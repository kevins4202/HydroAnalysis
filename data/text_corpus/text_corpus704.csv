3520,the extreme decline in fluvial sediment discharge and rapid increase in sea level have increased salt marsh vulnerability in some of the world s mega delta however limited research has addressed both the vertical accretion and horizontal lateral progradation of salt marshes induced by anthropogenic activities in recent decades here a machine learning based method for retrieving remote sensing images of the salt marsh along the eastern chongming wetland ecw the largest wetland in the yangtze river delta was used to monitor salt marsh dynamics between 2002 and 2019 the results demonstrate that salt marshes have experienced significant expansion including seaward progradation and accretion with ranges of 18 5 60 6 m yr and 0 103 0 178 m yr respectively nevertheless the bare mudflat areas adjoining the salt marshes have remained almost unchanged while their progradation and accretion have also shown similar trends with the ranges of 13 3 103 7 m yr and 0 066 0 256 m yr respectively although there was a 70 reduction in fluvial sediment supply in the yangtze river delta after the three gorges dam tgd began operating in 2003 it is less understood if the constant local suspended sediment concentration ssc of the estuary could be responsible for supporting enough sediment to enable salt marsh and mudflat expansions meanwhile the results showed that the seaward expansion of the mudflats provided suitable space for the salt marsh to trap vast amounts of sediment and gradually occupy the adjoining mudflat area the mudflat progradation further provided a larger space for the growth of salt marsh vegetation and promoted salt marsh expansion moreover the accretion of the ecw indicates the high resilience of these salt marshes to sea level rise slr the present work highlights the external factors and internal driving forces of the salt marsh evolution process providing information that can be used by communities and coastal managers to conserve and restore the salt marshes in the future keywords salt marsh mudflat morphodynamics sea level rising changjiang yangtze delta 1 introduction estuarine salt marshes located in the intertidal zone of transition are among the most valuable coastal geomorphic features barbier et al 2008 2011 vuik et al 2016 as economically significant natural resources on earth they provide habitats for fish and wildlife species and land resources for social and economic development and provide coastal stability against flood risks from land and ocean allen 2000 costanza 2006 murray et al 2012 therefore salt marsh dynamics have caused widespread concern worldwide huang et al 2010 spencer et al 2016 murray et al 2019 however some studies have indicated that land subsidence sea level rise slr coastal development and decreased fluvial suspended sediment discharge ssd have induced large scale salt marsh degradation spencer et al 2016 wei et al 2017 murray et al 2019 such as in the mississippi estuary reed 2002 chesapeake bay kearney et al 2002 venice lagoon carniello et al 2009 and the yellow sea estuary murray et al 2014 specifically spencer et al 2016 predicted that 78 of global coastal wetlands would be lost given the coupling influence between accelerated slr 110 cm by 2100 and dike construction and this estimate was based on the dynamic interactive vulnerability assessment wetland change model in louisiana jankowski et al 2017 determined that 35 of the wetlands in the mississippi delta se louisiana and 58 of the sites on the chenier plain sw louisiana may experience erosion and degradation risks at a relative slr rate of 12 8 mm per year subsequently gu et al 2018 also indicated that with the impact of the slr and coastal reclamation severe losses 59 of salt marshes occurred in china from the 1980 s to the 2010 s in contrast kirwan et al 2016 stated that salt marsh vulnerability was overstated and that marsh accretion could exceed the relative slr 10 mm yr as higher tidal inundation promotes more settling of sediments and hence accretion where plants further contribute by trapping sediments and adding organic matter accretion in the plum island estuary massachusetts usa langston et al 2020 demonstrated that salt marshes were not immediately vulnerable to erosion despite their inadequate sediment supply and slr as sediment accumulation contributes to salt marsh elevation langston et al 2020 furthermore based on the integrated global modeling approach a recent study showed that the global extent of marshes would increase to 60 of the current area until 2100 if the wetlands have sufficient coastal accommodation space and the present level of sediment supply remains the same schuerch et al 2018 these different research results highlight that whether coastal wetland degradation or progradation occurs with the relative slr or reduction of fluvial sediment is still undetermined moreover a few studies have proposed that the local sediment fluxes toward salt marshes are crucial for marsh survival ladd et al 2019 fagherazzi et al 2020 however salt marsh dynamics that consist of accretion and progradation changes are determined by multiple complex effects related to global changes and there is a need to gain greater insight into the marsh s morphodynamic processes the determination of salt marsh morphodynamics in previous studies has mainly been analyzed by field observations tang et al 2015 digital elevation model construction shaw et al 2016 and the creation of hydrodynamic morphodynamic models nardin et al 2016 nevertheless the above mentioned traditional methods for observing mudflats and salt marshes are time consuming and involve labor intensive measurements based on these limitations it is difficult to carry out large scale and long term salt marsh landform detection murray et al 2012 more specifically to determine salt marsh dynamics in terms of slr influence decades of data records are required which is impractical to obtain through tidal flat profile observations at the same time it is challenging to link the biological factors hydrodynamics and geomorphology of salt marshes through model construction because salt marshes are intimately related to mudflats carlin and dellapenna 2014 compared with traditional methods that are expensive and have regional limitations remote sensing technology is recognized as an efficient tool for monitoring salt marsh morphodynamics anthony et al 2015 the changjiang delta cjd yangtze river delta is one of the largest deltas in asia and has multiple vast estuarine wetlands where the eastern chongming wetland ecw contains the largest salt marsh of the cjd chen et al 1985 fig 1 the ecw receives substantial sediment input from the changjiang river wei et al 2016 in recent decades the ecw has faced large challenges related to riverine suspended sediment discharge ssd reductions and slr impacts tian et al 2010 dai et al 2014 with the construction of the largest dam in the world the three gorges dam tgd finalized in 2003 fluvial sediment input has remarkably decreased by over 70 dai et al 2014 furthermore the coupling effects between the sharp reduction in riverine ssd and relative slr could further induce potential erosion risks for the ecw salt marshes yang et al 2020 leonardi et al 2021 dai 2021 tian et al 2010 indicated that under the ipcc sea level rise scenarios 0 88 m increase in 2100 40 of the chongming wetland area would be inundated especially the scirpus mariqueter communities and mudflats li et al 2014 noted that the salt marshes of the cjd had slower seaward migration rates after 2003 due to the decline in the fluvial ssd in addition utilizing field measurements yang et al 2020 found that the salt marshes in the cjd exhibited an accretion trend which could balance the relative slr recent work also indicated that the ecw could survive for years to decades under declining riverine ssd conditions due to the support of abundant sediment from the submarine delta yang et al 2021 however the previous work that referred to the salt marshes in the ecw could have one sided views and not reflect the recognition of all the ecw s salt marsh dynamics even though they mentioned potential impacts to salt marshes from riverine ssd decline and slr specifically the work analyzing monthly elevation data over 8 years 2005 2013 based on three fixed stations in one profile at the center of the ecw was too short thus it was limited in its representation of the whole ecw salt marsh response to slr yang et al 2020 additionally two isobaths of 2 m and 5 m collected in 1997 2002 and 2010 as documented in yang et al 2021 may also not adequately reflect the variations in the salt marshes because of the suitable growth elevations of salt marshes above 2 m ge et al 2015a ge et al 2015b to date there is a great obstacle to obtaining long term elevation data in salt marshes which are key to exploring the relationship between salt marsh variations and slr murray et al 2012 the erosion or accretion of salt marshes in response to slr and insufficient sediment not only is recognized as a long term process due to sediment settling lag scour lag effects but also depends on local hydrogeomorphological conditions anthony and dobroniak 2000 fagherazzi et al 2020 therefore it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the ecw s response to external forcings based on long term systematic data little information is available on how the abovementioned forcings impact ecw salt marsh dynamics and the potential couplings between salt marshes and mudflats in this region in this study we try to fill gaps in monitoring the successive dynamics of the salt marsh mudflat system in the ecw to determine the vegetation geomorphology interaction process based on long term data by an effective method therefore new machine learning approaches that interpret large numbers of remote sensing images and then combine them with the 17 year hourly tidal elevations to construct a conceptual tidal flat model were used in this work utilizing this comprehensive methodology with data collection on decadal salt marsh dynamics the main aim was to 1 detect the long term dynamics of the salt marshes of the ecw 2 determine the main driving forces of salt marsh dynamics and 3 discriminate couplings between salt marsh dynamics and variations in the mudflats this work provides a vital foundation for managing risk in global mega deltas as they respond to similar environmental effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the changjiang estuary cje is an irregular semidiurnal tidal estuary and its average daily tidal range is 2 67 m dai et al 2013a the subtropical monsoon climate of this region results in significant seasonal wind direction variations with wind directions of nw nnw in winter and of sse s in summer and average wind speeds of 4 5 7 2 m s yun 2004 the wind in the cje is the dominant factor affecting wave activities including wave directions and heights yun 2004 proposed that the average wave height at the sheshan station could reach 0 9 m based on long term observation records the ecw is one of the most extensive wetlands in the cje located in the slow flowing zone between the north branch and the north channel of this estuary dai et al 2018a fig 1 the suspended sediment concentration ssc of the surrounding area is approximately 0 42 kg m3 chen et al 2004 as a result of chongming island shadow effects the ecw is well developed and has continued to expand seaward for the past decades wei et al 2017 with a width of more than 7 km at the tip featuring a vegetated salt marsh and mudflat fine sand median diameter of 8 15 μm and mud are the major components of the surficial sediments in this area yan et al 2011 there are three primary vegetation communities in this salt marsh zone phragmites australis scirpus mariqueter and spartina alterniflora ge et al 2015a ge et al 2015b phragmites australis and scirpus mariqueter are native species while spartina alterniflora was introduced in the eastern chongming flat in 1995 and has rapidly spread due to its extraordinary competitive ability yuan et al 2011 in addition considering the distinct regional features in the ecw this work divided the whole wetland into three zones to describe the local wetland dynamics in detail fig 1 specifically the south zone sz of the ecw has steeper slopes and small salt marshes and mudflats the east zone ez with a gentle slope has a large area of salt marshes and mudflats whereas the regional features of the north zone nz are between those of the sz and ez 2 2 data collection according to the worldwide reference system one landsat image path 118 row 38 completely covers chongming island fig 1 a total of 161 landsat images with cloud cover 50 from 2002 to 2019 were obtained from the google earth engine gee including landsat 5 tm 2002 2011 7 etm 2002 2003 and 8 oli images 2013 2019 table 1 these data are identified as the standard level 1 terrain corrected l1t products that have been revised through the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system leadaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 all of these l1t products are recognized as being high quality and ready to use chen et al 2017 the hourly tidal level data from 2002 to 2019 at hengsha station using the theoretical minimum tidal surface as the benchmark were acquired from the china oceanic information network https www coi gov cn and applied to map the tidal mudflats under different tidal levels the annual runoff and ssd at datong station the most downstream hydrologic station in the changjiang river were obtained from the changjiang water resource committee http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb nsgb the wave direction data from 1979 to 2018 were downloaded from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily levtype sfc these hydrological data are considered the main driving factors of tidal mudflat evolution 2 3 methods 2 3 1 reference sample selection to explore the evolution of the salt marshes and mudflats we categorized the eastern chongming wetland as salt marsh mudflat and water the annual landsat images with the lowest cloud cover were selected to generate training samples using visual interpretation first we built three layers in gee and identified them as salt marsh areas mudflat areas and water areas then we manually selected dozens of regions of interest rois in each layer and generated 500 random points by the randompoint command in gee in this study 3706 rois were selected and 25 500 random sample points were generated including 1281 salt marsh samples 8500 sample points 1390 mudflat samples 8500 sample points and 1035 water area samples 8500 sample points table 2 seventy percent of these sample points were applied for training and the remaining points were applied for the accuracy assessment 2 3 2 landsat data processing the pixel based supervised random forest rf algorithm was used to discriminate the different landforms in the eastern chongming wetland based on the gee platform landsat data processing is divided into three steps 1 selecting and preprocessing landsat images 2 conducting the rf algorithm classification and 3 identifying different landform area statistics and sketching the edges of the salt marshes and mudflats fig 2 the three gorges dam tgd the largest hydrological project in the world was constructed in 2003 and caused a sharp decrease in fluvial ssc dai et al 2013b dai et al 2018a to examine the ecw morphodynamics all available landsat images from 2002 to 2019 were collected for this study the images in 2002 represent the scenario with unchanged fluvial ssc before tgd operation as clouds and cloud shadows directly affect landsat image interpretation we further masked these distractions by using the fmask algorithm of the gee and reconstructed more precise observations from the landsat data zhu and woodcock 2012 jia et al 2021 in addition various landforms have different spectral characteristics huete et al 2002 jiang et al 2015 to effectively classify these spectral characteristics four water and vegetation indices were applied such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 land surface water index lswi xiao et al 2004 and modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 1 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 2 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red ρ nir 6 ρ red 7 ρ blue 1 3 lswi ρ nir ρ swir ρ nir ρ swir 4 mndwi ρ green ρ swir ρ green ρ swir where ρ blue ρ green ρ red ρ nir ρ swir represent the pixel values of the blue b2 green b3 red b4 near infrared b5 and shortwave infrared b6 and b7 bands of the landsat images respectively then 11 bands seven spectral reflectance bands and four index bands constituted the input datasets of this rf algorithm to boost the between class separability of the various land cover types at the same time on the gee platform there are six input parameters to define rf classifiers 1 the number of classification trees to create per class 2 the number of variables per split 3 the minimum size for a terminal node 4 the fraction of input to bag per tree 5 out of bag mode and 6 random seed variable for decision tree construction https code earthengine google com breiman 2001 proposed that the overall accuracy of the classifications in the rf algorithm depends on the number of trees while more decision trees also increase the processing time considering the overall accuracy and classification processing duration we selected the 100 decision trees as the optimum value for this classification and other parameters were defaults the postprocessing of landsat images mainly included two tasks vectorization and edge line extraction the discriminated landsat images were first vectorized to calculate the salt marsh area mudflat area and water area subsequently utilizing the canny operators we further extracted the edge lines of the salt marshes and mudflats finally we exported all the datasets and images that were required for follow up statistics all of the processing procedures were programmed on the gee platform which effectively improves remote sensing image processing efficiency 2 3 3 estimates of salt marsh mudflat area and elevation the salt marshes are located are a higher position in the wetland and are rarely submerged by high tide levels so their areas are minimally affected by tidal level fluctuations fig 3 therefore the salt marsh area was directly obtained from the landsat image interpretation subject to landsat image limitations continuous time series data with the mudflat exposed area at low tide levels are challenging to acquire jia et al 2021 considering that the mudflat exposed area is sensitive to water level fluctuations we attempted to explore their relationship supplementary fig 1 the results indicated that the rating curves between the exposed area and the tidal levels could be well expressed by the 2nd degree polynomial equations which are as follows 5 s h f n h a n h 2 b n h c n n 2002 2003 2019 where h is the tidal level corresponding to landsat image exposure time and s h is the exposed area at the corresponding tidal level a n b n and c n present the annual fit coefficients in a specific year and n represents the specific year subsequently utilizing the quadratic equations we further calculated the mudflat exposed area at the mean low water spring mlws 0 5 m the total wetland area salt marsh area mudflat area had a similar connection with the tidal level supplementary fig 2 additionally according to the relation between the wetland area and tidal levels salt marsh and mudflat accretion variations from 2002 to 2019 were further recalculated here the original locations of the salt marsh seaward edges with a tide level of 2 75 m and mudflat seaward edges with a tide level of 2 0 m in 2002 were used as the benchmarks for detecting the vertical elevation changes of the salt marshes and mudflats respectively the calculated equation can be described as follows 6 δ h f n 1 s n 1 f n 1 s n 7 h n 2002 n δ h where δ h is the calculated elevation variation based on the previous area of salt marsh mudflat s n is the salt marsh mudflat area in a specific year and f n is the relation formula between tidal level and total wetland area mudflat area in a specific year h n is the accumulated salt marsh elevation variation from the original year of 2002 to 2019 notably the local areas and vertical accumulated changes in the nz and ez were also estimated by these equations whereas sz was not involved in the calculation due to frequent recessions in this area supplementary figs 3 6 2 3 4 digital shoreline analysis system dsas the dsas a software extension for arcgis provides an automated method for detecting multiple historical shoreline changes https code usgs gov cch dsas in this study the edge line changes in the salt marshes and mudflats in the three zones were calculated by the dsas to indicate the lateral evolution of wetlands specifically the edge lines of the salt marshes and mudflats in 2002 were divided into 200 300 sections with a 50 m distance then the interannual edge line migrations of each transect were automatedly generated by dsas 2 3 5 accuracy assessment results are affected by remote sensing resolution and data processing thus error analysis is necessary to verify the accuracy of the results lawrence and wrlght 2001 for the landsat image classification error matrices with independent validation samples were employed to assess the performance of the rf classification algorithm liu et al 2016 producer accuracy user accuracy overall accuracy and kappa coefficient k were the four indicators used in this accuracy assessment jia et al 2018 table 3 shows the annual accuracy assessment for the different land cover types obtained through the rf method using test data indicating a high level of confidence in the different land cover types of the rf classification in this work specifically the overall annual accuracies ranged between 0 971 and 0 997 for all observation years and these kappa coefficients were higher than 0 96 additionally the three classes of producer and user accuracies were over 0 9 and most of these accuracies were 0 98 table 3 the other deviations occurred based on the original data postprocessing including the fitting curve and elevation calculation supplementary figs 1 and 2 show the annual fitting curves between the mudflat areas wetland areas and tidal levels with high correlation as most of the correlation coefficients of the fitting equations were over 0 95 considering the deviation of this linear interpolation method we constructed a 95 confidence interval of our results 3 results 3 1 area changes in the salt marshes and mudflats fig 4 shows the annual area changes in the salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw between 2002 and 2019 including the local area variations in the nz and ez the original salt marsh area of the ecw in 2002 was approximately 38 km2 fig 4 in 2019 this area expanded to 102 km2 which was nearly three times that in 2002 indicating that the salt marshes of the ecf exhibited a remarkable expansion trend with an increasing rate of 3 818 km2 yr fig 4a similarly simple trend analyses of the nz and ez local areas from 2002 to 2019 also clearly indicated interannual salt marsh expansion with rates of 2 641 km2 yr and 0 978 km2 yr respectively fig 4b this result reflected that the growth rate of the nz salt marsh was more significant than that of the ez salt marsh at the same time the total mudflat area in the ecw mainly fluctuated with a total area of approximately 84 9 km2 over the past decades fig 4c however the nz and ez mudflats displayed opposite development processes from 2002 to 2019 the annual nz mudflat area has shown a gradually increasing trend with an average growth rate of 0 922 km2 yr whereas the ez mudflat has presented a slightly decreasing trend the mudflat erosion rate in the ez reached 0 738 km2 yr fig 4d 3 2 lateral migration of salt marshes and mudflats the migrations of salt marshes and mudflat margins effectively reveal their lateral changes fagherazzi et al 2020 intuitively the salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw exhibited gradual seaward movements supplementary fig 7 fig 5 shows the salt marsh and mudflat lateral migrations during 2002 2019 in the three different zones specifically the nz salt marsh was a rapid deposition area with annual seaward expansion rates of 60 6 m yr the nz mudflat displayed more significant expansion than the salt marsh with an average seaward migration rate of 103 7 m yr fig 5a the total migration distances of the nz salt marshes and mudflats were over 1000 m and 1700 m respectively between 2002 and 2019 moreover similar lateral migrations of salt marshes and mudflats were detected in the ez fig 5b the salt marshes had a seaward expansion rate of 39 5 m yr and the mudflats had a rate of 36 m yr the expansion rate of the mudflats was slightly slower than that of the salt marshes despite the widespread expansion of wetlands in the nz and ez the sz wetlands showed a slight landward retreat fig 5c the annual recession rates of salt marshes and mudflats in the sz were 18 5 m yr and 13 3 m yr respectively furthermore the mudflats were divided into four areas the southeastern area the eastern area the northeastern area and the northern area the width of the northern area mudflats significantly increased after 2005 while the widths of the other three mudflat areas exhibited fluctuations over the years fig 6 a 6b fig 6c indicates that the annual decrease rates of mudflat widths in the southeastern area and eastern area reached 26 9 m yr and 21 m yr respectively at the same time the mudflat widths of the northeastern area and northeastern area gradually expanded from 2002 to 2019 at 30 5 m yr and 49 9 m yr respectively fig 6c overall the mudflats exhibited explicit distinct variations that changed from sediment erosion to deposition from south to north 3 3 elevation changes in the salt marshes and mudflats elevation changes are imperative indicators of salt marsh and mudflat morphodynamics the nz salt marshes and mudflats presented significant accretion trends with significant levels reaching 0 97 and 0 95 during 2002 2019 respectively the accumulated elevation changes in the salt marshes reached almost 3 m from 2002 to 2019 and the average annual elevation change rate was 0 178 m yr fig 7 a additionally the mudflat deposition in the nz was higher than that of the salt marsh which had an accretion rate of 0 256 m yr fig 7a in the ez the accretion rates were reduced significantly between 2004 and 2008 the ez salt marsh elevation changes occurred due to erosion subsequently the gradual deposition trend recovered after 2008 with an annual increase of 0 103 m yr fig 7b the accumulated salt marsh elevation increased by approximately 1 m in the past decade moreover the ez mudflat exhibited a similar elevation evolution process nevertheless its accretion was much lower with an average accumulation of 0 066 m yr from 2005 to 2019 fig 7b these results indicate that of the wetlands the nz wetlands had the most remarkable accretion zone with the maximum lateral migration and vertical deposition rates 4 discussion 4 1 sediment supply tidal flat morphodynamics are controlled by a combination of influences such as tidal range relative slr marsh elevation within the tidal frame and sediment source supply lovelock et al 2015 kirwan et al 2016 crosby et al 2016 a sufficient sediment supply is one of the important drivers supporting salt marsh and mudflat growth fagherazzi et al 2020 the ecw has multiple sediment sources including fluvial sediment and longshore sediment transport yang et al 2020 leonardi et al 2021 fig 8 a indicates that the fluvial suspended sediment load at the datong station had a sharply decreasing trend 27 99 106 t yr between 2003 and 2008 because of tgd operations dai et al 2016b even though the discharge remained almost unchanged fig 8a moreover between 2008 and 2019 the ssd was relatively stable at a mean of approximately 121 4 106 t yr fig 8a obviously the ssd reduction still induced the expansion of the salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw which could be seen from the negative relationship between them fig 8b nevertheless a short term vertical decreasing trend occurred in the ez salt marshes and mudflats from 2003 to 2008 fig 7b which was attributable to the decreasing fluvial ssd although the fluvial ssd reduction had little impact on ecw development in the long term it hampered local mudflat expansion fig 8c reveals that the annual ssc in the estuary at sheshan station near the ecw was approximately 0 77 kg m3 from 2009 to 2017 and this value remained almost unchanged fig 8c this result explicitly demonstrates that even if the fluvial sediment underwent a sharp decline the constant local ssc could still support salt marsh development this finding is in line with the theory that sediment availability is the critical factor controlling salt marsh expansion and survival fagherazzi et al 2020 4 2 effects of local conditions an estuary s regional morphology significantly affects sediment transport dynamics and wetland evolution dai et al 2018a dai 2021 the ecw is located in a complex tidal environment its nz is near the north branch of the cjd and its sz is near the north channel limited by the regional morphology the north branch only receives 1 of the runoff flows from the changjiang river but accepts 25 of the total tidal prism chen and chen 2003 as a flood dominated channel it is primarily controlled by estuarine hydrodynamics and mainly receives sediment from the sea dai et al 2016a at the same time the mouth of the north branch is recognized as one of the highest ssc zones in the cjd and a substantial amount of sediment is deposited in this area dai et al 2018b therefore flood dominated hydrodynamics and sufficient sediment supply are responsible for promoting northern and eastern wetland deposition leonardi et al 2021 dai 2021 fig 9 a in contrast to the north branch the north channel is dominated by the ebb tide dominated current mei et al 2018 the sz is constrained by strong hydrodynamic conditions between the flood dominated channel and ebb dominated channel and thus faces a large obstruction to expansion fig 9a in addition waves in sheshan generally are in southern or southeastern directions in spring and summer and northern or northeastern directions in autumn and winter yun 2004 wu and zhu 2010 fig 9b the southerly wave directly erodes the mudflats of the sz in the ecw due to the open surrounding sea areas therefore the field measurement results displayed the highest slope in the sz at 1 and the ez and nz slopes were 0 08 and 0 1 respectively yang et al 2002 which could be attributed to the local actions of tidal currents and wind driven waves in addition the ebb dominated circumstances in the north channel carry the sediment away from the tidal flats wu and zhu 2010 liu et al 2020 the strong hydrodynamic environment and insufficient sediment supply are remarkable obstructions to sz expansion on the other hand the sz has a steep slope and narrow mudflat distribution and is unable to withstand wave and tide current dynamics which force the mudflats to erode and become steeper from this increase in slope steepness the margin between the salt marsh and mudflat platforms becomes increasingly unstable eventually this process leads to salt marsh retreat and landward migration van de koppel et al 2004 4 3 sea level rise existing knowledge reveals that the sustainability of wetlands is now severely threatened by the increase in slr due to global climate change rizzetto and tosi 2011 kirwan and megonigal 2013 linhoss et al 2015 globally many studies have demonstrated that marsh mudflat ecosystems are in danger of disappearing if they cannot accrete elevation at rates that match slr lovelock et al 2015 crosby et al 2016 one crucial index assessing salt marsh vulnerability is that which compares salt marsh surface elevation changes with regional sea level variations horton et al 2018 recent research has indicated that the rate of global mean slr presents an accelerating trend with a rate that increased from 1 4 mm yr in 1880 1993 to 2 9 mm yr in 1993 2010 church and white 2011 in addition influenced by the high forcing and unfavorable ice sheet dynamics the slr might exceed 2 m in many regions kopp et al 2017 here we assessed the relative slr in the cjd using the theoretical minimum tidal surface as the benchmark the mean sea level in the cjd exhibited an increasing trend with an increasing rate of 4 7 mm yr despite the interannual fluctuations fig 10 furthermore wang 2010 determined that the subsidence rate in the ecw was approximately 5 2 mm yr in recent years therefore the relative slr is approximately 9 9 mm yr because of the mean slr and subsidence rate coupling effects based on the results related to salt marsh and mudflat accretions we found that the annual accretion in the ez mudflat was 66 mm yr excluding the sz erosion fig 7 nevertheless the local wetland subsidence process including sediment compaction and organic matter decomposition are not considered here in this remote sensing technology it is notable that although the local wetland subsidence process could have contributed to lowering the rates of elevation change subsidence rates were much smaller than the ecw accretion rate yang et al 2020 also proposed an accretion rate of 33 49 mm yr in the ecw although the estimated annual accretion rate was greater than that in the previous study proposed by yang et al 2020 it could be concluded that the enhancement of the salt marshes in the ecw was remarkably higher than the relative slr in the ecw reflecting that these areas are sufficiently resilient to the slr threat 4 4 effects of human intervention in the ecw a series of artificial projects including embankment construction and vegetation plantations have been conducted in recent decades to accelerate marsh sedimentation luo et al 2017 fig 11 shows that several large scale reclamation projects were constructed in the ecw during 1999 2019 the embankments interrupted the tidal current decreased the water flow velocity and restricted the sediment carrying capacity thus accelerating wetland sedimentation li et al 2011 subsequently lu and jiang 2013 also identified that the ecw underwent a remarkable expansion in the first three years following the construction of the embankments in 1999 and then gradually recovered to equilibrium conditions the results indicate that mudflat areas in 2002 2003 2010 2013 and 2015 appeared to increase fig 4c which confirms that these projects dramatically promoted mudflat expansion in the following 1 2 years fig 11 additionally with their immense capacity for diminishing flow velocity and trapping sediment salt marsh vegetation is considered one of the driving factors of wetland development kirwan and megonigal 2013 therefore spartina alterniflora was artificially introduced in 2001 and 2003 to promote the development and stability of the ecw han et al 2009 furthermore the cultivation of spartina alterniflora in the ecw expanded from 33 ha in 2000 to 916 131 ha in 2008 phragmites australis increased to 206 25 ha and scirpus mariqueter decreased from 1660 ha to 963 137 ha from 2000 to 2008 ge et al 2015a because of its prominent competitive advantage spartina alterniflora rapidly spread and became an invasive grass species in the chongming wetland resulting in part of the mudflat areas in the ecw being occupied by salt marshes ge et al 2015a ge et al 2015b eventually the ecw reached an equilibrium state in which the salt marshes continuously expanded and the mudflats remained stable from 2002 to 2019 another effect of ecw evolution is the distribution of salt marsh vegetation zhang et al 2020 based on remote sensing technology liu et al 2020 indicated that the invasive species spartina alterniflora is mainly distributed in the northern and northeastern ecw while the native species scirpus mariqueter and phragmites australis are in the eastern and southern ecw obviously as a result of its stronger competitive capacity and wider ecological niche the spartina alterniflora has higher expansion rates than those of the native species huang et al 2007 zhu et al 2012 on the other hand through field measurements li and yang 2009 found that the annual sediment trapping rate of spartina alterniflora was 220 6 172 7 g m2 in the cjd which was remarkably higher than that of phragmites australis 64 9 38 1 g m2 and scirpus mariqueter 31 6 10 0 g m2 this scenario also explains the generation of differences in the nz and ez 4 5 dynamic spatial patterns of the salt marshes and mudflats the three zones of the ecw showed different salt marsh and mudflat dynamics from 2002 to 2019 corresponding to three evolution spatial patterns fig 12 generally salt marsh and mudflat development presented similar spatial evolution patterns with deposition in the northern and eastern areas and erosion in the south area fig 12 specifically both the nz salt marshes and mudflats were in a rapid expansion stage in comparison to salt marsh accretion mudflat accretion was much higher including lateral expansions and vertical accumulations fig 12a the ez salt marsh and mudflat dynamics experienced stable progradation processes from 2002 to 2019 the lateral expansion rates of the salt marshes and mudflats were similar while the vertical mudflat deposition was slightly weaker than that of the salt marshes fig 12b in contrast the sz salt marshes and mudflats continuously eroded which gradually induced their edges to retreat landward fig 12c thus this dynamic could be identified as a slight erosion spatial pattern such spatial patterns reasonably summarize the salt marsh development dynamics to analyze the external contributors salt marsh progradation could be linked to the sediment budget of the entire wetland ganju et al 2017 sufficient sediment and moderate hydrodynamics are prerequisites for marsh progradation such as in the nz salt marsh otherwise a marsh would risk retreat which is similar to that which occurred in the sz salt marsh based on internal mechanisms there is a potential balance between salt marsh and mudflat the salt marshes continuously occupied the mudflat areas and forced the mudflat margins to migrate seaward at the same time the mudflat seaward expansion also provided the salt marsh greater area to further accelerate salt marsh growth conversely mudflat erosion would have restricted salt marsh development due to a lack of space for expansion furthermore based on the salt marsh dynamic models proposed by fagherazzi et al 2020 this study further forecasts the fate of the ecw in the future notably in the nz the mudflats have a higher deposition rate than the salt marshes providing enough space for salt marsh progradation nevertheless mudflat progradation will be limited by the local morphology and hydrodynamics and eventually reach a dynamic balance then mudflats will feedback the salt marshes affecting their continual progradation and even causing them to retreat however in the ez the seaward migration and accretion of the salt marshes were greater than those of its adjacent mudflat and the mudflats were in the erosion stage although the large mudflat area in the ez offered sufficient space for salt marsh progradation the slow accretion of the mudflats would likely gradually increase wave and tide flow impacts and restrict marsh development in addition impacted by wave hydrodynamics the sz salt marshes and mudflats have experienced landward retreat which increases the risk of coastal erosion 4 6 uncertainty analysis multiple remote sensing images and measured tidal levels were combined to build annual fitted linear equations and this method effectively exhibited the long term and successive morphological evolution of the edw nevertheless there are still some uncertainties in this measurement including data source errors and processing errors specifically the data source error primarily refers to the 30 m spatial resolution of landsat images which would induce a pixel error of 9x10 4 km2 therefore selecting a large study area is a precondition for decreasing this data source error okin and gu 2015 the results show that the edw area is over 100 km2 remarkably larger than the pixel error which would effectively decrease the impact from the data source error at the same time although we utilized the measured tidal level to construct the relationship between the tidal flat areas and tidal levels due to the topographic influence the tidal levels in the different regions of the edw were not entirely consistent at the same moment this scenario affected the statistical relations between areas and tidal levels and then further influenced tidal flat area acquisition although the annual fitting curves between the tidal flat areas and tidal levels had high correlation coefficients r2 0 95 deviations remained between the fitted tidal flat areas and the actual values overall compared with the results from the few and intermittent landsat images the results from numerous and serial landsat images applied through machine learning provided increased accuracy and decreased randomness this method can precisely describe the morphological evolution process in the ecw in recent decades furthermore this work also demonstrated the long term interaction of vegetation geomorphology between salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw which is difficult to detect through episodic field measurements 5 conclusion influenced by slr and fluvial ssd reduction most of the salt marshes in mega deltas are under tremendous pressure to better protect and manage these precious natural resources it is essential to detect the long term morphodynamics of salt marshes and demonstrate the variability in salt marsh and mudflat evolution and their underlying connections taking the ecw as an example this paper proposed a creative method to detect salt marsh and mudflat multidimensional development by combining a full time series of remote sensing images and regional tidal elevations the main conclusions are as follows 1 the whole eastern chongming wetland was experiencing deposition even though there were distinct changes in the local salt marshes between 2002 and 2019 the northern salt marshes and mudflats of the eastern chongming wetland exhibited remarkable expansions and their areas increased 2 64 km2 yr and 0 922 km2 yr respectively with seaward migrations and accretions the eastern salt marshes had moderate progradation with lateral changes of 39 5 m yr and vertical increases of 0 103 m yr whereas the mudflats experienced slight erosion with an area reduction of 0 738 km2 yr nevertheless landward retreats were detected in the sz salt marshes and mudflats 2 fluvial ssd is not a dominant factor controlling salt marsh development while the high local ssc ensured salt marsh progression in the eastern chongming wetland at the same time the relative sea level rise in the eastern chongming wetland was lower than the salt marsh and mudflat accretions providing sufficient wetland resilience to sea level rise local hydrology human intervention and vegetation effects are recognized as the primary factors that impact the spatial evolution pattern of salt marshes and mudflats 3 the salt marsh and mudflat dynamics in the eastern chongming wetland were divided into three patterns the first pattern is the rapid expansion pattern of the salt marshes in the western zone which are supported by sufficient sediment and weaker hydrodynamics the second pattern is the moderate progradation pattern of salt marshes in the eastern zone although seaward migration of the salt marshes occurred the mudflats faced minimal erosion the third pattern is the slight erosion pattern of the salt marshes in the western zone landward migration of the salt marshes and mudflats revealed recession of the salt marsh system credit authorship contribution statement yaying lou writing original draft data collection and analysis zhijun dai ideal

3520,the extreme decline in fluvial sediment discharge and rapid increase in sea level have increased salt marsh vulnerability in some of the world s mega delta however limited research has addressed both the vertical accretion and horizontal lateral progradation of salt marshes induced by anthropogenic activities in recent decades here a machine learning based method for retrieving remote sensing images of the salt marsh along the eastern chongming wetland ecw the largest wetland in the yangtze river delta was used to monitor salt marsh dynamics between 2002 and 2019 the results demonstrate that salt marshes have experienced significant expansion including seaward progradation and accretion with ranges of 18 5 60 6 m yr and 0 103 0 178 m yr respectively nevertheless the bare mudflat areas adjoining the salt marshes have remained almost unchanged while their progradation and accretion have also shown similar trends with the ranges of 13 3 103 7 m yr and 0 066 0 256 m yr respectively although there was a 70 reduction in fluvial sediment supply in the yangtze river delta after the three gorges dam tgd began operating in 2003 it is less understood if the constant local suspended sediment concentration ssc of the estuary could be responsible for supporting enough sediment to enable salt marsh and mudflat expansions meanwhile the results showed that the seaward expansion of the mudflats provided suitable space for the salt marsh to trap vast amounts of sediment and gradually occupy the adjoining mudflat area the mudflat progradation further provided a larger space for the growth of salt marsh vegetation and promoted salt marsh expansion moreover the accretion of the ecw indicates the high resilience of these salt marshes to sea level rise slr the present work highlights the external factors and internal driving forces of the salt marsh evolution process providing information that can be used by communities and coastal managers to conserve and restore the salt marshes in the future keywords salt marsh mudflat morphodynamics sea level rising changjiang yangtze delta 1 introduction estuarine salt marshes located in the intertidal zone of transition are among the most valuable coastal geomorphic features barbier et al 2008 2011 vuik et al 2016 as economically significant natural resources on earth they provide habitats for fish and wildlife species and land resources for social and economic development and provide coastal stability against flood risks from land and ocean allen 2000 costanza 2006 murray et al 2012 therefore salt marsh dynamics have caused widespread concern worldwide huang et al 2010 spencer et al 2016 murray et al 2019 however some studies have indicated that land subsidence sea level rise slr coastal development and decreased fluvial suspended sediment discharge ssd have induced large scale salt marsh degradation spencer et al 2016 wei et al 2017 murray et al 2019 such as in the mississippi estuary reed 2002 chesapeake bay kearney et al 2002 venice lagoon carniello et al 2009 and the yellow sea estuary murray et al 2014 specifically spencer et al 2016 predicted that 78 of global coastal wetlands would be lost given the coupling influence between accelerated slr 110 cm by 2100 and dike construction and this estimate was based on the dynamic interactive vulnerability assessment wetland change model in louisiana jankowski et al 2017 determined that 35 of the wetlands in the mississippi delta se louisiana and 58 of the sites on the chenier plain sw louisiana may experience erosion and degradation risks at a relative slr rate of 12 8 mm per year subsequently gu et al 2018 also indicated that with the impact of the slr and coastal reclamation severe losses 59 of salt marshes occurred in china from the 1980 s to the 2010 s in contrast kirwan et al 2016 stated that salt marsh vulnerability was overstated and that marsh accretion could exceed the relative slr 10 mm yr as higher tidal inundation promotes more settling of sediments and hence accretion where plants further contribute by trapping sediments and adding organic matter accretion in the plum island estuary massachusetts usa langston et al 2020 demonstrated that salt marshes were not immediately vulnerable to erosion despite their inadequate sediment supply and slr as sediment accumulation contributes to salt marsh elevation langston et al 2020 furthermore based on the integrated global modeling approach a recent study showed that the global extent of marshes would increase to 60 of the current area until 2100 if the wetlands have sufficient coastal accommodation space and the present level of sediment supply remains the same schuerch et al 2018 these different research results highlight that whether coastal wetland degradation or progradation occurs with the relative slr or reduction of fluvial sediment is still undetermined moreover a few studies have proposed that the local sediment fluxes toward salt marshes are crucial for marsh survival ladd et al 2019 fagherazzi et al 2020 however salt marsh dynamics that consist of accretion and progradation changes are determined by multiple complex effects related to global changes and there is a need to gain greater insight into the marsh s morphodynamic processes the determination of salt marsh morphodynamics in previous studies has mainly been analyzed by field observations tang et al 2015 digital elevation model construction shaw et al 2016 and the creation of hydrodynamic morphodynamic models nardin et al 2016 nevertheless the above mentioned traditional methods for observing mudflats and salt marshes are time consuming and involve labor intensive measurements based on these limitations it is difficult to carry out large scale and long term salt marsh landform detection murray et al 2012 more specifically to determine salt marsh dynamics in terms of slr influence decades of data records are required which is impractical to obtain through tidal flat profile observations at the same time it is challenging to link the biological factors hydrodynamics and geomorphology of salt marshes through model construction because salt marshes are intimately related to mudflats carlin and dellapenna 2014 compared with traditional methods that are expensive and have regional limitations remote sensing technology is recognized as an efficient tool for monitoring salt marsh morphodynamics anthony et al 2015 the changjiang delta cjd yangtze river delta is one of the largest deltas in asia and has multiple vast estuarine wetlands where the eastern chongming wetland ecw contains the largest salt marsh of the cjd chen et al 1985 fig 1 the ecw receives substantial sediment input from the changjiang river wei et al 2016 in recent decades the ecw has faced large challenges related to riverine suspended sediment discharge ssd reductions and slr impacts tian et al 2010 dai et al 2014 with the construction of the largest dam in the world the three gorges dam tgd finalized in 2003 fluvial sediment input has remarkably decreased by over 70 dai et al 2014 furthermore the coupling effects between the sharp reduction in riverine ssd and relative slr could further induce potential erosion risks for the ecw salt marshes yang et al 2020 leonardi et al 2021 dai 2021 tian et al 2010 indicated that under the ipcc sea level rise scenarios 0 88 m increase in 2100 40 of the chongming wetland area would be inundated especially the scirpus mariqueter communities and mudflats li et al 2014 noted that the salt marshes of the cjd had slower seaward migration rates after 2003 due to the decline in the fluvial ssd in addition utilizing field measurements yang et al 2020 found that the salt marshes in the cjd exhibited an accretion trend which could balance the relative slr recent work also indicated that the ecw could survive for years to decades under declining riverine ssd conditions due to the support of abundant sediment from the submarine delta yang et al 2021 however the previous work that referred to the salt marshes in the ecw could have one sided views and not reflect the recognition of all the ecw s salt marsh dynamics even though they mentioned potential impacts to salt marshes from riverine ssd decline and slr specifically the work analyzing monthly elevation data over 8 years 2005 2013 based on three fixed stations in one profile at the center of the ecw was too short thus it was limited in its representation of the whole ecw salt marsh response to slr yang et al 2020 additionally two isobaths of 2 m and 5 m collected in 1997 2002 and 2010 as documented in yang et al 2021 may also not adequately reflect the variations in the salt marshes because of the suitable growth elevations of salt marshes above 2 m ge et al 2015a ge et al 2015b to date there is a great obstacle to obtaining long term elevation data in salt marshes which are key to exploring the relationship between salt marsh variations and slr murray et al 2012 the erosion or accretion of salt marshes in response to slr and insufficient sediment not only is recognized as a long term process due to sediment settling lag scour lag effects but also depends on local hydrogeomorphological conditions anthony and dobroniak 2000 fagherazzi et al 2020 therefore it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the ecw s response to external forcings based on long term systematic data little information is available on how the abovementioned forcings impact ecw salt marsh dynamics and the potential couplings between salt marshes and mudflats in this region in this study we try to fill gaps in monitoring the successive dynamics of the salt marsh mudflat system in the ecw to determine the vegetation geomorphology interaction process based on long term data by an effective method therefore new machine learning approaches that interpret large numbers of remote sensing images and then combine them with the 17 year hourly tidal elevations to construct a conceptual tidal flat model were used in this work utilizing this comprehensive methodology with data collection on decadal salt marsh dynamics the main aim was to 1 detect the long term dynamics of the salt marshes of the ecw 2 determine the main driving forces of salt marsh dynamics and 3 discriminate couplings between salt marsh dynamics and variations in the mudflats this work provides a vital foundation for managing risk in global mega deltas as they respond to similar environmental effects 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the changjiang estuary cje is an irregular semidiurnal tidal estuary and its average daily tidal range is 2 67 m dai et al 2013a the subtropical monsoon climate of this region results in significant seasonal wind direction variations with wind directions of nw nnw in winter and of sse s in summer and average wind speeds of 4 5 7 2 m s yun 2004 the wind in the cje is the dominant factor affecting wave activities including wave directions and heights yun 2004 proposed that the average wave height at the sheshan station could reach 0 9 m based on long term observation records the ecw is one of the most extensive wetlands in the cje located in the slow flowing zone between the north branch and the north channel of this estuary dai et al 2018a fig 1 the suspended sediment concentration ssc of the surrounding area is approximately 0 42 kg m3 chen et al 2004 as a result of chongming island shadow effects the ecw is well developed and has continued to expand seaward for the past decades wei et al 2017 with a width of more than 7 km at the tip featuring a vegetated salt marsh and mudflat fine sand median diameter of 8 15 μm and mud are the major components of the surficial sediments in this area yan et al 2011 there are three primary vegetation communities in this salt marsh zone phragmites australis scirpus mariqueter and spartina alterniflora ge et al 2015a ge et al 2015b phragmites australis and scirpus mariqueter are native species while spartina alterniflora was introduced in the eastern chongming flat in 1995 and has rapidly spread due to its extraordinary competitive ability yuan et al 2011 in addition considering the distinct regional features in the ecw this work divided the whole wetland into three zones to describe the local wetland dynamics in detail fig 1 specifically the south zone sz of the ecw has steeper slopes and small salt marshes and mudflats the east zone ez with a gentle slope has a large area of salt marshes and mudflats whereas the regional features of the north zone nz are between those of the sz and ez 2 2 data collection according to the worldwide reference system one landsat image path 118 row 38 completely covers chongming island fig 1 a total of 161 landsat images with cloud cover 50 from 2002 to 2019 were obtained from the google earth engine gee including landsat 5 tm 2002 2011 7 etm 2002 2003 and 8 oli images 2013 2019 table 1 these data are identified as the standard level 1 terrain corrected l1t products that have been revised through the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system leadaps and landsat surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 all of these l1t products are recognized as being high quality and ready to use chen et al 2017 the hourly tidal level data from 2002 to 2019 at hengsha station using the theoretical minimum tidal surface as the benchmark were acquired from the china oceanic information network https www coi gov cn and applied to map the tidal mudflats under different tidal levels the annual runoff and ssd at datong station the most downstream hydrologic station in the changjiang river were obtained from the changjiang water resource committee http www cjw gov cn zwzc bmgb nsgb the wave direction data from 1979 to 2018 were downloaded from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily levtype sfc these hydrological data are considered the main driving factors of tidal mudflat evolution 2 3 methods 2 3 1 reference sample selection to explore the evolution of the salt marshes and mudflats we categorized the eastern chongming wetland as salt marsh mudflat and water the annual landsat images with the lowest cloud cover were selected to generate training samples using visual interpretation first we built three layers in gee and identified them as salt marsh areas mudflat areas and water areas then we manually selected dozens of regions of interest rois in each layer and generated 500 random points by the randompoint command in gee in this study 3706 rois were selected and 25 500 random sample points were generated including 1281 salt marsh samples 8500 sample points 1390 mudflat samples 8500 sample points and 1035 water area samples 8500 sample points table 2 seventy percent of these sample points were applied for training and the remaining points were applied for the accuracy assessment 2 3 2 landsat data processing the pixel based supervised random forest rf algorithm was used to discriminate the different landforms in the eastern chongming wetland based on the gee platform landsat data processing is divided into three steps 1 selecting and preprocessing landsat images 2 conducting the rf algorithm classification and 3 identifying different landform area statistics and sketching the edges of the salt marshes and mudflats fig 2 the three gorges dam tgd the largest hydrological project in the world was constructed in 2003 and caused a sharp decrease in fluvial ssc dai et al 2013b dai et al 2018a to examine the ecw morphodynamics all available landsat images from 2002 to 2019 were collected for this study the images in 2002 represent the scenario with unchanged fluvial ssc before tgd operation as clouds and cloud shadows directly affect landsat image interpretation we further masked these distractions by using the fmask algorithm of the gee and reconstructed more precise observations from the landsat data zhu and woodcock 2012 jia et al 2021 in addition various landforms have different spectral characteristics huete et al 2002 jiang et al 2015 to effectively classify these spectral characteristics four water and vegetation indices were applied such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 land surface water index lswi xiao et al 2004 and modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 1 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 2 evi 2 5 ρ nir ρ red ρ nir 6 ρ red 7 ρ blue 1 3 lswi ρ nir ρ swir ρ nir ρ swir 4 mndwi ρ green ρ swir ρ green ρ swir where ρ blue ρ green ρ red ρ nir ρ swir represent the pixel values of the blue b2 green b3 red b4 near infrared b5 and shortwave infrared b6 and b7 bands of the landsat images respectively then 11 bands seven spectral reflectance bands and four index bands constituted the input datasets of this rf algorithm to boost the between class separability of the various land cover types at the same time on the gee platform there are six input parameters to define rf classifiers 1 the number of classification trees to create per class 2 the number of variables per split 3 the minimum size for a terminal node 4 the fraction of input to bag per tree 5 out of bag mode and 6 random seed variable for decision tree construction https code earthengine google com breiman 2001 proposed that the overall accuracy of the classifications in the rf algorithm depends on the number of trees while more decision trees also increase the processing time considering the overall accuracy and classification processing duration we selected the 100 decision trees as the optimum value for this classification and other parameters were defaults the postprocessing of landsat images mainly included two tasks vectorization and edge line extraction the discriminated landsat images were first vectorized to calculate the salt marsh area mudflat area and water area subsequently utilizing the canny operators we further extracted the edge lines of the salt marshes and mudflats finally we exported all the datasets and images that were required for follow up statistics all of the processing procedures were programmed on the gee platform which effectively improves remote sensing image processing efficiency 2 3 3 estimates of salt marsh mudflat area and elevation the salt marshes are located are a higher position in the wetland and are rarely submerged by high tide levels so their areas are minimally affected by tidal level fluctuations fig 3 therefore the salt marsh area was directly obtained from the landsat image interpretation subject to landsat image limitations continuous time series data with the mudflat exposed area at low tide levels are challenging to acquire jia et al 2021 considering that the mudflat exposed area is sensitive to water level fluctuations we attempted to explore their relationship supplementary fig 1 the results indicated that the rating curves between the exposed area and the tidal levels could be well expressed by the 2nd degree polynomial equations which are as follows 5 s h f n h a n h 2 b n h c n n 2002 2003 2019 where h is the tidal level corresponding to landsat image exposure time and s h is the exposed area at the corresponding tidal level a n b n and c n present the annual fit coefficients in a specific year and n represents the specific year subsequently utilizing the quadratic equations we further calculated the mudflat exposed area at the mean low water spring mlws 0 5 m the total wetland area salt marsh area mudflat area had a similar connection with the tidal level supplementary fig 2 additionally according to the relation between the wetland area and tidal levels salt marsh and mudflat accretion variations from 2002 to 2019 were further recalculated here the original locations of the salt marsh seaward edges with a tide level of 2 75 m and mudflat seaward edges with a tide level of 2 0 m in 2002 were used as the benchmarks for detecting the vertical elevation changes of the salt marshes and mudflats respectively the calculated equation can be described as follows 6 δ h f n 1 s n 1 f n 1 s n 7 h n 2002 n δ h where δ h is the calculated elevation variation based on the previous area of salt marsh mudflat s n is the salt marsh mudflat area in a specific year and f n is the relation formula between tidal level and total wetland area mudflat area in a specific year h n is the accumulated salt marsh elevation variation from the original year of 2002 to 2019 notably the local areas and vertical accumulated changes in the nz and ez were also estimated by these equations whereas sz was not involved in the calculation due to frequent recessions in this area supplementary figs 3 6 2 3 4 digital shoreline analysis system dsas the dsas a software extension for arcgis provides an automated method for detecting multiple historical shoreline changes https code usgs gov cch dsas in this study the edge line changes in the salt marshes and mudflats in the three zones were calculated by the dsas to indicate the lateral evolution of wetlands specifically the edge lines of the salt marshes and mudflats in 2002 were divided into 200 300 sections with a 50 m distance then the interannual edge line migrations of each transect were automatedly generated by dsas 2 3 5 accuracy assessment results are affected by remote sensing resolution and data processing thus error analysis is necessary to verify the accuracy of the results lawrence and wrlght 2001 for the landsat image classification error matrices with independent validation samples were employed to assess the performance of the rf classification algorithm liu et al 2016 producer accuracy user accuracy overall accuracy and kappa coefficient k were the four indicators used in this accuracy assessment jia et al 2018 table 3 shows the annual accuracy assessment for the different land cover types obtained through the rf method using test data indicating a high level of confidence in the different land cover types of the rf classification in this work specifically the overall annual accuracies ranged between 0 971 and 0 997 for all observation years and these kappa coefficients were higher than 0 96 additionally the three classes of producer and user accuracies were over 0 9 and most of these accuracies were 0 98 table 3 the other deviations occurred based on the original data postprocessing including the fitting curve and elevation calculation supplementary figs 1 and 2 show the annual fitting curves between the mudflat areas wetland areas and tidal levels with high correlation as most of the correlation coefficients of the fitting equations were over 0 95 considering the deviation of this linear interpolation method we constructed a 95 confidence interval of our results 3 results 3 1 area changes in the salt marshes and mudflats fig 4 shows the annual area changes in the salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw between 2002 and 2019 including the local area variations in the nz and ez the original salt marsh area of the ecw in 2002 was approximately 38 km2 fig 4 in 2019 this area expanded to 102 km2 which was nearly three times that in 2002 indicating that the salt marshes of the ecf exhibited a remarkable expansion trend with an increasing rate of 3 818 km2 yr fig 4a similarly simple trend analyses of the nz and ez local areas from 2002 to 2019 also clearly indicated interannual salt marsh expansion with rates of 2 641 km2 yr and 0 978 km2 yr respectively fig 4b this result reflected that the growth rate of the nz salt marsh was more significant than that of the ez salt marsh at the same time the total mudflat area in the ecw mainly fluctuated with a total area of approximately 84 9 km2 over the past decades fig 4c however the nz and ez mudflats displayed opposite development processes from 2002 to 2019 the annual nz mudflat area has shown a gradually increasing trend with an average growth rate of 0 922 km2 yr whereas the ez mudflat has presented a slightly decreasing trend the mudflat erosion rate in the ez reached 0 738 km2 yr fig 4d 3 2 lateral migration of salt marshes and mudflats the migrations of salt marshes and mudflat margins effectively reveal their lateral changes fagherazzi et al 2020 intuitively the salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw exhibited gradual seaward movements supplementary fig 7 fig 5 shows the salt marsh and mudflat lateral migrations during 2002 2019 in the three different zones specifically the nz salt marsh was a rapid deposition area with annual seaward expansion rates of 60 6 m yr the nz mudflat displayed more significant expansion than the salt marsh with an average seaward migration rate of 103 7 m yr fig 5a the total migration distances of the nz salt marshes and mudflats were over 1000 m and 1700 m respectively between 2002 and 2019 moreover similar lateral migrations of salt marshes and mudflats were detected in the ez fig 5b the salt marshes had a seaward expansion rate of 39 5 m yr and the mudflats had a rate of 36 m yr the expansion rate of the mudflats was slightly slower than that of the salt marshes despite the widespread expansion of wetlands in the nz and ez the sz wetlands showed a slight landward retreat fig 5c the annual recession rates of salt marshes and mudflats in the sz were 18 5 m yr and 13 3 m yr respectively furthermore the mudflats were divided into four areas the southeastern area the eastern area the northeastern area and the northern area the width of the northern area mudflats significantly increased after 2005 while the widths of the other three mudflat areas exhibited fluctuations over the years fig 6 a 6b fig 6c indicates that the annual decrease rates of mudflat widths in the southeastern area and eastern area reached 26 9 m yr and 21 m yr respectively at the same time the mudflat widths of the northeastern area and northeastern area gradually expanded from 2002 to 2019 at 30 5 m yr and 49 9 m yr respectively fig 6c overall the mudflats exhibited explicit distinct variations that changed from sediment erosion to deposition from south to north 3 3 elevation changes in the salt marshes and mudflats elevation changes are imperative indicators of salt marsh and mudflat morphodynamics the nz salt marshes and mudflats presented significant accretion trends with significant levels reaching 0 97 and 0 95 during 2002 2019 respectively the accumulated elevation changes in the salt marshes reached almost 3 m from 2002 to 2019 and the average annual elevation change rate was 0 178 m yr fig 7 a additionally the mudflat deposition in the nz was higher than that of the salt marsh which had an accretion rate of 0 256 m yr fig 7a in the ez the accretion rates were reduced significantly between 2004 and 2008 the ez salt marsh elevation changes occurred due to erosion subsequently the gradual deposition trend recovered after 2008 with an annual increase of 0 103 m yr fig 7b the accumulated salt marsh elevation increased by approximately 1 m in the past decade moreover the ez mudflat exhibited a similar elevation evolution process nevertheless its accretion was much lower with an average accumulation of 0 066 m yr from 2005 to 2019 fig 7b these results indicate that of the wetlands the nz wetlands had the most remarkable accretion zone with the maximum lateral migration and vertical deposition rates 4 discussion 4 1 sediment supply tidal flat morphodynamics are controlled by a combination of influences such as tidal range relative slr marsh elevation within the tidal frame and sediment source supply lovelock et al 2015 kirwan et al 2016 crosby et al 2016 a sufficient sediment supply is one of the important drivers supporting salt marsh and mudflat growth fagherazzi et al 2020 the ecw has multiple sediment sources including fluvial sediment and longshore sediment transport yang et al 2020 leonardi et al 2021 fig 8 a indicates that the fluvial suspended sediment load at the datong station had a sharply decreasing trend 27 99 106 t yr between 2003 and 2008 because of tgd operations dai et al 2016b even though the discharge remained almost unchanged fig 8a moreover between 2008 and 2019 the ssd was relatively stable at a mean of approximately 121 4 106 t yr fig 8a obviously the ssd reduction still induced the expansion of the salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw which could be seen from the negative relationship between them fig 8b nevertheless a short term vertical decreasing trend occurred in the ez salt marshes and mudflats from 2003 to 2008 fig 7b which was attributable to the decreasing fluvial ssd although the fluvial ssd reduction had little impact on ecw development in the long term it hampered local mudflat expansion fig 8c reveals that the annual ssc in the estuary at sheshan station near the ecw was approximately 0 77 kg m3 from 2009 to 2017 and this value remained almost unchanged fig 8c this result explicitly demonstrates that even if the fluvial sediment underwent a sharp decline the constant local ssc could still support salt marsh development this finding is in line with the theory that sediment availability is the critical factor controlling salt marsh expansion and survival fagherazzi et al 2020 4 2 effects of local conditions an estuary s regional morphology significantly affects sediment transport dynamics and wetland evolution dai et al 2018a dai 2021 the ecw is located in a complex tidal environment its nz is near the north branch of the cjd and its sz is near the north channel limited by the regional morphology the north branch only receives 1 of the runoff flows from the changjiang river but accepts 25 of the total tidal prism chen and chen 2003 as a flood dominated channel it is primarily controlled by estuarine hydrodynamics and mainly receives sediment from the sea dai et al 2016a at the same time the mouth of the north branch is recognized as one of the highest ssc zones in the cjd and a substantial amount of sediment is deposited in this area dai et al 2018b therefore flood dominated hydrodynamics and sufficient sediment supply are responsible for promoting northern and eastern wetland deposition leonardi et al 2021 dai 2021 fig 9 a in contrast to the north branch the north channel is dominated by the ebb tide dominated current mei et al 2018 the sz is constrained by strong hydrodynamic conditions between the flood dominated channel and ebb dominated channel and thus faces a large obstruction to expansion fig 9a in addition waves in sheshan generally are in southern or southeastern directions in spring and summer and northern or northeastern directions in autumn and winter yun 2004 wu and zhu 2010 fig 9b the southerly wave directly erodes the mudflats of the sz in the ecw due to the open surrounding sea areas therefore the field measurement results displayed the highest slope in the sz at 1 and the ez and nz slopes were 0 08 and 0 1 respectively yang et al 2002 which could be attributed to the local actions of tidal currents and wind driven waves in addition the ebb dominated circumstances in the north channel carry the sediment away from the tidal flats wu and zhu 2010 liu et al 2020 the strong hydrodynamic environment and insufficient sediment supply are remarkable obstructions to sz expansion on the other hand the sz has a steep slope and narrow mudflat distribution and is unable to withstand wave and tide current dynamics which force the mudflats to erode and become steeper from this increase in slope steepness the margin between the salt marsh and mudflat platforms becomes increasingly unstable eventually this process leads to salt marsh retreat and landward migration van de koppel et al 2004 4 3 sea level rise existing knowledge reveals that the sustainability of wetlands is now severely threatened by the increase in slr due to global climate change rizzetto and tosi 2011 kirwan and megonigal 2013 linhoss et al 2015 globally many studies have demonstrated that marsh mudflat ecosystems are in danger of disappearing if they cannot accrete elevation at rates that match slr lovelock et al 2015 crosby et al 2016 one crucial index assessing salt marsh vulnerability is that which compares salt marsh surface elevation changes with regional sea level variations horton et al 2018 recent research has indicated that the rate of global mean slr presents an accelerating trend with a rate that increased from 1 4 mm yr in 1880 1993 to 2 9 mm yr in 1993 2010 church and white 2011 in addition influenced by the high forcing and unfavorable ice sheet dynamics the slr might exceed 2 m in many regions kopp et al 2017 here we assessed the relative slr in the cjd using the theoretical minimum tidal surface as the benchmark the mean sea level in the cjd exhibited an increasing trend with an increasing rate of 4 7 mm yr despite the interannual fluctuations fig 10 furthermore wang 2010 determined that the subsidence rate in the ecw was approximately 5 2 mm yr in recent years therefore the relative slr is approximately 9 9 mm yr because of the mean slr and subsidence rate coupling effects based on the results related to salt marsh and mudflat accretions we found that the annual accretion in the ez mudflat was 66 mm yr excluding the sz erosion fig 7 nevertheless the local wetland subsidence process including sediment compaction and organic matter decomposition are not considered here in this remote sensing technology it is notable that although the local wetland subsidence process could have contributed to lowering the rates of elevation change subsidence rates were much smaller than the ecw accretion rate yang et al 2020 also proposed an accretion rate of 33 49 mm yr in the ecw although the estimated annual accretion rate was greater than that in the previous study proposed by yang et al 2020 it could be concluded that the enhancement of the salt marshes in the ecw was remarkably higher than the relative slr in the ecw reflecting that these areas are sufficiently resilient to the slr threat 4 4 effects of human intervention in the ecw a series of artificial projects including embankment construction and vegetation plantations have been conducted in recent decades to accelerate marsh sedimentation luo et al 2017 fig 11 shows that several large scale reclamation projects were constructed in the ecw during 1999 2019 the embankments interrupted the tidal current decreased the water flow velocity and restricted the sediment carrying capacity thus accelerating wetland sedimentation li et al 2011 subsequently lu and jiang 2013 also identified that the ecw underwent a remarkable expansion in the first three years following the construction of the embankments in 1999 and then gradually recovered to equilibrium conditions the results indicate that mudflat areas in 2002 2003 2010 2013 and 2015 appeared to increase fig 4c which confirms that these projects dramatically promoted mudflat expansion in the following 1 2 years fig 11 additionally with their immense capacity for diminishing flow velocity and trapping sediment salt marsh vegetation is considered one of the driving factors of wetland development kirwan and megonigal 2013 therefore spartina alterniflora was artificially introduced in 2001 and 2003 to promote the development and stability of the ecw han et al 2009 furthermore the cultivation of spartina alterniflora in the ecw expanded from 33 ha in 2000 to 916 131 ha in 2008 phragmites australis increased to 206 25 ha and scirpus mariqueter decreased from 1660 ha to 963 137 ha from 2000 to 2008 ge et al 2015a because of its prominent competitive advantage spartina alterniflora rapidly spread and became an invasive grass species in the chongming wetland resulting in part of the mudflat areas in the ecw being occupied by salt marshes ge et al 2015a ge et al 2015b eventually the ecw reached an equilibrium state in which the salt marshes continuously expanded and the mudflats remained stable from 2002 to 2019 another effect of ecw evolution is the distribution of salt marsh vegetation zhang et al 2020 based on remote sensing technology liu et al 2020 indicated that the invasive species spartina alterniflora is mainly distributed in the northern and northeastern ecw while the native species scirpus mariqueter and phragmites australis are in the eastern and southern ecw obviously as a result of its stronger competitive capacity and wider ecological niche the spartina alterniflora has higher expansion rates than those of the native species huang et al 2007 zhu et al 2012 on the other hand through field measurements li and yang 2009 found that the annual sediment trapping rate of spartina alterniflora was 220 6 172 7 g m2 in the cjd which was remarkably higher than that of phragmites australis 64 9 38 1 g m2 and scirpus mariqueter 31 6 10 0 g m2 this scenario also explains the generation of differences in the nz and ez 4 5 dynamic spatial patterns of the salt marshes and mudflats the three zones of the ecw showed different salt marsh and mudflat dynamics from 2002 to 2019 corresponding to three evolution spatial patterns fig 12 generally salt marsh and mudflat development presented similar spatial evolution patterns with deposition in the northern and eastern areas and erosion in the south area fig 12 specifically both the nz salt marshes and mudflats were in a rapid expansion stage in comparison to salt marsh accretion mudflat accretion was much higher including lateral expansions and vertical accumulations fig 12a the ez salt marsh and mudflat dynamics experienced stable progradation processes from 2002 to 2019 the lateral expansion rates of the salt marshes and mudflats were similar while the vertical mudflat deposition was slightly weaker than that of the salt marshes fig 12b in contrast the sz salt marshes and mudflats continuously eroded which gradually induced their edges to retreat landward fig 12c thus this dynamic could be identified as a slight erosion spatial pattern such spatial patterns reasonably summarize the salt marsh development dynamics to analyze the external contributors salt marsh progradation could be linked to the sediment budget of the entire wetland ganju et al 2017 sufficient sediment and moderate hydrodynamics are prerequisites for marsh progradation such as in the nz salt marsh otherwise a marsh would risk retreat which is similar to that which occurred in the sz salt marsh based on internal mechanisms there is a potential balance between salt marsh and mudflat the salt marshes continuously occupied the mudflat areas and forced the mudflat margins to migrate seaward at the same time the mudflat seaward expansion also provided the salt marsh greater area to further accelerate salt marsh growth conversely mudflat erosion would have restricted salt marsh development due to a lack of space for expansion furthermore based on the salt marsh dynamic models proposed by fagherazzi et al 2020 this study further forecasts the fate of the ecw in the future notably in the nz the mudflats have a higher deposition rate than the salt marshes providing enough space for salt marsh progradation nevertheless mudflat progradation will be limited by the local morphology and hydrodynamics and eventually reach a dynamic balance then mudflats will feedback the salt marshes affecting their continual progradation and even causing them to retreat however in the ez the seaward migration and accretion of the salt marshes were greater than those of its adjacent mudflat and the mudflats were in the erosion stage although the large mudflat area in the ez offered sufficient space for salt marsh progradation the slow accretion of the mudflats would likely gradually increase wave and tide flow impacts and restrict marsh development in addition impacted by wave hydrodynamics the sz salt marshes and mudflats have experienced landward retreat which increases the risk of coastal erosion 4 6 uncertainty analysis multiple remote sensing images and measured tidal levels were combined to build annual fitted linear equations and this method effectively exhibited the long term and successive morphological evolution of the edw nevertheless there are still some uncertainties in this measurement including data source errors and processing errors specifically the data source error primarily refers to the 30 m spatial resolution of landsat images which would induce a pixel error of 9x10 4 km2 therefore selecting a large study area is a precondition for decreasing this data source error okin and gu 2015 the results show that the edw area is over 100 km2 remarkably larger than the pixel error which would effectively decrease the impact from the data source error at the same time although we utilized the measured tidal level to construct the relationship between the tidal flat areas and tidal levels due to the topographic influence the tidal levels in the different regions of the edw were not entirely consistent at the same moment this scenario affected the statistical relations between areas and tidal levels and then further influenced tidal flat area acquisition although the annual fitting curves between the tidal flat areas and tidal levels had high correlation coefficients r2 0 95 deviations remained between the fitted tidal flat areas and the actual values overall compared with the results from the few and intermittent landsat images the results from numerous and serial landsat images applied through machine learning provided increased accuracy and decreased randomness this method can precisely describe the morphological evolution process in the ecw in recent decades furthermore this work also demonstrated the long term interaction of vegetation geomorphology between salt marshes and mudflats in the ecw which is difficult to detect through episodic field measurements 5 conclusion influenced by slr and fluvial ssd reduction most of the salt marshes in mega deltas are under tremendous pressure to better protect and manage these precious natural resources it is essential to detect the long term morphodynamics of salt marshes and demonstrate the variability in salt marsh and mudflat evolution and their underlying connections taking the ecw as an example this paper proposed a creative method to detect salt marsh and mudflat multidimensional development by combining a full time series of remote sensing images and regional tidal elevations the main conclusions are as follows 1 the whole eastern chongming wetland was experiencing deposition even though there were distinct changes in the local salt marshes between 2002 and 2019 the northern salt marshes and mudflats of the eastern chongming wetland exhibited remarkable expansions and their areas increased 2 64 km2 yr and 0 922 km2 yr respectively with seaward migrations and accretions the eastern salt marshes had moderate progradation with lateral changes of 39 5 m yr and vertical increases of 0 103 m yr whereas the mudflats experienced slight erosion with an area reduction of 0 738 km2 yr nevertheless landward retreats were detected in the sz salt marshes and mudflats 2 fluvial ssd is not a dominant factor controlling salt marsh development while the high local ssc ensured salt marsh progression in the eastern chongming wetland at the same time the relative sea level rise in the eastern chongming wetland was lower than the salt marsh and mudflat accretions providing sufficient wetland resilience to sea level rise local hydrology human intervention and vegetation effects are recognized as the primary factors that impact the spatial evolution pattern of salt marshes and mudflats 3 the salt marsh and mudflat dynamics in the eastern chongming wetland were divided into three patterns the first pattern is the rapid expansion pattern of the salt marshes in the western zone which are supported by sufficient sediment and weaker hydrodynamics the second pattern is the moderate progradation pattern of salt marshes in the eastern zone although seaward migration of the salt marshes occurred the mudflats faced minimal erosion the third pattern is the slight erosion pattern of the salt marshes in the western zone landward migration of the salt marshes and mudflats revealed recession of the salt marsh system credit authorship contribution statement yaying lou writing original draft data collection and analysis zhijun dai ideal

3521,the water resources in the upper awash basin in central ethiopia are intensively utilized by the densely populated urban centers and extensive agricultural activities in the wide rift plains surrounding the major cities the green blue grey and total water footprints of major crops dominantly cultivated in the sub basin teff maize sorghum and sugar cane are characterized the water footprints were analyzed for the period 2000 to 2010 using climatic as well as soil and crop yield data from the debrezeit wonji melkassa and metehara stations the temporal and spatial variations of total water footprints twfs in the basin were analyzed and mapped the temporal trends of the water footprints wfs are interpreted using mann kendall and sen s slope tests the crop production in the sub basin mainly depends on green water consumption teff and sorghum crops in the climatically similar debrezeit and melkassa areas had relatively higher twfs 4205 m3 ton and 2539 m3 ton respectively compared to maize blue water requirement to supplement rainfed agriculture decreases from metehara melkassa wonji to debrezeit in that order the twf of irrigated sugarcane 117 212 m3 ton is less than those of rainfed crops such as maize which has a minimum twf of 1752 m3 ton the spatial and temporal variations in wfs in the sub basin are determined by both climatic effective rainfall evapotranspiration length of wet spell and length of growing period and non climatic parameters such as fertilizer consumption soil types crop yields and agricultural management practices our results suggest cultivating less water intensive high yield crops can significantly decrease the twfs in the sub basin the results could be used to develop well informed regional and national freshwater resource management policies more broadly our novel approach of characterizing wfs at the sub basin scale using limited amount of locally measured data sets could be a useful tool in other parts of the world where locally measured data sets are scarce keywords water footprint spatial variability temporal variability blue green grey water dominant crops 1 introduction in the past century freshwater use has been growing twice as fast as the world s population which has resulted in 1 2 billion people living in water scarce regions by the turn of the century un water 2007 berger et al 2014 this shows that earth s freshwater resources have been facing tremendous pressure due to increasing consumptive use and water pollution steffen et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 freshwater scarcity is therefore a growing global concern that is directly linked to human activities postel et al 1996 vörösmarty et al 2010 this is particularly evident in the agricultural sector which is constrained by unbalanced demands and withdrawals though it accounts for roughly 70 of freshwater use molden et al 2010 fader et al 2011 previous research on the intricate relationship among water use scarcity and pollution as well as consumption production and trade has led to the conceptualization of water footprint wf which is defined as the volume of freshwater consumed and polluted to make a certain product hoekstra 2003 the wf water scarcity and crop water productivity are used to assess water and food sustainability xu et al 2019 the wf accounts not only for the direct water use by a consumer or producer but also for indirect water use which depends on the water footprint of the activities related to the studied product or process that goes beyond the boundary of the process egan 2011 therefore quantifying agricultural water use is the basis for reasonable utilization and allocation of regional water resources the wf concept reflects the real demand and utilization of water resources in a region or country and the consequences of human and societal reliance on water sources and the environment hoekstra 2003 xu et al 2019 crop water footprint cwf in particular is the main factor affecting the global water footprint due to the extensive areal coverage of crops xu et al 2019 various studies have attempted to quantify the wf of various crops in different river basins of the world chapagain and hoekstra 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a yoo et al 2014 zhuo et al 2014 duan et al 2016 mali et al 2018 ewaid et al 2021 the total water footprint constitutes the green blue and grey wfs the green wf is the volume of rainwater stored in the root zone of the soil soil moisture evaporated transpired or incorporated by plants hoekstra et al 2011 ali 2019 in this type of wf the rainwater neither recharges the groundwater nor flows as a runoff the blue wf refers to the consumption of blue water resources surface and groundwater along the supply chain of a product the grey wf on the other hand is defined as the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentration and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 ali 2019 the total wfs of ethiopia is accounted by 97 green wf 2 blue wf and 1 grey wf for crop production 5 blue wf and 95 grey for industrial production 10 blue wf and 90 grey wf for domestic water supply mekonnen and hoekstra 2011c the total annual wfs of ethiopia for the period between1996 and 2005 have been estimated to be 77 8 billion m3 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011c the green wf which is used by plants from rainfall stored as soil moisture accounted for 98 of the total the remaining 2 of the wf was from the use of surface and groundwater for agriculture industry and domestic water supply these studies focused on quantifying the wf of crop production at global regional and national levels studies of wf at a river basin scale using data collected from within the basin are very crucial for structured and effective water management practices however such studies are non existent in ethiopia this study at the upper awash basin is therefore the first of its kind in ethiopia the headwater of the awash river starts at the central ethiopian highlands at an altitude of 3000 m a s l some 100 km west of addis ababa and drains southeastward until it reaches the main ethiopian rift mer at the koka reservoir the river then flows northeastward following the general ne sw orientation of the rift bounding and within rift faults and eventually discharges into lake abhe at the ethio djibouti border keraga et al 2017 gedefaw et al 2019 the upper awash basin characterized by diverse climatic conditions topographic features and agricultural practices is the most intensively utilized river basin in ethiopia adane et al 2020a b the water resources in the upper awash basin are very much stressed due to rapid population growth industrialization pollution and intensification of agricultural activities in and surrounding the major urban centers including addis ababa modjo and adama this leads to water scarcity and presents serious challenges in water allocation and distribution among various users gedefaw et al 2019 applying the wf concept will therefore enable us to characterize the relationships among these stressors water use pollution and scarcity and will provide new perspectives to better management of the water resources in the basin the study aims at assessing spatial and temporal variation of wfs of dominant crops grown in the upper awash basin by characterizing the rainy season i e the onset end and length of the wet spells as well as the soil moisture reserves of a particular area in order to determine the exact length of growing periods lgp of crops in addition the spatial variation of wfs of the basin have been mapped and relationships of the total wf versus crop yield and crop evapotranspiration etc versus total wfs have been characterized our novel approach utilizes a limited amount of locally measured data set including climate parameters soil type yields fertilizer application rate among others to characterize the wfs of dominant crops via considering the onset cessation of rainfall season wet spell length and length of growing periods in a data scarce basin past wf measurements at national level used global data sets e g allen et al 1998 and the results tend to over or under estimate the wfs for different crops our approach shows that accurate determination of the length of growing period using locally measured data set is crucial in accurate characterization of the twfs in a basin our novel approach could be a useful tool in determining wfs in other parts of the world where locally measured data are scarce careful vetting of the scare data set for their resolution internal consistency and duration as well as proper selection of the dominant cultivated crops in the basin are important preconditions to replicate our approach 2 data sources 2 1 climate data the climate of the awash basin is influenced by the inter tropical convergence zone itcz getahun and haj 2015 which is a zone of low pressure marking the convergence of the dry tropical easterlies and the moist equatorial westerlies the seasonal rainfall distribution within the basin results from the annual migration of the itcz getahun and haj 2015 the upper awash basin comprises relatively higher elevations in the southwest and lower elevation areas of the rift in the southeast fig 1 the climate data are obtained from the national meteorological agency nma of ethiopia wonji shoa sugar factory metehara sugar factory debrezeit and melkassa agricultural research centers these include mean maximum and minimum temperatures c mean temperature c relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed at 2 m height in m s or km day and rainfall mm a summary of the rainfall and temperature records is shown in table 1 additional climate data are presented in supplementary fig s1 mean annual air temperature and evapotranspiration increases from the west debrezeit to the east metehara rainfall occurs mainly in two different seasons a short rainy season february may and a long rainy season june september locally named as belg and kiremt respectively the climate analysis is computed based on the dekadal 10 days records of climatological elements the standard meteorological dekads represent periods of ten days for the first two dekads between the 1st and 10th and the 11th and 20th days respectively in each month and 8 9 10 or 11 days for the last dekad of the month wmo 1967 adane et al 2020b this is indicated in supplementary table s1 the tukey fence method was used to screen the outliers and a double mass curve method was used to test the homogeneity of the rainfall data respectively this preliminary step analysis was done in adane et al 2020b 2 2 soil and crop yield data physical properties of the dominant soils soil groups bulk density the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp percentages are collected from the archives of the research centers sugar state companies and verified following the fc pwp ranges in allen et al 1998 the details of the soil data are given in supplementary tables s2 s5 aggregated crop yields at zonal level and consumption of fertilizers per area of croplands are obtained from the database of the central statistical agency csa of ethiopia the data from eastern showa zone where the study sites located was used in this study in addition data was collected from local agricultural research centers and extension services and the sugar corporation research and development center of ethiopia the debrezeit area is known for intensive cultivation of the indigenous ethiopian crop teff in the wonji and metehara areas maize is mostly cultivated especially during the kiremt season sorghum is also commonly cultivated in the dryland areas in and around melkassa area in this study maize is considered as a common rainfed crop in all the four areas of study in addition to the dominant types of crops in a specific area furthermore irrigated sugarcane plantations in the wonji and metehara areas are the major crops in the upper awash basin the wonji shoa sugar cane estate farm covers more than 12 800 ha of irrigated land nigussie et al 2017 and metehara has a 10 230 ha areal coverage in the study basin degefa et al 2017 the sugar cane early maturing with lgp of 14 months and late maturing of 20 or 24 months was considered for wf analysis on the other hand though fruits and vegetables could have an important wf particularly from the upper awash agro industry and other small scale community farms appropriate data with the resolution and time period matching those of the other crops at the center of this study are not available as a result the wf of vegetables and fruits are not incorporated in this study 3 methods various methods and approaches are used to determine the onset end and length of the wet spells and the length of growing period lgp some methods use daily and others dekadal or monthly data to characterize the rainfall distribution within a river basin 3 1 data analysis water footprint wfblue wfgreen wfgray of the upper awash basin was computed by analyzing the reference evapotranspiration eto using the penman monteith method as well as the effective rainfall crop water requirements and irrigation requirements of specific crops the cropwat model version 8 0 was used as decision support for analyzing the above parameters and matlab r2020a software was used to plot graphs of the analysis the local data elevation latitude and longitude and climatic data were then used as input in the cropwat model the fao penman monteith equation was used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 using eq 1 most of the input parameters minimum temperature maximum temperature relative

debrezeit maize in melkassa and metehara and sorghum in melkassa has been characterized the rainfall characterization was based on the dominant type of crop however maize is also considered a common crop in all four areas the crop water requirements of the selected crops during their initial growth stages were used to determine the onset of the wet spell for specific season moreover the end of a wet spell dekad is defined as a dekad with a cumulative rainfall of less than or equal to the dekadal water requirements of each crop during the late growing stage adane et al 2020b these results are later used for analyzing the spatio temporal variation of the wfs of different crops the beginning onset and end of the wet spell periods were analyzed using eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 p o k c i n i t

from allen et al 1998 the lgp is defined as the period between the onset and end of the wet spell dekads and the number of dekads it takes to evapotranspire the moisture reserve in the topsoil depth the fao 1978 assumes an additional 100 mm moisture reserve to be added with the period of length of wet spells this assumption is for the ideal crop and it is not soil specific in this study lgp for crops commonly grown in the study areas were computed by considering the dominant soil types vertisols in the debrezeit area a1 and ba2 black and brown soils of fine textured clay in the wonji area clay loam and sandy loam in the melkassa area and clay and clay loamy soil in the metehara area wonji shoa sugar state factory 2000 isayas and tafesse 2003 tate 2009 the soil moisture reserve after the cessation of rainfall that the crop can utilize within one meter depth known as the readily available water was considered hence the period required to evapotranspire the readily available water

utilized by the crops readily available water raw however the plantation date and the lgp of different sugarcane varieties was collected from ethiopian sugar corporation research and development center therefore there was no need for computing the taw raw and lws for irrigated crops due to lack of data about the effective root zone depth for various crops under rainfed conditions the depth of root zone in this study was taken from savva and frenken 2002 which have made detail analysis on eastern and southern africa by considering the minimum depth for different crops grown under fully irrigated conditions as the depth of root zone for rainfed conditions depth of root zone for millet under rainfed condition was used as root depth for teff 1 0 m furthermore an effective root zone depth of 1 0 m was considered for both maize and sorghum allen et al 1998 savva and frenken 2002 the managerial allowable depletion mad for the selected crops teff maize and sorghum was assumed to be

analysis of lgp and twfs the mann kendall mk trend analysis method which is the most widely used test for assessing time series trends in hydro meteorological studies karpouzos et al 2010 shadmani et al 2012 gocic and trajkovic 2013 ali et al 2019 adane et al 2020b was used to test the trends of the lgp and twfs over different time series for the time series of x1 x2 xn the mk test statistics s mann 1945 kendall 1957 for the green blue and grey wf and twf of consecutive years can be calculated using eq 18 18 s i 1 n 1 j k 1 n sign x j x i the variance of s is then computed using eq 19 19 var

null hypothesis of no trend can be rejected with a 95 confidence i e with 5 probability of wrongly rejecting the hypothesis if z 1 96 or p value of the mk test statistics is below 0 05 furthermore sen s slope estimation q2 was carried out to analyze the magnitude of a trend in the time series gocic and trajkovic 2013 adane et al 2020a this test provides a strong trend estimation when the trend cannot be estimated by other statistical approaches like kendall s test statistics or regression adane et al 2020a the positive results of q2 in the twf represent an increasing trend while the negative values represent decreasing trends over a given time 4 results 4 1 onset end and length of wet spells adane et al 2020b have characterized the rainfall season onset end and lws of the upper awash basin for the selected crop types table 2 the mean onset of the growing period during the main rainy season kiremt occurred at the end of dekad 17 june 11 20 in debrezeit wonji and melkassa areas and dekad 19 july 1 10 in the metehara area an early withdrawal of rainfall was observed in metehara in dekad 25 september 1 10 4 2 lgp of crops the total lgp for the rainfed condition was determined by adding the period required to evapotranspire the raw to the period between the onset and end of the wet spell table 3 and fig 2 the moisture reserves in the soils in a meter depth were estimated to be 110 0 mm in debrezeit 74 3 mm and 68 8 mm in wonji 100 0 mm in melkassa and 72 6 mm and 61 1 mm in metehara table 3 and see supplementary tables s2 s5 for more details the maximum moisture reserve in a soil depth is expected to stay for 28 days in debrezeit and the shortest about 15 days in metehara table 3 the available moisture reserve in soil which extends the growing period after the rainfall ceased allows an extended lgp of 140 days in the debrezeit area and a short lgp of 75 days in the metehara area table 3 and fig 2 the lgp in the metehara area during the main rainy season kiremt does not show the real span of the growing period and more supplemental irrigation is required to support the lgp in this area the lgp of sugarcane for late maturing cane in the wonji and metehara areas ranges between 18 and 24 and 18 20 months respectively on the other hand 14 15 months are required for early maturing sugarcane in both areas the crop coefficient kc values used by both sugar estates for quantifying the water requirement during initial mid season and late season stages are 0 55 1 05 and 0 7 respectively in this study maximum and minimum lgp ranges were used to quantify the twf of sugarcane in both farms at a 5 significance level our result does not allow us to determine that there is a trend in lgp with a reasonable degree of certainty i e 95 over the period 1977 2010 in the upper awash basin table 4 this implies that the lgps of dominant rainfed crop trends are not serially correlated over time in the basin the no trend hypothesis in mk signifies that the data are independent and identically distributed in the given period gilbert 1987 mann 1945 these findings agree with the rainfall characterization in the upper awash basin by adane et al 2020b who found out that the lws excluding the soil moisture reserves has a non significant trend at a 5 level in all areas of the basin except at the debreziet station in the debrezeit station the lws showed an increasing trend only when rainfall is considered a determinant factor sen s slope test q2 results also show a decline in lgp by 0 3 days season in the melkassa and metehara areas table 4 the lgp trends could be affected by other agricultural and water management practices such as crop variety selection fertilizer application and moisture conservation practices which improve the water use efficiency and yield and in turn contribute to the reduction of wfs in the basin tuninetti et al 2018 investigated the global wfs of some crops wheat maize rice and soyabean and found significant positive trends in crop yield and a non significant evapotranspiration pattern for the studied crops our results that show non significant trend of the lgp which is mainly driven by evapotranspiration agrees with the findings on the global average evapotranspiration trends of selected crops 4 3 wfs of crops 4 3 1 rainfed crops the average annual wfs of the dominant rainfed crops over a period of 11 years 2000 2010 vary from the highest at the debreziet area 4205 m3 ton for teff 1940 m3 ton for maize to the lowest at the wonji area 1752 m3 ton for maize table 5 on the other hand though the low rainfall in the metehara area cannot produce a crop yield there is a green and grey water use green cwu and grey wu in the early growth stages fig 3 the average annual green and grey cwu of metehara area for maize are 2316 m3 ha and 573 m3 ha respectively however to sustain an optimal yield production in this area 2688 m3 ha of blue water demand bwd is required either from the surface or sub surface water sources table 5 and fig 3 except in the metehara area the green wfs under rainfed conditions account for the highest proportions in supporting the growth of crops with 90 87 and 86 of the total wf requirements in the debrezeit melkassa and wonji areas respectively the green wf is higher in the main rainy season kiremt which coincides with the main growing periods of crops between june and september teff in the debrezeit area has an extended lgp and requires more blue water 1157 m3 ha to fully satisfy the deficit from the available rainfall amount similarly sorghum in the melkassa area requires 1039 m3 ha additional water to satisfy the consumptive uses fully however no irrigation practice has been observed for the crops in the study areas and rely on rainfed for these rainfed crops except in metehara yields are harvested under deficit conditions as they require more blue water for optimal harvests the average annual bwd for maize crops is lower 701 m3 ha in the debrezeit than in the metehara 2688 m3 ha with intermediate values in the melkassa 1323 m3 ha and wonji 902 m3 ha areas table 5 the average annual grey wf which is the minimum volume of water used to dilute nitrogen fertilizer applied for enhancing the vegetation growth and subsequently leached to the groundwater range from 10 for maize and 13 for teff in the debrezeit area 14 for maize in the wonji area and 13 for both sorghum and maize in the melkassa area table 5 4 3 2 wf for irrigated crop sugarcane the sugarcane farms at wonji and metehara which cover an area of 23 000 ha mostly use surface irrigation systems while wonji shoa sugar estate additionally use an overhead sprinkler irrigation system the annual average twf during the 2000 2010 period ranges from 125 to 212 m3 ton in wonji and 117 to 167 m3 ton in metehara the ranges representing the short and long lgp variety sugarcanes table 6 though the short lgp sugarcane variety sc 2 in wonji has the least coefficient of variation cv in twf 11 3 with deviation from the mean of 14 2 m3 ton all the sugarcane varieties in both farms show comparable cvs in wf ranging only between 11 3 and 13 6 and limited standard deviation ranges between the short lgp 14 to 16 m3 ton and long lgp 22 7 to 26 2 m3 ton sugarcane varieties table 6 on the other hand the sugarcane at wonji both short and long lgp varieties show higher green wf as a result of the extended rainfall period compared to the sugarcane both the short and long lgp varieties at metehara in contrast both the sugarcane varieties at metehara show more blue consumptive water use and relatively higher blue wf fig 4 as they require more irrigated water due to the high crop evapotranspiration rate in the area based on the findings of this study the estate farms are recommended to grow a low twf sugar cane variety sc 2 and sc 4 in the water stressed upper awash basin a lower twfs in irrigated sugar cane 117 212 m3 ton compared to rainfed crops are observed in the upper awash basin this indicates that there is a possibility to raise the green water productivity in the basin mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 the confidence interval ci with a significance of 0 05 i e a confidence level of 95 for the annual average twfs of the time series 2000 2010 are indicated for both estate farms in table 6 4 4 twf vs etc relations the twf vs etc linear regression for the rainfed conditions see supplementary fig s3 show slightly decreasing trend in the debrezeit and slightly increasing trends in wonji and melkassa areas similar regression for the irrigated sugarcane see supplementary fig s4 show slightly increasing trends in both wonji and metehara the etc of maize shows no statistically significant trend in the debrezeit wonji and melkassa areas see supplementary table s6 while in metehara it shows a statistically significant decreasing trend with a magnitude of sen s slope of 10 6 mm growing season the reduction in etc for the rainfed crops in the melkassa and metehara areas could indicate the scarcity of available rainfall and requires extra blue water bwd to supplement the rainfed crops in the basin likewise for the irrigated sugarcane the etc shows a significant decreasing trend z 2 49 only in the metehara farm see supplementary table s6 the variability in etc of crops in the basin is primarily driven by climatic eto and plant conditions degree of surface cover and their interactions in line with various factors such as soil characteristics physical chemical and hydraulic conditions and soil water availability among others irmak 2017 5 discussion 5 1 temporal variation of wfs all the wfs show some inter annual variability for different crops under rainfed and irrigated conditions in the four study areas fig 3 fig 5 and fig 6 adane et al 2020b investigated the variability in rainfall and length of wet spells in a time series between 1980 and 2010 across the upper awash basin and found out that the rainfall variability is responsible for variation in wet spell lengths consequently this could influence the twfs of different crops across the basin under rainfed conditions more green and less grey wfs were noticed in the entire study area fig 5 in 2002 nearly all the study sites were under moisture stress and the annual wf components show more blue water was required to sustain the optimal agricultural productivity in the basin fig 5 in 2002 rainfall failed in both the small belg and main kiremt rainy seasons in many parts of the country including the study area due to el nino induced drought mera 2018 in 2004 more blue water was needed to support the sorghum and maize crops in the melkassa area fig 5d e during the 2007 2009 period the wfs of irrigated sugarcane in wonji experienced the highest wf in the range of 241 252 m3 ton sc 1 and 142 147 m3 ton sc 2 with an annual average yield of 153 ton ha fig 6 a low yield 129 137 ton ha below the expected average resulted in higher twfs of the sugarcane however in metehara relatively lower twfs of 149 163 m3 ton sc 3 and 106 109 m3 ton sc 4 were recorded in 2007 2009 with an average yield of 184 ton ha implying relatively better water consumption with lower wfs and higher yield therefore these twf variabilities indicate variation in yield and consumptive use in the basin fig 6 further these variabilities in the wfs in different time scales are attributed to the inter annual variabilities in effective rainfall amounts the reference evapotranspiration and agricultural inputs like fertilizer consumption the fertilizer application urea from 2000 to 2010 were 32 87 kg ha for teff 51 62 kg ha for maize 48 76 kg ha for sorghum and 200 kg ha for sugarcane which are mainly associated with grey wf the mk trend test and sen s slope estimation for twfs of rainfed and irrigated crops show a significant monotonic decrease at p 0 03 in the debrezeit teff and metehara areas 20 months lgp sugarcane with the sen s slope of 208 and 4 7 m3 ton at 5 significance level table 7 and supplementary fig s2 furthermore the twfs of maize in the debrezeit wonji and melkassa areas show decreasing trends though they are not statistically significant with the magnitude of trends of 48 13 2 and 33 5 m3 ton respectively table 7 the irrigated fields of sugarcane exhibited an increasing trend in twfs in wonji and a decreasing trend in metehara for both short and long lgp sugarcane varieties however the trends are statistically significant only in the long lgp sc 3 variety table 7 this decline in twfs is due to the combined influence of higher yield in some crops like maize 1 8 3 1 ton ha and lower yield 0 8 1 3 ton ha in teff or the effect of lower crop evapotranspiration etc demand which results in lower green wf 5 2 spatial variation of wfs the spatial variation in climatic conditions soil type lgp and fertilizer consumption resulted in a significant variation in wfs across the study areas the evapotranspiration rate is high in the eastern part of the upper awash basin with a late onset and early termination of the main rainfall season adane et al 2020b therefore the rainfall in the metehara area representing the eastern part of the upper awash basin cannot support the entire growing season without irrigation blue water see fig 3 different areas require different amounts of blue water for instance for rainfed maize production an additional blue water of 1179 m3 ha in melkassa 902 m3 ha in wonji and 701 m3 ha in debrezeit areas is required hence the bwd is higher in the eastern part of the basin compared to the available green water during the main rainy season on the other hand the spatial distribution of green wfs is higher in the western part of the upper awash basin represented by the debrezeit wonji and melkassa stations as compared to the blue and grey wfs figs 5 7 this is attributed to the higher amount of rainfall during the rainy season in these areas as higher rainfall enhances the availability of green water resources in the form of rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture ali 2019 5 3 determinant factors of twfs in the upper awash basin water footprints in the upper awash basin show temporal and spatial variations see figs 5 7 these variations in twfs could be attributed to various climatic and non climatic parameters which affect the eto the hydrological conditions dryness wetness crop type lgp agricultural inputs and management practices yirga 2007 has identified a decline in soil quality due to loss of top soil over 100 tons ha and net soil nutrient extraction from agricultural land 16 2 kg ha from flat areas and 56 7 kg ha from slopping areas of the central highlands which includes the western part of the upper awash basin contributing to a significant yield reduction of rainfed crops in addition haileslassie et al 2006 found out that the nutrient balance on the central highlands of ethiopia is negative in teff leading to low yields these studies also recommend integrated soil fertility management use of inorganic fertilizer and soil conservation practices stone soil bunds in order to enhance crop yields in the basin yirga 2007 a lower yield and high consumptive use of water for rainfed crops contribute to a higher twf resulting at least partly due to poor water management practices in the basin sun et al 2013 stated that climatic variations have a direct influence on crop evapotranspiration etc and crop yield per area and has also an indirect effect on the twf of a crop in a region the twf of rainfed crops assumes the blue wf as zero and is a function of eto and effective rainfall and mainly affects the green wf in line with the climatic factors various agricultural inputs like fertilizer application use of machinery etc and management practices dry planting mulching intercropping etc could significantly improve the water productivity crop yield and then the twf of a crop in a basin sun et al 2013 therefore these factors mentioned by sun et al 2013 and irmak 2017 could influence the variation in etc and twf of the upper awash basin however data on management practices and agricultural input apart from amount of fertilizer input at station level are not available to make a comparison on the relative effects of these parameters on the twf in the upper awash basin the relationship between twfs and crop yield fig 8 shows high twf of teff in the debrezeit area corresponds to low yield which could be attributed to the high average green wf 3648 m3 ton and consumptive use etc of water 420 mm period of teff this is in agreement with studies that show teff to be a low yield crop compared to other cereals produced in ethiopia lee 2018 on the other hand maize has relatively lower twfs and higher yields compared to other rainfed crops sorghum and teff in the basin fig 8 the annual average twf for maize across the basin decreases from the deberezeit to melkassa then to wonji however the annual average etc is higher in melkassa 428 mm period than in debrezeit 363 mm period maize yield variation in small scale farms in sub saharan africa has been attributed to variation in environmental conditions and local management practice including variation in sowing date spacing weeding and fertilizer doses sileshi et al 2010 sadras et al 2015 furthermore rockström 2003 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a indicated that the general trend between water footprint and yield of cereals follows a logarithmic function similar to what is observed in the upper awash basin fig 8 and argued that agricultural management practices could play a more significant role than agro climatic conditions in determining the wfs though our conclusion cannot be empirically supported due to the lack of data on agricultural management practices at station level in the upper awash basin the wf vs crop yield relationship strongly suggests an important influence of the agricultural input and management practices on the wf of maize and other cereal crops sorghum and teff this implies improving water productivity i e producing more food per unit of water consumption can decrease twfs 5 4 upper awash basin versus global and regional wfs the twfs for various crops computed in the upper awash basin show a significant difference with twf values calculated in other works e g mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a b c table 8 in addition to the fact that the previous works were conducted at global regional and country scale see table 8 while the current study was at a sub basin scale these differences might also reflect the different study periods considered the variation in the length of wet spell period the soil types and climatic parameters we need also to emphasize that our study has the advantage of using locally measured data in each study site for many of our parameters while mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a used the aquastat crop data for computing global average water footprints mekonnen and hoekstra 2011b c estimated the twf of maize and sorghum for ethiopia to be 4237 m3 ton and 5007 m3 ton respectively while these values were much lower at a global scale table 8 our results for the rainfed crops maize sorghum and teff are generally comparable with the respective global wfs but significantly vary from the wfs determined at the national level on the other hand the estimated wfs for two long lgp varieties of irrigated sugar cane sc 1 and sc 3 both in the metehara and wonji areas matched with the global and national estimates mekonnen and hoekstra 2011b 2011c while our estimates for short lgp varieties sc 2 and sc 4 show much lower twfs compared to the global and national estimates table 8 the discrepancies in the wf estimates could be due to the different spatial scales considered in the different studies these discrepancies also suggest that the basin scale studies with actual non averaged climate and crop yield data could better quantify the spatial wf variations and can contribute to formulate site specific water management practices and to develop long term strategies and policies on a broader scale our novel approach and results could contribute to a better use and management of the available green water for increasing food production in a region where food security which is also one of the un sustainable development goals sdg 2 end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture lartey 2015 is a priority objective it has been established that the agricultural sector takes the biggest share 70 of the global freshwater withdrawal while the remaining 30 is shared by the domestic and industrial sectors fader et al 2011 molden et al 2010 un water 2021 in sub saharan africa a region which in most cases is food insecure and water stressed more than 95 of the available green water soil moisture reserve exclusively from precipitation is used by rainfed agriculture rockström et al 2007 schuol et al 2008 at a global scale green water is primarily used to produce food for global consumption falkenmark rockström 2006 sulser et al 2010 except in south asian countries where blue water irrigation also significantly contributes to food production however the blue water resources in the southeast asian countries are mostly from unsustainable groundwater sulser et al 2010 in the face of increasing demand for freshwater resources from the domestic and industrial sectors environmental flows as well as other agricultural activities than crop production such as livestock rearing water resource planners decision makers are increasingly focused on the blue water under estimating the potential of green water to sustain agricultural production at the same time coping with frequent extreme climate change impacts schuol et al 2008 our approach can be used to characterize wfs in many parts of the world such as sub saharan africa where such studies are rare our approach of characterizing wfs using a specific case study in a water stressed food insecure data scarce sub basin could serve as a tool for decision making in the prioritization of green or blue water for agricultural use 6 conclusions the following key findings are drawn from this study on the wfs of dominant rainfed and irrigated crops in the upper awash basin for the period 2000 2010 1 under rainfed conditions teff and sorghum have relatively higher twfs compared to maize under the same climate and environmental conditions in the debreziet and melkassa areas the basin mainly depends on green water resources that sustain rain fed agriculture 2 grey wf from agricultural lands is relatively small compared to blue and green wfs in the upper awash basin however this is only assuming leached nitrogen fertilizers as the major sources of pollutants grey wf might be higher if other pollutants such as phosphorus fertilizers and pesticides are considered 3 the western part of the upper awash basin the debrezeit melkassa and wonji areas has lower blue water demands for maize compared to the eastern part of the basin the metehara area 4 teff the staple crop in many parts of ethiopia has higher wfs compared to sorghum and maize implying that wfs could be lowered if less water intensive varieties can be developed or it is substituted by smaller wf crops 5 the long lgp irrigated sugarcane varieties in wonji and metehara have significantly higher twfs compared to the short lgp varieties preferential cultivation of the early maturing sugarcane varieties could therefore effectively decrease the twfs in the basin 6 the spatial and temporal variations in wfs in the upper awash basin are not related to a single climatic or non climatic parameter rather to a combination of parameters including the lws lgp fertilizer consumption soil types and agricultural management practices 7 twfs in the basin could significantly decrease if less water intensive high yield crops are adopted while rainfed agriculture is supported by efficient irrigation water management systems 8 characterizing wfs at basin and sub basin scales using actual measured non averaged data could give more accurate results which could be more relevant for developing well informed regional and national freshwater resource management policies instead of relying on global and regional scale

3521,the water resources in the upper awash basin in central ethiopia are intensively utilized by the densely populated urban centers and extensive agricultural activities in the wide rift plains surrounding the major cities the green blue grey and total water footprints of major crops dominantly cultivated in the sub basin teff maize sorghum and sugar cane are characterized the water footprints were analyzed for the period 2000 to 2010 using climatic as well as soil and crop yield data from the debrezeit wonji melkassa and metehara stations the temporal and spatial variations of total water footprints twfs in the basin were analyzed and mapped the temporal trends of the water footprints wfs are interpreted using mann kendall and sen s slope tests the crop production in the sub basin mainly depends on green water consumption teff and sorghum crops in the climatically similar debrezeit and melkassa areas had relatively higher twfs 4205 m3 ton and 2539 m3 ton respectively compared to maize blue water requirement to supplement rainfed agriculture decreases from metehara melkassa wonji to debrezeit in that order the twf of irrigated sugarcane 117 212 m3 ton is less than those of rainfed crops such as maize which has a minimum twf of 1752 m3 ton the spatial and temporal variations in wfs in the sub basin are determined by both climatic effective rainfall evapotranspiration length of wet spell and length of growing period and non climatic parameters such as fertilizer consumption soil types crop yields and agricultural management practices our results suggest cultivating less water intensive high yield crops can significantly decrease the twfs in the sub basin the results could be used to develop well informed regional and national freshwater resource management policies more broadly our novel approach of characterizing wfs at the sub basin scale using limited amount of locally measured data sets could be a useful tool in other parts of the world where locally measured data sets are scarce keywords water footprint spatial variability temporal variability blue green grey water dominant crops 1 introduction in the past century freshwater use has been growing twice as fast as the world s population which has resulted in 1 2 billion people living in water scarce regions by the turn of the century un water 2007 berger et al 2014 this shows that earth s freshwater resources have been facing tremendous pressure due to increasing consumptive use and water pollution steffen et al 2015 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 freshwater scarcity is therefore a growing global concern that is directly linked to human activities postel et al 1996 vörösmarty et al 2010 this is particularly evident in the agricultural sector which is constrained by unbalanced demands and withdrawals though it accounts for roughly 70 of freshwater use molden et al 2010 fader et al 2011 previous research on the intricate relationship among water use scarcity and pollution as well as consumption production and trade has led to the conceptualization of water footprint wf which is defined as the volume of freshwater consumed and polluted to make a certain product hoekstra 2003 the wf water scarcity and crop water productivity are used to assess water and food sustainability xu et al 2019 the wf accounts not only for the direct water use by a consumer or producer but also for indirect water use which depends on the water footprint of the activities related to the studied product or process that goes beyond the boundary of the process egan 2011 therefore quantifying agricultural water use is the basis for reasonable utilization and allocation of regional water resources the wf concept reflects the real demand and utilization of water resources in a region or country and the consequences of human and societal reliance on water sources and the environment hoekstra 2003 xu et al 2019 crop water footprint cwf in particular is the main factor affecting the global water footprint due to the extensive areal coverage of crops xu et al 2019 various studies have attempted to quantify the wf of various crops in different river basins of the world chapagain and hoekstra 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a yoo et al 2014 zhuo et al 2014 duan et al 2016 mali et al 2018 ewaid et al 2021 the total water footprint constitutes the green blue and grey wfs the green wf is the volume of rainwater stored in the root zone of the soil soil moisture evaporated transpired or incorporated by plants hoekstra et al 2011 ali 2019 in this type of wf the rainwater neither recharges the groundwater nor flows as a runoff the blue wf refers to the consumption of blue water resources surface and groundwater along the supply chain of a product the grey wf on the other hand is defined as the volume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants based on natural background concentration and existing ambient water quality standards hoekstra et al 2011 ali 2019 the total wfs of ethiopia is accounted by 97 green wf 2 blue wf and 1 grey wf for crop production 5 blue wf and 95 grey for industrial production 10 blue wf and 90 grey wf for domestic water supply mekonnen and hoekstra 2011c the total annual wfs of ethiopia for the period between1996 and 2005 have been estimated to be 77 8 billion m3 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011c the green wf which is used by plants from rainfall stored as soil moisture accounted for 98 of the total the remaining 2 of the wf was from the use of surface and groundwater for agriculture industry and domestic water supply these studies focused on quantifying the wf of crop production at global regional and national levels studies of wf at a river basin scale using data collected from within the basin are very crucial for structured and effective water management practices however such studies are non existent in ethiopia this study at the upper awash basin is therefore the first of its kind in ethiopia the headwater of the awash river starts at the central ethiopian highlands at an altitude of 3000 m a s l some 100 km west of addis ababa and drains southeastward until it reaches the main ethiopian rift mer at the koka reservoir the river then flows northeastward following the general ne sw orientation of the rift bounding and within rift faults and eventually discharges into lake abhe at the ethio djibouti border keraga et al 2017 gedefaw et al 2019 the upper awash basin characterized by diverse climatic conditions topographic features and agricultural practices is the most intensively utilized river basin in ethiopia adane et al 2020a b the water resources in the upper awash basin are very much stressed due to rapid population growth industrialization pollution and intensification of agricultural activities in and surrounding the major urban centers including addis ababa modjo and adama this leads to water scarcity and presents serious challenges in water allocation and distribution among various users gedefaw et al 2019 applying the wf concept will therefore enable us to characterize the relationships among these stressors water use pollution and scarcity and will provide new perspectives to better management of the water resources in the basin the study aims at assessing spatial and temporal variation of wfs of dominant crops grown in the upper awash basin by characterizing the rainy season i e the onset end and length of the wet spells as well as the soil moisture reserves of a particular area in order to determine the exact length of growing periods lgp of crops in addition the spatial variation of wfs of the basin have been mapped and relationships of the total wf versus crop yield and crop evapotranspiration etc versus total wfs have been characterized our novel approach utilizes a limited amount of locally measured data set including climate parameters soil type yields fertilizer application rate among others to characterize the wfs of dominant crops via considering the onset cessation of rainfall season wet spell length and length of growing periods in a data scarce basin past wf measurements at national level used global data sets e g allen et al 1998 and the results tend to over or under estimate the wfs for different crops our approach shows that accurate determination of the length of growing period using locally measured data set is crucial in accurate characterization of the twfs in a basin our novel approach could be a useful tool in determining wfs in other parts of the world where locally measured data are scarce careful vetting of the scare data set for their resolution internal consistency and duration as well as proper selection of the dominant cultivated crops in the basin are important preconditions to replicate our approach 2 data sources 2 1 climate data the climate of the awash basin is influenced by the inter tropical convergence zone itcz getahun and haj 2015 which is a zone of low pressure marking the convergence of the dry tropical easterlies and the moist equatorial westerlies the seasonal rainfall distribution within the basin results from the annual migration of the itcz getahun and haj 2015 the upper awash basin comprises relatively higher elevations in the southwest and lower elevation areas of the rift in the southeast fig 1 the climate data are obtained from the national meteorological agency nma of ethiopia wonji shoa sugar factory metehara sugar factory debrezeit and melkassa agricultural research centers these include mean maximum and minimum temperatures c mean temperature c relative humidity sunshine hours wind speed at 2 m height in m s or km day and rainfall mm a summary of the rainfall and temperature records is shown in table 1 additional climate data are presented in supplementary fig s1 mean annual air temperature and evapotranspiration increases from the west debrezeit to the east metehara rainfall occurs mainly in two different seasons a short rainy season february may and a long rainy season june september locally named as belg and kiremt respectively the climate analysis is computed based on the dekadal 10 days records of climatological elements the standard meteorological dekads represent periods of ten days for the first two dekads between the 1st and 10th and the 11th and 20th days respectively in each month and 8 9 10 or 11 days for the last dekad of the month wmo 1967 adane et al 2020b this is indicated in supplementary table s1 the tukey fence method was used to screen the outliers and a double mass curve method was used to test the homogeneity of the rainfall data respectively this preliminary step analysis was done in adane et al 2020b 2 2 soil and crop yield data physical properties of the dominant soils soil groups bulk density the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp percentages are collected from the archives of the research centers sugar state companies and verified following the fc pwp ranges in allen et al 1998 the details of the soil data are given in supplementary tables s2 s5 aggregated crop yields at zonal level and consumption of fertilizers per area of croplands are obtained from the database of the central statistical agency csa of ethiopia the data from eastern showa zone where the study sites located was used in this study in addition data was collected from local agricultural research centers and extension services and the sugar corporation research and development center of ethiopia the debrezeit area is known for intensive cultivation of the indigenous ethiopian crop teff in the wonji and metehara areas maize is mostly cultivated especially during the kiremt season sorghum is also commonly cultivated in the dryland areas in and around melkassa area in this study maize is considered as a common rainfed crop in all the four areas of study in addition to the dominant types of crops in a specific area furthermore irrigated sugarcane plantations in the wonji and metehara areas are the major crops in the upper awash basin the wonji shoa sugar cane estate farm covers more than 12 800 ha of irrigated land nigussie et al 2017 and metehara has a 10 230 ha areal coverage in the study basin degefa et al 2017 the sugar cane early maturing with lgp of 14 months and late maturing of 20 or 24 months was considered for wf analysis on the other hand though fruits and vegetables could have an important wf particularly from the upper awash agro industry and other small scale community farms appropriate data with the resolution and time period matching those of the other crops at the center of this study are not available as a result the wf of vegetables and fruits are not incorporated in this study 3 methods various methods and approaches are used to determine the onset end and length of the wet spells and the length of growing period lgp some methods use daily and others dekadal or monthly data to characterize the rainfall distribution within a river basin 3 1 data analysis water footprint wfblue wfgreen wfgray of the upper awash basin was computed by analyzing the reference evapotranspiration eto using the penman monteith method as well as the effective rainfall crop water requirements and irrigation requirements of specific crops the cropwat model version 8 0 was used as decision support for analyzing the above parameters and matlab r2020a software was used to plot graphs of the analysis the local data elevation latitude and longitude and climatic data were then used as input in the cropwat model the fao penman monteith equation was used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 using eq 1 most of the input parameters minimum temperature maximum temperature relative humidity sunshine hour duration and wind speed were measured at local climate stations 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g υ 900 υ 273 u 2 e s e a δ υ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto reference evapotranspiration mm dekad rn

surface runoff deep percolation or evaporation only part of the rainfall can be effectively used by the crop depending on its root zone depth and the soil storage capacity one of the most commonly used methods to compute effective rainfall is the usda soil conservation service mls 1980 as given in eqs 2 and 3 2 p eff p 125 0 2 3 p 125 f o r p 250 3 3 p eff 125 3 0 1 p f o r p 250 3 where peff effective dependable rainfall mm dekad and p dependable rainfall mm dekad 3 2 characterization of the rainy season the rainy season in terms of the onset end and lgp for some selected crops teff in debrezeit maize in melkassa and metehara and sorghum in melkassa has been characterized the rainfall characterization was based on the dominant type of crop however maize is also considered a common crop in all four areas the crop water requirements of the selected crops during their initial growth stages were used to determine the onset of the wet spell for specific season moreover the end of a wet spell dekad is defined as a dekad with a cumulative rainfall of less than or equal to the dekadal water requirements of each crop during the late growing stage adane et al 2020b these results are later used for analyzing the spatio temporal variation of the wfs of different crops the beginning onset and end of the wet spell periods were analyzed using eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 p o k c i n i t

from allen et al 1998 the lgp is defined as the period between the onset and end of the wet spell dekads and the number of dekads it takes to evapotranspire the moisture reserve in the topsoil depth the fao 1978 assumes an additional 100 mm moisture reserve to be added with the period of length of wet spells this assumption is for the ideal crop and it is not soil specific in this study lgp for crops commonly grown in the study areas were computed by considering the dominant soil types vertisols in the debrezeit area a1 and ba2 black and brown soils of fine textured clay in the wonji area clay loam and sandy loam in the melkassa area and clay and clay loamy soil in the metehara area wonji shoa sugar state factory 2000 isayas and tafesse 2003 tate 2009 the soil moisture reserve after the cessation of rainfall that the crop can utilize within one meter depth known as the readily available water was considered hence the period required to evapotranspire the readily available water was added to the period between the onset and end of wet spells to determine the total lgp using eqs 6 and 7 6 lws p e p o 7 lgp l w s m reserve where lws length of wet spells and mreserve moisture reserve in a soil the variability of lgp was analyzed using the coefficient of variability cv over years eq 8 8 cv sd x where sd standard deviation and x mean lgp the moisture reserve within the soil that extends the growing period beyond the rainy season was computed based on the total available water within the root zone total available water taw and the readily available water that can be utilized by the crops readily available water raw however the plantation date and the lgp of different sugarcane varieties was collected from ethiopian sugar corporation research and development center therefore there was no need for computing the taw raw and lws for irrigated crops due to lack of data about the effective root zone depth for various crops under rainfed conditions the depth of root zone in this study was taken from savva and frenken 2002 which have made detail analysis on eastern and southern africa by considering the minimum depth for different crops grown under fully irrigated conditions as the depth of root zone for rainfed conditions depth of root zone for millet under rainfed condition was used as root depth for teff 1 0 m furthermore an effective root zone depth of 1 0 m was considered for both maize and sorghum allen et al 1998 savva and frenken 2002 the managerial allowable depletion mad for the selected crops teff maize and sorghum was assumed to be 55 savva and frenken 2002 the readily available water raw within one meter depth was taken as the soil moisture reserve after the cessation of rainfall that the crop can utilize eqs 9 and 10 allen et al 1998 9 taw 1000 θ fc θ pwp z r 10 raw m a d t a w where taw total available soil water in the root zone mm θfc water content at field capacity m3 m 3 θpwp water content at wilting point m3 m 3 and

includes the sum of blue green and grey water footprints eq 11 11 w f total w f blue w f green w f grey where wftotal wf of crop production m3 ton wfblue blue wf m3 ton wfgreen green wf m3 ton and wfgrey grey wf m3 ton the green water use of a crop cwugreen m3 ha is the volume of total rainfall that is actually used for evapotranspiration by the crop etc over the complete growing period it is estimated using eq 12 12 cw u green 10 t 1 n min e t c p eff the blue water use of a crop cwublue m3 ha also called the irrigation water requirement is the difference between the seasonal crop

added to convert mm into m3 ha the application of nitrogen fertilizer contributes to the highest proportion of pollutants in water duan et al 2016 therefore grey water use of crop is computed with the assumption of application of nitrogen fertilizer throughout the entire growth stage the grey water use of a crop cwugrey m3 ha 1 is the volume of water that is required to dilute the nitrate leached to the groundwater to the desired level cwugrey is estimated using eq 14 14 cw u grey α a r c max c net where ar amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied kgha 1 to the specific crop throughout the

central statistical agency csa for the rainfed crops and from the ethiopian sugar corporation research and development center for the irrigated sugarcane plantations in wonji and metehara 3 4 trend analysis of lgp and twfs the mann kendall mk trend analysis method which is the most widely used test for assessing time series trends in hydro meteorological studies karpouzos et al 2010 shadmani et al 2012 gocic and trajkovic 2013 ali et al 2019 adane et al 2020b was used to test the trends of the lgp and twfs over different time series for the time series of x1 x2 xn the mk test statistics s mann 1945 kendall 1957 for the green blue and grey wf and twf of consecutive years can be calculated using eq 18 18 s i 1 n 1 j k 1 n sign x j x i the variance of s is then computed using eq 19 19 var s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 t f t f t 1 2 f t 5 where t varies over the set of tied ranks and ft is the number of times i e frequency the rank t appears while n represents the sample size the standard normal test statistics z is calculated using eq 20 20 z s 1 s e s 0 0 s 0 s 1 s e s 0 where se square root ofvar a positive negative value ofzindicates that the data tend to increase decrease with time the null hypothesis of no trend can be rejected with a 95 confidence i e with 5 probability of wrongly rejecting the hypothesis if z 1 96 or p value of the mk test statistics is below 0 05 furthermore sen s slope estimation q2 was carried out to analyze the magnitude of a trend in the time series gocic and trajkovic 2013 adane et al 2020a this test provides a strong trend estimation when the trend cannot be estimated by other statistical approaches like kendall s test statistics or regression adane et al 2020a the positive results of q2 in the twf represent an increasing trend while the negative values represent decreasing trends over a given time 4 results 4 1 onset end and length of wet spells adane et al 2020b have characterized the rainfall season onset end and lws of the upper awash basin for the selected crop types table 2 the mean onset of the growing period during the main rainy season kiremt occurred at the end of dekad 17 june 11 20 in debrezeit wonji and melkassa areas and dekad 19 july 1 10 in the metehara area an early withdrawal of rainfall was observed in metehara in dekad 25 september 1 10 4 2 lgp of crops the total lgp for the rainfed condition was determined by adding the period required to evapotranspire the raw to the period between the onset and end of the wet spell table 3 and fig 2 the moisture reserves in the soils in a meter depth were estimated to be 110 0 mm in debrezeit 74 3 mm and 68 8 mm in wonji 100 0 mm in melkassa and 72 6 mm and 61 1 mm in metehara table 3 and see supplementary tables s2 s5 for more details the maximum moisture reserve in a soil depth is expected to stay for 28 days in debrezeit and the shortest about 15 days in metehara table 3 the available moisture reserve in soil which extends the growing period after the rainfall ceased allows an extended lgp of 140 days in the debrezeit area and a short lgp of 75 days in the metehara area table 3 and fig 2 the lgp in the metehara area during the main rainy season kiremt does not show the real span of the growing period and more supplemental irrigation is required to support the lgp in this area the lgp of sugarcane for late maturing cane in the wonji and metehara areas ranges between 18 and 24 and 18 20 months respectively on the other hand 14 15 months are required for early maturing sugarcane in both areas the crop coefficient kc values used by both sugar estates for quantifying the water requirement during initial mid season and late season stages are 0 55 1 05 and 0 7 respectively in this study maximum and minimum lgp ranges were used to quantify the twf of sugarcane in both farms at a 5 significance level our result does not allow us to determine that there is a trend in lgp with a reasonable degree of certainty i e 95 over the period 1977 2010 in the upper awash basin table 4 this implies that the lgps of dominant rainfed crop trends are not serially correlated over time in the basin the no trend hypothesis in mk signifies that the data are independent and identically distributed in the given period gilbert 1987 mann 1945 these findings agree with the rainfall characterization in the upper awash basin by adane et al 2020b who found out that the lws excluding the soil moisture reserves has a non significant trend at a 5 level in all areas of the basin except at the debreziet station in the debrezeit station the lws showed an increasing trend only when rainfall is considered a determinant factor sen s slope test q2 results also show a decline in lgp by 0 3 days season in the melkassa and metehara areas table 4 the lgp trends could be affected by other agricultural and water management practices such as crop variety selection fertilizer application and moisture conservation practices which improve the water use efficiency and yield and in turn contribute to the reduction of wfs in the basin tuninetti et al 2018 investigated the global wfs of some crops wheat maize rice and soyabean and found significant positive trends in crop yield and a non significant evapotranspiration pattern for the studied crops our results that show non significant trend of the lgp which is mainly driven by evapotranspiration agrees with the findings on the global average evapotranspiration trends of selected crops 4 3 wfs of crops 4 3 1 rainfed crops the average annual wfs of the dominant rainfed crops over a period of 11 years 2000 2010 vary from the highest at the debreziet area 4205 m3 ton for teff 1940 m3 ton for maize to the lowest at the wonji area 1752 m3 ton for maize table 5 on the other hand though the low rainfall in the metehara area cannot produce a crop yield there is a green and grey water use green cwu and grey wu in the early growth stages fig 3 the average annual green and grey cwu of metehara area for maize are 2316 m3 ha and 573 m3 ha respectively however to sustain an optimal yield production in this area 2688 m3 ha of blue water demand bwd is required either from the surface or sub surface water sources table 5 and fig 3 except in the metehara area the green wfs under rainfed conditions account for the highest proportions in supporting the growth of crops with 90 87 and 86 of the total wf requirements in the debrezeit melkassa and wonji areas respectively the green wf is higher in the main rainy season kiremt which coincides with the main growing periods of crops between june and september teff in the debrezeit area has an extended lgp and requires more blue water 1157 m3 ha to fully satisfy the deficit from the available rainfall amount similarly sorghum in the melkassa area requires 1039 m3 ha additional water to satisfy the consumptive uses fully however no irrigation practice has been observed for the crops in the study areas and rely on rainfed for these rainfed crops except in metehara yields are harvested under deficit conditions as they require more blue water for optimal harvests the average annual bwd for maize crops is lower 701 m3 ha in the debrezeit than in the metehara 2688 m3 ha with intermediate values in the melkassa 1323 m3 ha and wonji 902 m3 ha areas table 5 the average annual grey wf which is the minimum volume of water used to dilute nitrogen fertilizer applied for enhancing the vegetation growth and subsequently leached to the groundwater range from 10 for maize and 13 for teff in the debrezeit area 14 for maize in the wonji area and 13 for both sorghum and maize in the melkassa area table 5 4 3 2 wf for irrigated crop sugarcane the sugarcane farms at wonji and metehara which cover an area of 23 000 ha mostly use surface irrigation systems while wonji shoa sugar estate additionally use an overhead sprinkler irrigation system the annual average twf during the 2000 2010 period ranges from 125 to 212 m3 ton in wonji and 117 to 167 m3 ton in metehara the ranges representing the short and long lgp variety sugarcanes table 6 though the short lgp sugarcane variety sc 2 in wonji has the least coefficient of variation cv in twf 11 3 with deviation from the mean of 14 2 m3 ton all the sugarcane varieties in both farms show comparable cvs in wf ranging only between 11 3 and 13 6 and limited standard deviation ranges between the short lgp 14 to 16 m3 ton and long lgp 22 7 to 26 2 m3 ton sugarcane varieties table 6 on the other hand the sugarcane at wonji both short and long lgp varieties show higher green wf as a result of the extended rainfall period compared to the sugarcane both the short and long lgp varieties at metehara in contrast both the sugarcane varieties at metehara show more blue consumptive water use and relatively higher blue wf fig 4 as they require more irrigated water due to the high crop evapotranspiration rate in the area based on the findings of this study the estate farms are recommended to grow a low twf sugar cane variety sc 2 and sc 4 in the water stressed upper awash basin a lower twfs in irrigated sugar cane 117 212 m3 ton compared to rainfed crops are observed in the upper awash basin this indicates that there is a possibility to raise the green water productivity in the basin mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 the confidence interval ci with a significance of 0 05 i e a confidence level of 95 for the annual average twfs of the time series 2000 2010 are indicated for both estate farms in table 6 4 4 twf vs etc relations the twf vs etc linear regression for the rainfed conditions see supplementary fig s3 show slightly decreasing trend in the debrezeit and slightly increasing trends in wonji and melkassa areas similar regression for the irrigated sugarcane see supplementary fig s4 show slightly increasing trends in both wonji and metehara the etc of maize shows no statistically significant trend in the debrezeit wonji and melkassa areas see supplementary table s6 while in metehara it shows a statistically significant decreasing trend with a magnitude of sen s slope of 10 6 mm growing season the reduction in etc for the rainfed crops in the melkassa and metehara areas could indicate the scarcity of available rainfall and requires extra blue water bwd to supplement the rainfed crops in the basin likewise for the irrigated sugarcane the etc shows a significant decreasing trend z 2 49 only in the metehara farm see supplementary table s6 the variability in etc of crops in the basin is primarily driven by climatic eto and plant conditions degree of surface cover and their interactions in line with various factors such as soil characteristics physical chemical and hydraulic conditions and soil water availability among others irmak 2017 5 discussion 5 1 temporal variation of wfs all the wfs show some inter annual variability for different crops under rainfed and irrigated conditions in the four study areas fig 3 fig 5 and fig 6 adane et al 2020b investigated the variability in rainfall and length of wet spells in a time series between 1980 and 2010 across the upper awash basin and found out that the rainfall variability is responsible for variation in wet spell lengths consequently this could influence the twfs of different crops across the basin under rainfed conditions more green and less grey wfs were noticed in the entire study area fig 5 in 2002 nearly all the study sites were under moisture stress and the annual wf components show more blue water was required to sustain the optimal agricultural productivity in the basin fig 5 in 2002 rainfall failed in both the small belg and main kiremt rainy seasons in many parts of the country including the study area due to el nino induced drought mera 2018 in 2004 more blue water was needed to support the sorghum and maize crops in the melkassa area fig 5d e during the 2007 2009 period the wfs of irrigated sugarcane in wonji experienced the highest wf in the range of 241 252 m3 ton sc 1 and 142 147 m3 ton sc 2 with an annual average yield of 153 ton ha fig 6 a low yield 129 137 ton ha below the expected average resulted in higher twfs of the sugarcane however in metehara relatively lower twfs of 149 163 m3 ton sc 3 and 106 109 m3 ton sc 4 were recorded in 2007 2009 with an average yield of 184 ton ha implying relatively better water consumption with lower wfs and higher yield therefore these twf variabilities indicate variation in yield and consumptive use in the basin fig 6 further these variabilities in the wfs in different time scales are attributed to the inter annual variabilities in effective rainfall amounts the reference evapotranspiration and agricultural inputs like fertilizer consumption the fertilizer application urea from 2000 to 2010 were 32 87 kg ha for teff 51 62 kg ha for maize 48 76 kg ha for sorghum and 200 kg ha for sugarcane which are mainly associated with grey wf the mk trend test and sen s slope estimation for twfs of rainfed and irrigated crops show a significant monotonic decrease at p 0 03 in the debrezeit teff and metehara areas 20 months lgp sugarcane with the sen s slope of 208 and 4 7 m3 ton at 5 significance level table 7 and supplementary fig s2 furthermore the twfs of maize in the debrezeit wonji and melkassa areas show decreasing trends though they are not statistically significant with the magnitude of trends of 48 13 2 and 33 5 m3 ton respectively table 7 the irrigated fields of sugarcane exhibited an increasing trend in twfs in wonji and a decreasing trend in metehara for both short and long lgp sugarcane varieties however the trends are statistically significant only in the long lgp sc 3 variety table 7 this decline in twfs is due to the combined influence of higher yield in some crops like maize 1 8 3 1 ton ha and lower yield 0 8 1 3 ton ha in teff or the effect of lower crop evapotranspiration etc demand which results in lower green wf 5 2 spatial variation of wfs the spatial variation in climatic conditions soil type lgp and fertilizer consumption resulted in a significant variation in wfs across the study areas the evapotranspiration rate is high in the eastern part of the upper awash basin with a late onset and early termination of the main rainfall season adane et al 2020b therefore the rainfall in the metehara area representing the eastern part of the upper awash basin cannot support the entire growing season without irrigation blue water see fig 3 different areas require different amounts of blue water for instance for rainfed maize production an additional blue water of 1179 m3 ha in melkassa 902 m3 ha in wonji and 701 m3 ha in debrezeit areas is required hence the bwd is higher in the eastern part of the basin compared to the available green water during the main rainy season on the other hand the spatial distribution of green wfs is higher in the western part of the upper awash basin represented by the debrezeit wonji and melkassa stations as compared to the blue and grey wfs figs 5 7 this is attributed to the higher amount of rainfall during the rainy season in these areas as higher rainfall enhances the availability of green water resources in the form of rainwater stored in the soil as soil moisture ali 2019 5 3 determinant factors of twfs in the upper awash basin water footprints in the upper awash basin show temporal and spatial variations see figs 5 7 these variations in twfs could be attributed to various climatic and non climatic parameters which affect the eto the hydrological conditions dryness wetness crop type lgp agricultural inputs and management practices yirga 2007 has identified a decline in soil quality due to loss of top soil over 100 tons ha and net soil nutrient extraction from agricultural land 16 2 kg ha from flat areas and 56 7 kg ha from slopping areas of the central highlands which includes the western part of the upper awash basin contributing to a significant yield reduction of rainfed crops in addition haileslassie et al 2006 found out that the nutrient balance on the central highlands of ethiopia is negative in teff leading to low yields these studies also recommend integrated soil fertility management use of inorganic fertilizer and soil conservation practices stone soil bunds in order to enhance crop yields in the basin yirga 2007 a lower yield and high consumptive use of water for rainfed crops contribute to a higher twf resulting at least partly due to poor water management practices in the basin sun et al 2013 stated that climatic variations have a direct influence on crop evapotranspiration etc and crop yield per area and has also an indirect effect on the twf of a crop in a region the twf of rainfed crops assumes the blue wf as zero and is a function of eto and effective rainfall and mainly affects the green wf in line with the climatic factors various agricultural inputs like fertilizer application use of machinery etc and management practices dry planting mulching intercropping etc could significantly improve the water productivity crop yield and then the twf of a crop in a basin sun et al 2013 therefore these factors mentioned by sun et al 2013 and irmak 2017 could influence the variation in etc and twf of the upper awash basin however data on management practices and agricultural input apart from amount of fertilizer input at station level are not available to make a comparison on the relative effects of these parameters on the twf in the upper awash basin the relationship between twfs and crop yield fig 8 shows high twf of teff in the debrezeit area corresponds to low yield which could be attributed to the high average green wf 3648 m3 ton and consumptive use etc of water 420 mm period of teff this is in agreement with studies that show teff to be a low yield crop compared to other cereals produced in ethiopia lee 2018 on the other hand maize has relatively lower twfs and higher yields compared to other rainfed crops sorghum and teff in the basin fig 8 the annual average twf for maize across the basin decreases from the deberezeit to melkassa then to wonji however the annual average etc is higher in melkassa 428 mm period than in debrezeit 363 mm period maize yield variation in small scale farms in sub saharan africa has been attributed to variation in environmental conditions and local management practice including variation in sowing date spacing weeding and fertilizer doses sileshi et al 2010 sadras et al 2015 furthermore rockström 2003 and mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a indicated that the general trend between water footprint and yield of cereals follows a logarithmic function similar to what is observed in the upper awash basin fig 8 and argued that agricultural management practices could play a more significant role than agro climatic conditions in determining the wfs though our conclusion cannot be empirically supported due to the lack of data on agricultural management practices at station level in the upper awash basin the wf vs crop yield relationship strongly suggests an important influence of the agricultural input and management practices on the wf of maize and other cereal crops sorghum and teff this implies improving water productivity i e producing more food per unit of water consumption can decrease twfs 5 4 upper awash basin versus global and regional wfs the twfs for various crops computed in the upper awash basin show a significant difference with twf values calculated in other works e g mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a b c table 8 in addition to the fact that the previous works were conducted at global regional and country scale see table 8 while the current study was at a sub basin scale these differences might also reflect the different study periods considered the variation in the length of wet spell period the soil types and climatic parameters we need also to emphasize that our study has the advantage of using locally measured data in each study site for many of our parameters while mekonnen and hoekstra 2011a used the aquastat crop data for computing global average water footprints mekonnen and hoekstra 2011b c estimated the twf of maize and sorghum for ethiopia to be 4237 m3 ton and 5007 m3 ton respectively while these values were much lower at a global scale table 8 our results for the rainfed crops maize sorghum and teff are generally comparable with the respective global wfs but significantly vary from the wfs determined at the national level on the other hand the estimated wfs for two long lgp varieties of irrigated sugar cane sc 1 and sc 3 both in the metehara and wonji areas matched with the global and national estimates mekonnen and hoekstra 2011b 2011c while our estimates for short lgp varieties sc 2 and sc 4 show much lower twfs compared to the global and national estimates table 8 the discrepancies in the wf estimates could be due to the different spatial scales considered in the different studies these discrepancies also suggest that the basin scale studies with actual non averaged climate and crop yield data could better quantify the spatial wf variations and can contribute to formulate site specific water management practices and to develop long term strategies and policies on a broader scale our novel approach and results could contribute to a better use and management of the available green water for increasing food production in a region where food security which is also one of the un sustainable development goals sdg 2 end hunger achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture lartey 2015 is a priority objective it has been established that the agricultural sector takes the biggest share 70 of the global freshwater withdrawal while the remaining 30 is shared by the domestic and industrial sectors fader et al 2011 molden et al 2010 un water 2021 in sub saharan africa a region which in most cases is food insecure and water stressed more than 95 of the available green water soil moisture reserve exclusively from precipitation is used by rainfed agriculture rockström et al 2007 schuol et al 2008 at a global scale green water is primarily used to produce food for global consumption falkenmark rockström 2006 sulser et al 2010 except in south asian countries where blue water irrigation also significantly contributes to food production however the blue water resources in the southeast asian countries are mostly from unsustainable groundwater sulser et al 2010 in the face of increasing demand for freshwater resources from the domestic and industrial sectors environmental flows as well as other agricultural activities than crop production such as livestock rearing water resource planners decision makers are increasingly focused on the blue water under estimating the potential of green water to sustain agricultural production at the same time coping with frequent extreme climate change impacts schuol et al 2008 our approach can be used to characterize wfs in many parts of the world such as sub saharan africa where such studies are rare our approach of characterizing wfs using a specific case study in a water stressed food insecure data scarce sub basin could serve as a tool for decision making in the prioritization of green or blue water for agricultural use 6 conclusions the following key findings are drawn from this study on the wfs of dominant rainfed and irrigated crops in the upper awash basin for the period 2000 2010 1 under rainfed conditions teff and sorghum have relatively higher twfs compared to maize under the same climate and environmental conditions in the debreziet and melkassa areas the basin mainly depends on green water resources that sustain rain fed agriculture 2 grey wf from agricultural lands is relatively small compared to blue and green wfs in the upper awash basin however this is only assuming leached nitrogen fertilizers as the major sources of pollutants grey wf might be higher if other pollutants such as phosphorus fertilizers and pesticides are considered 3 the western part of the upper awash basin the debrezeit melkassa and wonji areas has lower blue water demands for maize compared to the eastern part of the basin the metehara area 4 teff the staple crop in many parts of ethiopia has higher wfs compared to sorghum and maize implying that wfs could be lowered if less water intensive varieties can be developed or it is substituted by smaller wf crops 5 the long lgp irrigated sugarcane varieties in wonji and metehara have significantly higher twfs compared to the short lgp varieties preferential cultivation of the early maturing sugarcane varieties could therefore effectively decrease the twfs in the basin 6 the spatial and temporal variations in wfs in the upper awash basin are not related to a single climatic or non climatic parameter rather to a combination of parameters including the lws lgp fertilizer consumption soil types and agricultural management practices 7 twfs in the basin could significantly decrease if less water intensive high yield crops are adopted while rainfed agriculture is supported by efficient irrigation water management systems 8 characterizing wfs at basin and sub basin scales using actual measured non averaged data could give more accurate results which could be more relevant for developing well informed regional and national freshwater resource management policies instead of relying on global and regional scale

3522,urban flood risk assessment is an important tool for urban disaster management the current research mainly considered area itself as the evaluation object urban road networks are extremely vulnerable to floods as a basis for all socio economic activities in the city however most studies on road environmental risk assessment only took road itself as the evaluation object and did not consider potential regional system risks such as traffic jam caused by road inundation based on this this study proposes a spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra conceptual model that comprehensively considers the spontaneous risk sr caused by the subregional hazard socio economic exposure and triggered risk tr from the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption caused by the road inundation in the evaluated subregion taking haidian island in haikou as an example six indices were selected for the sr assessment based on the combined weight gray fuzzy comprehensive risk assessment method the maximum mean inundation depth of road rmd maximum inundation duration of road rid road betweenness centrality rbc and number of road bus lines rbl were selected for the tr assessment total flood risk fr of the study area was obtained by combining the two the results indicate that compared with the traditional sr the highest and higher risk subregions are more concentrated in the study area center and the risk of the outer ring subregions is reduced overall after considering the tr according to statistics the fr level of 68 subregions is lower than the sr level most of which are in the outer ring of the study area and the fr level of 17 subregions is higher than the sr level most of which are located around the intersection of haidian fifth road and people road the study outcomes provide a novel approach for flood risk assessment keywords urban flood risk assessment combined weight spontaneous risk triggered risk pcswmm 1 introduction in recent decades due to climate change and the acceleration of urbanization urban floods have become a more common global problem lian et al 2017 chen et al 2021 xu et al 2020 from 1995 to 2015 there were around 3 100 floods which affected 2 3 billion people worldwide with overall damages of usd 662 billion cred and unisdr 2015 in 2016 more than 78 million people worldwide were affected by floods and economic losses amounted to usd 56 billion costache et al 2020a by 2050 68 of the world s population is expected to live in cities un 2018 which will significantly increase the risk of flooding in cities as an urban lifeline system key urban infrastructures play a significant role in the response to inundation and post disaster recovery of a whole city liu and song 2020 as an important urban infrastructure road network is the basic carrier of urban economic operation which directly affects the stable development of the urban social economy but it is extremely vulnerable to flooding chen et al 2019 on july 21 2012 a serious inundation disaster occurred in beijing 95 roads were interrupted ground transportation was forced to be paralyzed and the direct economic loss was usd 1 8 billion guo et al 2020 at 5 00 pm on september 13 2013 during the peak off duty period shanghai encountered a short duration heavy rainstorm which caused rainwater accumulation and flooding in nearly 100 roads in the urban area and many routes failed and were paralyzed hu et al 2018 in august 2017 the extreme rainfall caused by hurricane harvey caused severe traffic interruptions in houston in harris county alone more than 60 000 residents were trapped because they could not be rescued gori et al 2020 in 2018 101 railways and 48 179 highways were interrupted due to floods in china resulting in huge losses to social and economic life fcdrhc and mwrc 2019 in view of the above problems some scholars have actively conducted studies on road flood risk that systematically consider the road environment urban road networks are essentially non homogeneous topological structures and the importance of each edge in the network is different zhang and yao 2019 therefore failure of each edge after being attacked will cause a different extent of reduction in social operation efficiency shabou et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2018a selected three important factors namely link vulnerability edge criticality and resilience of the auxiliary paths to assess road flood risk in order to help obtain the safest rescue route casali et al 2019 analyzed the changes in node betweenness centrality edge betweenness centrality and closeness centrality of the road network under different flood events to determine the most critical position of the road network however a single network topology measurement can only provide a simple representation of the system structure and lacks road disaster information and system details such as user needs and routing selection wang et al 2020 papilloud et al 2020 the traffic flow of flooded roads will spread to other roads causing all or part of the traffic network to be blocked thereby increasing the travel time and cost chakraborty et al 2018a zhu et al 2018 considered road flooding depth and traffic flow to predict flood risks and road traffic conditions at different times and locations under different rainfall conditions chen et al 2019 used the road inundation depth number of lanes and annual average daily traffic volume to obtain the flood risk level pérez morales et al 2019 used the road cost matrix to determine the best location for a new emergency management center according to road accessibility most of these studies considered the road itself as an evaluation object however roads connect all areas of a city as the skeleton of the city when a flood of a larger spatial scale affects the road network it will lead to the deterioration of the traffic operation environment and reduction of the network connectivity which will affect the normal operation of the urban social economy serre and heinzlef 2018 meanwhile the geographical and physical interdependence between the region and the road network will increase this risk wang et al 2020 based on this this study proposes a spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra conceptual model considering regional road environment in the stra conceptual model risk from cross subregional traffic jam and interruption caused by road inundation is regarded as an important part of the overall risk and is quantified according to the multi attributes of road network the urban flood risk assessment is carried out by integrating the spontaneous risk sr caused by the subregion s own disaster and socio economic exposure and the triggered risk tr caused by the road environment the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 construct a multi index system of urban flood risk assessment based on the stra conceptual model 2 establish quantitative evaluation methods for sr and tr respectively and propose a coupled evaluation model for the total regional flood risk 3 put forward a combined weight gray fuzzy comprehensive risk assessment method to calculate the risk value of each subregion 4 verify the proposed method and quantify the flood risk of haidian island haikou city 2 materials and methods 2 1 stra conceptual model the urban road network is the foundation of all socio economic activities in the city but it is easily submerged by flooding at present most of the urban flood risk assessments that consider the road environment only consider the road itself as the evaluation object zhang and yao 2019 papilloud et al 2020 yin et al 2016 and few studies further consider the secondary risks brought by the geographical and physical interdependence between the subregions and the road network meanwhile the commonly used risk assessment frameworks such as hazard exposure vulnerability h e v driving forces pressure state impact response dpsir etc only take the area itself as the evaluation object and do not systematically consider road environmental factors based on this this study proposes a spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra conceptual model the framework consists of spontaneous risk sr and triggered risk tr the overall framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 1 spontaneous risk spontaneous risk sr refers to the flood risk caused by the interaction of hazard factors and regional socio economic exposure the urban population and gdp are the most important components of socio economic exposure however disaster losses are generally counted in cities such as casualties and direct economic losses santos et al 2020 in this study the hazard indices maximum mean inundation depth md proportion of maximum inundation area pa maximum mean flow velocity mv and socio economic exposure indices population density dpp poi density dpoi building density db were selected for sr assessment sr is calculated by eq 1 1 r sr s 1 m ω s p s where rsr denotes the sr risk value ωs denotes the weight assigned to sr index s ps denotes the score of sr index s and m denotes the total number of sr indices 2 1 2 triggered risk triggered risk tr refers to the risk from the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption caused by the road inundation in the evaluated subregion more attention should be paid to the subregions with which cause an obvious reduction in urban operation efficiency for example flooded key roads will hinder the transportation of other connected subregions resulting in the failure of disaster prevention manpower and facilities to arrive on time and the obstruction of normal traffic and medical treatment pérez morales et al 2019 dong et al 2020a these may disrupt normal socio economic life and cause casualties which greatly increase the potential flood risk in the subregions where the flooded roads are located li et al 2019a therefore this study considers the adverse effects caused by the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption and regards tr as an important part of the overall subregional risk assessment tr is mainly affected by the hazard and exposure of roads chakraborty et al 2018b therefore it is assessed by comprehensively considering the road network hazard indices expressed by the maximum mean inundation depth of road rmd and maximum inundation duration of road rid the structural exposure index quantified by the road betweenness centrality rbc and the functional exposure index quantified by the road bus lines rbl the maximum mean inundation depth of road rmd m as a hazard index refers to the mean value of the maximum inundation depth for all inundation grids of each road and the maximum inundation duration of road rid refers to the maximum value of the inundation duration for all inundation grids of each road which are calculated as follows 2 rmd g 1 n m d g n 3 rid max 1 g n i d g where mdg denotes the maximum inundation depth of the road inundation grid g idg denotes the inundation duration of the road inundation grid g and n denotes the total number of inundation grids included in the road rmd and rid directly affect residents travel and traffic conditions if the inundation depth is greater and the duration is longer road flooding is more serious and the road is more likely to be interrupted road betweenness centrality rbc is an important index of road structure exposure quantified by the network method papilloud et al 2020 it is defined by the number of shortest paths going through a road as follows 4 rbc 1 n n 1 o d σ od r σ od where σod is the number of shortest paths from subregion o to subregion d σod r is the number of shortest paths from o to d that pass through road r and n is the total number of subregions rbc reflects the connectivity of road sections in the road network roads with higher rbc values tended to have higher usage rates and higher traffic flows if these roads are interrupted by flooding they will have a higher potential to fragment the road network into clusters and cause traffic paralysis which will hinder disaster prevention therefore the subregions with roads with high rbc values have a higher tr the number of road bus lines rbl is a functional exposure index for roads compared with traffic flow and other data bus lines were easier to obtain the distribution of urban bus lines is generally coordinated with the travel needs of residents which can directly reflect the functional importance of the road section tr was calculated as follows first the flood risk of each road in the study area was calculated using eq 5 5 r road r ω 1 r m d ω 2 r i d ω 3 r b c ω 4 r b l where rroad r denotes the road risk value and ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 denote the weights assigned to rmd rid rbc and rbl respectively the tr of each subregion is obtained by linear weighting of road risk values around the evaluated subregion based on the length of each road which was specifically calculated as follows 6 r tr r 1 t l r r road r l where rtr denotes the tr risk value lr denotes the length of road r rroad r denotes the road risk value of road r l denotes the sum of all road lengths in the evaluated subregion l r 1 t l r and t denotes the total number of roads in the evaluated subregion based on the risk values rsr and rtr of sr and tr the total subregional flood risk fr was obtained from eq 7 7 r fr α r sr β r tr where rfr rsr and rtr denote the risk values of fr sr and tr respectively α and β denote the corresponding weight of each item respectively and their values are determined according to the characteristics of study area 2 2 flood risk assessment based on combined weight gray fuzzy method currently the main challenges of flood risk assessment are fuzziness and uncertainty akter et al 2019 fuzzy mathematics is widely used because of its advantages in solving complex and uncertain problems cai et al 2019 lv et al 2020 proposed a composite fuzzy matter element and entropy weight model to evaluate the flood risk of zhengzhou city fariza et al 2020 applied the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to determine the urban flood risk level of sidoarjo however this method has the defects of an unclear membership function and an artificially determined threshold li et al 2019b existing studies have combined the gray evaluation method to reduce the uncertainty of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method dong et al 2020a yin et al 2020 feng et al 2019 in addition the assignment of index weights is crucial to risk assessment results rehman et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the subjective weighting method and objective weighting method are commonly used at present and each has its advantages and disadvantages zou et al 2020 the subjective weighting method is greatly affected by experts cognitive level and exhibits strong randomness the objective weighting method is mainly affected by the characteristics of data distribution without considering the practical significance of the indices lin et al 2020 this study adopted a combination of subjective and objective weight determination methods 2 2 1 calculation of the combined weights the combined weight method can make full use of experts knowledge and experience and explore the inherent laws of data to guarantee the rationality of the results and reduce randomness zou et al 2020 in this study the subjective weight determination adopted the analytic hierarchy process ahp tahmasebi birgani and yazdandoost 2018 ogato et al 2020 darabi et al 2020 which includes four steps establishment of a hierarchical model construction of a judgment matrix calculation of the weight of each layer and consistency check costache et al 2020b the objective weight determination adopted the improved entropy weight method which determines the index weight according to the amount of information contained in each evaluation index it overcomes the limitation of the traditional entropy weight method when the entropy value of each index approaches 1 the small gap between the entropy values will cause the entropy weight to change exponentially su et al 2018 the calculation formulas are as follows 8 ω j 1 h ω 0 j h ω 1 j h j 1 0 h j 1 9 ω 1 j 1 h h j k 1 h k 1 q 1 h h k j 1 2 q where ω j denotes the weight of the improved entropy weight method hj denotes the entropy value of index j h denotes the average of all entropy values that are not 1 ω 0 j denotes the weight of the traditional entropy weight method and q denotes the number of indices the index weights are calculated based on the ahp and the improved entropy weight method and the combined weight is obtained by linear weighting of the results 10 ω j 1 γ ω j γ ω j where ω j ω j and ω j denote the combined weight the weight determined by ahp and the weight determined by the improved entropy weight method respectively and γ denotes the ratio of the weight of the improved entropy method in the combination weighting in order to reduce the influence of subjective factors γ is calculated according to the variance coefficient approach liu et al 2018 the calculation formula is as follows 11 γ q q 1 2 q ω 1 2 ω 2 q ω q q 1 q where ω 1 ω 2 ω q denote the weight values of the ahp arranged from small to large and q denotes the number of indices 2 2 2 gray fuzzy evaluation the gray fuzzy evaluation method replaces the degree of membership by solving the distance between the index value and the optimal value to avoid the shortcomings of strong subjectivity of fuzzy evaluation dong et al 2020b feng et al 2019 the basic steps are as follows step 1 for m evaluated objects and n evaluation indices the initial data matrix f is constructed 12 f f 11 f 12 f 1 n f 21 f 22 f 2 n f m 1 f m 2 f mn where fij denotes the jth evaluation index value of the ith evaluated object step 2 dimensionless treatment of indices and determination of the optimal index set assuming that the maximum and minimum values of the ith index are f j max and f j min respectively dij is obtained by the dimensionless treatment of fij 13 d ij f ij f j min f j max f j min the optimal index set is determined by the ideal object d denoted by d d 1 d 2 d n usually the optimal value of the jth index in all subjects is taken as the value of d j 14 d j max i d ij the j th index has a positive impact min i d ij t h e j t h i n d e x h a s a n e g a t i v e i m p a c t step 3 calculate the gray correlation coefficient using the optimal index set d as the reference sequence and the index value d i d i 1 d i 2 d in of any evaluated object as the comparison sequence the correlation coefficient rij between dij and the optimal index d j is solved which is the membership degree the membership matrix r r im m n is obtained 15 r ij min i min j δ d ij ρ max i max j δ d ij δ d ij ρ max i max j δ d ij 16 δ d ij d j d ij where ρ 0 1 generally takes 0 5 is called the resolution coefficient step 4 calculate the flood risk the weight vector w ω 1 ω 2 ω n is combined with the membership matrix r r ij m n this study used a multiplication operator to obtain the flood risk value of each evaluated object 17 b w r t b 1 b 2 b m 2 3 determination of flood risk levels the classification of flood risk levels usually requires artificially setting thresholds which leads to a subjective influence on the risk assessment results to solve this problem the natural breakpoint method was used to classify flood risk levels the natural breakpoint method uses clustering thinking the similarity values can be optimally grouped and the differences between the classes can be maximized shi et al 2019 however clustering does not focus on the number and range of elements in each class while the natural breakpoint method also considers that the range and number of elements in each group should be as close as possible costache et al 2020b dodangeh et al 2020 2 4 sensitivity analysis of indices weights the combined weight is a combination of subjective and objective methods and its results are still affected by the preferences of decision makers to a certain extent in this study the one at a time oat method was used to analyze the stability of the results to index weights changes to verify the robustness of the results by selecting one major variation index at a time and changing its weight first the range of percent change rpc and increment of percent change ipc of weight need to be determined then the weights of other indices are adjusted in proportion to ensure that the sum of all weights is always 1 finally the weight sensitivity is analyzed by calculating the mean of the absolute change rate macr 18 m a c r c m p c k 1 n 1 n r k c m p c r k 0 r k 0 100 where macr cm pc is the mean of the absolute change rate of risk in the entire study area when the weight of the major variation index cm changes pc n is the total number of subregions in the study area rk cm pc is the comprehensive flood risk assessment result in the subregion k after the cm weight is changed rk0 is the initial flood risk assessment result of subregion k 2 5 case study 2 5 1 study area haidian island is located in the northern part of haikou in hainan province china and is adjacent to the qiongzhou strait as shown in fig 2 the three bridges century bridge people bridge and peace bridge connect haidian island

constructed by the research group xu et al 2018 road network layer this is the basic data used to quantify the indices related to roads it was obtained from openstreetmap osm the major road network in this study consisted of 317 vertices and 486 edges based on this the road inundation grids were extracted by superimposing the road network layer with the pcswmm simulation results and the shortest paths between the subregions were calculated using the path analysis function in arcgis 10 1 bus lines basic data to quantify the functional indices of roads the information on bus lines and stations came from the gaode open platform 2 5 3 quantification of the indices this study fully considered the influence of roads buildings and pipe network distribution on the rainwater confluence process and divided the study area into 207 subregions by block the distribution of sr indices md pa mv dpp dpoi and db were obtained through spatial analysis in gis and the results are shown in fig 3 the road network was divided into 317 vertices and 486 edges with road intersections as nodes the distribution of tr indices rmd rid rbc and rbl were obtained through path statistics and analysis in gis and the results are shown in fig 4 the basic data required for dpp dpoi db rbc and rbl were obtained through the gaode open platform satellite remote sensing image and open street map md pa mv rmd and rid were obtained using pcswmm the parameters of the pcswmm model were calibrated by trial and error and the ranges recommended in relevant studies zhang and li 2015 tobio et al 2015 in this study the multi point inundation data of the rammasun typhoon in 2014 were used to calibrate the model a comparison between the simulated inundation depth of the model and the observed value is presented in table 1 the error values between observations and simulations were lower than 0 1 m and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value is 0 725 yang et al 2013 and dechmi et al 2012 proposed that the simulations were considered satisfactory when nse 0 5 therefore the fitting accuracy of the model satisfies the requirements the model is feasible and can be applied to simulate flooding scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 weight calculation results first the improved entropy weight method was used to determine the target weight according to the degree of variability within the index tables 2 and 3 then the ahp was applied to determine the relative significance of each index we invited 10 experts in the field of urban flooding and asked them to rank the significance of sr indices md pa mv db dpp dpoi and tr indices rmd rid rbc rbl based on the significance of flood risk indices obtained from experts knowledge and experience the judgment matrices of the indices were determined tables 4 and 5 among them the sr indices consistency ratio cr 0 02 0 1 and the tr indices consistency ratio cr 0 01 0 1 therefore the judgment matrices are reasonable lyu et al 2018 tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the inconsistency between the improved entropy weights and ahp weights for example when affected by the topography of the study area the inundation is relatively concentrated and the md values of the inundation area change little therefore the md has a lower weight in the improved entropy method however because of its greater impact on flood risk the weight calculated using the ahp method is greater therefore it is unreasonable to determine the weight using only subjective or objective methods in this study we adopted the combined weight of the improved entropy weight method and ahp the final index weights are listed in tables 2 and 3 3 2 distribution characteristics of flood risk in this study both α and β were 0 5 which means that sr and tr have the same impact on haidian island and through the above calculation the spatial distribution maps of fr sr and tr were obtained as shown in fig 5 fig 5 a shows that there are 36 subregions at the highest risk of fr accounting for 12 04 of the total area mainly distributed in the subregions along the haidian third road haidian fifth road people road and peace road in the middle east of the study area and around the intersection of yawei river and baisha river the subregions along the four roads mentioned above are important commercial and economic belts with dense population and commerce and these areas are flat and difficult to drain which will cause serious inundation in addition the rbc and rbl values of the four roads were higher because they were arterial roads and close to the center of the road network the subregions around the intersection of the yawei river and baisha river have low terrain and a certain slope so md and mv are both high residential buildings and some commercial buildings were built along the rivers increasing the exposure of these areas to urban floods at the same time roads crossing the river were built once flooded the travel time of the residents is greatly increased the higher risk area covers approximately 17 36 of the total area and most of them are also distributed along the above four arterial roads close to the highest risk subregions the west north and southeast coastal areas had lower flood risk levels overall the high risk areas are concentrated in the center of the study area and the flood risk in the southeast was higher than that in the northwest the spatial distributions of sr and tr are shown in fig 5 b c comparing fig 5 a it can be seen that compared with sr after considering tr the fr risk level of some subregions far from the arterial roads of the study area center is reduced such as areas d1 and d2 while the fr risk level of the subregions around the arterial roads especially around the intersection of the arterial roads has increased such as area d3 according to statistics the fr level of 68 subregions is lower than the sr level mostly located in the outer ring part of the study area the fr level is higher than the sr level in 17 subregions most of which are around the intersection of haidian fifth road and people road overall compared with sr fr high risk areas are more concentrated in the arterial roads such as haidian third road haidian fifth road people road peace road and century road while the overall fr risk level in the outer ring of the island is lower than that in sr in the past disaster prevention decisions were made based on sr results alone the outer and central subregions of haidian island all have higher risk levels and disaster prevention needs to be prioritized however the rbc and rbl of the roads in the central area of haidian island are all high and the corresponding tr is high therefore after considering the impact of the regional road environment the central area should be given priority for disaster prevention only in this way can the traffic obstruction caused by the inundation of key roads be reduced ensuring smooth traffic flow enables disaster relief manpower and equipment to be delivered to the required areas in time which can reduce the risk of flooding in the entire region and improve regional disaster prevention capability 3 3 sensitivity analysis the range of percent change rpc and increment of percent change ipc of the index weights are 30 and 2 respectively each index is selected as the main change factor and the mean absolute change rate macr of the sr and tr evaluation results under a certain percent change pc of each index weight were obtained as shown in fig 6 according to the macr the order of the sr indices was md pa dpp dpoi db mv among them md had the largest weight and the strongest sensitivity with a maximum macr value of 1 74 the order of the tr indices according to the value of macrs was rid rbc rmd rbl the weight of the rid ranks third among the four indices but it is the most sensitive to the results and its maximum macr value is 1 14 when its weight change percentage is 16 the first 36 subregions sorted by risk value remain unchanged but the internal order changes when the index weight changes beyond its stable range it will have a certain impact on decision making which should be paid more attention the weight of the rmd is the largest among the tr indices but it is less sensitive to the results overall the macr value of each index is all far below the weight change rate of 30 indicating that the overall risk assessment result is relatively stable guo et al 2019 to determine the impact more intuitively on the ranking of the final scheme when the weight of each index changes we sorted out the ranking of the evaluation results when the weight changes of each index had the greatest impact on the results considering the top 36 based on the number of the highest risk areas in the initial result as shown in fig 7 the different color blocks represent different subregions the darker the color the higher the order of the subregions in the initial result the white blocks indicate that they did not enter the top 36 in the initial results as the figure shows the ranking of the risk assessment results changed to a certain extent with the change in the index weights but the overall trend consistency is relatively high compared with the initial result there are at most three differences among the top 36 subregions so the proposed method is more robust 4 conclusion this study proposes a conceptual framework for spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra it aims to carry out a more comprehensive risk assessment of urban flooding by systematically considering the sr caused by the subregional hazard and socio economic exposure and the tr from the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption caused by the road inundation in the evaluated subregion first md pa mv dpoi dpp and db were selected to quantify sr rmd rid rbc and rbl were selected to quantify tr the risk values of sr and tr were calculated based on the combined weight gray fuzzy method the equal weight method was used to linearly weigh sr and tr to obtain the comprehensive flood risk fr according to the assessment results the natural breakpoint method was used to divide the risk levels finally the sensitivity of the model was analyzed by changing the index weight taking haidian island as an example the study results indicate that fr fully considers sr and tr and its high risk areas are mainly distributed in areas with dense business and population high traffic flow low terrain and serious flooding such as the subregions along the haidian third road haidian fifth road people road and peace road compared with sr the highest and higher risk subregions of fr are more concentrated in the center of the study area and the risk in the outer ring areas is reduced overall the results can help to carry out comprehensive flood management of high risk areas and their road environment more specifically and accurately in the study area the stra framework has a simple structure and comprehensive assessment content it not only combines the advantages of the most used hazard exposure vulnerability framework but also innovatively proposes the tr concept which intuitively reflects the two main sources of regional flood risks however the two sub frameworks contained in the framework require a large amount of index data and the evaluation results depend on the availability and accuracy of the index data in the future with the further development of big data and other technologies such as population thermal maps night light data real time traffic data etc a more comprehensive index system and more accurate urban flood risk assessment results will be obtained credit authorship contribution statement chao ma conceptualization investigation methodology resources supervision writing review

3522,urban flood risk assessment is an important tool for urban disaster management the current research mainly considered area itself as the evaluation object urban road networks are extremely vulnerable to floods as a basis for all socio economic activities in the city however most studies on road environmental risk assessment only took road itself as the evaluation object and did not consider potential regional system risks such as traffic jam caused by road inundation based on this this study proposes a spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra conceptual model that comprehensively considers the spontaneous risk sr caused by the subregional hazard socio economic exposure and triggered risk tr from the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption caused by the road inundation in the evaluated subregion taking haidian island in haikou as an example six indices were selected for the sr assessment based on the combined weight gray fuzzy comprehensive risk assessment method the maximum mean inundation depth of road rmd maximum inundation duration of road rid road betweenness centrality rbc and number of road bus lines rbl were selected for the tr assessment total flood risk fr of the study area was obtained by combining the two the results indicate that compared with the traditional sr the highest and higher risk subregions are more concentrated in the study area center and the risk of the outer ring subregions is reduced overall after considering the tr according to statistics the fr level of 68 subregions is lower than the sr level most of which are in the outer ring of the study area and the fr level of 17 subregions is higher than the sr level most of which are located around the intersection of haidian fifth road and people road the study outcomes provide a novel approach for flood risk assessment keywords urban flood risk assessment combined weight spontaneous risk triggered risk pcswmm 1 introduction in recent decades due to climate change and the acceleration of urbanization urban floods have become a more common global problem lian et al 2017 chen et al 2021 xu et al 2020 from 1995 to 2015 there were around 3 100 floods which affected 2 3 billion people worldwide with overall damages of usd 662 billion cred and unisdr 2015 in 2016 more than 78 million people worldwide were affected by floods and economic losses amounted to usd 56 billion costache et al 2020a by 2050 68 of the world s population is expected to live in cities un 2018 which will significantly increase the risk of flooding in cities as an urban lifeline system key urban infrastructures play a significant role in the response to inundation and post disaster recovery of a whole city liu and song 2020 as an important urban infrastructure road network is the basic carrier of urban economic operation which directly affects the stable development of the urban social economy but it is extremely vulnerable to flooding chen et al 2019 on july 21 2012 a serious inundation disaster occurred in beijing 95 roads were interrupted ground transportation was forced to be paralyzed and the direct economic loss was usd 1 8 billion guo et al 2020 at 5 00 pm on september 13 2013 during the peak off duty period shanghai encountered a short duration heavy rainstorm which caused rainwater accumulation and flooding in nearly 100 roads in the urban area and many routes failed and were paralyzed hu et al 2018 in august 2017 the extreme rainfall caused by hurricane harvey caused severe traffic interruptions in houston in harris county alone more than 60 000 residents were trapped because they could not be rescued gori et al 2020 in 2018 101 railways and 48 179 highways were interrupted due to floods in china resulting in huge losses to social and economic life fcdrhc and mwrc 2019 in view of the above problems some scholars have actively conducted studies on road flood risk that systematically consider the road environment urban road networks are essentially non homogeneous topological structures and the importance of each edge in the network is different zhang and yao 2019 therefore failure of each edge after being attacked will cause a different extent of reduction in social operation efficiency shabou et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2018a selected three important factors namely link vulnerability edge criticality and resilience of the auxiliary paths to assess road flood risk in order to help obtain the safest rescue route casali et al 2019 analyzed the changes in node betweenness centrality edge betweenness centrality and closeness centrality of the road network under different flood events to determine the most critical position of the road network however a single network topology measurement can only provide a simple representation of the system structure and lacks road disaster information and system details such as user needs and routing selection wang et al 2020 papilloud et al 2020 the traffic flow of flooded roads will spread to other roads causing all or part of the traffic network to be blocked thereby increasing the travel time and cost chakraborty et al 2018a zhu et al 2018 considered road flooding depth and traffic flow to predict flood risks and road traffic conditions at different times and locations under different rainfall conditions chen et al 2019 used the road inundation depth number of lanes and annual average daily traffic volume to obtain the flood risk level pérez morales et al 2019 used the road cost matrix to determine the best location for a new emergency management center according to road accessibility most of these studies considered the road itself as an evaluation object however roads connect all areas of a city as the skeleton of the city when a flood of a larger spatial scale affects the road network it will lead to the deterioration of the traffic operation environment and reduction of the network connectivity which will affect the normal operation of the urban social economy serre and heinzlef 2018 meanwhile the geographical and physical interdependence between the region and the road network will increase this risk wang et al 2020 based on this this study proposes a spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra conceptual model considering regional road environment in the stra conceptual model risk from cross subregional traffic jam and interruption caused by road inundation is regarded as an important part of the overall risk and is quantified according to the multi attributes of road network the urban flood risk assessment is carried out by integrating the spontaneous risk sr caused by the subregion s own disaster and socio economic exposure and the triggered risk tr caused by the road environment the specific objectives of this study are as follows 1 construct a multi index system of urban flood risk assessment based on the stra conceptual model 2 establish quantitative evaluation methods for sr and tr respectively and propose a coupled evaluation model for the total regional flood risk 3 put forward a combined weight gray fuzzy comprehensive risk assessment method to calculate the risk value of each subregion 4 verify the proposed method and quantify the flood risk of haidian island haikou city 2 materials and methods 2 1 stra conceptual model the urban road network is the foundation of all socio economic activities in the city but it is easily submerged by flooding at present most of the urban flood risk assessments that consider the road environment only consider the road itself as the evaluation object zhang and yao 2019 papilloud et al 2020 yin et al 2016 and few studies further consider the secondary risks brought by the geographical and physical interdependence between the subregions and the road network meanwhile the commonly used risk assessment frameworks such as hazard exposure vulnerability h e v driving forces pressure state impact response dpsir etc only take the area itself as the evaluation object and do not systematically consider road environmental factors based on this this study proposes a spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra conceptual model the framework consists of spontaneous risk sr and triggered risk tr the overall framework is shown in fig 1 2 1 1 spontaneous risk spontaneous risk sr refers to the flood risk caused by the interaction of hazard factors and regional socio economic exposure the urban population and gdp are the most important components of socio economic exposure however disaster losses are generally counted in cities such as casualties and direct economic losses santos et al 2020 in this study the hazard indices maximum mean inundation depth md proportion of maximum inundation area pa maximum mean flow velocity mv and socio economic exposure indices population density dpp poi density dpoi building density db were selected for sr assessment sr is calculated by eq 1 1 r sr s 1 m ω s p s where rsr denotes the sr risk value ωs denotes the weight assigned to sr index s ps denotes the score of sr index s and m denotes the total number of sr indices 2 1 2 triggered risk triggered risk tr refers to the risk from the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption caused by the road inundation in the evaluated subregion more attention should be paid to the subregions with which cause an obvious reduction in urban operation efficiency for example flooded key roads will hinder the transportation of other connected subregions resulting in the failure of disaster prevention manpower and facilities to arrive on time and the obstruction of normal traffic and medical treatment pérez morales et al 2019 dong et al 2020a these may disrupt normal socio economic life and cause casualties which greatly increase the potential flood risk in the subregions where the flooded roads are located li et al 2019a therefore this study considers the adverse effects caused by the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption and regards tr as an important part of the overall subregional risk assessment tr is mainly affected by the hazard and exposure of roads chakraborty et al 2018b therefore it is assessed by comprehensively considering the road network hazard indices expressed by the maximum mean inundation depth of road rmd and maximum inundation duration of road rid the structural exposure index quantified by the road betweenness centrality rbc and the functional exposure index quantified by the road bus lines rbl the maximum mean inundation depth of road rmd m as a hazard index refers to the mean value of the maximum inundation depth for all inundation grids of each road and the maximum inundation duration of road rid refers to the maximum value of the inundation duration for all inundation grids of each road which are calculated as follows 2 rmd g 1 n m d g n 3 rid max 1 g n i d g where mdg denotes the maximum inundation depth of the road inundation grid g idg denotes the inundation duration of the road inundation grid g and n denotes the total number of inundation grids included in the road rmd and rid directly affect residents travel and traffic conditions if the inundation depth is greater and the duration is longer road flooding is more serious and the road is more likely to be interrupted road betweenness centrality rbc is an important index of road structure exposure quantified by the network method papilloud et al 2020 it is defined by the number of shortest paths going through a road as follows 4 rbc 1 n n 1 o d σ od r σ od where σod is the number of shortest paths from subregion o to subregion d σod r is the number of shortest paths from o to d that pass through road r and n is the total number of subregions rbc reflects the connectivity of road sections in the road network roads with higher rbc values tended to have higher usage rates and higher traffic flows if these roads are interrupted by flooding they will have a higher potential to fragment the road network into clusters and cause traffic paralysis which will hinder disaster prevention therefore the subregions with roads with high rbc values have a higher tr the number of road bus lines rbl is a functional exposure index for roads compared with traffic flow and other data bus lines were easier to obtain the distribution of urban bus lines is generally coordinated with the travel needs of residents which can directly reflect the functional importance of the road section tr was calculated as follows first the flood risk of each road in the study area was calculated using eq 5 5 r road r ω 1 r m d ω 2 r i d ω 3 r b c ω 4 r b l where rroad r denotes the road risk value and ω 1 ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 denote the weights assigned to rmd rid rbc and rbl respectively the tr of each subregion is obtained by linear weighting of road risk values around the evaluated subregion based on the length of each road which was specifically calculated as follows 6 r tr r 1 t l r r road r l where rtr denotes the tr risk value lr denotes the length of road r rroad r denotes the road risk value of road r l denotes the sum of all road lengths in the evaluated subregion l r 1 t l r and t denotes the total number of roads in the evaluated subregion based on the risk values rsr and rtr of sr and tr the total subregional flood risk fr was obtained from eq 7 7 r fr α r sr β r tr where rfr rsr and rtr denote the risk values of fr sr and tr respectively α and β denote the corresponding weight of each item respectively and their values are determined according to the characteristics of study area 2 2 flood risk assessment based on combined weight gray fuzzy method currently the main challenges of flood risk assessment are fuzziness and uncertainty akter et al 2019 fuzzy mathematics is widely used because of its advantages in solving complex and uncertain problems cai et al 2019 lv et al 2020 proposed a composite fuzzy matter element and entropy weight model to evaluate the flood risk of zhengzhou city fariza et al 2020 applied the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to determine the urban flood risk level of sidoarjo however this method has the defects of an unclear membership function and an artificially determined threshold li et al 2019b existing studies have combined the gray evaluation method to reduce the uncertainty of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method dong et al 2020a yin et al 2020 feng et al 2019 in addition the assignment of index weights is crucial to risk assessment results rehman et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the subjective weighting method and objective weighting method are commonly used at present and each has its advantages and disadvantages zou et al 2020 the subjective weighting method is greatly affected by experts cognitive level and exhibits strong randomness the objective weighting method is mainly affected by the characteristics of data distribution without considering the practical significance of the indices lin et al 2020 this study adopted a combination of subjective and objective weight determination methods 2 2 1 calculation of the combined weights the combined weight method can make full use of experts knowledge and experience and explore the inherent laws of data to guarantee the rationality of the results and reduce randomness zou et al 2020 in this study the subjective weight determination adopted the analytic hierarchy process ahp tahmasebi birgani and yazdandoost 2018 ogato et al 2020 darabi et al 2020 which includes four steps establishment of a hierarchical model construction of a judgment matrix calculation of the weight of each layer and consistency check costache et al 2020b the objective weight determination adopted the improved entropy weight method which determines the index weight according to the amount of information contained in each evaluation index it overcomes the limitation of the traditional entropy weight method when the entropy value of each index approaches 1 the small gap between the entropy values will cause the entropy weight to change exponentially su et al 2018 the calculation formulas are as follows 8 ω j 1 h ω 0 j h ω 1 j h j 1 0 h j 1 9 ω 1 j 1 h h j k 1 h k 1 q 1 h h k j 1 2 q where ω j denotes the weight of the improved entropy weight method hj denotes the entropy value of index j h denotes the average of all entropy values that are not 1 ω 0 j denotes the weight of the traditional entropy weight method and q denotes the number of indices the index weights are calculated based on the ahp and the improved entropy weight method and the combined weight is obtained by linear weighting of the results 10 ω j 1 γ ω j γ ω j where ω j ω j and ω j denote the combined weight the weight determined by ahp and the weight determined by the improved entropy weight method respectively and γ denotes the ratio of the weight of the improved entropy method in the combination weighting in order to reduce the influence of subjective factors γ is calculated according to the variance coefficient approach liu et al 2018 the calculation formula is as follows 11 γ q q 1 2 q ω 1 2 ω 2 q ω q q 1 q where ω 1 ω 2 ω q denote the weight values of the ahp arranged from small to large and q denotes the number of indices 2 2 2 gray fuzzy evaluation the gray fuzzy evaluation method replaces the degree of membership by solving the distance between the index value and the optimal value to avoid the shortcomings of strong subjectivity of fuzzy evaluation dong et al 2020b feng et al 2019 the basic steps are as follows step 1 for m evaluated objects and n evaluation indices the initial data matrix f is constructed 12 f f 11 f 12 f 1 n f 21 f 22 f 2 n f m 1 f m 2 f mn where fij denotes the jth evaluation index value of the ith evaluated object step 2 dimensionless treatment of indices and determination of the optimal index set assuming that the maximum and minimum values of the ith index are f j max and f j min respectively dij is obtained by the dimensionless treatment of fij 13 d ij f ij f j min f j max f j min the optimal index set is determined by the ideal object d denoted by d d 1 d 2 d n usually the optimal value of the jth index in all subjects is taken as the value of d j 14 d j max i d ij the j th index has a positive impact min i d ij t h e j t h i n d e x h a s a n e g a t i v e i m p a c t step 3 calculate the gray correlation coefficient using the optimal index set d as the reference sequence and the index value d i d i 1 d i 2 d in of any evaluated object as the comparison sequence the correlation coefficient rij between dij and the optimal index d j is solved which is the membership degree the membership matrix r r im m n is obtained 15 r ij min i min j δ d ij ρ max i max j δ d ij δ d ij ρ max i max j δ d ij 16 δ d ij d j d ij where ρ 0 1 generally takes 0 5 is called the resolution coefficient step 4 calculate the flood risk the weight vector w ω 1 ω 2 ω n is combined with the membership matrix r r ij m n this study used a multiplication operator to obtain the flood risk value of each evaluated object 17 b w r t b 1 b 2 b m 2 3 determination of flood risk levels the classification of flood risk levels usually requires artificially setting thresholds which leads to a subjective influence on the risk assessment results to solve this problem the natural breakpoint method was used to classify flood risk levels the natural breakpoint method uses clustering thinking the similarity values can be optimally grouped and the differences between the classes can be maximized shi et al 2019 however clustering does not focus on the number and range of elements in each class while the natural breakpoint method also considers that the range and number of elements in each group should be as close as possible costache et al 2020b dodangeh et al 2020 2 4 sensitivity analysis of indices weights the combined weight is a combination of subjective and objective methods and its results are still affected by the preferences of decision makers to a certain extent in this study the one at a time oat method was used to analyze the stability of the results to index weights changes to verify the robustness of the results by selecting one major variation index at a time and changing its weight first the range of percent change rpc and increment of percent change ipc of weight need to be determined then the weights of other indices are adjusted in proportion to ensure that the sum of all weights is always 1 finally the weight sensitivity is analyzed by calculating the mean of the absolute change rate macr 18 m a c r c m p c k 1 n 1 n r k c m p c r k 0 r k 0 100 where macr cm pc is the mean of the absolute change rate of risk in the entire study area when the weight of the major variation index cm changes pc n is the total number of subregions in the study area rk cm pc is the comprehensive flood risk assessment result in the subregion k after the cm weight is changed rk0 is the initial flood risk assessment result of subregion k 2 5 case study 2 5 1 study area haidian island is located in the northern part of haikou in hainan province china and is adjacent to the qiongzhou strait as shown in fig 2 the three bridges century bridge people bridge and peace bridge connect haidian island

they were obtained from the simulation results of the personal computer storm water management model pcswmm of haidian island under design rainfall with a return period of 50 years the model was constructed by the research group xu et al 2018 road network layer this is the basic data used to quantify the indices related to roads it was obtained from openstreetmap osm the major road network in this study consisted of 317 vertices and 486 edges based on this the road inundation grids were extracted by superimposing the road network layer with the pcswmm simulation results and the shortest paths between the subregions were calculated using the path analysis function in arcgis 10 1 bus lines basic data to quantify the functional indices of roads the information on bus lines and stations came from the gaode open platform 2 5 3 quantification of the indices this study fully considered the influence of roads buildings and pipe network distribution on the rainwater confluence process and divided the study area into 207 subregions by block the distribution of sr indices md pa mv dpp dpoi and db were obtained through spatial analysis in gis and the results are shown in fig 3 the road network was divided into 317 vertices and 486 edges with road intersections as nodes the distribution of tr indices rmd rid rbc and rbl were obtained through path statistics and analysis in gis and the results are shown in fig 4 the basic data required for dpp dpoi db rbc and rbl were obtained through the gaode open platform satellite remote sensing image and open street map md pa mv rmd and rid were obtained using pcswmm the parameters of the pcswmm model were calibrated by trial and error and the ranges recommended in relevant studies zhang and li 2015 tobio et al 2015 in this study the multi point inundation data of the rammasun typhoon in 2014 were used to calibrate the model a comparison between the simulated inundation depth of the model and the observed value is presented in table 1 the error values between observations and simulations were lower than 0 1 m and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value is 0 725 yang et al 2013 and dechmi et al 2012 proposed that the simulations were considered satisfactory when nse 0 5 therefore the fitting accuracy of the model satisfies the requirements the model is feasible and can be applied to simulate flooding scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 weight calculation results first the improved entropy weight method was used to determine the target weight according to the degree of variability within the index tables 2 and 3 then the ahp was applied to determine the relative significance of each index we invited 10 experts in the field of urban flooding and asked them to rank the significance of sr indices md pa mv db dpp dpoi and tr indices rmd rid rbc rbl based on the significance of flood risk indices obtained from experts knowledge and experience the judgment matrices of the indices were determined tables 4 and 5 among them the sr indices consistency ratio cr 0 02 0 1 and the tr indices consistency ratio cr 0 01 0 1 therefore the judgment matrices are reasonable lyu et al 2018 tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the inconsistency between the improved entropy weights and ahp weights for example when affected by the topography of the study area the inundation is relatively concentrated and the md values of the inundation area change little therefore the md has a lower weight in the improved entropy method however because of its greater impact on flood risk the weight calculated using the ahp method is greater therefore it is unreasonable to determine the weight using only subjective or objective methods in this study we adopted the combined weight of the improved entropy weight method and ahp the final index weights are listed in tables 2 and 3 3 2 distribution characteristics of flood risk in this study both α and β were 0 5 which means that sr and tr have the same impact on haidian island and through the above calculation the spatial distribution maps of fr sr and tr were obtained as shown in fig 5 fig 5 a shows that there are 36 subregions at the highest risk of fr accounting for 12 04 of the total area mainly distributed in the subregions along the haidian third road haidian fifth road people road and peace road in the middle east of the study area and around the intersection of yawei river and baisha river the subregions along the four roads mentioned above are important commercial and economic belts with dense population and commerce and these areas are flat and difficult to drain which will cause serious inundation in addition the rbc and rbl values of the four roads were higher because they were arterial roads and close to the center of the road network the subregions around the intersection of the yawei river and baisha river have low terrain and a certain slope so md and mv are both high residential buildings and some commercial buildings were built along the rivers increasing the exposure of these areas to urban floods at the same time roads crossing the river were built once flooded the travel time of the residents is greatly increased the higher risk area covers approximately 17 36 of the total area and most of them are also distributed along the above four arterial roads close to the highest risk subregions the west north and southeast coastal areas had lower flood risk levels overall the high risk areas are concentrated in the center of the study area and the flood risk in the southeast was higher than that in the northwest the spatial distributions of sr and tr are shown in fig 5 b c comparing fig 5 a it can be seen that compared with sr after considering tr the fr risk level of some subregions far from the arterial roads of the study area center is reduced such as areas d1 and d2 while the fr risk level of the subregions around the arterial roads especially around the intersection of the arterial roads has increased such as area d3 according to statistics the fr level of 68 subregions is lower than the sr level mostly located in the outer ring part of the study area the fr level is higher than the sr level in 17 subregions most of which are around the intersection of haidian fifth road and people road overall compared with sr fr high risk areas are more concentrated in the arterial roads such as haidian third road haidian fifth road people road peace road and century road while the overall fr risk level in the outer ring of the island is lower than that in sr in the past disaster prevention decisions were made based on sr results alone the outer and central subregions of haidian island all have higher risk levels and disaster prevention needs to be prioritized however the rbc and rbl of the roads in the central area of haidian island are all high and the corresponding tr is high therefore after considering the impact of the regional road environment the central area should be given priority for disaster prevention only in this way can the traffic obstruction caused by the inundation of key roads be reduced ensuring smooth traffic flow enables disaster relief manpower and equipment to be delivered to the required areas in time which can reduce the risk of flooding in the entire region and improve regional disaster prevention capability 3 3 sensitivity analysis the range of percent change rpc and increment of percent change ipc of the index weights are 30 and 2 respectively each index is selected as the main change factor and the mean absolute change rate macr of the sr and tr evaluation results under a certain percent change pc of each index weight were obtained as shown in fig 6 according to the macr the order of the sr indices was md pa dpp dpoi db mv among them md had the largest weight and the strongest sensitivity with a maximum macr value of 1 74 the order of the tr indices according to the value of macrs was rid rbc rmd rbl the weight of the rid ranks third among the four indices but it is the most sensitive to the results and its maximum macr value is 1 14 when its weight change percentage is 16 the first 36 subregions sorted by risk value remain unchanged but the internal order changes when the index weight changes beyond its stable range it will have a certain impact on decision making which should be paid more attention the weight of the rmd is the largest among the tr indices but it is less sensitive to the results overall the macr value of each index is all far below the weight change rate of 30 indicating that the overall risk assessment result is relatively stable guo et al 2019 to determine the impact more intuitively on the ranking of the final scheme when the weight of each index changes we sorted out the ranking of the evaluation results when the weight changes of each index had the greatest impact on the results considering the top 36 based on the number of the highest risk areas in the initial result as shown in fig 7 the different color blocks represent different subregions the darker the color the higher the order of the subregions in the initial result the white blocks indicate that they did not enter the top 36 in the initial results as the figure shows the ranking of the risk assessment results changed to a certain extent with the change in the index weights but the overall trend consistency is relatively high compared with the initial result there are at most three differences among the top 36 subregions so the proposed method is more robust 4 conclusion this study proposes a conceptual framework for spontaneous triggered risk assessment stra it aims to carry out a more comprehensive risk assessment of urban flooding by systematically considering the sr caused by the subregional hazard and socio economic exposure and the tr from the cross subregional traffic jam or interruption caused by the road inundation in the evaluated subregion first md pa mv dpoi dpp and db were selected to quantify sr rmd rid rbc and rbl were selected to quantify tr the risk values of sr and tr were calculated based on the combined weight gray fuzzy method the equal weight method was used to linearly weigh sr and tr to obtain the comprehensive flood risk fr according to the assessment results the natural breakpoint method was used to divide the risk levels finally the sensitivity of the model was analyzed by changing the index weight taking haidian island as an example the study results indicate that fr fully considers sr and tr and its high risk areas are mainly distributed in areas with dense business and population high traffic flow low terrain and serious flooding such as the subregions along the haidian third road haidian fifth road people road and peace road compared with sr the highest and higher risk subregions of fr are more concentrated in the center of the study area and the risk in the outer ring areas is reduced overall the results can help to carry out comprehensive flood management of high risk areas and their road environment more specifically and accurately in the study area the stra framework has a simple structure and comprehensive assessment content it not only combines the advantages of the most used hazard exposure vulnerability framework but also innovatively proposes the tr concept which intuitively reflects the two main sources of regional flood risks however the two sub frameworks contained in the framework require a large amount of index data and the evaluation results depend on the availability and accuracy of the index data in the future with the further development of big data and other technologies such as population thermal maps night light data real time traffic data etc a more comprehensive index system and more accurate urban flood risk assessment results will be obtained credit authorship contribution statement chao ma conceptualization investigation methodology resources supervision writing review

affected by water scarcity and over 1 7 billion people are living in watersheds where water use exceeds recharge united nations 2019 problems related to water food health and poverty are interconnected in many developing countries especially in areas where freshwater is a scarce resource however in places with abundant water resources the increasing demand for freshwater as well as water quality depletion can also lead to water shortages and scarcity due to unplanned population growth and economic development oki and kanae 2006 pressure on natural resources is steadily

sustainability was determined by calculating indexes that encompass the vulnerability the resilience and the reliability of a water supply the assessment employed discharge projections from a hydrological model to simulate future supply of freshwater while water demand scenarios were built based on public policy planning past experiences in brazil such as the dry summer of 2001 cavalcanti and kousky 2004 in which rainfall deficit reached 40 significantly reducing river streamflow and thus the country s hydropower capacity marengo et al 2014 have showed that regional climate change has potential to affect future water resources and power generation in the country marengo et al 2014 recently the southeast region of brazil the most populated and developed region within the country where the paraíba do sul river basin is located experienced a robust drought period which resulted in a severe hydric crisis especially due to existing unsatisfied water demands facing urbanization

the main phenomena that modulate its climate alves et al 2002 cuadra and rocha 2006 and scarce observations chou et al 2014 marengo et al 2014 highlighted that the dispersion of results in the assessment of potential climate change impacts on water resources are due to the structure of climate models uncertainties inherent to the knowledge of such phenomena the importance of developing reasonable scenarios is thereby emphasized to support risk assessment and decision making processes dessai et al 2009 2 study area brazil benefits from great water availability the brazilian territory has about 12 of all freshwater on the planet brazilian ministry of environment 2000 despite the expressive availability the distribution of water resources in brazil is quite unequal in geographic and population terms although the amazon region has 74 of the water share the amazon river basin is inhabited by less than 5 of the brazilian population which explains the low average use of the resource in the region brazilian water agency 2007 still in the brazilian context from a regional point of view the north has 68 of water resources and only 7 of the population the midwest has 16 of water resources and 6 of the population the south 7 of water resources and 15 of the population the northeast has only 3 of water resources and 29 of the brazilian population and the southeast where the paraíba do sul river basin is placed has 6 of water resources and 43 of the population including the three largest metropolitan areas brazilian ministry of environment 2000 in addition to the unequal distribution of water resources relative to population occupation water vulnerability has become even more relevant in brazil as severe droughts affect different regions of the country the northeast region has recorded periods of severe drought in recent years tortajada and fernandez 2018 the southeast region gained visibility from the water crisis that especially affected the two larger metropolitan areas of the country in 2014 2015 bringing the issue of water supply in the region to the center of a broad and complex national debate britto et al 2019 the water crisis was triggered by the lack of precipitation during the rainy season of 2014 2015 driven by atmospheric configurations associated to an extended atmospheric block coelho et al 2015 the paraíba do sul river has its headwaters in the state of são paulo and its water course runs through minas gerais and rio de janeiro states until it flows into the atlantic ocean at city of são joão da barra in rio de janeiro state fig 1 besides being a source of water supply for the two largest metropolitan areas in brazil the paraíba do sul river also supply freshwater for almost a million people in its drainage area coppetec 2007 important reservoirs of hydroelectric plants are located in the basin which produce almost 3 of the brazilian hydropower water conflicts in this area are mainly driven by agriculture and energy production water quality domestic use ioris 2008 kumler and lemos 2008 kelman 2015 ronquim et al 2017 as well as the two most significant water transfers to rio de janeiro and são paulo metropolitan areas brazilian water agency 2019 the decrease in water availability during the 2014 2015 drought period highlighted a multifaceted issue between the water supply for the rio de janeiro metropolitan area rjma and for other users located downstream in the lower paraíba do sul region fig 1 the reduced water flow in this region resulted in siltation of large river stretches changes in water quality and the increase extent of the saline wedge intrusion affecting the water supply in some municipalities cohidro 2014 such drought pushed the são paulo metropolitan area spma the largest metropolis in the country with nearly 22 million inhabitants to the edge of a profound water crisis millington 2018 the lack of precipitation strongly affected the main hydric system that supplies the spma the cantareira dam system the crisis also revealed the deficiency of são paulo s water system which led the federal government to implement a water transfer system from a neighbor basin the paraiba do sul river basin to increase water supply kelman 2015 as a result 5 m3 s were diverted from the paraiba do sul river at the jaguari reservoir to the atibainha reservoir located in the pcj watershed piracicaba capivari and jundiaí rivers fig 1 the primary responsible for spma water supply to relief the water stress in the system this water transfer enhanced the conflict between the rio de janeiro state government and the são paulo state government kelman 2015 the supply of the rjma which is the second largest metropolitan area in brazil with a population of 13 million inhabitants is also based on the particular diversion of waters from the paraíba do sul river basin to the guandu river basin fig 1 approximately 9 million people along with industries located in the rjma rely on water from this transfer the 2014 2015 crisis also emphasized the dependence of the rio de janeiro metropolitan area on the diverted water from the paraíba do sul river since the water supply for almost 90 of its population is exclusively provided by such transfer rio de janeiro state government 2018 apart from drinking water supply another significant share of the diverted water goes towards industry applications furthermore it must be noted that part of the transferred water volume is used to contain the advance of the saline wedge on the guandu river mouth rio de janeiro state government 2018 such panorama reveals the broader water conflicts that affect the paraiba do sul river basin even with annual streamflow of around 1 100 m3 s at the river mouth oliveira et al 2018 and annual precipitation totals of 1400 mm silva and simões 2014 yearly distributed among wet summers and dry winters rao and hada 1990 as a result many studies were carried out by the government and civil organizations proposing different policies for water resource management in the basin this study focused on the evaluation of public policies and how they can contribute for the paraíba do sul river basin s sustainability mainly considering severe drought conditions as depicted by some climate change scenarios 3 methodology scenarios of water supply and freshwater demand were constructed to analyze the long term suitability of a water system to keep providing the required safe yield until the end of the century in the light of climate change impacts future water availability was estimated using streamflow projections from the hydrological model mhd inpe distributed hydrological model national institute for space research on the other hand future water demand scenarios were built considering available public policy and proposed water management plans for both short and long runs the hydrological approach was coupled with climate models for temperature also until the end of the century in order to compare the performance of the water system under the proposed scenarios sustainability indexes were calculated as ipcc s specific warming levels swls were reached in other words as global mean temperatures increased the indexes were recorded for each scenario under different degrees of global warming here expressed as 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 celsius of temperature increment when compared to preindustrial levels fig 2 depicts the model chain approach utilized in the study this approach aims to evaluate the watershed response to climate pressures intended to distinguish impact levels of swls either from greenhouse gases concentrations or from fixed climate change periods alfieri et al 2017 impacts of global warming were evaluated in 30 year intervals centered around the year at which swls were reached for each model long term inertial effects of warming stabilization scenarios were not covered for climate predictions the use of rcp 8 5 projections was applied due to the forecast of 4 celsius of warming until the end of this century allowing the adoption of the three sets of swls over the course of the model simulations alfieri et al 2017 regardless of constraints and limitations such approach has been implemented in recent publications hirabayashi et al 2013 james and washington 2013 swain and hayhoe 2014 koutroulis et al 2016b alfieri et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2021 the paraíba do sul river basin was simplified as a conceptual water system fig 3 the scheme highlights the three main points of conflict first the upper paraíba do sul region and its water uses including the diversion to spma second the santa cecília diversion to the guandu watershed supplying water to rjma as well as restraining the saline wedge for industrial freshwater consumption finally the lower paraíba do sul region and its challenges to provide water resources for domestic agricultural and industrial uses as well as for restraining the saline wedge the study focused on the santa cecilia station a pumping station without reservoir capacity where the water is rerouted to the guandu watershed as the key place for water balance assessment 3 1 water availability scenarios hydrological historical simulations and future projections of water availability under climate change scenarios lima et al 2014 queiroz et al 2016 were used in this study for creating the future water supply scenarios on the region of study water availability was assessed by analyzing streamflows simulated with the hydrological model mhd inpe integrated at 10 km resolution distributed hydrological model national institute for space research rodriguez and tomasella 2016 mhd inpe model implementation and calibration were conducted using observed hydrometeorological data obtained from the national institute of meteorology the national institute for space research and from the national electric system operator for the calibration period from 1970 to 1990 authors shown an adequate performance of the model with nash sutcliffe coefficients above 0 71 in all stations analyzed lima et al 2014 queiroz et al 2016 for assessing the impact of climate change on water availability climate projections from five climate models were combined with the hydrological model namely geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory climate model version 2 1 gfdl cm2 1 milly and shmakin

community climate system model ccsm3 national center for atmospheric research 2004 these climate models have proven to adequately simulate the main features of south american climate vera and silvestri 2009 pesquero et al 2010 chou et al 2012 however there were bias in precipitation volumes across the continent gulizia and camilloni 2015 koutroulis et al 2016b for the hydrological simulations meteorological data simulated by global climate models gcms including precipitation were bias corrected using comparisons with observed data rainfall bias was corrected by applying the quartile quartile mapping method described by bárdossy and pegram 2011 climate projections are based on the special report on emissions scenarios sres a1b from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ipcc 2007 the scenario a1b utilized in this study is an intermediary scenario which represents medium level emissions knutti and sedlacek 2013 widely used for sustainable hydrosystems assessments tzabiras et al 2016 khajeh et al 2017 in terms of radiative forcing the scenario sres a1b has an intermediary behavior between representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 and rcp 4 5 being close to rcp 6 ipcc 2014 according to the ipcc 2014 differences between the sres and the rcps are largely due to the inclusion of the wider range of emissions assessed over south america differences between cmip3 and cmip5 projections regarding inter model variability were noted however projected precipitation changes were similar in both model s pools blázquez and nuñez 2013 streamflows simulated for the historical period 1961 to 1990 are used as baseline to assess climate change impact in projected water availability from 2011 to 2099 average flows and minimum q95 flows i e flows encountered in a given stream 95 of the time were utilized averaged for a 30 year period i e 360 month moving average in order to account for uncertainty and modeling limitations changes in the q95 streamflow under climate change scenarios were estimated as the difference between model projection and baseline simulations for each model experiment data was analyzed using programming tools for calculation and visualization hunter 2007 mckinney 2010 waskon 2021 water availability scenarios were analyzed considering specific warming levels that represent potential global mean temperature increase above preindustrial levels allen et al 2018 since the focus is policy significant global warming targets rather than a specific point in time projections are combined to form swl groups based on the target temperature barring and strandberg 2018 it is important to emphasize that the swls have the objective to subsidize the policy decision making processes at a governmental scale allen et al 2018 therefore they were used in this study to establish the relationship between climate change water availability and potential public policy impacts to identify the periods for which the different swls are reached for each of the climate projections increments in global mean temperature between historical period and the projections were recorded such variations were then categorized into three specific warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c and over 3 0 c this last swl includes the largest temperature increase depicted for the climate projections used in this work which range from 3 0 c to 3 4 c data from climate projections of average temperature for each climatic model were obtained from the earth systems grid federation database esgf 2019 3 2 water demand scenarios the water demand scenarios were based on policies presented by the water resources state plan of rio de janeiro coppetec 2014 which established plans programs and goals for the study region water resources plans are instruments of the brazilian national water law brasil 1997 objectifying a long term water management based on the multiple uses of water within a watershed in a first assessment any demand upstream santa cecília was dismissed considering only the natural flow regime in the station the objective of this analysis was to establish grounds for comparison since this is the best case scenario in terms of water availability the following assessments gradually accounted for different uses and diversions to evaluate the system s response upstream upper paraíba where the diversion to pcj takes place different scenarios explored diverted water volumes and water demand for domestic and agricultural uses in this region reducing water availability in santa cecília the diversion to the pcj basin was fixed in 5 m3 s kelman 2015 water consumption for the municipalities upstream the station is 5 29 m3 s brazilian water agency 2010 water regulation in large dams mainly affected by energy market supplies were not accounted in this research regarding rio de janeiro metropolitan area demand the total amount needed at the guandu river basin is 70 m3 s considering domestic industrial mining and agropastoral uses coppetec 2014 furthermore it is necessary to consider an additional 60 m3 s already accounting for the 25 m3 s environmental flow determined for such water body coppetec 2014 to restrain the saline wedge at the mouth of the river allowing industrial freshwater harvest guandu river basin committee 2017 although the paraíba do sul river receives inputs from another streams and tributaries until reaching its lower course lower paraíba the value considered at santa cecília to remain in the downstream stretch will be considered as the amount of water sufficient to fulfill normal operation of the system the lower paraíba region demands 16 26 m3 s for industrial domestic agropastoral and sanitation purposes coppetec 2014 brazilian water agency 2010 and 252 m3 s are needed to contain the saline intrusion at the river outfall cohidro 2014 finally 130 m3 s are added to account for the water transfer to the guandu basin at santa cecília thus total downstream demand required at the santa cecilia station is 398 26 m3 s 3 3 sustainability index sustainability indicators were calculated to analyze the system s performance applied indexes were suggested in the studies developed by sandoval solis et al 2011 as well as okkan and kirdemir 2018 if the amount of water supplied s eq 1 is equal to or greater than the amount of water demanded dem eq 2 for a certain month the deficit def eq 3 is zero on that given month if the value of dem is greater than the value of s for determined month the deficit value will be equal to the difference between dem and s 1 s s

reliability resilience and vulnerability results were recorded for the timeframe in which each of the models reached swl targets an important observation to be made is that the index is adaptable to the number of performance criteria utilized and is calculated by geometric averaging the number of criteria chosen to assess the water system sandoval solis et al 2011 thus to strengthen the analysis

criterion utilized must have a scale that varies from 0 to 1 with desirable criteria values approximating 1 consequently the sustainability index also varies from 0 to 1 and the multiplicative form of the index implies that each criterion has an essential and non substitutable role nevertheless metrics of vulnerability resilience and reliability should be analyzed along with the sustainability index which can be viewed as a synthesis indicator to facilitate the quantification and identification of policies that improve water management sandoval solis et al 2011 the si according to sandoval solis et al 2011 can be used as one of the water management goals for the decision making process involved on planning and policy making steps of water systems furthermore the methodology aims to identify policies that are more sustainable when compared to the status quo or a baseline scenario since is does not have a reference set of numbers to categorize the sustainability of a given system 4 results 4 1 water supply scenarios simulations for the historical period 1961 1990 constitute the baseline to assess changes associated to climate change in the watershed system then uncertainties can be assessed by observing the dispersion in simulations results and its differences with observed values for the historical period table 1 flow duration curves fdcs of the historical period 1961 to 1990 simulated using meteorological data from different global models show largest dispersion for both highest and lowest extreme streamflows fig 4 when compared to the streamflow flow data provided by the national grid operator simulations tend to overestimate highest streamflows and underestimate lowest flows performing conservative in both cases meanwhile for averaged streamflows differences are smaller table 1 climate scenarios used here project global mean temperature increases up to 3 5 c table 2 as expected lowest swl are reached during the first years of integration meanwhile the largest increases are projected towards the end of the century however none of them reached 4 0 c and just three of them reached a temperature increase above 3 0 c fdcs for the projected flows at santa cecilia gauge station show greater dispersion than simulations of historical period for swl 1 5 ad 2 0 fig 4 meanwhile the tendency of underestimating minimum flows and overestimating flood flows is still observed at the highest warming condition swl 3 0 c the spread of the projections is reduced as the number of projections decreases at this swl projections converge to a scenario where less water availability is observed changes in santa cecilia streamflows under climate change scenarios were estimated as the difference between model projected streamflows 2011 2099 for each swl period and baseline simulations 1961 1990 for average flows table 3 and q95 flows table 4 all the models project a decrease in the average and q95 discharges as time advances towards the end of the century and swl targets are hit the projected flows sharply decrease showing a connection between the temperature increase and the reduced water availability this result flags future warning condition to the paraíba do sul river catchment 4 2 water demand scenarios three different scenarios were developed promising feasible and trend table 5 the promising scenario assumes that water distribution systems are properly designed and maintained as well as adopts an environmental education mindset regarding natural resources usage the trend scenario adopts a business as usual state with further agricultural and economic developments finally the feasible scenario represents a midpoint between the scenarios mentioned embracing some assumptions of the promising scenario but not to their full extent for constructing the promising water demand scenario proposals for reduction of distribution losses in rjma depicted by the water resources state plan were considered the 15 reduction is suggested in the strategic plan for integrated urban development of the rio de janeiro metropolitan area by the rio de janeiro state government 2018 also the minimal streamflow of 25 m3 s accounting for the environmental flow in the guandu river coppetec 2014 is considered this scenario included a reduction in the per capita water consumption from present rates of 273 l hab day national sanitation information system 2017 to the 165 l hab day suggested by the world health organization who howard et al 2003 this resulted in a reduction in water intake from the guandu river from the current 45 m3 s to 27 m3 s in the promising scenario projections for future water demand in the lower paraíba do sul region presented in the integrated plan of water resources of the paraíba do sul river basin cohidro 2014 were taken into consideration also a streamflow of 252 m3 s was considered necessary for avoiding siltation and the impacts of saline intrusion at the catchment regions of the municipalities located on the mouth of the paraíba do sul basin cohidro 2014 for the feasible scenario a reduction of 20 in water intake to supply the rjma was accounted reducing the amount from 45 m3 s to 36 m3 s this estimate considers the reduction in per capita consumption to 216 l hab day as suggested by the american water works association awwa mayer and deoreo 1999 also current economic dynamics and consumption practices were left unchanged in the lower paraíba do sul region to estimate the total water demand cohidro 2014 the trend water demand scenario considered water distribution losses in rjma to be reduced to 30 for this scenario no reductions in the rio de janeiro metropolitan area water consumption were considered regarding the lower paraíba do sul region the scenario considered the incentive for economic growth without concerning for environmental awareness further economic growth depicted in this scenario was based on incentive programs for oil and natural gas exploration a significant economic activity in the lower paraíba do sul region cohidro 2014 4 3 sustainability indexes lower water availability observed with time progression warming climate led to an increase in the number of months with potential deficit def less than 0 i e the number of times that the water supply is not enough to fulfill the water demand it must be noted that water availability scenarios are based in natural streamflow regime conditions considering water uses upstream of santa cecília station including the water diversion to spma this result demonstrates the likelihood of a collapse in the system as an effect of the climate change projected by the models analyzed in this work which point to a reduction in minimum streamflows in terms of trends there is not an agreement between the frequency of deficits projection wise trends tend to better relate with the different precipitation schemes projected by the climate models lima et al 2014 queiroz et al 2016 the frequency of deficit events decreases as scenarios based in better demand management policies are considered though with the promising scenario indicating the lowest number of deficit events while the trend scenario projected largest deficit frequencies table 6 climate change projections drive a reduction in the hydric system sustainability fig 6 where the analyses of targa and batista 2015 nobre et al 2016 and britto et al 2019 gave a sense that the system has been operating with too much pressure for a while the indexes showed on fig 5 and the sustainability index values showed in fig 6 indicate that the scenarios proposed regardless of what each one considered were not able to make the paraíba do sul hydric system more sustainable for most of the data points since the si is applicable to assess the performance of a system when compared to a baseline case it can be observed that the system under study tends to lose sustainability over time largest dispersion seems to be driven by the uncertainties in climate projections in general larger increments in mean global temperature result in larger losses of sustainability in the hydric system however swls 1 5 c and 2 0 c show similar behavior mohammed et al 2017 also concluded that the impacts of minimum flows may be less severe at 2 0 c swl than at 1 5 c swl in some cases khan et al 2020 also discussed that the distribution patterns at 1 5 c and 2 0 c swl are similar when analyzing the probability distribution of extreme rainfall indices regarding demand scenarios the sustainability index calculated for the three scenarios developed reveals the performance difference among them the si always achieved its largest value under the promising scenario it is worth mentioning that in these projections even in the promising scenario sustainability in the water system remains lower or at most similar to the historical period 5 discussion pressure on natural resources is progressively increasing water resources planning consist in taking into account several aspects that can contribute to an alteration of the stationarity conditions of a system during the decision making process hirsch 2011 these changes can be derived from a variety of factors including anthropogenic activities and changes in climate conditions the assessment of potential issues is critical to a sustainable water resources management scenario construction and model based approaches are tactics stakeholders can employ to highlight uncertainties and non expected impacts driven by a pool of policies and strategies proposed for environmental planning and management in terms of sustainability michels brito et al 2021 alfieri et al 2017 climate change impacts in streamflows usually have a large dispersion mainly because of inherent climate model uncertainties in simulation of precipitation marengo et al 2014 the use of multiple climate change projections makes it possible to identify the spread of potential impacts and to perform risk assessment dessai et al 2009 mohor et al 2015 thus results of this work are restricted to the climate and hydrological projections here analyzed although the projections applied in this study were built on the sres scenarios of the ipcc the specific warning levels approach has been used as a reference for climate change commitment since the paris agreement in 2015 koutroulis et al 2016a alfieri et al 2017 however main limitations of this approach are related to the lack of stabilization in the climate projections barring and strandberg 2018 that add uncertainty in the assessment of sensitive impacts to the clustering of extreme events developing adaptation strategies to overcome water scarcity has grown in importance in the agenda of policy decision makers towards greater sustainability in hydrosystems gain and wada 2014 uniyal et al 2015 due to the water availability situation presented in this study it becomes clear the need for adaptation tactics at certain part of the system achieving a more sustainable future for all which is the objective of sustainable development goals sdgs is directly linked to ensuring water security especially in periods of water scarcity sdg 6 based on ensuring access to water and sanitation for all proposes that by 2030 water use efficiency in all sectors increase also it aims to ensure sustainable water supply to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity which aligns with this study proposal sdg 13 is also considered in this discussion with respect to taking urgent action to attenuate climate change impacts by increasing resilience and adaptation to climate related hazards and natural disasters additionally it seeks to integrate climate change measures into national policies strategies and planning united nations 2019 for instance the importance of scenario planning becomes evident in the decision making processes to identify uncertainties and prepare responses to potential impacts policies for water infrastructure improvements in the urban context as well as investments in environmental education to reduce water consumption per capita are significant strategies for reducing water demand in this investigation even for the strictest scenario considered the current level of sustainability was at most emulated no improvements were seen by the end of this century water governance challenges also need to be addressed in order to improve water security such as coordination among departments involved with drinking water services monitoring and executing water quality laws and adequate personnel capacity to improve administrative and technical management of water services kayser et al 2015 based on the necessity for a structural change the connection between human life and environment as well as mutual association of powerful organizations can positively lead to a path of sustainable development and sustainable water resources management hopwood et al 2005 kim and chung 2014 dealing with real world complex issues and the need to somehow describe complicated processes some assumptions had to be made the present work does not consider reservoir operations within the study area which implies in a steady state flux of water throughout the system such assumption limits the system resilience to natural conditions besides this approach can identify potential impacts on the system allowing to focus on specific severe periods and to plan ahead for reservoir operation strategies and even include energy market discussions for example under severe drought events such as the 2014 2015 drought reservoirs in the upper paraiba do sul and guandu river reached their inactive zone or dead storage which led the basin to maintain natural minimal flows downstream kelman 2015 for all the demand scenarios the water demand needed for containing saltwater intrusion was kept unchanged it is known that climate change leads to the rise of sea level and as one of its consequences could increase the impact of saltwater intrusion in estuaries however there are no technical nor scientific studies about this impact thus recent sea level rise trends for the brazilian coastline are unknown neves and muehe 2008 also this issue has not been addressed in any of the public policies in which this study is based the worsening of this condition will imply in a larger water demand and lower sustainability if no other adaptative policies were to be implemented in the catchment it is important to emphasize that the focus of this work was to assess future availability of water for human consumption the paraíba do sul has an important role in terms of energy generation however due to its highly urbanization rates and the need to supply water for different sectors the energy impact was not considered regarding the rjma strong dependence of the paraíba do sul river diversion to the guandu system since rio de janeiro has one of the biggest metropolitan areas in brazil some policies suggested by governmental plans follow a paradigm based on supply management where other sources of fresh water supply are sought gonzález bravo et al 2020 the integration of water supply and demand management is needed to preserve water resources and guarantee water access for everyone that relies on it achieving water security is a multifaceted goal however integrating this idea into political and financial spheres would be a starting point for implementing it at different scales planning carefully assessing water system as a whole implementing guidelines to decrease per capita water consumption and investing on efficient water distribution infrastructure are ways to maximize performance and decrease uncertainties over time furthermore it is important to develop comprehensive management practices to enable wise responses with reliable strategies when facing a water crisis the analyses of water supply and demand scenarios including reasonable water supply alternatives public education and response plans are reliable ways to anticipate problems and project solutions to achieve a smart water management 6 conclusions given the high degree of uncertainty related to the potential changes in water resources not only from climate change but also as a result of human actions a multidisciplinary approach is needed on water management and planning to better guide decision making this consists in understanding and incorporating these potential factors of pressure into the planning process in this study climate change projections and public policies recommendations were combined into a broad analysis of potential outcomes to support the decision making process and assess the vulnerability of a multipurpose water system the study highlighted through the comparison of water supply scenarios influenced by climate change projections and water demand scenarios based on public policies that water policies more adherent with sustainable goals could help to reduce the impacts of climate change in water resources for the paraíba do sul river catchment results show that the system presents the risk of collapsing under particular conditions becoming less sustainable the minimum flow analysis which directly relates to the sustainability of the water system indicates worsening performance over time however the promising demand scenario which aggregates policies for sustainable water resources management minimizes this impact to achieve the sustainable management of water resources policy decision makers are required to ensure water access for those relying on it especially during water shortages aiming to minimize water vulnerability public policies and adaptation measures as responses to climate change projections ought to be evaluated the importance of assessing scenarios of water supply projections should be emphasized as a proposal mechanism since it allows managers to incorporate modifications identify uncertainties and anticipate potential impacts of climate change on water resources systems credit authorship contribution statement amanda carneiro marques

3523,economic development alongside unsustained population growth are among the leading factors of hydrological depletion facing climate change impacts long term policy planning via scenario analysis is an essential tool to ensure water security this investigation utilized an approach based on numerical model experiments and sustainability indexes to assess the impact of public policies for water resources management over a long term horizon streamflow projections 2011 2099 from the hydrological model mhd inpe distributed hydrological model national institute for space research were evaluated as means to investigate water supply scenarios monthly flows were accounted into 30 year moving average intervals sustainability indexes were then calculated to evaluate the performance of a water system as ipcc s specific warming levels were reached in this study the contribution of public policies for water resources sustainability under climate change scenarios in the paraíba do sul river basin which supports the water supply of the two major brazilian metropolitan areas were analyzed results indicated that the system will operate with more stress facing climate change impacts finally the assessment of water availability scenarios is concluded to benefit decision makers in incorporating adaptation measures identifying uncertainties and foreseeing potential effects of climate change keywords water availability scenarios specific warming levels sustainability index water security climate projections decision making process 1 introduction more than 40 of the world population is affected by water scarcity and over 1 7 billion people are living in watersheds where water use exceeds recharge united nations 2019 problems related to water food health and poverty are interconnected in many developing countries especially in areas where freshwater is a scarce resource however in places with abundant water resources the increasing demand for freshwater as well as water quality depletion can also lead to water shortages and scarcity due to unplanned population growth and economic development oki and kanae 2006 pressure on natural resources is steadily increasing and greater investment in infrastructure is needed to improve public health conditions stabilize food supply and increase the potential for industrial development oki and kanae 2006 ervinia et al 2019 changes in climate conditions could have a critical impact on water resources management reports from the international panel on climate change ipcc and the united nations climate change

human systems un environment 2019 ipcc 2014 assessing climate change impacts the ipcc fifth report ar5 ipcc 2014 stated that over the period of 1901 to 2010 global average sea level rose by 0 19 m in addition extreme sea levels such as those experienced during storms are likely to have risen since 1970 evidence of the observed impacts on climate change is stronger and more comprehensive for natural systems in many regions changes in precipitation and melting of snow and ice are changing hydrological systems affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality the impacts of recent extreme weather related events such as heat waves droughts floods cyclones and forest fires reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability despite stating that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of floods on a global scale recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharges in some catchments implies a greater risk of flooding at regional scale ipcc 2014 ipcc 2021 most recently the ipcc sixth report ar6 ipcc 2021 states that human induced climate change already affects every part of the planet evidencing the great anthropogenic impact in the biosphere atmosphere hydrosphere and cryosphere notwithstanding observed changes in patterns effects from past and further warming can be considered irreversible for centuries to come regarding plausible scenarios for climate change in the future global temperature is likely to exceed 1 5 c and 2 c until the end of the century under business as usual conditions ipcc 2021 climate variability and change translate into water resources impacts that impose risks for planning and management policies systemic interactions between watershed characteristics ecosystem functioning geographical area water source and water supply among others influence the climate related impacts in drinking water cann et al 2012 serdeczny et al 2017 aiming to minimize water resources vulnerability future development of hydrology requires better communication between scientists and decision makers to ensure that hydrological studies are translated into actions oki and kanae 2006 since factors that increase vulnerability relate to national polices and management strategies jun et al 2011 the inefficiency of public policies and infrastructure investments as well as historical problems such as the difference between rising demand and supply capacity poor infrastructure maintenance and intermittent supply have been aggravated by climate change kelman 2015 britto et al 2019 furthermore uncertainty derived from the rapid growth and diversity of climate research literature imposes additional ongoing challenges cubasch et al 2013 sustainable water resources management encompasses technical legal and political aspects for solving problems covering multiple scales and areas of study integrative concepts explore the effectiveness of these aspects in water governance recognizing the limitations that arise in the context of their implementation into the water management system cook and bakker 2011 the use of indexes is beneficial to quantify a system s sustainability okkan and kirdemir 2018 silva et al 2020 haro monteagudo et al 2020 sustainability indicators are calculated using aspects such as vulnerability reliability and resilience of a system hashimoto et al 1982 exploring the connections between climate conditions and hydrosphere is a necessary step to understand how climate change will impact freshwater availability as well as how watershed ecosystems respond to these changes the complexity of the theme requires the conciliation of varied points of view and the introduction of new variables such as economic crisis climate change and anthropic activities that continually change the environment araújo et al 2015 the knowledge of climatic phenomena and the structure of climate models result in disperse results in the assessment of potential impacts of climate change on water resources marengo et al 2014 thus it is emphasized the importance of plausible scenarios generation considering climate projections population growth and economic development in an attempt to subsidize the risk assessment through exploratory analyses and the decision making process dessai et al 2009 scenario planning helps policymakers to incorporate proposals for sustainable development into their decision making through a structured process enabling the identification of key uncertainties potential impacts and the system s responses symstad et al 2017 the process of scenarios construction objectifying an integrated water resources management under uncertainty is an efficient tool used in the global context in order to preserve water resources from degradation it is necessary to apply coupled water supply and demand management scenarios safavi et al 2016 scenario planning is also used as a technique in decision making processes applied for climate change adaptation and policy star et al 2016 which can be conditioned on the weight of climate projection based evidence brown et al 2011 moody and brown 2012 besides the analysis of water supply and demand scenarios under climate change conditions implementing water security would also mean integrating this idea into the policy cycle and along different scales al saidi 2017 the present investigation aims to evaluate the sustainability of a multiuse watershed in the face of climate change impacts here the sustainability was determined by calculating indexes that encompass the vulnerability the resilience and the reliability of a water supply the assessment employed discharge projections from a hydrological model to simulate future supply of freshwater while water demand scenarios were built based on public policy planning past experiences in brazil such as the dry summer of 2001 cavalcanti and kousky 2004 in which rainfall deficit reached 40 significantly reducing river streamflow and thus the country s hydropower capacity marengo et al 2014 have showed that regional climate change has potential to affect future water resources and power generation in the country marengo et al 2014 recently the southeast region of brazil the most populated and developed region within the country where the paraíba do sul river basin is located experienced a robust drought period which resulted in a severe hydric crisis especially due to existing unsatisfied water demands facing urbanization and climate change baptista et al 2017 paiva et al 2020 water related conflicts between the two largest metropolitan areas in brazil rio de janeiro and são paulo improved leading local governments to adopt measures to ensure adequate supply via water diversion between basins coelho et al 2015 marengo et al 2014 kelman 2015 although recent studies have projected reductions in total annual precipitation towards the end of the century and clear warming trends chou et al 2019 the paraíba do sul river basin is considered a region of low climate predictability given the characteristics of the main phenomena that modulate its climate alves et al 2002 cuadra and rocha 2006 and scarce observations chou et al 2014 marengo et al 2014 highlighted that the dispersion of results in the assessment of potential climate change impacts on water resources are due to the structure of climate models uncertainties inherent to the knowledge of such phenomena the importance of developing reasonable scenarios is thereby emphasized to support risk assessment and decision making processes dessai et al 2009 2 study area brazil benefits from great water availability the brazilian territory has about 12 of all freshwater on the planet brazilian ministry of environment 2000 despite the expressive availability the distribution of water resources in brazil is quite unequal in geographic and population terms although the amazon region has 74 of the water share the amazon river basin is inhabited by less than 5 of the brazilian population which explains the low average use of the resource in the region brazilian water agency 2007 still in the brazilian context from a regional point of view the north has 68 of water resources and only 7 of the population the midwest has 16 of water resources and 6 of the population the south 7 of water resources and 15 of the population the northeast has only 3 of water resources and 29 of the brazilian population and the southeast where the paraíba do sul river basin is placed has 6 of water resources and 43 of the population including the three largest metropolitan areas brazilian ministry of environment 2000 in addition to the unequal distribution of water resources relative to population occupation water vulnerability has become even more relevant in brazil as severe droughts affect different regions of the country the northeast region has recorded periods of severe drought in recent years tortajada and fernandez 2018 the southeast region gained visibility from the water crisis that especially affected the two larger metropolitan areas of the country in 2014 2015 bringing the issue of water supply in the region to the center of a broad and complex national debate britto et al 2019 the water crisis was triggered by the lack of precipitation during the rainy season of 2014 2015 driven by atmospheric configurations associated to an extended atmospheric block coelho et al 2015 the paraíba do sul river has its headwaters in the state of são paulo and its water course runs through minas gerais and rio de janeiro states until it flows into the atlantic ocean at city of são joão da barra in rio de janeiro state fig 1 besides being a source of water supply for the two largest metropolitan areas in brazil the paraíba do sul river also supply freshwater for almost a million people in its drainage area coppetec 2007 important reservoirs of hydroelectric plants are located in the basin which produce almost 3 of the brazilian hydropower water conflicts in this area are mainly driven by agriculture and energy production water quality domestic use ioris 2008 kumler and lemos 2008 kelman 2015 ronquim et al 2017 as well as the two most significant water transfers to rio de janeiro and são paulo metropolitan areas brazilian water agency 2019 the decrease in water availability during the 2014 2015 drought period highlighted a multifaceted issue between the water supply for the rio de janeiro metropolitan area rjma and for other users located downstream in the lower paraíba do sul region fig 1 the reduced water flow in this region resulted in siltation of large river stretches changes in water quality and the increase extent of the saline wedge intrusion affecting the water supply in some municipalities cohidro 2014 such drought pushed the são paulo metropolitan area spma the largest metropolis in the country with nearly 22 million inhabitants to the edge of a profound water crisis millington 2018 the lack of precipitation strongly affected the main hydric system that supplies the spma the cantareira dam system the crisis also revealed the deficiency of são paulo s water system which led the federal government to implement a water transfer system from a neighbor basin the paraiba do sul river basin to increase water supply kelman 2015 as a result 5 m3 s were diverted from the paraiba do sul river at the jaguari reservoir to the atibainha reservoir located in the pcj watershed piracicaba capivari and jundiaí rivers fig 1 the primary responsible for spma water supply to relief the water stress in the system this water transfer enhanced the conflict between the rio de janeiro state government and the são paulo state government kelman 2015 the supply of the rjma which is the second largest metropolitan area in brazil with a population of 13 million inhabitants is also based on the particular diversion of waters from the paraíba do sul river basin to the guandu river basin fig 1 approximately 9 million people along with industries located in the rjma rely on water from this transfer the 2014 2015 crisis also emphasized the dependence of the rio de janeiro metropolitan area on the diverted water from the paraíba do sul river since the water supply for almost 90 of its population is exclusively provided by such transfer rio de janeiro state government 2018 apart from drinking water supply another significant share of the diverted water goes towards industry applications furthermore it must be noted that part of the transferred water volume is used to contain the advance of the saline wedge on the guandu river mouth rio de janeiro state government 2018 such panorama reveals the broader water conflicts that affect the paraiba do sul river basin even with annual streamflow of around 1 100 m3 s at the river mouth oliveira et al 2018 and annual precipitation totals of 1400 mm silva and simões 2014 yearly distributed among wet summers and dry winters rao and hada 1990 as a result many studies were carried out by the government and civil organizations proposing different policies for water resource management in the basin this study focused on the evaluation of public policies and how they can contribute for the paraíba do sul river basin s sustainability mainly considering severe drought conditions as depicted by some climate change scenarios 3 methodology scenarios of water supply and freshwater demand were constructed to analyze the long term suitability of a water system to keep providing the required safe yield until the end of the century in the light of climate change impacts future water availability was estimated using streamflow projections from the hydrological model mhd inpe distributed hydrological model national institute for space research on the other hand future water demand scenarios were built considering available public policy and proposed water management plans for both short and long runs the hydrological approach was coupled with climate models for temperature also until the end of the century in order to compare the performance of the water system under the proposed scenarios sustainability indexes were calculated as ipcc s specific warming levels swls were reached in other words as global mean temperatures increased the indexes were recorded for each scenario under different degrees of global warming here expressed as 1 5 2 0 and 3 0 celsius of temperature increment when compared to preindustrial levels fig 2 depicts the model chain approach utilized in the study this approach aims to evaluate the watershed response to climate pressures intended to distinguish impact levels of swls either from greenhouse gases concentrations or from fixed climate change periods alfieri et al 2017 impacts of global warming were evaluated in 30 year intervals centered around the year at which swls were reached for each model long term inertial effects of warming stabilization scenarios were not covered for climate predictions the use of rcp 8 5 projections was applied due to the forecast of 4 celsius of warming until the end of this century allowing the adoption of the three sets of swls over the course of the model simulations alfieri et al 2017 regardless of constraints and limitations such approach has been implemented in recent publications hirabayashi et al 2013 james and washington 2013 swain and hayhoe 2014 koutroulis et al 2016b alfieri et al 2017 hirabayashi et al 2021 the paraíba do sul river basin was simplified as a conceptual water system fig 3 the scheme highlights the three main points of conflict first the upper paraíba do sul region and its water uses including the diversion to spma second the santa cecília diversion to the guandu watershed supplying water to rjma as well as restraining the saline wedge for industrial freshwater consumption finally the lower paraíba do sul region and its challenges to provide water resources for domestic agricultural and industrial uses as well as for restraining the saline wedge the study focused on the santa cecilia station a pumping station without reservoir capacity where the water is rerouted to the guandu watershed as the key place for water balance assessment 3 1 water availability scenarios hydrological historical simulations and future projections of water availability under climate change scenarios lima et al 2014 queiroz et al 2016 were used in this study for creating the future water supply scenarios on the region of study water availability was assessed by analyzing streamflows simulated with the hydrological model mhd inpe integrated at 10 km resolution distributed hydrological model national institute for space research rodriguez and tomasella 2016 mhd inpe model implementation and calibration were conducted using observed hydrometeorological data obtained from the national institute of meteorology the national institute for space research and from the national electric system operator for the calibration period from 1970 to 1990 authors shown

availability climate projections from five climate models were combined with the hydrological model namely geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory climate model version 2 1 gfdl cm2 1 milly and shmakin

community climate system model ccsm3 national center for atmospheric research 2004 these climate models have proven to adequately simulate the main features of south american climate vera and silvestri 2009 pesquero et al 2010 chou et al 2012 however there were bias in precipitation volumes across the continent gulizia and camilloni 2015 koutroulis et al 2016b for the hydrological simulations meteorological data simulated by global climate models gcms including precipitation were bias corrected using comparisons with observed data rainfall bias was corrected by applying the quartile quartile mapping method described by bárdossy and pegram 2011 climate projections are based on the special report on emissions scenarios sres a1b from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ipcc 2007 the scenario a1b utilized in this study is an intermediary scenario which represents medium level emissions knutti and sedlacek 2013 widely used for sustainable hydrosystems assessments tzabiras et al 2016 khajeh et al 2017 in terms of radiative forcing the scenario sres a1b has an intermediary behavior between representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 and rcp 4 5 being close to rcp 6 ipcc 2014 according to the ipcc 2014 differences between the sres and the rcps are largely due to the inclusion of the wider range of emissions assessed over south america differences between cmip3 and cmip5 projections regarding inter model variability were noted however projected precipitation changes were similar in both model s pools blázquez and nuñez 2013 streamflows simulated for the historical period 1961 to 1990 are used as baseline to assess climate change impact in projected water availability from 2011 to 2099 average flows and minimum q95 flows i e flows encountered in a given stream 95 of the time were utilized averaged for a 30 year period i e 360 month moving average in order to account for uncertainty and modeling limitations changes in the q95 streamflow under climate change scenarios were estimated as the difference between model projection and baseline simulations for each model experiment data was analyzed using programming tools for calculation and visualization hunter 2007 mckinney 2010 waskon 2021 water availability scenarios were analyzed considering specific warming levels that represent potential global mean temperature increase above preindustrial levels allen et al 2018 since the focus is policy significant global warming targets rather than a specific point in time projections are combined to form swl groups based on the target temperature barring and strandberg 2018 it is important to emphasize that the swls have the objective to subsidize the policy decision making processes at a governmental scale allen et al 2018 therefore they were used in this study to establish the relationship between climate change water availability and potential public policy impacts to identify the periods for which the different swls are reached for each of the climate projections increments in global mean temperature between historical period and the projections were recorded such variations were then categorized into three specific warming levels 1 5 c 2 0 c and over 3 0 c this last swl includes the largest temperature increase depicted for the climate projections used in this work which range from 3 0 c to 3 4 c data from climate projections of average temperature for each climatic model were obtained from the earth systems grid federation database esgf 2019 3 2 water demand scenarios the water demand scenarios were based on policies presented by the water resources state plan of rio de janeiro coppetec 2014 which established plans programs and goals for the study region water resources plans are instruments of the brazilian national water law brasil 1997 objectifying a long term water management based on the multiple uses of water within a watershed in a first assessment any demand upstream santa cecília was dismissed considering only the natural flow regime in the station the objective of this analysis was to establish grounds for comparison since this is the best case scenario in terms of water availability the following assessments gradually accounted for different uses and diversions to evaluate the system s response upstream upper paraíba where the diversion to pcj takes place different scenarios explored diverted water volumes and water demand for domestic and agricultural uses in this region reducing water availability in santa cecília the diversion to the pcj basin was fixed in 5 m3 s kelman 2015 water consumption for the municipalities upstream the station is 5 29 m3 s brazilian water agency 2010 water regulation in large dams mainly affected by energy market supplies were not accounted in this research regarding rio de janeiro metropolitan area demand the total amount needed at the guandu river basin is 70 m3 s considering domestic industrial mining and agropastoral uses coppetec 2014 furthermore it is necessary to consider an additional 60 m3 s already accounting for the 25 m3 s environmental flow determined for such water body coppetec 2014 to restrain the saline wedge at the mouth of the river allowing industrial freshwater harvest guandu river basin committee 2017 although the paraíba do sul river receives inputs from another streams and tributaries until reaching its lower course lower paraíba the value considered at santa cecília to remain in the downstream stretch will be considered as the amount of water sufficient to fulfill normal operation of the system the lower paraíba region demands 16 26 m3 s for industrial domestic agropastoral and sanitation purposes coppetec 2014 brazilian water agency 2010 and 252 m3 s are needed to contain the saline intrusion at the river outfall cohidro 2014 finally 130 m3 s are added to account for the water transfer to the guandu basin at santa cecília thus total downstream demand required at the santa cecilia station is 398 26 m3 s 3 3 sustainability index sustainability indicators were calculated to analyze the system s performance applied indexes were suggested in the studies developed by sandoval solis et al 2011 as well as okkan and kirdemir 2018 if the amount of water supplied s eq 1 is equal to or greater than the amount of water demanded dem eq 2 for a certain month the deficit def eq 3 is zero on that given month if the value of dem is greater than the value of s for determined month the deficit value will be equal to the difference between dem and s 1 s s

e m s d e m 0 s d e m the water balance calculations were made for each timestep 360 month moving average to determine the number of deficits and deficit related parameters used to calculate temporal reliability resilience and vulnerability results were recorded for the timeframe in which each of the models reached swl targets an important observation to be made is that the index is adaptable to the number of performance criteria utilized and is calculated by geometric averaging the number of criteria chosen to assess the water system sandoval solis et al 2011 thus to strengthen the analysis 3 performance criteria were calculated and the holistic sustainability index si was determined based on the estimated reliability rel resilience res and vulnerability vul of the system eq 4 4 si r e l r e s 1 v u l 1 3 the system is in deficit when in a given timestep the water balance is negative eq 5 reliability and resilience are estimated from the frequency and persistence of non deficit events eq 6 and eq 7 during the total n months meanwhile vulnerability is estimated from the rate between total volume of water deficit and total unmet water demand eq 8 where n is the total number of months

criterion utilized must have a scale that varies from 0 to 1 with desirable criteria values approximating 1 consequently the sustainability index also varies from 0 to 1 and the multiplicative form of the index implies that each criterion has an essential and non substitutable role nevertheless metrics of vulnerability resilience and reliability should be analyzed along with the sustainability index which can be viewed as a synthesis indicator to facilitate the quantification and identification of policies that improve water management sandoval solis et al 2011 the si according to sandoval solis et al 2011 can be used as one of the water management goals for the decision making process involved on planning and policy making steps of water systems furthermore the methodology aims to identify policies that are more sustainable when compared to the status quo or a baseline scenario since is does not have a reference set of numbers to categorize the sustainability of a given system 4 results 4 1 water supply scenarios simulations for the historical period 1961 1990 constitute the baseline to assess changes associated to climate change in the watershed system then uncertainties can be assessed by observing the dispersion in simulations results and its differences with observed values for the historical period table 1 flow duration curves fdcs of the historical period 1961 to 1990 simulated using meteorological data from different global models show largest dispersion for both highest and lowest extreme streamflows fig 4 when compared to the streamflow flow data provided by the national grid operator simulations tend to overestimate highest streamflows and underestimate lowest flows performing conservative in both cases meanwhile for averaged streamflows differences are smaller table 1 climate scenarios used here project global mean temperature increases up to 3 5 c table 2 as expected lowest swl are reached during the first years of integration meanwhile the largest increases are projected towards the end of the century however none of them reached 4 0 c and just three of them reached a temperature increase above 3 0 c fdcs for the projected flows at santa cecilia gauge station show greater dispersion than simulations of historical period for swl 1 5 ad 2 0 fig 4 meanwhile the tendency of underestimating minimum flows and overestimating flood flows is still observed at the highest warming condition swl 3 0 c the spread of the projections is reduced as the number of projections decreases at this swl projections converge to a scenario where less water availability is observed changes in santa cecilia streamflows under climate change scenarios were estimated as the difference between model projected streamflows 2011 2099 for each swl period and baseline simulations 1961 1990 for average flows table 3 and q95 flows table 4 all the models project a decrease in the average and q95 discharges as time advances towards the end of the century and swl targets are hit the projected flows sharply decrease showing a connection between the temperature increase and the reduced water availability this result flags future warning condition to the paraíba do sul river catchment 4 2 water demand scenarios three different scenarios were developed promising feasible and trend table 5 the promising scenario assumes that water distribution systems are properly designed and maintained as well as adopts an environmental education mindset regarding natural resources usage the trend scenario adopts a business as usual state with further agricultural and economic developments finally the feasible scenario represents a midpoint between the scenarios mentioned embracing some assumptions of the promising scenario but not to their full extent for constructing the promising water demand scenario proposals for reduction of distribution losses in rjma depicted by the water resources state plan were considered the 15 reduction is suggested in the strategic plan for integrated urban development of the rio de janeiro metropolitan area by the rio de janeiro state government 2018 also the minimal streamflow of 25 m3 s accounting for the environmental flow in the guandu river coppetec 2014 is considered this scenario included a reduction in the per capita water consumption from present rates of 273 l hab day national sanitation information system 2017 to the 165 l hab day suggested by the world health organization who howard et al 2003 this resulted in a reduction in water intake from the guandu river from the current 45 m3 s to 27 m3 s in the promising scenario projections for future water demand in the lower paraíba do sul region presented in the integrated plan of water resources of the paraíba do sul river basin cohidro 2014 were taken into consideration also a streamflow of 252 m3 s was considered necessary for avoiding siltation and the impacts of saline intrusion at the catchment regions of the municipalities located on the mouth of the paraíba do sul basin cohidro 2014 for the feasible scenario a reduction of 20 in water intake to supply the rjma was accounted reducing the amount from 45 m3 s to 36 m3 s this estimate considers the reduction in per capita consumption to 216 l hab day as suggested by the american water works association awwa mayer and deoreo 1999 also current economic dynamics and consumption practices were left unchanged in the lower paraíba do sul region to estimate the total water demand cohidro 2014 the trend water demand scenario considered water distribution losses in rjma to be reduced to 30 for this scenario no reductions in the rio de janeiro metropolitan area water consumption were considered regarding the lower paraíba do sul region the scenario considered the incentive for economic growth without concerning for environmental awareness further economic growth depicted in this scenario was based on incentive programs for oil and natural gas exploration a significant economic activity in the lower paraíba do sul region cohidro 2014 4 3 sustainability indexes lower water availability observed with time progression warming climate led to an increase in the number of months with potential deficit def less than 0 i e the number of times that the water supply is not enough to fulfill the water demand it must be noted that water availability scenarios are based in natural streamflow regime conditions considering water uses upstream of santa cecília station including the water diversion to spma this result demonstrates the likelihood of a collapse in the system as an effect of the climate change projected by the models analyzed in this work which point to a reduction in minimum streamflows in terms of trends there is not an agreement between the frequency of deficits projection wise trends tend to better relate with the different precipitation schemes projected by the climate models lima et al 2014 queiroz et al 2016 the frequency of deficit events decreases as scenarios based in better demand management policies are considered though with the promising scenario indicating the lowest number of deficit events while the trend scenario projected largest deficit frequencies table 6 climate change projections drive a reduction in the hydric system sustainability fig 6 where the analyses of targa and batista 2015 nobre et al 2016 and britto et al 2019 gave a sense that the system has been operating with too much pressure for a while the indexes showed on fig 5 and the sustainability index values showed in fig 6 indicate that the scenarios proposed regardless of what each one considered were not able to make the paraíba do sul hydric system more sustainable for most of the data points since the si is applicable to assess the performance of a system when compared to a baseline case it can be observed that the system under study tends to lose sustainability over time largest dispersion seems to be driven by the uncertainties in climate projections in general larger increments in mean global temperature result in larger losses of sustainability in the hydric system however swls 1 5 c and 2 0 c show similar behavior mohammed et al 2017 also concluded that the impacts of minimum flows may be less severe at 2 0 c swl than at 1 5 c swl in some cases khan et al 2020 also discussed that the distribution patterns at 1 5 c and 2 0 c swl are similar when analyzing the probability distribution of extreme rainfall indices regarding demand scenarios the sustainability index calculated for the three scenarios developed reveals the performance difference among them the si always achieved its largest value under the promising scenario it is worth mentioning that in these projections even in the promising scenario sustainability in the water system remains lower or at most similar to the historical period 5 discussion pressure on natural resources is progressively increasing water resources planning consist in taking into account several aspects that can contribute to an alteration of the stationarity conditions of a system during the decision making process hirsch 2011 these changes can be derived from a variety of factors including anthropogenic activities and changes in climate conditions the assessment of potential issues is critical to a sustainable water resources management scenario construction and model based approaches are tactics stakeholders can employ to highlight uncertainties and non expected impacts driven by a pool of policies and strategies proposed for environmental planning and management in terms of sustainability michels brito et al 2021 alfieri et al 2017 climate change impacts in streamflows usually have a large dispersion mainly because of inherent climate model uncertainties in simulation of precipitation marengo et al 2014 the use of multiple climate change projections makes it possible to identify the spread of potential impacts and to perform risk assessment dessai et al 2009 mohor et al 2015 thus results of this work are restricted to the climate and hydrological projections here analyzed although the projections applied in this study were built on the sres scenarios of the ipcc the specific warning levels approach has been used as a reference for climate change commitment since the paris agreement in 2015 koutroulis et al 2016a alfieri et al 2017 however main limitations of this approach are related to the lack of stabilization in the climate projections barring and strandberg 2018 that add uncertainty in the assessment of sensitive impacts to the clustering of extreme events developing adaptation strategies to overcome water scarcity has grown in importance in the agenda of policy decision makers towards greater sustainability in hydrosystems gain and wada 2014 uniyal et al 2015 due to the water availability situation presented in this study it becomes clear the need for adaptation tactics at certain part of the system achieving a more sustainable future for all which is the objective of sustainable development goals sdgs is directly linked to ensuring water security especially in periods of water scarcity sdg 6 based on ensuring access to water and sanitation for all proposes that by 2030 water use efficiency in all sectors increase also it aims to ensure sustainable water supply to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity which aligns with this study proposal sdg 13 is also considered in this discussion with respect to taking urgent action to attenuate climate change impacts by increasing resilience and adaptation to climate related hazards and natural disasters additionally it seeks to integrate climate change measures into national policies strategies and planning united nations 2019 for instance the importance of scenario planning becomes evident in the decision making processes to identify uncertainties and prepare responses to potential impacts policies for water infrastructure improvements in the urban context as well as investments in environmental education to reduce water consumption per capita are significant strategies for reducing water demand in this investigation even for the strictest scenario considered the current level of sustainability was at most emulated no improvements were seen by the end of this century water governance challenges also need to be addressed in order to improve water security such as coordination among departments involved with drinking water services monitoring and executing water quality laws and adequate personnel capacity to improve administrative and technical management of water services kayser et al 2015 based on the necessity for a structural change the connection between human life and environment as well as mutual association of powerful organizations can positively lead to a path of sustainable development and sustainable water resources management hopwood et al 2005 kim and chung 2014 dealing with real world complex issues and the need to somehow describe complicated processes some assumptions had to be made the present work does not consider reservoir operations within the study area which implies in a steady state flux of water throughout the system such assumption limits the system resilience to natural conditions besides this approach can identify potential impacts on the system allowing to focus on specific severe periods and to plan ahead for reservoir operation strategies and even include energy market discussions for example under severe drought events such as the 2014 2015 drought reservoirs in the upper paraiba do sul and guandu river reached their inactive zone or dead storage which led the basin to maintain natural minimal flows downstream kelman 2015 for all the demand scenarios the water demand needed for containing saltwater intrusion was kept unchanged it is known that climate change leads to the rise of sea level and as one of its consequences could increase the impact of saltwater intrusion in estuaries however there are no technical nor scientific studies about this impact thus recent sea level rise trends for the brazilian coastline are unknown neves and muehe 2008 also this issue has not been addressed in any of the public policies in which this study is based the worsening of this condition will imply in a larger water demand and lower sustainability if no other adaptative policies were to be implemented in the catchment it is important to emphasize that the focus of this work was to assess future availability of water for human consumption the paraíba do sul has an important role in terms of energy generation however due to its highly urbanization rates and the need to supply water for different sectors the energy impact was not considered regarding the rjma strong dependence of the paraíba do sul river diversion to the guandu system since rio de janeiro has one of the biggest metropolitan areas in brazil some policies suggested by governmental plans follow a paradigm based on supply management where other sources of fresh water supply are sought gonzález bravo et al 2020 the integration of water supply and demand management is needed to preserve water resources and guarantee water access for everyone that relies on it achieving water security is a multifaceted goal however integrating this idea into political and financial spheres would be a starting point for implementing it at different scales planning carefully assessing water system as a whole implementing guidelines to decrease per capita water consumption and investing on efficient water distribution infrastructure are ways to maximize performance and decrease uncertainties over time furthermore it is important to develop comprehensive management practices to enable wise responses with reliable strategies when facing a water crisis the analyses of water supply and demand scenarios including reasonable water supply alternatives public education and response plans are reliable ways to anticipate problems and project solutions to achieve a smart water management 6 conclusions given the high degree of uncertainty related to the potential changes in water resources not only from climate change but also as a result of human actions a multidisciplinary approach is needed on water management and planning to better guide decision making this consists in understanding and incorporating these potential factors of pressure into the planning process in this study climate change projections and public policies recommendations were combined into a broad analysis of potential outcomes to support the decision making process and assess the vulnerability of a multipurpose water system the study highlighted through the comparison of water supply scenarios influenced by climate change projections and water demand scenarios based on public policies that water policies more adherent with sustainable goals could help to reduce the impacts of climate change in water resources for the paraíba do sul river catchment results show that the system presents the risk of collapsing under particular conditions becoming less sustainable the minimum flow analysis which directly relates to the sustainability of the water system indicates worsening performance over time however the promising demand scenario which aggregates policies for sustainable water resources management minimizes this impact to achieve the sustainable management of water resources policy decision makers are required to ensure water access for those relying on it especially during water shortages aiming to minimize water vulnerability public policies and adaptation measures as responses to climate change projections ought to be evaluated the importance of assessing scenarios of water supply projections should be emphasized as a proposal mechanism since it allows managers to incorporate modifications identify uncertainties and anticipate potential impacts of climate change on water resources systems credit authorship contribution statement amanda carneiro marques

3524,quantifying the regional evapotranspiration is critical in terrestrial water balance and global water cycle while partitioning of evapotranspiration is challenging but fundamental to predict the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under climate changes here we performed in situ measurements of water isotopes in atmospheric vapor plant tissues and soil pools in a pinus yunnanensis forest ecosystem in southwest china aiming to partitioning et by estimating the stable isotopic compositions of et and that of its two components i e plant transpiration and soil water evaporation we used combined high frequency laser spectroscopy and chamber methods to constrain the estimates of t et we first found that the estimated daily t et ratio ranges from 0 59 to 0 81 with an apparent increasing shift in the early growing season and maintaining a plateau level of over 0 75 during the peak growing season this higher averaged t et of 0 73 0 06 indicates that plant transpiration is the main component of evapotranspiration the estimated δe and δt are in agreement with result from customized chamber method we also found that in monsoon season in june september soil water content is the main control of t et variations with leaf area index playing only a partial role our study confirms the critical impact of soil water on the seasonal change of t et in pinus yunnanensis ecosystem such as the sw china however we are also aware the sensitivity of controls on estimated t et at different time scale interested our results here provide insight into the regional hydrological cycle in alpine forest ecosystem and potentially benefits many applications from forest ecosystem protection to paleo isotope archives keywords evapotranspiration partitioning water isotopes seasonality forest ecosystem southwest china 1 introduction increasing stress from climate change exerted its impact on water cycle of the global terrestrial ecosystem and hydrological cycle is expected to be intensified and to alter evapotranspiration et with implications for feedback to regional and global climate jung et al 2010 evapotranspiration is the most important process that influences ecosystem water loss and a major determinant of the water budget and energy balance in the ecosystem however in the terrestrial water cycle budget evapotranspiration determined by the intensities and relative proportions of evaporation from the soil e and transpiration through the stomata of plants t is still a major uncertainty especially in the stress of climate change since t fluxes link the water and carbon cycles scott et al 2006 it transfers a significant portion of water from the soil to the atmosphere with consequences for regional humidity and precipitation patterns aguiar et al 1996 kool et al 2014 prince et al 1998 therefore quantitative estimation of t in the total et t et has long been acknowledged to play a crucial role in water resource management yield estimation the water cycle and climate change from plot scale to global scale e g jasechko et al 2013 kool et al 2014 in addition as water limited environments currently comprise about half of the earth s land surface and are expected to continue to expand newman et al 2006 the issue of accurately assessing et and its components has become more acute in recent studies in related to isotope hydrology ecosystem processes and climate change dubbert et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 jefferson et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 on a global scale concerns about climate change have raised interest in the connection between et and carbon sequestration scott et al 2006 and the influence of et partitioning on land atmosphere patterns which affect climate simulations lawrence et al 2007 consequently the topic of evapotranspiration partitioning has gained much attention in the scientific community e g berkelhammer et al 2016 lu et al 2017 at present various methods have been developed for et partitioning at different spatial and temporal scales coenders gerrits et al 2014 fatichi and pappas 2017 scott and biederman 2017 wei et al 2017 such as those from field observations zhou et al 2016 remote sensing model estimation miralles et al 2016 process based model simulations wang erlandsson et al 2014 and reanalysis data kochendorfer and ramírez 2010 isotopic measurements good et al 2015 have been increasingly used to partition et at these scales owning to the sensitivity of isotope fractionation in evaporation the stable isotope method for et partitioning is usually based on the principle of isotope mass balance thus the analysis of the water stable isotopic compositions within soil vegetation and the atmosphere are the core issue xiao et al 2018 in spite of the et partitioning efforts over the past decades there is a significant discrepancy among global t et estimated by different methods and large uncertainty still exists at different spatial temporal coverages at the global scale the magnitude of t et differs substantially 20 90 among different methods coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 good et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 miralles et al 2016 wei et al 2017 the distinct isotope effects of t and e showed that t represents 80 90 of terrestrial et at basin and global scales by using a combination of isotope measurement techniques and satellite observations jasechko et al 2013 such high ratio was questioned and challenged by following correspondence schlesinger and jasechko 2014 coenders gerrits et al 2014 lately good et al 2015 adjusted the global t et ratio to 64 13 by using the satellite isotope data and large scale water balance method wei et al 2017 modified the global t et to be about 57 with a leaf area index lai based et partitioning algorithm the uncertainty is likely persistent since plot scale et partitioning observations at relevant spatiotemporal scales for large scale t et upscaling wei et al 2017 constraint lian et al 2018 and validation rigden et al 2018 are still lack at plot scale isotopic methods have been widely used for et partitioning at different ecosystem including forests dubbert et al 2013 savanna yepez et al 2003 grassland good et al 2014 and farmland wei et al 2015 for the past two decades the main effect involved is to determine the environment factors that controls t et changes which is necessary for better upscaling hydrological cycling to large areas wei et al 2017 as well as land surface modeling ma et al 2017 forest ecosystems cover approximately 30 of the earth s land surface hansen et al 2014 and play an essential ecological role in the earth atmosphere interaction the earth s surface energy balance and hydrological cycle the alpine forest exerts a strong regulating function on preventing soil erosion and regulating climate system altieri et al 2018 many previous effects have addressed the water cycle in association with the forest ecosystem with a specification on et participation by using the steam model wang erlandsson et al 2014 simulated the global et and its components and found that deciduous broadleaved forest had the largest t et value 0 64 and evergreen coniferous forests had the smallest value 0 50 liu et al 2020 used eddy covariance technique and sap flow probes and concluded that the overall t et varies in the range of 0 66 0 84 in a larch forest in most northern china however previous studies have focused mainly on lower elevations or only estimated the gross evapotranspiration and a gap exists in the study of seasonal evapotranspiration processes and its controlling factors in alpine forest ecosystems stress increased in recent years to protect the forest ecosystem in southwest china due to their ecological importance characterized by ecological security barrier and vulnerable global climate change coniferous leaved forests are one of the wide transcontinental distribution and keystone forest types in subalpine forest ecosystem here we reported a new result on isotope based land surface water cycle in a typical subalpine forest region in lijiang yunnan guizhou plateau in southwest china by employing a high frequency laser spectrometry and chamber method throughout an entire raining season we made continuous measurement of isotopes in atmospheric vapor and evapotranspiration in the raining season june to september of 2019 δe and δt were directly measured by newly customized chambers or calculated from commonly used non process based empirical models keeling plot craig gordon model and isotopic steady state assumption the paper aims first to determine the seasonal shift of water isotope in different water bodies and water transfers among precipitation soil water xylem water then to evaluate the variations of e t and et in pinus yunnanensis forest ecosystem and partition evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation for an improved understanding of the dynamics that drive the seasonal variations of t et 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description we made observation of water isotopes in precipitation plant soil water and atmospheric vapor at lijiang forest ecosystem research

water leaf water simultaneously during may to september of 2019 we also collected precipitation for isotope measurement as input water isotope signal during the same period following we made description on how we made the monitoring and sampling work at the experiment plot 2 2 1 vapor isotope measurement we used a picarro l2130 i high frequency wavelength scanning cavity decay spectrum analyzer for atmospheric vapor isotope measurement the analyzer is placed in room on the site to ensure the stability of the ambient air temperature two models i e solid model and vapor model were switched to measure water isotopes in plant and soil water samples cui et al 2017 or the near surface water vapor steen larsen et al 2013 in vapor mode the measurement and calibration system are comprised of a standard delivery module a0101 a vaporizer module a0211 picarro inc santa clara ca and an analyzer the schematic diagram working principle and calibration process of the crds analyzer was described elsewhere wang and dickinson 2012 in practice instrumental drifts and humidity dependence of water vapor isotopes were corrected before normalizing to v smow scale and calibration measurement was performed every 12 h following the protocols of steen larsen et al 2013 we measured the atmospheric vapor isotopes at 8 layers along a vertical profile of 0 5 1 2 3 5 10 15 and 20 m above the ground utilizing eight way solenoid valves and from 13 00 15 00 and 23 00 next 8 00 h local standard time utc 8 every day each level was measured for 10 min during the noon hours from 13 00 15 00 and the average of the last 5min was used to establish the keeling plot to obtain δet since soil water and plant water isotopes were measured in daytime using the same isotope analyzer the vapor isotope measurement was intermittent in daytime the precision was 0 2 for vapor δ18o and 0 5 for vapor δ2h 2 2 2 plant and soil water sampling and isotope measurement soil water xylem water and leaf water were measured at 13 00 to 15 00 every other day and three duplicated samples were measured each time and the average value is used for representative a total number of 362 47 and 47 samples of soil water xylem water and leaf water were collected for isotope analysis occasional samples were also collected after raining events to reveal the direct raining impact on soil and xylem water isotopes in each measurement the collected xylem samples from the base of the plant green tissue e g outer leaf were stripped and only the white i e non transpiring tissue was used for measurement we measured plant samples at different sides of the tree east west south north and from three mature trees for the representative of the measurement soil samples were collected at depth of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 80 cm at each time with a hand drill at sites near the three trees plant xylem pinus yunnanensis and soil samples were measured by the isotope analyzer in solid mode combined with an induction module im the solid mode allowed for the simultaneous measurement of the isotopic compositions of small solid samples and the removal of organic contamination from within the samples in the field quade et al 2019 the measurement of the plant and soil water immediately after sampling will also reduce the influence of evaporation on water isotopes three laboratory standard waters were used for calibration s1 δ18o 2 83 δ2h 27 42 s2 δ18o 29 84 δ2h 222 84 and s3 δ18o 15 29 δ2h 110 30 which roughly cover the ranges of the measured water isotope ratios for the measurement procedure 3 μl of laboratory standard water s1 and s3 was injected onto glass filter paper whatman plc maidstone uk for calibration prior to sample measurements xylem samples were wrapped in small tri fold metal strips picarro inc santa clara ca and placed inside a 4 ml glass vial the vial was inserted into the im and heated through induction and the evaporated vapor was sent to analyzer for isotope measurement for soil samples each soil sample 4μg was put into a steel pipe picarro inc santa clara ca with 20 mm in length and 5 mm in diameter and also placed inside a vial this process generally required 5 min to measure for one xylem sample and 10 15 min to measure for one soil water sample the measured precision is 0 20 for δ18o and 0 69 for δ2h the detailed measurement and calibration processes followed the protocol of cui et al 2017 2 2 3 precipitation sampling and measurement we used two methods to collect precipitation samples daily precipitation samples were collected at 20 00 in the raining day using a container specifically designed to avoid re evaporation of collected water samples in addition 170 precipitation event samples were collected in the period from may to september 2019 all samples were stored in plastic bottles and frozen in refrigerator before laboratory analysis the collected precipitation samples were analyzed in laboratory by using picarro l2140 i liquid water isotope analyzer for both δ18o and δ2h all measured results were normalized to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water with precision within 0 05 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h 2 3 micrometeorological and eddy covariance measurements we installed the eddy covariance ec instruments meteorology station at the sampling station including an open path infrared co2 h2o gas analyzer li 7500 a li cor usa and a three dimensional sonic anemometer thermometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa mounted 3 m above the ground the data were stored in a cr6 data logger and cf storage card at a sampling frequency of 10 hz the raw data acquired at 10 hz were processed using the postprocessing software edire and quality control of the half hourly flux data were conducted as described in earlier literature xu et al 2013 and will only be summarized here micrometeorological parameters air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation amount four component radiation three layers of soil temperature and soil moisture profiles soil heat flux etc were recorded under 1 hz additional details concerning data acquisition were described liu and zhang 2012 eichelmann et al 2018 based on measurements from the ec system the energy balance closure ratio was evaluated at this site and result shows a relatively high energy balance closure ratio of 0 88 indicating that the energy balance closure problem wilson et al 2001 is not a major concern for the site and system leaf area index lai 1 hour composited 0 25 data from the era 5 product were used in the discussion about the control of seasonal t et ratio the values proved to be broadly consistent with observations data were downloaded from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts https www ecmwf int 2 4 methods 2 4 1 isotopic flux partitioning water stable isotopes have been widely used to estimate plot scale et partitioning yepez et al 2003 good et al 2014 wei et al 2018 owing to the distinctive isotope signal of δet δe and δt resulted from deviated fractionation between evaporation and transpiration utilizing a two end member e and t mixing model the partitioning can be expressed as the three isotope signals by the following equation yakir and sternberg 2000 1 t et δ et δ e δ t δ e where δet δe and δt are isotopic compositions of evapotranspiration et soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t respectively this equation requires that the isotopic ratio of the et e and t fluxes to be known for model estimation 2 4 2 isotopic composition of soil evaporation considering both equilibrium and kinetic fractionation during the phased change of water from liquid to vapor the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 is the most common method widely employed for estimating δe and has been successfully applied under different conditions yepez et al 2003 rothfuss et al 2010 good et al 2014 wei et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 using the isotopic composition of soil water at the evaporating surface δs and vapor measured at the reference height δv as well as various meteorological variables δe can be calculated as follows 2 δ e α e 1 δ s h δ v ε eq 1 h ε k 1 h 10 3 1 h ε k where ɑ e 1 is the equilibrium fractionation factor calculated as a function of water surface temperature majoube 1971 ε eq 1 1 ɑ e 103 represents the equilibrium fractionation effect ε k is the isotopic kinetic fractionation effect if the diffusion is molecular then ε k of δ18o is equal to 28 merlivat 1978 h is the relative humidity normalized to the surface soil temperature craig and gordon 1965 2 4 3 isotopic composition of plant transpiration isotope mass conservation requires that the isotopic composition of leaf transpiration water should be equal to that of soil water absorbed by roots at midday and in the early afternoon when et is most intensive commonly known as the isotope stable state hypothesis iss yakir and sternberg 2000 we assumed that δt is equal to the isotope values of plant water source under iss xiao et al 2012 under the premise of iss the isotope values of unfractionated water in the xylem can be used as substitute of the isotopic signal of transpiration water vapor hence we assume the water leaving the leaf has the same isotope composition as the xylem water dawson and ehleringer 1993 then we have 3 δ t δ x where δx is the isotopic ratio of xylem water and δt is the isotopic ratio of transpiration 2 4 4 estimation of the isotopic composition of evapotranspiration a direct measurement of δet in forest is difficult here we acquire δet from the intercept of the linear regression of atmospheric vapor δa with the inverse of the vapor mixing ratio measured across multiple heights over a specific time interval keeling 1958 4 δ a 1 c a c b g δ b g δ e t δ et where cbg and δbg are the mixing ratio and isotopic composition of the background i e local atmospheric vapor it is assumed that δet and δbg remain constant over the course of observations the threshold value of r2 in the keeling plot is 0 80 in this study fig a1 2 4 5 chamber based measurements of δt and δe recently the chamber method was introduced to directly measure δt wang et al 2010 dubbert et al 2014 and δe dubbert et al 2013 lu et al 2017 with the development of high frequency laser spectroscopy the major advantage of the chamber method is that it offers an alternative solution to estimating δet δe or δt without the use of complex isotopic models here two kinds of transparent cylindrical acrylic chambers were developed to measure δt and δe of the alpine forest ecosystem following the methods described by wang et al 2012 for δt the chamber is made of two half cylinders teflon lined transparent plastic that joined at a neoprene gasket allowing for leaf samples to be placed inside the chamber while still connected to plant xylem the base plate of the chamber was removed and a 1 4 brass bulkhead was installed to allow the isotope analyzer inlet to connect the chamber base two small air vents at the base are the only path that allow the ambient air to enter the chamber and mix with water vapor transpired by the leaves the mixed vapor was finally pumped to the analyzer through a 3 m long and 1 8 inner diameter tube consisting of a 0 5 m teflon tube and a 2 5 m stainless steel tube for isotopic analysis the residence time of vapor in the tube total volume 150 cm3 is only 18 s at a flow rate of 500 cm3 min which is negligible in terms of the chamber measurement furthermore to exclude the influence of residual vapor from previous measurements in the tube a break of 2 3 min was set between two subsequent measurements to guarantee that vapor concentration dropped back to background level before the next measurement for δe measurement a cap was directly placed on areas with bare soil the cap was tightly covered on the ground to seal the chamber this procedure ensures that only soil evaporation vapor δe as mixed with ambient air from air vents on the cap is measured by the analyzer the specifics of the chamber have been reported elsewhere cui et al 2020 in practice we first measured the ambient vapor isotopes for 2 min then we closed the chamber and made measurement of the mixed water vapor for another 2 min since the concentration and isotopic composition of water vapor in the chamber reached a steady state showed little change with time after 1 1 5 min we ignored the measured result for the first 1 5 min and only used the average results for the last 0 5 min as the measured δe this method provided respectively ambient and steady state values to calculate the two end members based on isotope and water mass balance the isotopic composition of source water vapor δ δt or δe was calculated as dubbert et al 2014 5 δ c m δ m c a δ a c m c a where δ is the isotopic composition of source water vapor e g plant transpired water or evaporation ca and cm are the concentrations of ambient and mixed water vapor in the chamber mol m 3 and δa and δm are the isotopic compositions of ambient and mixed water vapor in the chamber at the steady state 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of meteorological and biotic variables detailed information on the seasonality of the environmental variables is essential to assess seasonal variations in et zhu et al 2013 fig 2 shows the seasonal variations of daily air temperature ta relative humidity rh net radiation rn wind speed u daily precipitation amount p and half hour average of volumetric soil water content swc at different depth from the in situ flux observation daily air temperature varies in the range of 6 8 18 6 c fig 2a daily wind speed is 0 5 m s 1 in the monitoring period varying from 0 2 to 1 3 m s 1 fig 2b mean net radiation varied between 15 9 and 199 9 w m 2 fig 2b and daily average precipitation was 10 6 mm d 1 the soil moisture content is quite constant in deep layers and slight variations is in response to precipitation events but with lag of a couple of days 3 2 relationship between δ18o and δ2h of different water to provide context for interpreting the nearly continuous measurements of δet we first present the measurements of the liquid water pools fig 3 we compared the δ2h δ18o relations in different water samples precipitation soil water xylem and leaf water with the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 fig 3 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 8 07 δ18o 10 52 r2 0 99 p 0 001 n 80 fig 3 is very close to the global meteoric water line of δ2h 8 17 δ18o 10 56 rozanski et al 1993 the variation of δ18o and δ2h in the soil water ranged from 5 3 to 21 3 and from 60 6 to 165 8 with mean values of 15 3 and 119 6 respectively soil water isotope signatures are mainly scattered in the lower of the lmwl as soil water is more a signal of weighted average of precipitation the soil water line swl equation is δ2h 7 12δ18o 12 17 r2 0 88 p 0 001 n 362 with lower slope and intercept than the lmwl owning to the slight evaporation of soil water in storage after rainfall the equation of the plant xylem water line xwl is δ2h 6 90δ18o 26 69 r2 0 89 p 0 001 n 47 roughly parallel with the soil water line but with a more negative intercept due to the selective absorption of soil water at different levels we also identified a leaf water evaporation line lwl of δ2h 4 98δ18o 52 49 r2 0 93 p 0 001 n 47 specifically for the pinus yunnanensis in this alpine forest ecosystem the leaf water line is significantly lower in slope than in xylem water in association with the fractionation in leaf transpiration with a slight seasonal shift between pre monsoon season and monsoon season in association with the distinctive humidity change between the two seasons fig a1 3 3 seasonal and diurnal variations of atmospheric vapor isotopes the surface water vapor δ18o flux δv is a quantity frequently used to constrain the seasonal diurnal and synoptic variability in the regional water cycle we presented the in situ measured daily δ18o and h2o concentration of atmospheric vapor at 0 3m 1m 2m 3m 5m 10m 15m 20m above ground fig 4 not continuously measured above 3 0m the strong seasonality of vapor isotope is in association with the indian summer intrusion from early june with incidental increase of vapor mixing ratio the fluctuation of vapor isotope is lower in the non monsoon season but with large fluctuations in summer monsoon season owning to the local precipitation events both vapor isotopes and vapor mixing ratio show consistent change in different levels above ground since the canopy height of the study area is 5 10m while the continuously measured vapor isotopes are only available in 3 0 meter and below therefore we made a precise comparison of vapor isotopes and vapor mixing ratio in the spring season april to july when all level of measurement are available table a2 we see that the isotopes in different level are almost identical until to 20m fig 4 vapor mixing ratio show slight variation from ground to higher level with general decrease trend above 2m level in the calculation of isotopes in evapotranspiration we used the midday vapor isotope data instead of daily average hence we also evaluated the diurnal change of vapor isotope at the sampling site the 24 h ensemble average values of the vapor δ18o at 3 m height measured from 13 to 16 october 2019 in non raining days fig a3 the overall diurnal change of vapor δ18o is smaller within 2 in all the four days 3 4 seasonal precipitation isotopes in the forest ecosystem we presented the daily precipitation δ18o d excess and precipitation amount from lijiang station fig 5 precipitation δ18o shows a seasonal shift from the higher value in the earlier summer of may june to the lower δ18o period of the raining season until to september this seasonal precipitation is consistent with the seasonal feature of monsoon type precipitation signal daily δ18o values ranged from 21 4 to 1 8 with a weighted mean value of 13 0 the d excess values ranged from 1 3 to 17 6 with a weighted mean of 10 9 slight lower precipitation d excess in less rainfall days are probably related to the reevaporation of falling raindrops which lowered d excess in the left rainfall 3 5 seasonal variation of the three flux endmembers δe δt and δet based on the observed vapor δ18o together with the concurrent meteorological observation we calculated the isotopic compositions of evaporation δe transpiration δt and evapotranspiration δet every other day using the methods descripted in the earlier section fig 6 shows the seasonal δ18o variations of δe δt and δet during early afternoon hours 13 00 15 00 in the observation days we also presented the daily precipitation δ18o variations to discuss their linkage fig 6 on average δt is 2 8 higher than δet and 10 4 higher than δe three of them show parallel temporal variations with the largest magnitude in δe variation indicating the conherent influence on the seasonal variations of the three a comparison with daily precipitation isotope demonstrates that precipitation strongly impact the temporal variation of δe δt and δet correlation analysis also shows the significant relationship between the three end members and precipitation δ18o r 2 0 85 0 55 0 83 p 0 001 respectively suggest that the former was strongly affected by precipitation isotopes 3 6 seasonal propagation of t et estimation in forest ecosystem we calculated the relative contribution of t to et t et based on the keeling cg method by using both δ18o and δ2h measured in midday periods the temporal variations of estimated t et from the dual isotopes are presented in fig 8 we also made the averaged t et from the two isotopes for a robust estimation of the seasonal characters and plotted in fig 7 as well results show a strong seasonal t et cycle varying between 0 59 0 81 in the pre monsoon season of june the t et ratio shows a strong increasing trend rising from 0 5 to 0 7 in the monsoon season the t et ratio is higher with slight fluctuation of around 0 7 0 8 in average the calculated ratio from δ18o based method is identical with the δ2h based results yet there is a slight bias between the two with time the average t et is 0 73 from isotopic labeling indicating that the evapotranspiration is mainly composed of plant transpiration in the pinus yunnanensis ecosystem we also presented the temporal variation of lai in the observing days showing general similar trend with the average t et however the ratio becomes relatively constant after the pinus yunnanensis established dense foliage lai 5 24 confirming that t et ratio become less sensitive to lai variation in the late growing season zhou et al 2016 we used the t et acquired from the two isotopes measurement and eddy covariance measured et ranging from 0 8 to 2 2 mm d 1 and with an average of 1 8 mm d 1 to partition the seasonal variations of soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t only on clear days fig 8 we identified a clear seasonal pattern of transpiration increasing from about 0 47 mm d 1 in the beginning of june to over 1 0 mm d 1 abruptly from the middle of june and keeping higher value until to the end of observation soil evaporation however shows little variations throughout the observation period varying in the range of 0 32 to 0 64 mm d 1 therefore the seasonal variations of evapotranspiration are mainly due to the change in transpiration less from soil evaporation 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of t et ratio in a global scale partitioning et is expected to become increasingly important as available water resources continue to diminish an improved understanding of where losses occur and how much water is used through plant transpiration can benefit the understanding of the hydrologic systems which affect stream flow ground water recharge and weather conditions as well as plant biomass production and associated carbon sequestration kool et al 2014 in this section we further compared our results of the estimated midday t et with previous studies fig 9 in a broad space scale this summary of the available estimated midday t et ratios on regional and global includes a diverse range of ecosystems such as cropland grassland woodland shrubland and paddy fields in africa europe america asia and oceania we see a large range of midday t et estimation of 0 15 0 98 owing to different approaches used in the estimation and different research scales and ecosystems as a comparison we also added our result in this graph the range of midday t et 0 59 0 81 in our study is within the broad range of previous studies schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 fatichi and pappas 2017 our midday average t et 0 73 0 06 value were slightly higher than results from global long term average one likely reason is that the estimated midday t et ratio is observed in the hours of maximum transpiration but not a daily average another possible influence is the lack of observation for intercepted precipitation by vegetation canopy in our study as isotope observations were only conducted during the clear periods evaporation over vegetation canopy interception was not included in evapotranspiration for keeling cg methods however interception dew or preceding rain may even present in no rain period and bias the values of δt and δet measurements conducted in this condition should be excluded and not involved in t et calculation on raining days interception evaporation may constitute a significant part of evapotranspiration miralles et al 2010 wei et al 2017 additionally the evergreen coniferous forests are distributed in humid climates zone with higher wet canopy evaporation rates than other biomes and therefore enhancing this effect wei et al 2017 hence our estimated midday t et of 0 73 may be to some extent overestimated when compared to long term means due to the lack of interception evaporation after precipitation different techniques and study scales may also lead to the variability for instance hydrometric and isotope based methods produce higher transpiration fraction values than the models driven by meteorological measurements and sap flow meters sutanto et al 2014 seasonal t et can be extremely variable within a given year at the same site in association with climate change and differential plant responses scott et al 2006 in this study the t et variation shows a strong seasonality with the lowest value of 0 5 0 7 in pre monsoon season of june and higher ratio of approximately of 0 7 0 8 throughout the monsoon season t et increased almost continuously with the vegetation growth in the early growing season and became relatively constant after the pinus yunnanensis established dense foliage lai 5 24 t et ratios estimated from both δ18o and δ2h are quite consistent but the estimate from δ2h is slightly higher than from δ18o in average in particular in the heavy raining days during august september overall transpiration is the most robust engine for water transportation in southwest forest consistent with other ecosystems worldwide schlesinger and jasechko 2014 4 2 factors influencing t et estimation in the forest ecosystem to evaluate how environmental swc vpd and ta and biological factors here we considered only lai influencing the seasonal t et variations correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis were performed between these daily values with t et ratios fig 10 the correlation analysis results show that swc and lai have a significant influence on t et and are the primary controlling factor followed by ta and vpd previous studies have consistently demonstrated that there is an observable relationship between t et and lai at the seasonal scale wang et al 2014 wei et al 2015 berkelhammer et al 2016 our isotope based results reconfirmed this relationship verifying that lai plays an important role in the hydrological cycle of alpine coniferous ecosystems at entire raining season critically we found the influence of swc is of sufficient magnitude comparable to the impact of lai on the seasonal t et variation fig 10a b partial correlation analysis further suggests that the individual contribution from swc is more substantial than that of lai fig 10c this may be because that the t et for evergreen vegetation is mainly controlled by soil water content since the inter annual change in vegetation cover is quite small for evergreens zhou et al 2016 in addition lai varies little in alpine forest regions at entire raining season the larger lai representing tree size and density will enhance transpiration while curb evaporation both because of the larger tree canopy and because of the larger shaded under canopy fraction raz yaseef et al 2012 based on the observations on the forest ecosystem in sw china we have developed an explanation of the underlying mechanisms controlling the changes of t et at seasonal scales the lower t et in spring was related to the lower lai in the early stage of the growing season combined with lower swc corresponding to less precipitation lai reached a peak in summer and intense precipitation elevated swc and thus brought sufficient water for high levels of plant transpiration under the same lai condition increasing soil moisture may reduce t et via increasing soil e wei et al 2018 other authors have also emphasized the role of soil water content in controlling t et hu et al 2009 liu et al 2002 although t et was well correlated with swc at the forest ecosystem in sw china fig 10a the relationship may have regional variation and not be ubiquitous instead being vegetation type related or spatiotemporal scales related according to a global t et dataset as synthesized by wang et al 2014 showed generally low correlations with soil water potential however swc was a constraining factor in arid or semi arid climates but not in humid or semi humid climates limited studies that have reported the swc dependence to date were located in croplands e g liu et al 2002 wei et al 2018 taking the example of wheat the main depths of root water uptake are from 0 to 40 cm depths while soil evaporation is controlled by soil moisture at the depth 20 cm zhang et al 2011 again causing weak correlations between t et and swc hence we are cautious to believe that both environmental partial correlation coefficient 0 44 and biological factors 0 09 dominated the variations of t et in our alpine coniferous ecosystem region in southwest china but only in june september against with the previous studies that arguing t et is mainly controlled by lai hu et al 2009 wei et al 2015 the same results also found in other ecosystems of earlier studies cui et al 2020 liu et al 2002 actually the correlation relationship analyzed in this study mainly reflects the influence of seasonal changes fig 10 however when focusing on a certain season after june 28th the relationship both lai and swc are not significant with t et ratios fig a4 the specific influencing factors in a certain season need to be further studied we are aware that this conclusion is very limited as our field experiments are from june to september not cover a full year a longer timeframe might demonstrate t et to have slightly different lai and swc dependencies at alpine forest regions future measurement campaigns that cover a full year will enable testing of our discovered relationships between t et lai and swc during other seasons 4 3 performance of chamber method in the forest ecosystem to evaluate the performance of each method in estimating δe and δt estimated isotopic composition from different methods new customized chamber and craig gordon model are presented for comparison fig 11 the time series diagrams of δe and δt estimated by the two methods are also presented to discern the detail differences between the two methods fig a5 the new customized chamber method presented in this study shows good agreements with craig gordon model the results from the chamber based mass balance approach and the craig gordon model matches well in δe with r2 of 0 82 0 88 p 0 01 respectively for δ18o and δ2h fig 11 for δt the relation coefficients are r2 of 0 63 0 65 p 0 01 respectively for δ18o and δ2h these statistics are encouraging and highlights the robustness of the chamber method in evaluation for evaporation e and transpiration t the δe values of c g model calculation is slightly lower than the chamber based method 21 0 4 5 vs 18 6 3 8 for c g model calculations and chamber based for δ18o respectively the enrichment result 2 is most likely caused by air condensation inside the chamber or sampling tube this is generally consistent with the suggestion of that the δe values for δ2h of chamber method were consistently more enriched than the c g model calculations wang et al 2013 this may be because of an inherent limitation of the chamber method in association with its impact on environmental conditions inside the chamber potentially affecting the measured isotope values dubbert et al 2014 air temperature in the chamber increased 2 c above ambient levels after 5 min in an open cork oak woodland dubbert et al 2014 this warming inadvertently enhanced the estimated soil evaporation in the chamber enriched δe relative to the c g model wang et al 2013 another possible reason for the enrichment result 2 between c g model calculations and chamber method is that the uncertainties of kinetic enrichment factor εk in c g model which εk associated with diffusion of water through the soil zhang et al 2010 additionally this may also lead to systematic bias because of the identification of the evaporating front in c g model dubbert et al 2013 the location of evaporation fronts is influenced by meteorological conditions soil water content and soil texture zimmermann et al 1967 using the c g model in conjunction with a climate chamber controlled experiment rothfuss et al 2010 showed that the failure to determine the evaporating front may produce a large bias within these consistence in the c g model calculations and chamber based observation confirmed the representative of vegetation in the chamber although we also suggest the necessity of comparison in more extensive area the uncertainty in the measured isotope data from the chamber method is rather small the average standard deviation of measured δ18o and δ2h of δt are 0 6 and 1 4 during the observations period very close to the precision of laboratory based values and lower than reported by wang et al 2012 1 0 for δ18o and 1 6 for δ2h there was no significant difference of standard deviation between δe and δt new customized chamber method will provide a new opportunity to investigate large scale t or e behaviors but require further validation for the independent measurements the potential advantage of using the new customized chamber method is the relatively consistent error sources in the isotope compositions of three fluxes e g from the same laser instrument which might be diminished or even canceled out when calculating the et partitioning wang et al 2013 4 4 uncertainty and possible error source in t et ratio estimation here we made the sensitivity test results and discussed the uncertainties and possible error sources in the keeling cg method δe δt and δet the estimated δet in this study was acquired by using the keeling plot method however this method can produce uncertainty and errors which is inherent in the keeling plots pataki et al 2003 nickerson and risk 2009 wei et al 2015 earlier studies showed that the error in δet estimation could be quite large even for a high r2 value in the keeling plots e g atmospheric fluctuations and unsteady diffusion lee et al 2006 nickerson and risk 2009 therefore to constrain the uncertainty in the estimated t et ratio we made the sensitivity test by assuming a 1σ variation in δet the results showed a 1σ changes in δet will result in a t et ratio change of 0 30 0 28 from δet 18o and 0 50 0 50 from δet 2h table 1 the total uncertainties in average 1σ is 13 8 2 1 for δet 18o and 117 0 20 2 for δet 2h however we argue that the bias from δet could be small since we did not find large variability of δet observed in the midday 13 00 15 00 fig 6 then we evaluated the uncertainty derived from δe variations the water δ18o at the soil evaporating front δs mainly controls the estimation of δe in the model craig and gordon 1965 therefore precise determination of the evaporating front depth was critical because δs varied considerably near the evaporating front dubbert et al 2013 in this study the vertical variations of soil water δ18o indicate that the evaporating front is at 5 cm the use of evaporating front water in other soil depth would induce a maximum t et bias of 0 16 and 0 34 based on δ18o and δ2h respectively in the sensitivity test we also showed that a 1σ changes in δe will result in a t et ration change of 0 30 to 0 12 from δe 18o and 0 89 to 0 16 from δe 2h table 1 the test result shows that the estimated t et ratio change could be large in particular with δe 2h decrease the total uncertainties in average 1σ is 21 0 4 6 for δe 18o and 156 4 39 0 for δe 2h in terms of the variations of δt the bias in the simulated t et ratio could be 0 19 0 34 from δt 18o and 0 27 0 65 from δt 2h table 1 with a 1σ changes in δt the total uncertainties in average 1σ is 11 2 2 5 for δt 18o and 103 7 20 8 for δt 2h this uncertainly is mainly resulted from the short observation hours while a full day observation is unavailable fortunately although a full day observation is encouraged williams et al 2004 short hours observation in midday and early afternoon is more in practice sutanto et al 2014 this is because the isotopic steady state iss is achieved by midday and or early afternoon and transpiration from plants is usually at its maximum with a short turnover time of leaf water and thus constrains δt close to the isotopic composition of plant source water wen et al 2016 additionally although some studies mentioned nss occurs even in midday for forests e g lai and ehleringer 2011 our results show that δet fall in the range bounded by δt and δe such that δe δet δt indicating that isotopic steady state iss was reached during the midday 13 00 15 00 therefore we suggested that an iss was a reasonable assumption in our observations 5 conclusions we presented a detailed observation work on the seasonal variation of dual isotopes in various water reservoirs and the isotope signal transfers in between including atmospheric vapor precipitation soil water and xylem water in an alpine forest ecosystem during the growing season in southwest china the seasonal isotope signals in various water reservoirs tell a detailed transfer processes from precipitation to soil water xylem water and leaf water with the involved fractionation allowing for a diagnose of the evapotranspiration for the specific pinus yunnanensis ecosystem we made an estimation of the t et ratio by using the isotope approach the estimated seasonal t et ranged from 0 59 to 0 81 with a near continuous increase over time in the early growing season and a plateau level of over 0 75 during the peak growing season the mean t et ratio of 0 73 0 06 is within the broad range of previous literature but slightly higher than global long term average highlights the importance of transpiration in the total evapotranspiration in the pinus yunnanensis ecosystem we also identified a clear seasonal pattern of transpiration increasing from about 0 47 mm d 1 in the beginning of june to over 1 0 mm d 1 abruptly from the middle of june and keeping higher value until to september a simple driver analysis showed that t et was correlated with environmental conditions here soil water content swc in alpine forest regions at entire raining season in june september in addition to lai challenging the earlier recognition of lai dominated control this result is likely related to the slight changes of lai in the growing season for pinus yunnanensis ecosystem hence longer time continuous monitoring is still necessary and we are also aware the sensitivity of controls on estimated t et at different time scale interested comparison of the results of customized chamber and craig gordon model demonstrated that the two methods are in robust consistence in estimating δe or δt with high correlation coefficients our results here highlighted the reliability of chamber method in isotope water cycle in the ecosystem with reasonable uncertainty and reconfirm the findings to observe δet by using the chamber method directly and comparing it with other methods such as keeling plot approach sap flow meters bowen ratio systems lysimeters and eddy covariance systems as well as methods to isolate the individual t and e components these results presented in this paper shed light on the mechanisms underlying temporal change of terrestrial transpiration and will provide far reaching impact on alpine forest managers and ecosystem protection under ongoing climate

3524,quantifying the regional evapotranspiration is critical in terrestrial water balance and global water cycle while partitioning of evapotranspiration is challenging but fundamental to predict the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under climate changes here we performed in situ measurements of water isotopes in atmospheric vapor plant tissues and soil pools in a pinus yunnanensis forest ecosystem in southwest china aiming to partitioning et by estimating the stable isotopic compositions of et and that of its two components i e plant transpiration and soil water evaporation we used combined high frequency laser spectroscopy and chamber methods to constrain the estimates of t et we first found that the estimated daily t et ratio ranges from 0 59 to 0 81 with an apparent increasing shift in the early growing season and maintaining a plateau level of over 0 75 during the peak growing season this higher averaged t et of 0 73 0 06 indicates that plant transpiration is the main component of evapotranspiration the estimated δe and δt are in agreement with result from customized chamber method we also found that in monsoon season in june september soil water content is the main control of t et variations with leaf area index playing only a partial role our study confirms the critical impact of soil water on the seasonal change of t et in pinus yunnanensis ecosystem such as the sw china however we are also aware the sensitivity of controls on estimated t et at different time scale interested our results here provide insight into the regional hydrological cycle in alpine forest ecosystem and potentially benefits many applications from forest ecosystem protection to paleo isotope archives keywords evapotranspiration partitioning water isotopes seasonality forest ecosystem southwest china 1 introduction increasing stress from climate change exerted its impact on water cycle of the global terrestrial ecosystem and hydrological cycle is expected to be intensified and to alter evapotranspiration et with implications for feedback to regional and global climate jung et al 2010 evapotranspiration is the most important process that influences ecosystem water loss and a major determinant of the water budget and energy balance in the ecosystem however in the terrestrial water cycle budget evapotranspiration determined by the intensities and relative proportions of evaporation from the soil e and transpiration through the stomata of plants t is still a major uncertainty especially in the stress of climate change since t fluxes link the water and carbon cycles scott et al 2006 it transfers a significant portion of water from the soil to the atmosphere with consequences for regional humidity and precipitation patterns aguiar et al 1996 kool et al 2014 prince et al 1998 therefore quantitative estimation of t in the total et t et has long been acknowledged to play a crucial role in water resource management yield estimation the water cycle and climate change from plot scale to global scale e g jasechko et al 2013 kool et al 2014 in addition as water limited environments currently comprise about half of the earth s land surface and are expected to continue to expand newman et al 2006 the issue of accurately assessing et and its components has become more acute in recent studies in related to isotope hydrology ecosystem processes and climate change dubbert et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 jefferson et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 on a global scale concerns about climate change have raised interest in the connection between et and carbon sequestration scott et al 2006 and the influence of et partitioning on land atmosphere patterns which affect climate simulations lawrence et al 2007 consequently the topic of evapotranspiration partitioning has gained much attention in the scientific community e g berkelhammer et al 2016 lu et al 2017 at present various methods have been developed for et partitioning at different spatial and temporal scales coenders gerrits et al 2014 fatichi and pappas 2017 scott and biederman 2017 wei et al 2017 such as those from field observations zhou et al 2016 remote sensing model estimation miralles et al 2016 process based model simulations wang erlandsson et al 2014 and reanalysis data kochendorfer and ramírez 2010 isotopic measurements good et al 2015 have been increasingly used to partition et at these scales owning to the sensitivity of isotope fractionation in evaporation the stable isotope method for et partitioning is usually based on the principle of isotope mass balance thus the analysis of the water stable isotopic compositions within soil vegetation and the atmosphere are the core issue xiao et al 2018 in spite of the et partitioning efforts over the past decades there is a significant discrepancy among global t et estimated by different methods and large uncertainty still exists at different spatial temporal coverages at the global scale the magnitude of t et differs substantially 20 90 among different methods coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 good et al 2015 maxwell and condon 2016 miralles et al 2016 wei et al 2017 the distinct isotope effects of t and e showed that t represents 80 90 of terrestrial et at basin and global scales by using a combination of isotope measurement techniques and satellite observations jasechko et al 2013 such high ratio was questioned and challenged by following correspondence schlesinger and jasechko 2014 coenders gerrits et al 2014 lately good et al 2015 adjusted the global t et ratio to 64 13 by using the satellite isotope data and large scale water balance method wei et al 2017 modified the global t et to be about 57 with a leaf area index lai based et partitioning algorithm the uncertainty is likely persistent since plot scale et partitioning observations at relevant spatiotemporal scales for large scale t et upscaling wei et al 2017 constraint lian et al 2018 and validation rigden et al 2018 are still lack at plot scale isotopic methods have been widely used for et partitioning at different ecosystem including forests dubbert et al 2013 savanna yepez et al 2003 grassland good et al 2014 and farmland wei et al 2015 for the past two decades the main effect involved is to determine the environment factors that controls t et changes which is necessary for better upscaling hydrological cycling to large areas wei et al 2017 as well as land surface modeling ma et al 2017 forest ecosystems cover approximately 30 of the earth s land surface hansen et al 2014 and play an essential ecological role in the earth atmosphere interaction the earth s surface energy balance and hydrological cycle the alpine forest exerts a strong regulating function on preventing soil erosion and regulating climate system altieri et al 2018 many previous effects have addressed the water cycle in association with the forest ecosystem with a specification on et participation by using the steam model wang erlandsson et al 2014 simulated the global et and its components and found that deciduous broadleaved forest had the largest t et value 0 64 and evergreen coniferous forests had the smallest value 0 50 liu et al 2020 used eddy covariance technique and sap flow probes and concluded that the overall t et varies in the range of 0 66 0 84 in a larch forest in most northern china however previous studies have focused mainly on lower elevations or only estimated the gross evapotranspiration and a gap exists in the study of seasonal evapotranspiration processes and its controlling factors in alpine forest ecosystems stress increased in recent years to protect the forest ecosystem in southwest china due to their ecological importance characterized by ecological security barrier and vulnerable global climate change coniferous leaved forests are one of the wide transcontinental distribution and keystone forest types in subalpine forest ecosystem here we reported a new result on isotope based land surface water cycle in a typical subalpine forest region in lijiang yunnan guizhou plateau in southwest china by employing a high frequency laser spectrometry and chamber method throughout an entire raining season we made continuous measurement of isotopes in atmospheric vapor and evapotranspiration in the raining season june to september of 2019 δe and δt were directly measured by newly customized chambers or calculated from commonly used non process based empirical models keeling plot craig gordon model and isotopic steady state assumption the paper aims first to determine the seasonal shift of water isotope in different water bodies and water transfers among precipitation soil water xylem water then to evaluate the variations of e t and et in pinus yunnanensis forest ecosystem and partition evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation for an improved understanding of the dynamics that drive the seasonal variations of t et 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description we made observation of water isotopes in precipitation plant soil water and atmospheric vapor at lijiang forest ecosystem research station 100 10 e 27 00 n 3250 m above sea level at the southern edge of a yulong mountain southwest china yulong mountain is recognized as the southern boundary that alpine glaciers can survive in the asia monsoon region and these glaciers are extremely sensitive to climate change he et al 2002 this region belongs to the hengduan mountains region and is located in the southeastern margin of the qinghai tibet plateau known as the center of the mountains of southwest china biodiversity hotspot the region is featured with a high altitude monsoon climate with indian monsoon intrusion in summer and persistent westerly jet in winter the average annual precipitation is 935 mm with distinctive seasonality of over 90 of the annual precipitation in summer from june to september while little precipitation in dry winter season from october to next may niu et al 2013 the monthly air temperature varies from 5 9 c in january to 17 9 c in july with annual average of 12 8 c based on data from lijiang meteorological station feng et al 2006 the overlying soil in a yulong snow mountain is loam and clay according to the fao soil classification the vertical vegetation zonation is obvious with elevational gradient in yulong mountain at the lowest elevation 2650 m the forest vegetation is dominated by pinus armandii at 2950 m the forest vegetation shifts to the dominated evergreen conifers p armandii and pinus yunnanensis and the sclerophyllous evergreen broad leaved quercus spinosa forming a mixed coniferous sclerophyllous broad leaved forest above 3250 m the forest vegetation is dominated by quercus guyavifolia and p yunnanensis at the highest elevation 3850 m the forest composition is dominated by quercus aquifolioides abies georgei and rhododendron rubiginosum luo et al 2016 the annual average evapotranspiration of the subalpine coniferous forest is 438 83 mm accounting for 42 17 of the annual precipitation in the ecosystem and the maximum occurs in wet season lin et al 2019 in this paper we selected pinus yunnanensis as the target tree for transpiration observation by water isotope approach the height of the community varies from 5 m to 10 m in the sampling plot in this study the growing season is defined as the period from may to september 2 2 sampling and measurement we performed continuous monitoring of water isotopes in atmospheric vapor soil water xylem water leaf water simultaneously during may to september of 2019 we also collected precipitation for isotope measurement as input water isotope signal during the same period following we made description on how we made the monitoring and sampling work at the experiment plot 2 2 1 vapor isotope measurement we used a picarro l2130 i high frequency wavelength scanning cavity decay spectrum analyzer for atmospheric vapor isotope measurement the analyzer is placed in room on the site to ensure the stability of the ambient air temperature two models i e solid model and vapor model were switched to measure water isotopes in plant and soil water samples cui et al 2017 or the near surface water vapor steen larsen et al 2013 in vapor mode the measurement and calibration system are comprised of a standard delivery module a0101 a vaporizer module a0211 picarro inc santa clara ca and an analyzer the schematic diagram working principle and calibration process of the crds analyzer was described elsewhere wang and dickinson 2012 in practice instrumental drifts and humidity dependence of water vapor isotopes were corrected before normalizing to v smow scale and calibration measurement was performed every 12 h following the protocols of steen larsen et al 2013 we measured the atmospheric vapor isotopes at 8 layers along a vertical profile of 0 5 1 2 3 5 10 15 and 20 m above the ground utilizing eight way solenoid valves and from 13 00 15 00 and 23 00 next 8 00 h local standard time utc 8 every day each level was measured for 10 min during the noon hours from 13 00 15 00 and the average of the last 5min was used to establish the keeling plot to obtain δet since soil water and plant water isotopes were measured in daytime using the same isotope analyzer the vapor isotope measurement was intermittent in daytime the precision was 0 2 for vapor δ18o and 0 5 for vapor δ2h 2 2 2 plant and soil water sampling and isotope measurement soil water xylem water and leaf water were measured at 13 00 to 15 00 every other day and three duplicated samples were measured each time and the average value is used for representative a total number of 362 47 and 47 samples of soil water xylem water and leaf water were collected for isotope analysis occasional samples were also collected after raining events to reveal the direct raining impact on soil and xylem water isotopes in each measurement the collected xylem samples from the base of the plant green tissue e g outer leaf were stripped and only the white i e non transpiring tissue was used for measurement we measured plant samples at different sides of the tree east west south north and from three mature trees for the representative of the measurement soil samples were collected at depth of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 50 cm and 80 cm at each time with a hand drill at sites near the three trees plant xylem pinus yunnanensis and soil samples were measured by the isotope analyzer in solid mode combined with an induction module im the solid mode allowed for the simultaneous measurement of the isotopic compositions of small solid samples and the removal of organic contamination from within the samples in the field quade et al 2019 the measurement of the plant and soil water immediately after sampling will also reduce the influence of evaporation on water isotopes three laboratory standard waters were used for calibration s1 δ18o 2 83 δ2h 27 42 s2 δ18o 29 84 δ2h 222 84 and s3 δ18o 15 29 δ2h 110 30 which roughly cover the ranges of the measured water isotope ratios for the measurement procedure 3 μl of laboratory standard water s1 and s3 was injected onto glass filter paper whatman plc maidstone uk for calibration prior to sample measurements xylem samples were wrapped in small tri fold metal strips picarro inc santa clara ca and placed inside a 4 ml glass vial the vial was inserted into the im and heated through induction and the evaporated vapor was sent to analyzer for isotope measurement for soil samples each soil sample 4μg was put into a steel pipe picarro inc santa clara ca with 20 mm in length and 5 mm in diameter and also placed inside a vial this process generally required 5 min to measure for one xylem sample and 10 15 min to measure for one soil water sample the measured precision is 0 20 for δ18o and 0 69 for δ2h the detailed measurement and calibration processes followed the protocol of cui et al 2017 2 2 3 precipitation sampling and measurement we used two methods to collect precipitation samples daily precipitation samples were collected at 20 00 in the raining day using a container specifically designed to avoid re evaporation of collected water samples in addition 170 precipitation event samples were collected in the period from may to september 2019 all samples were stored in plastic bottles and frozen in refrigerator before laboratory analysis the collected precipitation samples were analyzed in laboratory by using picarro l2140 i liquid water isotope analyzer for both δ18o and δ2h all measured results were normalized to vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water with precision within 0 05 for δ18o and 0 5 for δ2h 2 3 micrometeorological and eddy covariance measurements we installed the eddy covariance ec instruments meteorology station at the sampling station including an open path infrared co2 h2o gas analyzer li 7500 a li cor usa and a three dimensional sonic anemometer thermometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa mounted 3 m above the ground the data were stored in a cr6 data logger and cf storage card at a sampling frequency of 10 hz the raw data acquired at 10 hz were processed using the postprocessing software edire and quality control of the half hourly flux data were conducted as described in earlier literature xu et al 2013 and will only be summarized here micrometeorological parameters air temperature relative humidity wind speed precipitation amount four component radiation three layers of soil temperature and soil moisture profiles soil heat flux etc were recorded under 1 hz additional details concerning data acquisition were described liu and zhang 2012 eichelmann et al 2018 based on measurements from the ec system the energy balance closure ratio was evaluated at this site and result shows a relatively high energy balance closure ratio of 0 88 indicating that the energy balance closure problem wilson et al 2001 is not a major concern for the site and system leaf area index lai 1 hour composited 0 25 data from the era 5 product were used in the discussion about the control of seasonal t et ratio the values proved to be broadly consistent with observations data were downloaded from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts https www ecmwf int 2 4 methods 2 4 1 isotopic flux partitioning water stable isotopes have been widely used to estimate plot scale et partitioning yepez et al 2003 good et al 2014 wei et al 2018 owing to the distinctive isotope signal of δet δe and δt resulted from deviated fractionation between evaporation and transpiration utilizing a two end member e and t mixing model the partitioning can be expressed as the three isotope signals by the following equation yakir and sternberg 2000 1 t et δ et δ e δ t δ e where δet δe and δt are isotopic compositions of evapotranspiration et soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t respectively this equation requires that the isotopic ratio of the et e and t fluxes to be known for model estimation 2 4 2 isotopic composition of soil evaporation considering both equilibrium and kinetic fractionation during the phased change of water from liquid to vapor the craig gordon model craig and gordon 1965 is the most common method widely employed for estimating δe and has been successfully applied under different conditions yepez et al 2003 rothfuss et al 2010 good et al 2014 wei et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 using the isotopic composition of soil water at the evaporating surface δs and vapor measured at the reference height δv as well as various meteorological variables δe can be calculated as follows 2 δ e α e 1 δ s h δ v ε eq 1 h ε k 1 h 10 3 1 h ε k where ɑ e 1 is the equilibrium fractionation factor calculated as a function of water surface temperature majoube 1971 ε eq 1 1 ɑ e 103 represents the equilibrium fractionation effect ε k is the isotopic kinetic fractionation effect if the diffusion is molecular then ε k of δ18o is equal to 28 merlivat 1978 h is the relative humidity normalized to the surface soil temperature craig and gordon 1965 2 4 3 isotopic composition of plant transpiration isotope mass conservation requires that the isotopic composition of leaf transpiration water should be equal to that of soil water absorbed by roots at midday and in the early afternoon when et is most intensive commonly known as the isotope stable state hypothesis iss yakir and sternberg 2000 we assumed that δt is equal to the isotope values of plant water source under iss xiao et al 2012 under the premise of iss the isotope values of unfractionated water in the xylem can be used as substitute of the isotopic signal of transpiration water vapor hence we assume the water leaving the leaf has the same isotope composition as the xylem water dawson and ehleringer 1993 then we have 3 δ t δ x where δx is the isotopic ratio of xylem water and δt is the isotopic ratio of transpiration 2 4 4 estimation of the isotopic composition of evapotranspiration a direct measurement of δet in forest is difficult here we acquire δet from the intercept of the linear regression of atmospheric vapor δa with the inverse of the vapor mixing ratio measured across multiple heights over a specific time interval keeling 1958 4 δ a 1 c a c b g δ b g δ e t δ et where cbg and δbg are the mixing ratio and isotopic composition of the background i e local atmospheric vapor it is assumed that δet and δbg remain constant over the course of observations the threshold value of r2 in the keeling plot is 0 80 in this study fig a1 2 4 5 chamber based measurements of δt and δe recently the chamber method was introduced to directly measure δt wang et al 2010 dubbert et al 2014 and δe dubbert et al 2013 lu et al 2017 with the development of high frequency laser spectroscopy the major advantage of the chamber method is that it offers an alternative solution to estimating δet δe or δt without the use of complex isotopic models here two kinds of transparent cylindrical acrylic chambers were developed to measure δt and δe of the alpine forest ecosystem following the methods described by wang et al 2012 for δt the chamber is made of two half cylinders teflon lined transparent plastic that joined at a neoprene gasket allowing for leaf samples to be placed inside the chamber while still connected to plant xylem the base plate of the chamber was removed and a 1 4 brass bulkhead was installed to allow the isotope analyzer inlet to connect the chamber base two small air vents at the base are the only path that allow the ambient air to enter the chamber and mix with water vapor transpired by the leaves the mixed vapor was finally pumped to the analyzer through a 3 m long and 1 8 inner diameter tube consisting of a 0 5 m teflon tube and a 2 5 m stainless steel tube for isotopic analysis the residence time of vapor in the tube total volume 150 cm3 is only 18 s at a flow rate of 500 cm3 min which is negligible in terms of the chamber measurement furthermore to exclude the influence of residual vapor from previous measurements in the tube a break of 2 3 min was set between two subsequent measurements to guarantee that vapor concentration dropped back to background level before the next measurement for δe measurement a cap was directly placed on areas with bare soil the cap was tightly covered on the ground to seal the chamber this procedure ensures that only soil evaporation vapor δe as mixed with ambient air from air vents on the cap is measured by the analyzer the specifics of the chamber have been reported elsewhere cui et al 2020 in practice we first measured the ambient vapor isotopes for 2 min then we closed the chamber and made measurement of the mixed water vapor for another 2 min since the concentration and isotopic composition of water vapor in the chamber reached a steady state showed little change with time after 1 1 5 min we ignored the measured result for the first 1 5 min and only used the average results for the last 0 5 min as the measured δe this method provided respectively ambient and steady state values to calculate the two end members based on isotope and water mass balance the isotopic composition of source water vapor δ δt or δe was calculated as dubbert et al 2014 5 δ c m δ m c a δ a c m c a where δ is the isotopic composition of source water vapor e g plant transpired water or evaporation ca and cm are the concentrations of ambient and mixed water vapor in the chamber mol m 3 and δa and δm are the isotopic compositions of ambient and mixed water vapor in the chamber at the steady state 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of meteorological and biotic variables detailed information on the seasonality of the environmental variables is essential to assess seasonal variations in et zhu et al 2013 fig 2 shows the seasonal variations of daily air temperature ta relative humidity rh net radiation rn wind speed u daily precipitation amount p and half hour average of volumetric soil water content swc at different depth from the in situ flux observation daily air temperature varies in the range of 6 8 18 6 c fig 2a daily wind speed is 0 5 m s 1 in the monitoring period varying from 0 2 to 1 3 m s 1 fig 2b mean net radiation varied between 15 9 and 199 9 w m 2 fig 2b and daily average precipitation was 10 6 mm d 1 the soil moisture content is quite constant in deep layers and slight variations is in response to precipitation events but with lag of a couple of days 3 2 relationship between δ18o and δ2h of different water to provide context for interpreting the nearly continuous measurements of δet we first present the measurements of the liquid water pools fig 3 we compared the δ2h δ18o relations in different water samples precipitation soil water xylem and leaf water with the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 fig 3 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 8 07 δ18o 10 52 r2 0 99 p 0 001 n 80 fig 3 is very close to the global meteoric water line of δ2h 8 17 δ18o 10 56 rozanski et al 1993 the variation of δ18o and δ2h in the soil water ranged from 5 3 to 21 3 and from 60 6 to 165 8 with mean values of 15 3 and 119 6 respectively soil water isotope signatures are mainly scattered in the lower of the lmwl as soil water is more a signal of weighted average of precipitation the soil water line swl equation is δ2h 7 12δ18o 12 17 r2 0 88 p 0 001 n 362 with lower slope and intercept than the lmwl owning to the slight evaporation of soil water in storage after rainfall the equation of the plant xylem water line xwl is δ2h 6 90δ18o 26 69 r2 0 89 p 0 001 n 47 roughly parallel with the soil water line but with a more negative intercept due to the selective absorption of soil water at different levels we also identified a leaf water evaporation line lwl of δ2h 4 98δ18o 52 49 r2 0 93 p 0 001 n 47 specifically for the pinus yunnanensis in this alpine forest ecosystem the leaf water line is significantly lower in slope than in xylem water in association with the fractionation in leaf transpiration with a slight seasonal shift between pre monsoon season and monsoon season in association with the distinctive humidity change between the two seasons fig a1 3 3 seasonal and diurnal variations of atmospheric vapor isotopes the surface water vapor δ18o flux δv is a quantity frequently used to constrain the seasonal diurnal and synoptic variability in the regional water cycle we presented the in situ measured daily δ18o and h2o concentration of atmospheric vapor at 0 3m 1m 2m 3m 5m 10m 15m 20m above ground fig 4 not continuously measured above 3 0m the strong seasonality of vapor isotope is in association with the indian summer intrusion from early june with incidental increase of vapor mixing ratio the fluctuation of vapor isotope is lower in the non monsoon season but with large fluctuations in summer monsoon season owning to the local precipitation events both vapor isotopes and vapor mixing ratio show consistent change in different levels above ground since the canopy height of the study area is 5 10m while the continuously measured vapor isotopes are only available in 3 0 meter and below therefore we made a precise comparison of vapor isotopes and vapor mixing ratio in the spring season april to july when all level of measurement are available table a2 we see that the isotopes in different level are almost identical until to 20m fig 4 vapor mixing ratio show slight variation from ground to higher level with general decrease trend above 2m level in the calculation of isotopes in evapotranspiration we used the midday vapor isotope data instead of daily average hence we also evaluated the diurnal change of vapor isotope at the sampling site the 24 h ensemble average values of the vapor δ18o at 3 m height measured from 13 to 16 october 2019 in non raining days fig a3 the overall diurnal change of vapor δ18o is smaller within 2 in all the four days 3 4 seasonal precipitation isotopes in the forest ecosystem we presented the daily precipitation δ18o d excess and precipitation amount from lijiang station fig 5 precipitation δ18o shows a seasonal shift from the higher value in the earlier summer of may june to the lower δ18o period of the raining season until to september this seasonal precipitation is consistent with the seasonal feature of monsoon type precipitation signal daily δ18o values ranged from 21 4 to 1 8 with a weighted mean value of 13 0 the d excess values ranged from 1 3 to 17 6 with a weighted mean of 10 9 slight lower precipitation d excess in less rainfall days are probably related to the reevaporation of falling raindrops which lowered d excess in the left rainfall 3 5 seasonal variation of the three flux endmembers δe δt and δet based on the observed vapor δ18o together with the concurrent meteorological observation we calculated the isotopic compositions of evaporation δe transpiration δt and evapotranspiration δet every other day using the methods descripted in the earlier section fig 6 shows the seasonal δ18o variations of δe δt and δet during early afternoon hours 13 00 15 00 in the observation days we also presented the daily precipitation δ18o variations to discuss their linkage fig 6 on average δt is 2 8 higher than δet and 10 4 higher than δe three of them show parallel temporal variations with the largest magnitude in δe variation indicating the conherent influence on the seasonal variations of the three a comparison with daily precipitation isotope demonstrates that precipitation strongly impact the temporal variation of δe δt and δet correlation analysis also shows the significant relationship between the three end members and precipitation δ18o r 2 0 85 0 55 0 83 p 0 001 respectively suggest that the former was strongly affected by precipitation isotopes 3 6 seasonal propagation of t et estimation in forest ecosystem we calculated the relative contribution of t to et t et based on the keeling cg method by using both δ18o and δ2h measured in midday periods the temporal variations of estimated t et from the dual isotopes are presented in fig 8 we also made the averaged t et from the two isotopes for a robust estimation of the seasonal characters and plotted in fig 7 as well results show a strong seasonal t et cycle varying between 0 59 0 81 in the pre monsoon season of june the t et ratio shows a strong increasing trend rising from 0 5 to 0 7 in the monsoon season the t et ratio is higher with slight fluctuation of around 0 7 0 8 in average the calculated ratio from δ18o based method is identical with the δ2h based results yet there is a slight bias between the two with time the average t et is 0 73 from isotopic labeling indicating that the evapotranspiration is mainly composed of plant transpiration in the pinus yunnanensis ecosystem we also presented the temporal variation of lai in the observing days showing general similar trend with the average t et however the ratio becomes relatively constant after the pinus yunnanensis established dense foliage lai 5 24 confirming that t et ratio become less sensitive to lai variation in the late growing season zhou et al 2016 we used the t et acquired from the two isotopes measurement and eddy covariance measured et ranging from 0 8 to 2 2 mm d 1 and with an average of 1 8 mm d 1 to partition the seasonal variations of soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t only on clear days fig 8 we identified a clear seasonal pattern of transpiration increasing from about 0 47 mm d 1 in the beginning of june to over 1 0 mm d 1 abruptly from the middle of june and keeping higher value until to the end of observation soil evaporation however shows little variations throughout the observation period varying in the range of 0 32 to 0 64 mm d 1 therefore the seasonal variations of evapotranspiration are mainly due to the change in transpiration less from soil evaporation 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of t et ratio in a global scale partitioning et is expected to become increasingly important as available water resources continue to diminish an improved understanding of where losses occur and how much water is used through plant transpiration can benefit the understanding of the hydrologic systems which affect stream flow ground water recharge and weather conditions as well as plant biomass production and associated carbon sequestration kool et al 2014 in this section we further compared our results of the estimated midday t et with previous studies fig 9 in a broad space scale this summary of the available estimated midday t et ratios on regional and global includes a diverse range of ecosystems such as cropland grassland woodland shrubland and paddy fields in africa europe america asia and oceania we see a large range of midday t et estimation of 0 15 0 98 owing to different approaches used in the estimation and different research scales and ecosystems as a comparison we also added our result in this graph the range of midday t et 0 59 0 81 in our study is within the broad range of previous studies schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 fatichi and pappas 2017 our midday average t et 0 73 0 06 value were slightly higher than results from global long term average one likely reason is that the estimated midday t et ratio is observed in the hours of maximum transpiration but not a daily average another possible influence is the lack of observation for intercepted precipitation by vegetation canopy in our study as isotope observations were only conducted during the clear periods evaporation over vegetation canopy interception was not included in evapotranspiration for keeling cg methods however interception dew or preceding rain may even present in no rain period and bias the values of δt and δet measurements conducted in this condition should be excluded and not involved in t et calculation on raining days interception evaporation may constitute a significant part of evapotranspiration miralles et al 2010 wei et al 2017 additionally the evergreen coniferous forests are distributed in humid climates zone with higher wet canopy evaporation rates than other biomes and therefore enhancing this effect wei et al 2017 hence our estimated midday t et of 0 73 may be to some extent overestimated when compared to long term means due to the lack of interception evaporation after precipitation different techniques and study scales may also lead to the variability for instance hydrometric and isotope based methods produce higher transpiration fraction values than the models driven by meteorological measurements and sap flow meters sutanto et al 2014 seasonal t et can be extremely variable within a given year at the same site in association with climate change and differential plant responses scott et al 2006 in this study the t et variation shows a strong seasonality with the lowest value of 0 5 0 7 in pre monsoon season of june and higher ratio of approximately of 0 7 0 8 throughout the monsoon season t et increased almost continuously with the vegetation growth in the early growing season and became relatively constant after the pinus yunnanensis established dense foliage lai 5 24 t et ratios estimated from both δ18o and δ2h are quite consistent but the estimate from δ2h is slightly higher than from δ18o in average in particular in the heavy raining days during august september overall transpiration is the most robust engine for water transportation in southwest forest consistent with other ecosystems worldwide schlesinger and jasechko 2014 4 2 factors influencing t et estimation in the forest ecosystem to evaluate how environmental swc vpd and ta and biological factors here we considered only lai influencing the seasonal t et variations correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis were performed between these daily values with t et ratios fig 10 the correlation analysis results show that swc and lai have a significant influence on t et and are the primary controlling factor followed by ta and vpd previous studies have consistently demonstrated that there is an observable relationship between t et and lai at the seasonal scale wang et al 2014 wei et al 2015 berkelhammer et al 2016 our isotope based results reconfirmed this relationship verifying that lai plays an important role in the hydrological cycle of alpine coniferous ecosystems at entire raining season critically we found the influence of swc is of sufficient magnitude comparable to the impact of lai on the seasonal t et variation fig 10a b partial correlation analysis further suggests that the individual contribution from swc is more substantial than that of lai fig 10c this may be because that the t et for evergreen vegetation is mainly controlled by soil water content since the inter annual change in vegetation cover is quite small for evergreens zhou et al 2016 in addition lai varies little in alpine forest regions at entire raining season the larger lai representing tree size and density will enhance transpiration while curb evaporation both because of the larger tree canopy and because of the larger shaded under canopy fraction raz yaseef et al 2012 based on the observations on the forest ecosystem in sw china we have developed an explanation of the underlying mechanisms controlling the changes of t et at seasonal scales the lower t et in spring was related to the lower lai in the early stage of the growing season combined with lower swc corresponding to less precipitation lai reached a peak in summer and intense precipitation elevated swc and thus brought sufficient water for high levels of plant transpiration under the same lai condition increasing soil moisture may reduce t et via increasing soil e wei et al 2018 other authors have also emphasized the role of soil water content in controlling t et hu et al 2009 liu et al 2002 although t et was well correlated with swc at the forest ecosystem in sw china fig 10a the relationship may have regional variation and not be ubiquitous instead being vegetation type related or spatiotemporal scales related according to a global t et dataset as synthesized by wang et al 2014 showed generally low correlations with soil water potential however swc was a constraining factor in arid or semi arid climates but not in humid or semi humid climates limited studies that have reported the swc dependence to date were located in croplands e g liu et al 2002 wei et al 2018 taking the example of wheat the main depths of root water uptake are from 0 to 40 cm depths while soil evaporation is controlled by soil moisture at the depth 20 cm zhang et al 2011 again causing weak correlations between t et and swc hence we are cautious to believe that both environmental partial correlation coefficient 0 44 and biological factors 0 09 dominated the variations of t et in our alpine coniferous ecosystem region in southwest china but only in june september against with the previous studies that arguing t et is mainly controlled by lai hu et al 2009 wei et al 2015 the same results also found in other ecosystems of earlier studies cui et al 2020 liu et al 2002 actually the correlation relationship analyzed in this study mainly reflects the influence of seasonal changes fig 10 however when focusing on a certain season after june 28th the relationship both lai and swc are not significant with t et ratios fig a4 the specific influencing factors in a certain season need to be further studied we are aware that this conclusion is very limited as our field experiments are from june to september not cover a full year a longer timeframe might demonstrate t et to have slightly different lai and swc dependencies at alpine forest regions future measurement campaigns that cover a full year will enable testing of our discovered relationships between t et lai and swc during other seasons 4 3 performance of chamber method in the forest ecosystem to evaluate the performance of each method in estimating δe and δt estimated isotopic composition from different methods new customized chamber and craig gordon model are presented for comparison fig 11 the time series diagrams of δe and δt estimated by the two methods are also presented to discern the detail differences between the two methods fig a5 the new customized chamber method presented in this study shows good agreements with craig gordon model the results from the chamber based mass balance approach and the craig gordon model matches well in δe with r2 of 0 82 0 88 p 0 01 respectively for δ18o and δ2h fig 11 for δt the relation coefficients are r2 of 0 63 0 65 p 0 01 respectively for δ18o and δ2h these statistics are encouraging and highlights the robustness of the chamber method in evaluation for evaporation e and transpiration t the δe values of c g model calculation is slightly lower than the chamber based method 21 0 4 5 vs 18 6 3 8 for c g model calculations and chamber based for δ18o respectively the enrichment result 2 is most likely caused by air condensation inside the chamber or sampling tube this is generally consistent with the suggestion of that the δe values for δ2h of chamber method were consistently more enriched than the c g model calculations wang et al 2013 this may be because of an inherent limitation of the chamber method in association with its impact on environmental conditions inside the chamber potentially affecting the measured isotope values dubbert et al 2014 air temperature in the chamber increased 2 c above ambient levels after 5 min in an open cork oak woodland dubbert et al 2014 this warming inadvertently enhanced the estimated soil evaporation in the chamber enriched δe relative to the c g model wang et al 2013 another possible reason for the enrichment result 2 between c g model calculations and chamber method is that the uncertainties of kinetic enrichment factor εk in c g model which εk associated with diffusion of water through the soil zhang et al 2010 additionally this may also lead to systematic bias because of the identification of the evaporating front in c g model dubbert et al 2013 the location of evaporation fronts is influenced by meteorological conditions soil water content and soil texture zimmermann et al 1967 using the c g model in conjunction with a climate chamber controlled experiment rothfuss et al 2010 showed that the failure to determine the evaporating front may produce a large bias within these consistence in the c g model calculations and chamber based observation confirmed the representative of vegetation in the chamber although we also suggest the necessity of comparison in more extensive area the uncertainty in the measured isotope data from the chamber method is rather small the average standard deviation of measured δ18o and δ2h of δt are 0 6 and 1 4 during the observations period very close to the precision of laboratory based values and lower than reported by wang et al 2012 1 0 for δ18o and 1 6 for δ2h there was no significant difference of standard deviation between δe and δt new customized chamber method will provide a new opportunity to investigate large scale t or e behaviors but require further validation for the independent measurements the potential advantage of using the new customized chamber method is the relatively consistent error sources in the isotope compositions of three fluxes e g from the same laser instrument which might be diminished or even canceled out when calculating the et partitioning wang et al 2013 4 4 uncertainty and possible error source in t et ratio estimation here we made the sensitivity test results and discussed the uncertainties and possible error sources in the keeling cg method δe δt and δet the estimated δet in this study was acquired by using the keeling plot method however this method can produce uncertainty and errors which is inherent in the keeling plots pataki et al 2003 nickerson and risk 2009 wei et al 2015 earlier studies showed that the error in δet estimation could be quite large even for a high r2 value in the keeling plots e g atmospheric fluctuations and unsteady diffusion lee et al 2006 nickerson and risk 2009 therefore to constrain the uncertainty in the estimated t et ratio we made the sensitivity test by assuming a 1σ variation in δet the results showed a 1σ changes in δet will result in a t et ratio change of 0 30 0 28 from δet 18o and 0 50 0 50 from δet 2h table 1 the total uncertainties in average 1σ is 13 8 2 1 for δet 18o and 117 0 20 2 for δet 2h however we argue that the bias from δet could be small since we did not find large variability of δet observed in the midday 13 00 15 00 fig 6 then we evaluated the uncertainty derived from δe variations the water δ18o at the soil evaporating front δs mainly controls the estimation of δe in the model craig and gordon 1965 therefore precise determination of the evaporating front depth was critical because δs varied considerably near the evaporating front dubbert et al 2013 in this study the vertical variations of soil water δ18o indicate that the evaporating front is at 5 cm the use of evaporating front water in other soil depth would induce a maximum t et bias of 0 16 and 0 34 based on δ18o and δ2h respectively in the sensitivity test we also showed that a 1σ changes in δe will result in a t et ration change of 0 30 to 0 12 from δe 18o and 0 89 to 0 16 from δe 2h table 1 the test result shows that the estimated t et ratio change could be large in particular with δe 2h decrease the total uncertainties in average 1σ is 21 0 4 6 for δe 18o and 156 4 39 0 for δe 2h in terms of the variations of δt the bias in the simulated t et ratio could be 0 19 0 34 from δt 18o and 0 27 0 65 from δt 2h table 1 with a 1σ changes in δt the total uncertainties in average 1σ is 11 2 2 5 for δt 18o and 103 7 20 8 for δt 2h this uncertainly is mainly resulted from the short observation hours while a full day observation is unavailable fortunately although a full day observation is encouraged williams et al 2004 short hours observation in midday and early afternoon is more in practice sutanto et al 2014 this is because the isotopic steady state iss is achieved by midday and or early afternoon and transpiration from plants is usually at its maximum with a short turnover time of leaf water and thus constrains δt close to the isotopic composition of plant source water wen et al 2016 additionally although some studies mentioned nss occurs even in midday for forests e g lai and ehleringer 2011 our results show that δet fall in the range bounded by δt and δe such that δe δet δt indicating that isotopic steady state iss was reached during the midday 13 00 15 00 therefore we suggested that an iss was a reasonable assumption in our observations 5 conclusions we presented a detailed observation work on the seasonal variation of dual isotopes in various water reservoirs and the isotope signal transfers in between including atmospheric vapor precipitation soil water and xylem water in an alpine forest ecosystem during the growing season in southwest china the seasonal isotope signals in various water reservoirs tell a detailed transfer processes from precipitation to soil water xylem water and leaf water with the involved fractionation allowing for a diagnose of the evapotranspiration for the specific pinus yunnanensis ecosystem we made an estimation of the t et ratio by using the isotope approach the estimated seasonal t et ranged from 0 59 to 0 81 with a near continuous increase over time in the early growing season and a plateau level of over 0 75 during the peak growing season the mean t et ratio of 0 73 0 06 is within the broad range of previous literature but slightly higher than global long term average highlights the importance of transpiration in the total evapotranspiration in the pinus yunnanensis ecosystem we also identified a clear seasonal pattern of transpiration increasing from about 0 47 mm d 1 in the beginning of june to over 1 0 mm d 1 abruptly from the middle of june and keeping higher value until to september a simple driver analysis showed that t et was correlated with environmental conditions here soil water content swc in alpine forest regions at entire raining season in june september in addition to lai challenging the earlier recognition of lai dominated control this result is likely related to the slight changes of lai in the growing season for pinus yunnanensis ecosystem hence longer time continuous monitoring is still necessary and we are also aware the sensitivity of controls on estimated t et at different time scale interested comparison of the results of customized chamber and craig gordon model demonstrated that the two methods are in robust consistence in estimating δe or δt with high correlation coefficients our results here highlighted the reliability of chamber method in isotope water cycle in the ecosystem with reasonable uncertainty and reconfirm the findings to observe δet by using the chamber method directly and comparing it with other methods such as keeling plot approach sap flow meters bowen ratio systems lysimeters and eddy covariance systems as well as methods to isolate the individual t and e components these results presented in this paper shed light on the mechanisms underlying temporal change of terrestrial transpiration and will provide far reaching impact on alpine forest managers and ecosystem protection under ongoing climate
