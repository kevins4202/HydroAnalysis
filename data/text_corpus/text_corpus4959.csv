24795,a species distribution across the landscape is not random but it is affected by distribution size abundance and connectivity of landscape patches this spatial configuration of the landscape shapes ecological processes for example the location of home ranges migration routes and migration ability landscape metrics describe the configuration of a landscape quantitatively while traditional approaches in habitat modelling only consider environmental attributes at a specific location the integration of landscape metrics adds more functional information in this paper we evaluated a method of directly incorporating a set of landscape metrics as covariates into a maxent habitat model specifically we used hexagons as statistical units for the calculation of landscape metrics with this method also landscape metrics calculated with vector data sets can be used for sdm we tested this approach for the smooth snake coronella austriaca in the austrian alps the experimental designs resulted in an improvement of the habitat models moreover the results demonstrated the benefits of landscape metrics for the model outcomes at different scales keywords maxent landscape metrics coronella austriaca zonal metrics tessellations 1 introduction for effective conservation planning it is fundamental to understand the factors that drive the distribution of species rosenzweig 1995 species distribution modelling is thus used in numerous studies that estimate the present and future habitat ranges of species for biodiversity research and conservation biology the most commonly used predictors in species distribution models are environmental variables like climate vegetation soil and elevation pulliam 2000 while these variables describe the ecological niche at a certain location they do not account for the spatial configuration and structure of the landscape the spatial context in which the species is embedded has an important influence on ecosystem functions and thus also on habitat suitability and biodiversity walz 2011 in other words a species distribution is not only determined by its environmental niche but also by functional relations in geographic space we thus argue that species distribution models become more informative with using landscape metrics as covariates in order to adequately model the local distribution of a specific animal species predictive variables need to be selected from an organism centred perspective cushman et al 2008 li and wu 2004 for the analysis of landscape configuration this implies the choice of an appropriate scale that matches dispersal processes of the species under study walz 2011 scale in this respect is characterised by the spatial resolution and extent but also the thematic granularity of land cover classes lam and quattrochi 1992 turner et al 2001 species with higher space demand and higher mobility are influenced by a larger extent of landscape than small species with low mobility so spatial grain of habitat perception is a function of body size what accords to the decision hierarchy concept of holling 1992 to represent the actual driving forces for the distribution of a target species resolution and extent thus need to reflect the size of the home ranges of this species holzkämper et al 2006 guisan and thuiller 2005 moreover the spatial and the thematic resolution of the model is limited by the quality of the underlying data to avoid pseudo accuracy landscape metrics are calculated with a set of algorithms that help to describe the spatial configuration of landscapes quantitatively therefore these metrics can be an important although mostly neglected factor for species distribution modelling adding to the above conceptual considerations of scale the use of landscape metrics as predictors in species distribution models also poses a methodological challenge if vector data is used schindler et al 2013 and turner et al 2001 have demonstrated that the spatial scale and extent of a study area affects the performance of landscape metrics especially the response to changing extent is not consistent saura and martinez millan 2001 small extents can cause the number of patches of the same class to drop below statistically meaningful sample sizes and thus lead to an unpredictable behaviour of metrics schindler et al 2013 some studies have used landscape metrics to complement species distribution models with additional information after the modelling process e g amici et al 2015 hasui et al 2017 hopkins 2009 foltete et al 2012 to predict species richness e g schindler et al 2013 or to correlate landscape metrics with species occurrence e g ippoliti et al 2013 westphal et al 2003 another possibility to incorporate landscape metrics into the modelling process is the moving window approach which is restricted to raster data sets e g hagen zanker 2016 santos et al 2019 in this research we suggest a novel method to incorporate landscape metrics as continuous surfaces derived from vector data sets into a species distribution model to account for the spatial configuration of landscapes so this method enables the use of vector data sets for landscape metrics calculations and model building specifically we 1 calculated landscape metrics for regular hexagonal cells at different ecologically meaningful scales for the smooth snake coronella austriaca in the austrian alps 2 incorporated the landscape metrics as predictors into a species distribution model based on the maxent algorithm to characterise the niche of coronella austriaca and 3 tested the approach against a model without landscape metrics 2 material and methods the approach of integrating landscape metrics as continuous surfaces into the species distribution model of the smooth snake followed a 3 step workflow fig 1 first occurrence points were pre processed to eliminate low precision and clustered points second the most contributing landscape metrics types and scale levels were identified in an exploratory modelling phase this step was done on a subset of the study area test areas to avoid computational overload third species distribution models were computed with the selected environmental and landscape predictors for the whole study area 2 1 study species and area the target species of this study was the smooth snake coronella austriaca we chose the smooth snake because the lead author is herpetologist with a profound knowledge of this colubrid we thus had access to an abundant set of recent survey data and also could well interpret results although this snake is distributed across entire europe western siberia and the middle east völkl and käsewieter 2003 it is included in the european council directive 92 43 eec of 21st of may 1992 annex iv and has been evaluated as being in an unfavourable state in central and northern european countries čeirāns and nikolajeva 2017 coronella austriaca is a rather small mean length between 60 70 cm non venomous and secretive snake that is mainly threatened through habitat loss and fragmentation which leads to extinction of populations and reduces the gene flow between persisting populations this can cause degeneration of the remaining populations pernetta et al 2011 reading 2012 c austriaca is one of the typical elements of the european cultural landscape and is very ductile in its habitat selection it inhabits a wide spectrum of open and half open landscapes and can be seen as xerothermophile species that sometimes also inhabits wet to alternating wet areas völkl and käsewieter 2003 all of these habitats are highly structured landscapes with adequate microhabitats like immature soil dry grass stone and rock and deadwood käsewieter 2002 the study area is located in the southern ranges of the eastern alps in carinthia a province of austria it is composed of 15 6 subalpine and alpine vegetation 57 6 of different types of forest 0 3 of wetlands 19 4 agriculture and 7 1 of miscellaneous areas hartl et al 2001 with an elevation between 384 m in the east and 3798 m in the west for this province a rich set of coronella austriaca observation points was available together with a fine scaled vegetation map at the scale of 1 50 000 which provided enough accuracy to detect relevant landscape patterns for this snake further a representative test area was delimited to explore the performance of landscape metrics surfaces with a computationally less demanding subset the size and position of the test area was chosen because of the number of occurrences in the area and the fact that it covers lower altitude regions as well as some subalpine areas fig 2 2 2 occurrence data and environmental data occurrence data for coronella austriaca was obtained from the herpetofaunistic database of the museum of natural history vienna 1 1 herpetofaunistische datenbank des naturhistorischen museums wien and from the consortium for nature conservation klagenfurt 2 2 arge naturschutz klagenfurt together these databases held 1208 occurrence records in the pre processing we extracted records that were collected between 1996 and 2016 to ensure a temporal match with the environmental layers further metadata was used to filter out locations with a positional inaccuracy of 100 m or more finally 129 occurrence records were left 46 of which were located in the test area in a second pre processing step we filtered the remaining occurrences spatially to reduce bias through spatial autocorrelation boria et al 2014 anderson and gonzalez 2011 this is necessary because biased occurrence records can lead to overfitted model outputs in maxent peterson et al 2007 which means that the model is more complex than the real relationships between the included environmental variables and the species niche peterson 2011 therefore only one randomly selected point was kept in occurrence clusters of 500 m distance after spatial filtering 94 occurrence points were left in the study area of which 38 occurrences were located in the test area the current vegetation of carinthia 3 3 https data gv at katalog dataset with a detection scale of 1 50 000 served as the environmental layer for the computation of landscape metrics this vegetation layer was further enriched with specific habitat information for coronella austriaca especially small water bodies source water body network of carinthia3 wetlands source map of the current vegetation of carinthia hartl et al 2001 and alpine land cover source the generalized land use of carinthia3 the resulting layer contained 51 vegetation classes to calculate the different kinds of landscape metrics three hierarchical levels were used two of them aggregations of the vegetation classes 1 vegetation classes 2 vegetation types 3 land cover classes the vegetation was aggregated into functional habitat types for coronella austriaca like open and half open landscape types and also wet to altering wet areas völkl and käsewieter 2003 thus three aggregation levels were available for further analysis first 51 vegetation classes at the level of plant associations e g secondary spruce forest on carbonate ground second 24 vegetation types e g spruce and mixed spruce forest and third 7 land cover classes e g forest finally seven climatic layers with a resolution of 250 250 m were acquired for model building mean annual global radiation average accumulated precipitation average accumulated summer precipitation mean snow cover duration average start of snow cover average end of snow cover average equivalent temperature in july 4 4 https data gv at katalog dataset 2 3 species distribution model the algorithm that we used to model the distribution of the smooth snake was maxent as implemented in maxent gui 3 4 1 5 5 http biodiversityinformatics amnh org open source maxent maxent is a machine learning method which today is one of the most frequently used algorithms to model species distribution phillips 2004 it is a presence background modelling method that associates known occurrences of a species with environmental data in the region of interest the resulting model extracts the ecological niche that the target species can inhabit in the study area and maps it onto geographic space the algorithm consistently shows good results especially for presence only data merow et al 2013 elith et al 2006 in maxent there are different approaches how to select covariates in ecological modelling one recommends reducing correlation between them to a minimum before starting the modelling process through correlation analysis clustering analyses or another reduction method because the complex features used by maxent often produce highly correlated outputs reducing the covariates prior to model building should result in models that are better interpretable this corresponds to the approach of treating maxent as traditional statistical model renner and warton 2013 an alternative approach considers maxent as machine learning method and lets the algorithm decide which covariates to use for model building through regularization phillips et al 2006 we followed the latter approach and did not filter the covariates before model building 2 4 regular tesselations landscape level metrics are usually computed with respect to an entire landscape the result for landscape metrics calculations is one number that characterises the whole study area however in order to incorporate the spatial configuration of a landscape as predictor into the maxent modelling process we needed to disaggregate the metrics into tessellation areas of landscape units the size of landscape units thereby needs to account for the multiple spatial scales at which dispersal processes are operating landscape metrics were calculated for this small units and afterwards the tessellation areas were converted to continuous raster files to explore the computation of landscape metrics for different spatial scales we tesselated the test area into multiple hexagonal grids of different cell sizes 5 ha 10 ha 15 ha 25 ha 35 ha per hexagon the size of the statistical zones defines the scale of analysis that should be considered because every analysed phenomenon can have a particular scale domain where it reveals levin 1992 turner et al 1989 to build organism centred models for the target species the size of the hexagons was on the one hand adjusted to the habitat size requirements of coronella austriaca populations which ranges between 1 ha and 200 ha völkl and käsewieter 2003 on the other hand we experimented with the size of the hexagons to get an insight on how the landscape metrics reacted boundary patches that extended over two hexagon zones or more were clipped in addition to the hexagonal grids we delimited the catchment areas of the test area with a mean zone size of 303 ha to serve as alternative natural ecological units for the landscape metrics computation finally the landscape metrics tessellation layers were rasterised to a resolution of 100 m x 100 m this was the finest resolution to avoid pseudo accuracy in the modelling process taking into account the resolution of the vegetation map and location inaccuracies for the observed snake occurrences 2 5 choice of candidate landscape metrics landscape metrics can be computed at three different levels for individual patches e g patch shape patch classes with respect to a landscape e g mean patch area or nearest neighbour distance and the structure of the mosaic of patches in a landscape e g fragmentation or connectivity in this research we were interested in the characterisation with respect to the entire landscape thus we selected a set of class and landscape level metrics that were meaningful to describe the habitat of the smooth snake in this exploratory phase a large number of metrics was computed as each model was spatially disaggregate the calculations proved to be computationally demanding and we thus limited them to the representative test area described above for all statistical layers and the catchment areas six types of landscape metrics were computed with the zonalmetrics toolbox adamczky and tiede 2017 for arcgis esri 2011 to quantify important habitat elements of c austriaca table 1 1 area metrics were calculated for open areas important for c austriaca of the vegetation types the result was the percent of the area of the whole statistical zone taken by the patch 2 the largest patch index was calculated for the plant associations result percentage of the total area of the statistical zone taken by the largest patch 3 connectance metrics for the habitable land cover the maximum connectance distance was 500 m the examined classes covered with buildings planted grassland and intensive grassland were merged the resulting values were the number of distinct connected classes the percentage of patch area that lies within the range of connection to the statistical zone and the percentage of the connection zone between the patches in comparison to the statistical zone 4 contrast metrics were calculated for the habitable land cover the analysed classes one at a time were covered with buildings intensive grassland planted and grassland the contrast classes were compact settlement waterbodies and forest the resulting value was the contrast index which is calculated as the percentage of the edge length of the focus classes shared with the contrast classes 5 the shannon diversity index was calculated for the plant associations this index considers the number of different patch types and their abundance 6 the edge density was computed based on boundaries between vegetation classes and the transportation network we dissolved the vegetation layer polygons to lines and merged the resulting layer with the transport network of carinthia to generate a line kernel density surface the decision for a bandwidth is a key step in kernel density estimation depending on the smoothing of the resulting surface cai et al 2013 as a rule of thumb arcgis esri 2011 works with the rule of silverman silverman 1986 which is based on a quadratic kernel function the first surface was calculated with the suggested bandwidth of 1741 11 m however to represent edge density for c austrica in an appropriate way the smoothing should not be too strong because the effect of these edges does not expand to far away from the linear structures thus three more surfaces with bandwidths of 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m were created based on a comparison with the line data set we chose the surface with the 1000 m bandwidth and a resolution of 100 m x 100 m for the modelling process for landscape level metrics like the largest patch index or the connectivity metrics one single landscape metric surface resulted for each metric class level metrics like the share of open areas resulted in multiple surfaces one for each class thus finally 26 landscape metrics surfaces at six resolutions resulted and were ready to be used as candidate predictors for further analyses in the test area 2 6 statistical selection of landscape metric surfaces in this final pre processing step we singled out the landscape metric surfaces which contributed most to the model and determined the most adequate resolutions to test respective models quantitatively against the validation data we did a jack knife evaluation with a random test percentage was 25 and a number of background points of 10 000 averaged over 20 iterations the assessment of model performance was based on two criteria auc area under the roc curve and omission rate or auc reflects the discriminatory ability of a model it is a measure for the ability that a model ranks a random presence locality better than a random background point phillips et al 2006 where higher values implicate better models omission rate or quantifies overfitting it ranges between 0 and 1 where lower numbers indicate better model performance shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 although the auc based on presence background data is an arguable absolute measure for the performance of models lobo et al 2008 warren and seifert 2011 it is adequate to compare models of single species in an identical study area peterson 2011 first we determined the optimal resolution of the hexgrid in the test area we computed models with all landscape metric surfaces for each of the six resolutions i e the five hexgrid tesselations between 5 and 35 ha and the catchment units the respective auc and or values were compared to identify the resolutions at which models performed best second we selected the landscape metric surfaces that were most important for the model predictions as maxent is a machine learning algorithm we could make use of the regularisation procedure not only to avoid overfitting but also to select the most contributing covariates phillips et al 2006 elith et al 2011 specifically we used permutation importance to determine the relative importance of predictors permutation importance randomly alters the values of the covariate of interest among presence and background points subsequently the drop in the auc is measured and normalised to the percentage scale the larger this drop the more important is the covariate for the model prediction phillips et al 2006 only landscape metric surfaces with a permutation importance of 4 and more were kept as predictors for the final model this threshold simplified the models to a reasonable amount of detail with two adjustments we tried to avoid overfitting of the model first the model was constrained to linear and quadratic features more complex feature combinations allow a better fine tuning but are potentially very sensitive to a species environmental tolerance which in turn may lead to overfitted models shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 second we adapted the regularisation multiplier that controls the intensity of regularization across all features to a value of two with this value the chance that the model is overfitted to bias or noise in the sample points is relatively low radosavljevic and anderson 2014 finally we assessed how much model predictions differed in geographic space even if their overall predictive performance was similar the algorithms that we used to quantify geographic similarity were schoeners d schoener 1968 and i statistics warren et al 2008 these performance indicators represent the difference between the normalised suitability scores per grid cell the values range from 0 no match to 1 identical models while i often overestimates model similarity schoeners d is a more conservative measure rödder and engler 2011 2 7 final species distribution models the final models were computed with climatic layers the vegetation layer and the statistically most significant landscape metric surfaces all predictors had the same raster resolution of 100 m x 100 m to assess the added value of incorporating landscape metrics as predictors we computed 1 one model with all parameters i e landscape metrics climatic variables and the vegetation layer 2 one model with landscape metrics only and 3 one model without landscape metrics the latter null model served as a reference the resulting species distribution maps fig 3 were visualised as a binary prediction with 10 percentile training presence logistic threshold phillips and dudík 2008 3 results 3 1 target resolutions the model outputs for the different test area resolutions performed similarly well with respect to the resulting auc and or values the values for the auc ranged between 0 843 and 0 890 and for the or between 0 346 and 0 369 for the 6 test area models see table 2 for the chosen model resolutions due to the similar performances across resolutions we thus decided to select the three ecologically most meaningful scales for coronella austriaca völkl and käsewieter 2003 one represents the population scale 5 ha one the metapopulation scale 25 ha and the catchment areas serve as natural ecological units 3 2 selection of landscape metrics the individual contribution of the 26 test area landscape metrics on model predictions got marginally stronger the coarser the hexgrid resolution was the permutation importance for the 5 ha model contained five covariates with a zero percent permutation importance contrast grassland compact settlement percentage of pioneer vegetation contrast planted compact settlement percentage of subalpine vegetation percentage of dwarf pine knee timber the 25 ha model had four covariates with zero per cent permutation importance contrast grassland compact settlement percentage of pioneer vegetation percentage of dwarf pine knee timber percentage of subalpine vegetation the model with the highest zone size catchment areas only had one layer that did not contribute percentage of subalpine vegetation from the initial 26 landscape metrics surfaces only 6 of the 5 ha model 5 of the 25 ha model and 7 of the catchment areas model had a 4 or more contribution to model building and thus were further used in the final models table 3 provides an overview of all variables that were used for the final models despite some similarities in auc and or values between the different test area model results we observed differences in geographic space schoeners d schoener 1968 showed greater differences and less similarity than the i index warren et al 2008 the highest schoeners d value was 0 817 between the 5 ha and the 10 ha model the lowest schoeners d value and therefore the highest difference showed the catchment area and the 5 ha model with 0 676 the average d value was 0 749 the highest i value was 0 971 between the 10 ha and the 15 ha model the lowest i value was 0 907 between the 5 ha and the catchment area model the average i value was 0 942 3 3 the final models the final models fig 3 were calculated with the same settings as the test area models for all three model resolutions the best values were shown by the models with all covariates climatic vegetation and landscape metrics surfaces table 4 the best value was 0 888 from the 25 ha model the 5 ha model showed an auc value of 0 882 and the catchment areas model auc was 0 876 the auc value of the model without landscape metrics surfaces was 0 857 and the values for the models with only landscape metrics were between 0 832 and 0 847 increasing with the size of the statistical zones considering the models without landscape metrics the model with the largest statistical surface units showed the best results we additionally tried to fit the models by changing the settings allow more feature classes and lower the regularisation multiplier which increased the auc values between 0 859 for the 25 ha model with only landscape metrics and 0 928 for the 25 ha model with all covariates compared to the test areas model runs schoeners d and i statistics both showed increased differences for all models in geographic space the lowest d value with 0 610 appeared between the 5 ha model with landscape metrics only and the catchment areas model with all covariates the highest d value was 0 850 between the 25 ha model with all covariates and the 5 ha model with all covariates the average d value was 0 696 the i statistics again showed greater similarities between the models in geographic space the lowest value was 0 848 between the 25 ha landscape metrics model and the model without landscape metrics the highest value was 0 980 between the 25 ha surface with all covariates and the 5 ha surface with all covariates the average i value was 0 907 the correlations between the covariates showed high values between the climatic layers from 0 72 between the average equivalent temperature in july and the average accumulated precipitation up to 0 99 between the mean snow cover duration and average start end of snow cover excluding the mean annual global radiation where correlations were negligible with the other climatic layers the landscape metrics showed very low correlations with the climatic layers only the edge density and the average equivalent temperature in july sowed values up to 0 47 the landscape metrics surfaces among each other only showed higher correlations between the edge density the shannon diversity index and the largest patch index that ranged between 0 67 for the shannon diversity index and the largest patch index and 0 4 between the edge density and the largest patch index the catchment areas model also showed higher correlations between the percentage of light building density and the edge density of 0 45 the vegetation layer showed very low correlations between 0 25 and 0 33 with every other predictor again the larger the statistical surfaces get the stronger the correlations become 4 discussion in contrast to the common assumption in species distribution modelling that the environmental niche is the main descriptor of distribution ranges elith and leathwick 2009 also geographic factors are influential in this research we were able to illustrate that the integration of landscape metrics as predictors can improve predictions of a species distribution model among all seven distribution models for the smooth snake the best auc values resulted from combining all available predictor covariates landscape structure and environmental variables in contrast the model with only environmental predictors performed worse and the models with only landscape metric surfaces performed worst these results confirmed our argument that a species distribution is not only determined by its environmental niche but also by functional relations in geographic space integration of such mechanistic aspects is especially important in non equilibrium situations of expanding invasive species or climate driven range shifts elith and leathwick 2009 the most important landscape metrics covariates for coronella austriaca were the shannon diversity index patch sizes and contrast metrics together with the egde density that reflects some of the known habitat requirements of coronella austrica like the preference of edge structures völkl and käsewieter 2003 when focusing on the contrast metrics percentage of edge length of a focus calss shared with contrast classes this also reflects the importance of edge effects for this species the shannon diversity index shows that the habitat suitability gets higher the more diverse the environment becomes a more diverse environment also means more niches for different species and therefore more pray for coronella austriaca when examining the patch sizes c austriaca seems to prefer regions with light building desity this could also be an artefact because of the sampling intesity of the occurrence data more occurence data was sampled in regions where people live and there still is enough room for snake habitats so areas with light building density may be overrepresented in the sample points to put these results in a nutshell the model confirms the known importand landscape traits for the target species 4 1 spatial structure to account for the spatial context we included contextual indices that summarised the characteristics within a spatial neighbourhood like for example in ferrier et al 2002 unlike these authors we were not interested in the surrounding ecological niches but in the spatial structure itself while the results of our research unambiguously show that distribution models improve with the integration of landscape metrics this effect may depend on the species of interest for example hasui et al 2017 showed that the explanatory value of landscape metrics greatly varied between taxonomic groups for small terrestrial mammals the realtionship between habitat suitability and the landscape structure was confirmed by amici et al 2015 additionally not only the scale of sampling is important but also the grain of the underlying landscape in order to obtain landscape metrics that are functionally relevant it is important to select an adequate thematic granularity of vegetation classes with respect to the specific species under consideration the resolution of the underlying data needs to be adapted to a specific species its particular space demands and environmental requirements this point often is neglected especially in studies were multiple species are considered e g holzkämper et al 2006 schindler et al 2013 hasiu et al 2017 also the choice of adequate landscape metrics greatly depends on the species schindler et al 2013 investigated the predictive power of landscape metrics for six very different taxa in more detail they concluded that patch shape proximity texture diversity and patch size often were significant whereas similarity or contrast metrics did not result in significant models this partly is in accordance with the findings of our research where also diversity shannon diversity index and patch size percentage of the area of the whole statistical zone taken by the patch performed well as predictors in the model in our research also contrast metrics showed good results although the target species of these studies are very different it can be concluded that landscape metrics often contribute significantly to species distribution models landscape metric predictor surfaces add distinctly new information to the environmental variables we demonstrated in our research that despite a similar predictive power of environmental predictors versus spatial predictors the schoeners d analysis on map similarity showed that resulting distribution maps are of distinctly different nature this is also confirmed by almost zero correlation between climatic and landscape layers whereas the correlation between climatic layers is high interestingly the correlation between various landscape metrics layers were also low so each landscape metric predictor surface provides fundamentally new information 4 2 spatial scale another important aspect to consider for the incorporation of landscape metrics is the choice of scale the spatial structure governs ecological processes at multiple scales our results confirm a better model performance for all spatial models the mid scaled cell resolution of 25 ha for the reference grid performed best accordingly václavík et al 2012 observed an improvement in the distribution model of an invasive forest pathogen with the incorporation of spatial autocorrelation like in our model spatial dependences where highest in neighbourhoods of 200 400 m 12 to 50 ha also schindler et al 2013 found that the best performing size for the landscape metric reference areas for m species was around 20 ha finally hasui et al 2017 analysed broader scale neighbourhoods 12 5 km2 where the effects were not so clear in their study consideration of landscape metrics only had significant effects in 22 of the investigated target species in summary our research confirms the findings in the literature that the spatial structure of a landschape in the size of a few dozen hectars significantly impacts the occurrence of species this seems a plausible size for a landscape reference grid as it contains a representative sample of patches and enables fine scale modelling this scale represents processes at the metapopulation level 4 3 recommendations and outlook this research presents an approach to integrate the spatial structure of landscapes as predictors in species distribution models the results indicate that this approach holds promise and should be investigated further it not only can enhance the predictive power of the model but can also be helpful in identifying the most important landscape traits for the target species in the study area however the process to single out relevant landscape metrics and adequate scale levels is laborious and data hungry each decision had to be reflected and verified on the basis of the available data further research to better understand the role of scale and the adequacy of specific landscape metrics

24795,a species distribution across the landscape is not random but it is affected by distribution size abundance and connectivity of landscape patches this spatial configuration of the landscape shapes ecological processes for example the location of home ranges migration routes and migration ability landscape metrics describe the configuration of a landscape quantitatively while traditional approaches in habitat modelling only consider environmental attributes at a specific location the integration of landscape metrics adds more functional information in this paper we evaluated a method of directly incorporating a set of landscape metrics as covariates into a maxent habitat model specifically we used hexagons as statistical units for the calculation of landscape metrics with this method also landscape metrics calculated with vector data sets can be used for sdm we tested this approach for the smooth snake coronella austriaca in the austrian alps the experimental designs

coronella austriaca zonal metrics tessellations 1 introduction for effective conservation planning it is fundamental to understand the factors that drive the distribution of species rosenzweig 1995 species distribution modelling is thus used in numerous studies that estimate the present and future habitat ranges of species for biodiversity research and conservation biology the most commonly used predictors in species distribution models are environmental variables like climate vegetation soil and elevation pulliam 2000 while these variables describe the ecological niche at a certain location they do not account for the spatial configuration and structure of the landscape the spatial context in which the species is embedded has an important influence on ecosystem functions and thus also on

and quattrochi 1992 turner et al 2001 species with higher space demand and higher mobility are influenced by a larger extent of landscape than small species with low mobility so spatial grain of habitat perception is a function of body size what accords to the decision hierarchy concept of holling 1992 to represent the actual driving forces for the distribution of a target species resolution and extent thus need to reflect the size of the home ranges of this species holzkämper et al 2006 guisan and thuiller 2005 moreover the spatial and the thematic resolution of the model is limited by the quality of the underlying data to avoid pseudo accuracy landscape metrics are calculated with a set of algorithms that help to describe the spatial configuration of landscapes quantitatively therefore these metrics can be an important although mostly neglected factor for species distribution modelling adding to the above conceptual considerations of scale the use of landscape metrics as predictors in species distribution models also poses a methodological challenge if vector data is used schindler et al 2013 and turner et al 2001 have demonstrated that the spatial scale and extent of a study area affects the performance of landscape metrics especially the response to changing extent is not consistent saura and martinez millan 2001 small extents can cause the number of patches of

moving window approach which is restricted to raster data sets e g hagen zanker 2016 santos et al 2019 in this research we suggest a novel method to incorporate landscape metrics as continuous surfaces derived from vector data sets into a species distribution model to account for the spatial configuration of landscapes so this method enables the use of vector data sets for landscape metrics calculations and model building specifically we 1 calculated landscape metrics for regular hexagonal cells at different ecologically meaningful scales for the smooth snake coronella austriaca in the austrian alps 2 incorporated the landscape metrics as predictors into a species distribution model based on the maxent algorithm to characterise the niche of coronella austriaca and 3 tested the approach against a model without landscape metrics 2 material and methods the approach of integrating landscape metrics as continuous surfaces into the species distribution model of the smooth snake followed a 3 step workflow fig 1 first occurrence points were pre processed to eliminate low precision and clustered points second the most contributing landscape metrics types and scale levels were identified in an exploratory modelling phase this step was done on a subset of the study area test areas to avoid computational overload third species distribution models were computed with the selected environmental and landscape predictors for the whole study area 2 1 study species and area the target species of this study was the smooth snake coronella austriaca we chose the smooth snake because the lead author is herpetologist with a profound knowledge of this colubrid we thus had access to an abundant set of recent survey data and also could well interpret results although this snake is distributed across entire europe western siberia and the middle east völkl and käsewieter 2003 it is included in the european council directive 92 43 eec of 21st of may 1992 annex iv and has been evaluated as being in an unfavourable state in central and northern european countries čeirāns and nikolajeva 2017 coronella austriaca is a rather small mean length between 60 70 cm non venomous and secretive snake that is mainly threatened through habitat loss and fragmentation which leads to extinction of populations and reduces the gene flow between persisting populations this can cause degeneration of the remaining populations pernetta et al 2011 reading 2012 c austriaca is one of the typical elements of the european cultural landscape and is very ductile in its habitat selection it inhabits a wide spectrum of open and half open landscapes and can be seen as xerothermophile species that sometimes also inhabits wet to alternating wet areas völkl and käsewieter 2003 all of these habitats are highly structured landscapes with adequate microhabitats like immature soil dry grass stone and rock and deadwood käsewieter 2002 the study area is located in the southern ranges of the eastern alps in carinthia a province of austria it is composed of 15 6 subalpine and alpine vegetation 57 6 of different types of forest 0 3 of wetlands 19 4 agriculture and 7 1 of miscellaneous areas hartl et al 2001 with an elevation between 384 m in the east and 3798 m in the west for this province a rich set of coronella austriaca observation points was available together with a fine scaled vegetation map at the scale of 1 50 000 which provided enough accuracy to detect relevant landscape patterns for this snake further a representative test area was delimited to explore the performance of landscape metrics surfaces with a computationally less demanding subset the size and position of the test area was chosen because of the number of occurrences in the area and the fact that it covers lower altitude regions as well as some subalpine areas fig 2 2 2 occurrence data and environmental data occurrence data for coronella austriaca was obtained from the herpetofaunistic database of the museum of natural history vienna 1 1 herpetofaunistische datenbank des naturhistorischen museums wien and from the consortium for nature conservation klagenfurt 2 2 arge naturschutz klagenfurt together these databases held 1208 occurrence records in the pre processing we extracted records that were collected between 1996 and 2016 to ensure a temporal match with the environmental layers further metadata was used to filter out locations with a positional inaccuracy of 100 m or more finally 129 occurrence records were left 46 of which were located in the test area in a second pre processing step we filtered the remaining occurrences spatially to reduce bias through spatial autocorrelation boria et al 2014 anderson and gonzalez 2011 this is necessary because biased occurrence records can lead to overfitted model outputs in maxent peterson et al 2007 which means that the model is more complex than the real relationships between the included environmental variables and the species niche peterson 2011 therefore only one randomly selected point was kept in occurrence clusters of 500 m distance after spatial filtering 94 occurrence points were left in the study area of which 38 occurrences were located in the test area the current vegetation of carinthia 3 3 https data gv at katalog dataset with a detection scale of 1 50 000 served as the environmental layer for the computation of landscape metrics this vegetation layer was further enriched with specific habitat information for coronella austriaca especially small water bodies source water body network of carinthia3 wetlands source map of the current vegetation of carinthia hartl et al 2001 and alpine land cover source the generalized land use of carinthia3 the resulting layer contained 51 vegetation classes to calculate the different kinds of landscape metrics three hierarchical levels were used two of them aggregations of the vegetation classes 1 vegetation classes 2 vegetation types 3 land cover classes the vegetation was aggregated into functional habitat types for coronella austriaca like open and half open landscape types and also wet to altering wet areas völkl and käsewieter 2003 thus three aggregation levels were available for further analysis first 51 vegetation classes at the level of plant associations e g secondary spruce forest on carbonate ground second 24 vegetation types e g spruce and mixed spruce forest and third 7 land cover classes e g forest finally seven climatic layers with a resolution of 250 250 m were acquired for model building mean annual global radiation average accumulated precipitation average accumulated summer precipitation mean snow cover duration average start of snow cover average end of snow cover average equivalent temperature in july 4 4 https data gv at katalog dataset 2 3 species distribution model the algorithm that we used to model the distribution of the smooth snake was maxent as implemented in maxent gui 3 4 1 5 5 http biodiversityinformatics amnh org open source maxent maxent is a machine learning method which today is one of the most frequently used algorithms to model species distribution phillips 2004 it is a presence background modelling method that associates known occurrences of a species with environmental data in the region of interest the resulting model extracts the ecological niche that the target species can inhabit in the study area and maps it onto geographic space the algorithm consistently shows good results especially for presence only data merow et al 2013 elith et al 2006 in maxent there are different approaches how to select covariates in ecological modelling one recommends reducing correlation between them to a minimum before starting the modelling process through correlation analysis clustering analyses or another reduction method because the complex features used by maxent often produce highly correlated outputs reducing the covariates prior to model building should result in models that are better interpretable this corresponds to the approach of treating maxent as traditional statistical model renner and warton 2013 an alternative approach considers maxent as machine learning method and lets the algorithm decide which covariates to use for model building through regularization phillips et al 2006 we followed the latter approach and did not filter the covariates before model building 2 4 regular tesselations landscape level metrics are usually computed with respect to an entire landscape the result for landscape metrics calculations is one number that characterises the whole study area however in order to incorporate the spatial configuration of a landscape as predictor into the maxent modelling process we needed to disaggregate the metrics into tessellation areas of landscape units the size of landscape units thereby needs to account for the multiple spatial scales at which dispersal processes are operating landscape metrics were calculated for this small units and afterwards the tessellation areas were converted to continuous raster files to explore the computation of landscape metrics for different spatial scales we tesselated the test area into multiple hexagonal grids of different cell sizes 5 ha 10 ha 15 ha 25 ha 35 ha per hexagon the size of the statistical zones defines the scale of analysis that should be considered because every analysed phenomenon can have a particular scale domain where it reveals levin 1992 turner et al 1989 to build organism centred models for the target species the size of the hexagons was on the one hand adjusted to the habitat size requirements of coronella austriaca populations which ranges between 1 ha and 200 ha völkl and käsewieter 2003 on the other hand we experimented with the size of the hexagons to get an insight on how the landscape metrics reacted boundary patches that extended over two hexagon zones or more were clipped in addition to the hexagonal grids we delimited the catchment areas of the test area with a mean zone size of 303 ha to serve as alternative natural ecological units for the landscape metrics computation finally the landscape metrics tessellation layers were rasterised to a resolution of 100 m x 100 m this was the finest resolution to avoid pseudo accuracy in the modelling process taking into account the resolution of the vegetation map and location inaccuracies for the observed snake occurrences 2 5 choice of candidate landscape metrics landscape metrics can be computed at three different levels for individual patches e g patch shape patch classes with respect to a landscape e g mean patch area or nearest neighbour distance and the structure of the mosaic of patches in a landscape e g fragmentation or connectivity in this research we were interested in the characterisation with respect to the entire landscape thus we selected a set of class and landscape level metrics that were meaningful to describe the habitat of the smooth snake in this exploratory phase a large number of metrics was computed as each model was spatially disaggregate the calculations proved to be computationally demanding and we thus limited them to the representative test area described above for all statistical layers and the catchment areas six types of landscape metrics were computed with the zonalmetrics toolbox adamczky and tiede 2017 for arcgis esri 2011 to quantify important habitat elements of c austriaca table 1 1 area metrics were calculated for open areas important for c austriaca of the vegetation types the result was the percent of the area of the whole statistical zone taken by the patch 2 the largest patch index was calculated for the plant associations result percentage of the total area of the statistical zone taken by the largest patch 3 connectance metrics for the habitable land cover the maximum connectance distance was 500 m the examined classes covered with buildings planted grassland and intensive grassland were merged the resulting values were the number of distinct connected classes the percentage of patch area that lies within the range of connection to the statistical zone and the percentage of the connection zone between the patches in comparison to the statistical zone 4 contrast metrics were calculated for the habitable land cover the analysed classes one at a time were covered with buildings intensive grassland planted and grassland the contrast classes were compact settlement waterbodies and forest the resulting value was the contrast index which is calculated as the percentage of the edge length of the focus classes shared with the contrast classes 5 the shannon diversity index was calculated for the plant associations this index considers the number of different patch types and their abundance 6 the edge density was computed based on boundaries between vegetation classes and the transportation network we dissolved the vegetation layer polygons to lines and merged the resulting layer with the transport network of carinthia to generate a line kernel density surface the decision for a bandwidth is a key step in kernel density estimation depending on the smoothing of the resulting surface cai et al 2013 as a rule of thumb arcgis esri 2011 works with the rule of silverman silverman 1986 which is based on a quadratic kernel function the first surface was calculated with the suggested bandwidth of 1741 11 m however to represent edge density for c austrica in an appropriate way the smoothing should not be too strong because the effect of these edges does not expand to far away from the linear structures thus three more surfaces with bandwidths of 500 m 1000 m and 1500 m were created based on a comparison with the line data set we chose the surface with the 1000 m bandwidth and a resolution of 100 m x 100 m for the modelling process for landscape level metrics like the largest patch index or the connectivity metrics one single landscape metric surface resulted for each metric class level metrics like the share of open areas resulted in multiple surfaces one for each class thus finally 26 landscape metrics surfaces at six resolutions resulted and were ready to be used as candidate predictors for further analyses in the test area 2 6 statistical selection of landscape metric surfaces in this final pre processing step we singled out the landscape metric surfaces which contributed most to the model and determined the most adequate resolutions to test respective models quantitatively against the validation data we did a jack knife evaluation with a random test percentage was 25 and a number of background points of 10 000 averaged over 20 iterations the assessment of model performance was based on two criteria auc area under the roc curve and omission rate or auc reflects the discriminatory ability of a model it is a measure for the ability that a model ranks a random presence locality better than a random background point phillips et al 2006 where higher values implicate better models omission rate or quantifies overfitting it ranges between 0 and 1 where lower numbers indicate better model performance shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 although the auc based on presence background data is an arguable absolute measure for the performance of models lobo et al 2008 warren and seifert 2011 it is adequate to compare models of single species in an identical study area peterson 2011 first we determined the optimal resolution of the hexgrid in the test area we computed models with all landscape metric surfaces for each of the six resolutions i e the five hexgrid tesselations between 5 and 35 ha and the catchment units the respective auc and or values were compared to identify the resolutions at which models performed best second we selected the landscape metric surfaces that were most important for the model predictions as maxent is a machine learning algorithm we could make use of the regularisation procedure not only to avoid overfitting but also to select the most contributing covariates phillips et al 2006 elith et al 2011 specifically we used permutation importance to determine the relative importance of predictors permutation importance randomly alters the values of the covariate of interest among presence and background points subsequently the drop in the auc is measured and normalised to the percentage scale the larger this drop the more important is the covariate for the model prediction phillips et al 2006 only landscape metric surfaces with a permutation importance of 4 and more were kept as predictors for the final model this threshold simplified the models to a reasonable amount of detail with two adjustments we tried to avoid overfitting of the model first the model was constrained to linear and quadratic features more complex feature combinations allow a better fine tuning but are potentially very sensitive to a species environmental tolerance which in turn may lead to overfitted models shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 second we adapted the regularisation multiplier that controls the intensity of regularization across all features to a value of two with this value the chance that the model is overfitted to bias or noise in the sample points is relatively low radosavljevic and anderson 2014 finally we assessed how much model predictions differed in geographic space even if their overall predictive performance was similar the algorithms that we used to quantify geographic similarity were schoeners d schoener 1968 and i statistics warren et al 2008 these performance indicators represent the difference between the normalised suitability scores per grid cell the values range from 0 no match to 1 identical models while i often overestimates model similarity schoeners d is a more conservative measure rödder and engler 2011 2 7 final species distribution models the final models were computed with climatic layers the vegetation layer and the statistically most significant landscape metric surfaces all predictors had the same raster resolution of 100 m x 100 m to assess the added value of incorporating landscape metrics as predictors we computed 1 one model with all parameters i e landscape metrics climatic variables and the vegetation layer 2 one model with landscape metrics only and 3 one model without landscape metrics the latter null model served as a reference the resulting species distribution maps fig 3 were visualised as a binary prediction with 10 percentile training presence logistic threshold phillips and dudík 2008 3 results 3 1 target resolutions the model outputs for the different test area resolutions performed similarly well with respect to the resulting auc and or values the values for the auc ranged between 0 843 and 0 890 and for the or between 0 346 and 0 369 for the 6 test area models see table 2 for the chosen model resolutions due to the similar performances across resolutions we thus decided to select the three ecologically most meaningful scales for coronella austriaca völkl and käsewieter 2003 one represents the population scale 5 ha one the metapopulation scale 25 ha and the catchment areas serve as natural ecological units 3 2 selection of landscape metrics the individual contribution of the 26 test area landscape metrics on model predictions got marginally stronger the coarser the hexgrid resolution was the permutation importance for the 5 ha model contained five covariates with a zero percent permutation importance contrast grassland compact settlement percentage of pioneer vegetation contrast planted compact settlement percentage of subalpine vegetation percentage of dwarf pine knee timber the 25 ha model had four covariates with zero per cent permutation importance contrast grassland compact settlement percentage of pioneer vegetation percentage of dwarf pine knee timber percentage of subalpine vegetation the model with the highest zone size catchment areas only had one layer that did not contribute percentage of subalpine vegetation from the initial 26 landscape metrics surfaces only 6 of the 5 ha model 5 of the 25 ha model and 7 of the catchment areas model had a 4 or more contribution to model building and thus were further used in the final models table 3 provides an overview of all variables that were used for the final models despite some similarities in auc and or values between the different test area model results we observed differences in geographic space schoeners d schoener 1968 showed greater differences and less similarity than the i index warren et al 2008 the highest schoeners d value was 0 817 between the 5 ha and the 10 ha model the lowest schoeners d value and therefore the highest difference showed the catchment area and the 5 ha model with 0 676 the average d value was 0 749 the highest i value was 0 971 between the 10 ha and the 15 ha model the lowest i value was 0 907 between the 5 ha and the catchment area model the average i value was 0 942 3 3 the final models the final models fig 3 were calculated with the same settings as the test area models for all three model resolutions the best values were shown by the models with all covariates climatic vegetation and landscape metrics surfaces table 4 the best value was 0 888 from the 25 ha model the 5 ha model showed an auc value of 0 882 and the catchment areas model auc was 0 876 the auc value of the model without landscape metrics surfaces was 0 857 and the values for the models with only landscape metrics were between 0 832 and 0 847 increasing with the size of the statistical zones considering the models without landscape metrics the model with the largest statistical surface units showed the best results we additionally tried to fit the models by changing the settings allow more feature classes and lower the regularisation multiplier which increased the auc values between 0 859 for the 25 ha model with only landscape metrics and 0 928 for the 25 ha model with all covariates compared to the test areas model runs schoeners d and i statistics both showed increased differences for all models in geographic space the lowest d value with 0 610 appeared between the 5 ha model with landscape metrics only and the catchment areas model with all covariates the highest d value was 0 850 between the 25 ha model with all covariates and the 5 ha model with all covariates the average d value was 0 696 the i statistics again showed greater similarities between the models in geographic space the lowest value was 0 848 between the 25 ha landscape metrics model and the model without landscape metrics the highest value was 0 980 between the 25 ha surface with all covariates and the 5 ha surface with all covariates the average i value was 0 907 the correlations between the covariates showed high values between the climatic layers from 0 72 between the average equivalent temperature in july and the average accumulated precipitation up to 0 99 between the mean snow cover duration and average start end of snow cover excluding the mean annual global radiation where correlations were negligible with the other climatic layers the landscape metrics showed very low correlations with the climatic layers only the edge density and the average equivalent temperature in july sowed values up to 0 47 the landscape metrics surfaces among each other only showed higher correlations between the edge density the shannon diversity index and the largest patch index that ranged between 0 67 for the shannon diversity index and the largest patch index and 0 4 between the edge density and the largest patch index the catchment areas model also showed higher correlations between the percentage of light building density and the edge density of 0 45 the vegetation layer showed very low correlations between 0 25 and 0 33 with every other predictor again the larger the statistical surfaces get the stronger the correlations become 4 discussion in contrast to the common assumption in species distribution modelling that the environmental niche is the main descriptor of distribution ranges elith and leathwick 2009 also geographic factors are influential in this research we were able to illustrate that the integration of landscape metrics as predictors can improve predictions of a species distribution model among all seven distribution models for the smooth snake the best auc values resulted from combining all available predictor covariates landscape structure and environmental variables in contrast the model with only environmental predictors performed worse and the models with only landscape metric surfaces performed worst these results confirmed our argument that a species distribution is not only determined by its environmental niche but also by functional relations in geographic space integration of such mechanistic aspects is especially important in non equilibrium situations of expanding invasive species or climate driven range shifts elith and leathwick 2009 the most important landscape metrics covariates for coronella austriaca were the shannon diversity index patch sizes and contrast metrics together with the egde density that reflects some of the known habitat requirements of coronella austrica like the preference of edge structures völkl and käsewieter 2003 when focusing on the contrast metrics percentage of edge length of a focus calss shared with contrast classes this also reflects the importance of edge effects for this species the shannon diversity index shows that the habitat suitability gets higher the more diverse the environment becomes a more diverse environment also means more niches for different species and therefore more pray for coronella austriaca when examining the patch sizes c austriaca seems to prefer regions with light building desity this could also be an artefact because of the sampling intesity of the occurrence data more occurence data was sampled in regions where people live and there still is enough room for snake habitats so areas with light building density may be overrepresented in the sample points to put these results in a nutshell the model confirms the known importand landscape traits for the target species 4 1 spatial structure to account for the spatial context we included contextual indices that summarised the characteristics within a spatial neighbourhood like for example in ferrier et al 2002 unlike these authors we were not interested in the surrounding ecological niches but in the spatial structure itself while the results of our research unambiguously show that distribution models improve with the integration of landscape metrics this effect may depend on the species of interest for example hasui et al 2017 showed that the explanatory value of landscape metrics greatly varied between taxonomic groups for small terrestrial mammals the realtionship between habitat suitability and the landscape structure was confirmed by amici et al 2015 additionally not only the scale of sampling is important but also the grain of the underlying landscape in order to obtain landscape metrics that are functionally relevant it is important to select an adequate thematic granularity of vegetation classes with respect to the specific species under consideration the resolution of the underlying data needs to be adapted to a specific species its particular space demands and environmental requirements this point often is neglected especially in studies were multiple species are considered e g holzkämper et al 2006 schindler et al 2013 hasiu et al 2017 also the choice of adequate landscape metrics greatly depends on the species schindler et al 2013 investigated the predictive power of landscape metrics for six very different taxa in more detail they concluded that patch shape proximity texture diversity and patch size often were significant whereas similarity or contrast metrics did not result in significant models this partly is in accordance with the findings of our research where also diversity shannon diversity index and patch size percentage of the area of the whole statistical zone taken by the patch performed well as predictors in the model in our research also contrast metrics showed good results although the target species of these studies are very different it can be concluded that landscape metrics often contribute significantly to species distribution models landscape metric predictor surfaces add distinctly new information to the environmental variables we demonstrated in our research that despite a similar predictive power of environmental predictors versus spatial predictors the schoeners d analysis on map similarity showed that resulting distribution maps are of distinctly different nature this is also confirmed by almost zero correlation between climatic and landscape layers whereas the correlation between climatic layers is high interestingly the correlation between various landscape metrics layers were also low so each landscape metric predictor surface provides fundamentally new information 4 2 spatial scale another important aspect to consider for the incorporation of landscape metrics is the choice of scale the spatial structure governs ecological processes at multiple scales our results confirm a better model performance for all spatial models the mid scaled cell resolution of 25 ha for the reference grid performed best accordingly václavík et al 2012 observed an improvement in the distribution model of an invasive forest pathogen with the incorporation of spatial autocorrelation like in our model spatial dependences where highest in neighbourhoods of 200 400 m 12 to 50 ha also schindler et al 2013 found that the best performing size for the landscape metric reference areas for m species was around 20 ha finally hasui et al 2017 analysed broader scale neighbourhoods 12 5 km2 where the effects were not so clear in their study consideration of landscape metrics only had significant effects in 22 of the investigated target species in summary our research confirms the findings in the literature that the spatial structure of a landschape in the size of a few dozen hectars significantly impacts the occurrence of species this seems a plausible size for a landscape reference grid as it contains a representative sample of patches and enables fine scale modelling this scale represents processes at the metapopulation level 4 3 recommendations and outlook this research presents an approach to integrate the spatial structure of landscapes as predictors in species distribution models the results indicate that this approach holds promise and should be investigated further it not only can enhance the predictive power of the model but can also be helpful in identifying the most important landscape traits for the target species in the study area however the process to single out relevant landscape metrics and adequate scale levels is laborious and data hungry each decision had to be reflected and verified on the basis of the available data further research to better understand the role of scale and the adequacy of specific landscape metrics

24796,grassland carrying capacity and the number of livestock and wildlife play important roles in maintaining the balance of the grassland ecosystem in this study we assessed the grassland livestock balance between large wild herbivores and livestock we used the sample line transect method to conduct a survey on population and habitat area of wildlife in sanjiangyuan national park china from 2016 to 2017 and got detailed information about the population density and distribution of wildlife the maximum entropy model maxent was used to calculate the suitable habitat area of large wild herbivores in addition we used a suitable area to calculate the number of wildlife the results showed that the suitable habitat area of tibetan wild ass equus kiang and tibetan gazelle procapra picticaudata were 14 463 7 and 15 306 3 km2 respectively in maduo county the number of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle was 12 176 and 4 231 respectively the results indicated that the number of livestock was higher than that of wild herbivores and overgrazing was the main cause of grassland desertification however the wildlife population had little effect on grasslands the pressure index of livestock on pastures had gradually decreased in recent years therefore we advise to protect the grasslands and control the number of livestock for maintaining local ecological balance and animal husbandry development keywords tibetan wild ass tibetan gazelle carrying capacity qinghai tibet plateau maximum entropy model 1 introduction sanjiangyuan national park 123 100 km2 is the first national park in china which includes yellow river source park yangtze river source park and lancang river source park sanjiangyuan national park has a unique plateau alpine climate which is known as an important water conservation area and ecological security barrier and stabilizer of climate pattern in china cai et al 2019 cao et al 2019 chi et al 2019 maduo county is located in the hinterland of the sanjiangyuan nature reserve and the source area of the yellow river the natural ecosystem of maduo county is typical and its biodiversity protection has an important position in the world maduo county has abundant wildlife resources and grassland is the main habitat tibetan wild ass equus kiang tibetan gazelle procapra picticaudata tibetan fox vulpes ferrilata himalayan marmot marmota himalayana woolly hare lepus oiostolus bearded vulture gypaetus barbatus black necked crane grus nigricollis upland buzzard buteo hemilasius and bar headed goose anser indicus are the main wild animals found in maduo country cai et al 2019 gao et al 2019 maduo county is an important animal husbandry base in china with the economic development of china the livestock population has increased the traditional grassland husbandry in this region currently faces many problems such as overgrazing grassland degradation and ecological imbalance zhang et al 2002 of these overgrazing is the major influencing factor that threatens the grassland ecosystem liu et al 2008 shao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 also the wildlife habitat area has been gradually decreased due to the strengthening of wildlife protection the gradual increase of wild herbivore population and the use of net fences therefore the study about the large herbivore pastures is significant for maintaining the balance of pasture and livestock carrying capacity is one of the major concepts of rangeland management tian et al 2019 many studies have reported the estimation of grass primary net yield lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 feed intake of herbivores pasture utilization etc fan et al 2011 li et al 2012 yang et al 2018 different grazing levels can affect pasture productivity climate change is the most important factor that affects pasture productivity fan et al 2010 guo et al 2008 at present the studies on the natural grassland yield and carrying capacity of the qinghai tibet plateau have been mainly based on the data of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa or advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr zhang et al 2014 however there is a lack of accurate and complete data on the number and habitat distribution of wildlife therefore it is impossible to analyze the grazing pressure of the pasture both tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle are large wild herbivores which are widely distributed in maduo county their habitats are high in altitude and harsh in climate therefore it is difficult to gather field investigation data studying the spatial distribution of suitable habitats is important in habitat protection and selection for the tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle the maximum entropy model maxent is widely used to simulate the possible distribution region of target species through the actual distribution sites of species and various environmental variables due to simple operation and good predictive niche model the model has been widely used in wildlife conservation research li and wang 2013 in this study the population density of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle in maduo county was identified by the traditional ground transect survey method the maxent model was used to calculate the suitable habitat area and the number of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle in maduo county this study aimed to examine the balance between wild herbivores and livestock in the area and the impact of grazing and wildlife on the pasture based on the number of livestock in maduo county 2 methods 2 1 data collection and processing of distribution sites an extensive wildlife resource survey was conducted in the sanjiangyuan area of tibetan plateau qinghai province china through the line transect method from 2016 to 2017 we conducted the survey alone local unpaved road and occasionally drove on grassland and recorded the species number and geographic location of the wildlife the occurrences of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were 396 and 542 respectively in addition 8 and 16 geographical coordinates of both species were supplemented from the global biodiversity information facility gbif https www gbif org the number of distribution points for tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle was 404 and 558 to reduce the negative impact of the spatial autocorrelation between species distribution points on the construction of the niche model and improve the reliability of the simulation results the resolution distance was used to screen the distribution points of both species for reducing closed or repeated distribution points in the same grid in this study chamaille et al 2010 the arcgis 10 2 software was used to set the resolution distance to 1 km a total of 323 tibetan wild ass and 402 tibetan gazelle points remained for the evaluation of the niche model the sorted sites were entered into the table in species longitude latitude format furthermore the livestock and pasture carrying capacity data from 2010 to 2018 were collected from the yellow river source park management bureau of maduo county 2 2 collection and screening of environmental variables in this study four types of environmental variables related to tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were used to construct the maxent model as follows i climate variables which were derived from the global climate date http www worldclim org including 19 bioclimatic variables monthly precipitation monthly mean minimum temperature monthly mean maximum temperature and monthly average temperature ii altitude slope aspect ruggedness curvature flow direction and other topographic variables were extracted from the 30 m digital elevation model dem data bennett et al 2017 iii vegetation variables including vegetation type and vegetation normalization index were collected from the chinese academy of sciences resource environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn and iv human impact index and population spatial distribution data were obtained from the socioeconomic data and applications center sedac and the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr the correlation coefficient was calculated to reduce autocorrelation and multiple linear repetitions between the environmental variables the highly correlated environmental variables were eliminated to improve the accuracy of the simulation results of the model then spss 22 software was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient for the environmental variables the environmental factors with a high correlation coefficient r 0 80 were eliminated 2 3 optimization of parameters and construction of maxent maxent is a kind of ecological niche models enms which requires two sets of data including the spatial distribution of the target species and the environmental variables of the distribution area in this study distribution points and environmental variables of both species were screened the maixent 3 3 3k model was used to construct the optimal parameters of habitat suitability model for both species feature class selection parameters fc and regularization multiplier rm parameters was used to obtain more accurate results fc included linear l quadratic q hinge h product p and threshold t which were combined however rm value was set between 0 5 5 and increased by 0 5 each time enm tools were used to calculate the akaike information criterion aicc and bayesian information criterion bic scores under different parameters the parameters with the lowest aicc and bic scores were used to construct the potential habitat for tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle after selecting the optimal parameters the data of the species distribution points were randomly divided into two groups including one set of 75 as the training set for the construction of the model and another set of 25 of the distribution sites as the test set for the model verification the model was repeated ten times furthermore the accuracy of the maxent model was evaluated by auc value area under the roc curve the auc values ranged from 0 1 the higher the value is the higher the accuracy of the model is soucy et al 2018 2 4 analysis of suitable habitat of tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle we imported the habitat probability distribution layers of both species generated by the maxent simulation into arcgis software the existence probability ranged from 0 to 1 a high value indicates the high probability of species occurrence we used the reclassification function of arcgis to divide the layer data into four levels the existence probability including 0 6 0 4 0 6 0 2 0 4 and 0 2 indicate highly medium and low suitable areas and unsuitable zone respectively convertino et al 2014 the high and middle suitable areas were regarded as suitable distribution areas for large wild herbivores 2 5 estimation of carrying capacity of large wild herbivores the surveys were carried out in winter summer and autumn using the line transect method when designing the line transects the habitat type range of activities ecological habits of wildlife and the method of the investigation were considered the area of maduo county is 25 253 km2 in winter a total of 219 line transects total length 965 km total area 3 858 km2 were investigated which accounted for 15 29 of maduo county in summer and autumn 188 and 202 line transects of 869 km and 930 km were investigated these line transects were observed with a total area of 3 477 km2 and 3 720 km2 in summer and autumn accounting for 13 77 and 14 73 of the maduo county respectively the relative density and quantity of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle in maduo county were calculated according to the following formulas sheng and xu 1992 ρ 1 n i 1 n ρ i ρ n n n a n n ρ s gc n α where ρ represents the density of the target species in a particular sample area and ρ n represents the density of the target species of the nth line nn represents the number of target species of the nth line and an represents the area of the nth line n represents the population of the target species gc represents the razing capacity and s represents the area of suitable habitat calculated by the niche model α is the coefficient of conversion of large wild herbivores to sheep units the α coefficients of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were 4 and 0 5 respectively indicating that each tibetan wild ass was converted to 4 sheep units and each tibetan gazelle was converted to 0 5 sheep units 3 results 3 1 screening of environmental variables and detection of model accuracy a total of 17 and 16 variables with small correlation coefficients were selected to construct the habitat assessment models for tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle respectively table a1 and a2 both species shared 14 variables table 1 the optimal parameters were the combination of linear quadratic and product features in feature class selection the β values of both species were set to 3 0 and 2 5 in the regularization multiplier respectively according to the roc curve the average values of the auctest of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were 0 933 and 0 894 furthermore the standard deviation sd of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle was 0 013 and 0 010 respectively figure 1 3 2 habitat suitability analysis of large wild herbivores in maduo county the maxent was constructed to simulate habitat suitability based on the environmental variables and the distribution points of the tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle the suitable distribution areas of the tibetan wild ass were mainly located in zhalinghu township middle of machali town the northwest part of huanghe township and the eastern part of huashixia town figure 2 the highly suitable and medium suitable areas were 7 278 1 km2 and 7 185 6 km2 accounting for 28 8 and 28 5 of the area of maduo county respectively table 2 suitable areas for the tibetan gazelle were mainly located in the northeast and southwest of zhalinghu township machali town huanghe township and north and west of huashixia town figure 2 the highly suitable and medium suitable areas were 6 338 0 km2 and 8 968 3 km2 accounting for 25 1 and 35 5 of the total area of maduo county respectively table 2 the areas where both of the species inhabited were mainly located in the middle of maduo county 3 3 assessment of population density and carrying capacity the density was calculated according to the line transects the relative densities of tibetan wild ass in maduo county in winter summer and autumn were 0 5251 0 8418 and 0 5628 individual km2 respectively the average density was 0 6432 individual km2 according to the suitable area of tibetan wild ass in maduo county the estimated number of individuals in winter summer and autumn was 7 595 12 176 and 8 140 respectively the tibetan wild ass in maduo county in winter summer and autumn was converted to 30 380 48 702 and 30 380 sheep units respectively the relative densities of tibetan gazelle in maduo county in winter summer and autumn were 0 2181 0 2764 and 0 2241 individual km2 with an average density of 0 2395 individual km2 similarly the estimated number of individuals of this species in winter summer and autumn was 3 338 4 231 and 3 430 respectively after conversion to sheep units the tibetan gazelles in maduo county were 1 669 2 115 and 1 715 sheep units in winter summer and autumn respectively 3 4 analysis of livestock carrying capacity in maduo county according to the data provided by the bureau of agriculture and animal husbandry and forestry science and technology of maduo county the total grassland area of maduo county was 22 536 86 km2 which was divided into two parts such as prohibited grazing area and livestock balance area the latter area was 5 788 23 km2 and accounted for 25 68 of the total grassland area local herders grazed alternately in summer and winter pastures the grassland of the livestock balance area did not change from 2010 to 2018 however the coverage and grass yield of the grassland gradually increased and the available grassland capacity and the livestock balance area capacity showed an overall rising trend table 3 the overall livestock carrying capacity of maduo county showed a rising trend from 2013 to 2017 the livestock carrying capacity ranged from 305 386 to 316 762 sheep units table 4 in 2014 2015 the analysis of the balance capacity of grass and livestock showed that the livestock was critically overloaded in the livestock balance area also there was no pressure on the entire pasture table 5 4 discussion tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle had the highest population density in summer the suitable distribution highly and medium suitable areas of these species calculated by the maxent model were more than half of the total area of maduo county and were consistent with the actual survey the estimated population was lower than the density and number obtained by an aerial vehicles survey guo et al 2018 there is a deviation in the method of field investigation and calculating the number of individuals the line transect method requires more time and labor however this method can reduce uncertainty and increase data reliability the population density of wildlife based on field surveys combined with the suitable habitat area of the species can more accurately estimate the number of wildlife from the habitat suitability analysis most of the habitats in maduo county were found to be suitable for the survival of the tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle these suitable distribution areas should be regarded as the key protected areas for both ungulates the value of their existence cannot be ignored in poor and unsuitable habitats su et al 2014 similarly suitable habitats can be transformed into unsuitable habitats due to the lack of proper attention which can affect the reproduction and survival of wildlife the number of livestock was more than the number of large wild herbivores and large wild herbivores were wildly distributed in maduo county the carrying pressure index was 0 030 and there was no pressure to overfeed the grassland however the maximum carrying pressure index of livestock was 0 996 overgrazing is the main factor affecting the grassland grassland balance and our results are consistent with the previous study yang et al 2018 from 2010 to 2018 the grassland coverage and grass yield in maduo county gradually increased the strengthening of ecological protection and climate change are the main reasons for this phenomenon gillespie et al 2019 which is conducive to improve the productivity of plateau vegetation guo et al 2008 jian et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 overgrazing leads to high quality forage which is decreasing year by year and the poisonous weeds are growing fast and spreading yan et al 2015 however the control of the number of livestock is the key approach to increase the productivity of the vegetation maduo county is an important livestock area livestock is the main source of economic development for local residents and the government the effective management of grazing by the local governments is very important for the sustainable development of grasslands moderate grazing can increase grassland productivity mcnaughton 1983 besides the number of livestock should be controlled the establishment of a buffer zone for grassland can reduce stress and improve grassland elasticity according to the results there was an overgrazing phenomenon in the livestock balance area of maduo county the high livestock population was found to be the main reason of grassland degradation in further studies the population of wildlife should be monitored to examine the dynamic changes in wildlife and livestock population the analysis of the carrying capacity of the grassland will provide corresponding data to develop animal husbandry and environmental protection 5 conclusion according to the species distribution site we calculated the suitable distribution areas highly suitable and medium suitable of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle by the maxent model we obtained a relatively accurate population of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle the method of calculating the population based on a suitable habitat can increase the reliability of the survey of the wildlife population in the analysis of carrying capacity livestock outnumbered the wildlife population also overgrazing was the main factor affecting the grassland ecosystem therefore it is necessary to control the livestock population and protect grasslands for grassland restoration credit authorship contribution statement hongmei gao conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft writing review editing visualization

24796,grassland carrying capacity and the number of livestock and wildlife play important roles in maintaining the balance of the grassland ecosystem in this study we assessed the grassland livestock balance between large wild herbivores and livestock we used the sample line transect method to conduct a survey on population and habitat area of wildlife in sanjiangyuan national park china from 2016 to 2017 and got detailed information about the population density and distribution of wildlife the maximum entropy model maxent was used to calculate the suitable habitat area of large wild herbivores in addition we used a suitable area to calculate the number of wildlife the results showed that the suitable habitat area of tibetan wild ass equus kiang and tibetan gazelle procapra picticaudata were 14 463 7 and 15 306 3 km2 respectively in maduo county the number of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle was 12 176 and 4 231 respectively the results indicated that the number of livestock was higher than that of wild herbivores and overgrazing was the main cause of grassland desertification however the wildlife population had little effect on grasslands the pressure index of livestock on pastures had gradually decreased in recent years therefore we advise to protect the grasslands and control the number of livestock for maintaining local ecological balance and animal husbandry development keywords tibetan wild ass tibetan gazelle carrying capacity qinghai tibet plateau maximum entropy model 1 introduction sanjiangyuan national park 123 100 km2 is the first national park in china which includes yellow river source park yangtze river source park and lancang river source park sanjiangyuan national park has a unique plateau alpine climate which is known as an important water conservation area and ecological security barrier and stabilizer of climate pattern in china cai et al 2019 cao et al 2019 chi et al 2019 maduo county is located in the hinterland of the sanjiangyuan nature reserve and the source area of the yellow river the natural ecosystem of maduo county is typical and its biodiversity protection has an important position in the world maduo county has abundant wildlife resources and grassland is the main habitat tibetan wild ass equus kiang tibetan gazelle procapra picticaudata tibetan fox vulpes ferrilata himalayan marmot marmota himalayana woolly hare lepus oiostolus bearded vulture gypaetus barbatus black necked crane grus nigricollis upland buzzard buteo hemilasius and bar headed goose anser indicus are the main wild animals found in maduo country cai et al 2019 gao et al 2019 maduo county is an important animal husbandry base in china with the economic development of china the livestock population has increased the traditional grassland husbandry in this region currently faces many problems such as overgrazing grassland degradation and ecological imbalance zhang et al 2002 of these overgrazing is the major influencing factor that threatens the grassland ecosystem liu et al 2008 shao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 also the wildlife habitat area has been gradually decreased due to the strengthening of wildlife protection the gradual increase of wild herbivore population and the use of net fences therefore the study about the large herbivore pastures is significant for maintaining the balance of pasture and livestock carrying capacity is one of the major concepts of rangeland management tian et al 2019 many studies have reported the estimation of grass primary net yield lu et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 feed intake of herbivores pasture utilization etc fan et al 2011 li et al 2012 yang et al 2018 different grazing levels can affect pasture productivity climate change is the most important factor that affects pasture productivity fan et al 2010 guo et al 2008 at present the studies on the natural grassland yield and carrying capacity of the qinghai tibet plateau have been mainly based on the data of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa or advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr zhang et al 2014 however there is a lack of accurate and complete data on the number and habitat distribution of wildlife therefore it is impossible to analyze the grazing pressure of the pasture both tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle are large wild herbivores which are widely distributed in maduo county their habitats are high in altitude and harsh in climate therefore it is difficult to gather field investigation data studying the spatial distribution of suitable habitats is important in habitat protection and selection for the tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle the maximum entropy model maxent is widely used to simulate the possible distribution region of target species through the actual distribution sites of species and various environmental variables due to simple operation and good predictive niche model the model has been widely used in wildlife conservation research li and wang 2013 in this study the population density of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle in maduo county was identified by the traditional ground transect survey method the maxent model was used to calculate the suitable habitat area and the number of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle in maduo county this study aimed to examine the balance between wild herbivores and livestock in the area and the impact of grazing and wildlife on the pasture based on the number of livestock in maduo county 2 methods 2 1 data collection and processing of distribution sites an extensive wildlife resource survey was conducted in the sanjiangyuan area of tibetan plateau qinghai province china through the line transect method from 2016 to 2017 we conducted the survey alone local unpaved road and occasionally drove on grassland and recorded the species number and geographic location of the wildlife the occurrences of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were 396 and 542 respectively in addition 8 and 16 geographical coordinates of both species were supplemented from the global biodiversity information facility gbif https www gbif org the number of distribution points for tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle was 404 and 558 to reduce the negative impact of the spatial autocorrelation between species distribution points on the construction of the niche model and improve the reliability of the simulation results the resolution distance was used to screen the distribution points of both species for reducing closed or repeated distribution points in the same grid in this study chamaille et al 2010 the arcgis 10 2 software was used to set the resolution distance to 1 km a total of 323 tibetan wild ass and 402 tibetan gazelle points remained for the evaluation of the niche model the sorted sites were entered into the table in species longitude latitude format furthermore the livestock and pasture carrying capacity data from 2010 to 2018 were collected from the yellow river source park management bureau of maduo county 2 2 collection and screening of environmental variables in this study four types of environmental variables related to tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were used to construct the maxent model as follows i climate variables which were derived from the global climate date http www worldclim org including 19 bioclimatic variables monthly precipitation monthly mean minimum temperature monthly mean maximum temperature and monthly average temperature ii altitude slope aspect ruggedness curvature flow direction and other topographic variables were extracted from the 30 m digital elevation model dem data bennett et al 2017 iii vegetation variables including vegetation type and vegetation normalization index were collected from the chinese academy of sciences resource environment data cloud platform http www resdc cn and iv human impact index and population spatial distribution data were obtained from the socioeconomic data and applications center sedac and the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr the correlation coefficient was calculated to reduce autocorrelation and multiple linear repetitions between the environmental variables the highly correlated environmental variables were eliminated to improve the accuracy of the simulation results of the model then spss 22 software was used to calculate the pearson correlation coefficient for the environmental variables the environmental factors with a high correlation coefficient r 0 80 were eliminated 2 3 optimization of parameters and construction of maxent maxent is a kind of ecological niche models enms which requires two sets of data including the spatial distribution of the target species and the environmental variables of the distribution area in this study distribution points and environmental variables of both species were screened the maixent 3 3 3k model was used to construct the optimal parameters of habitat suitability model for both species feature class selection parameters fc and regularization multiplier rm parameters was used to obtain more accurate results fc included linear l quadratic q hinge h product p and threshold t which were combined however rm value was set between 0 5 5 and increased by 0 5 each time enm tools were used to calculate the akaike information criterion aicc and bayesian information criterion bic scores under different parameters the parameters with the lowest aicc and bic scores were used to construct the potential habitat for tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle after selecting the optimal parameters the data of the species distribution points were randomly divided into two groups including one set of 75 as the training set for the construction of the model and another set of 25 of the distribution sites as the test set for the model verification the model was repeated ten times furthermore the accuracy of the maxent model was evaluated by auc value area under the roc curve the auc values ranged from 0 1 the higher the value is the higher the accuracy of the model is soucy et al 2018 2 4 analysis of suitable habitat of tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle we imported the habitat probability distribution layers of both species generated by the maxent simulation into arcgis software the existence probability ranged from 0 to 1 a high value indicates the high probability of species occurrence we used the reclassification function of arcgis to divide the layer data into four levels the existence probability including 0 6 0 4 0 6 0 2 0 4 and 0 2 indicate highly medium and low suitable areas and unsuitable zone respectively convertino et al 2014 the high and middle suitable areas were regarded as suitable distribution areas for large wild herbivores 2 5 estimation of carrying capacity of large wild herbivores the surveys were carried out in winter summer and autumn using the line transect method when designing the line transects the habitat type range of activities ecological habits of wildlife and the method of the investigation were considered the area of maduo county is 25 253 km2 in winter a total of 219 line transects total length 965 km total area 3 858 km2 were investigated which accounted for 15 29 of maduo county in summer and autumn 188 and 202 line transects of 869 km and 930 km were investigated these line transects were observed with a total area of 3 477 km2 and 3 720 km2 in summer and autumn accounting for 13 77 and 14 73 of the maduo county respectively the relative density and quantity of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle in maduo county were calculated according to the following formulas sheng and xu 1992 ρ 1 n i 1 n ρ i ρ n n n a n n ρ s gc n α where ρ represents the density of the target species in a particular sample area and ρ n represents the density of the target species of the nth line nn represents the number of target species of the nth line and an represents the area of the nth line n represents the population of the target species gc represents the razing capacity and s represents the area of suitable habitat calculated by the niche model α is the coefficient of conversion of large wild herbivores to sheep units the α coefficients of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were 4 and 0 5 respectively indicating that each tibetan wild ass was converted to 4 sheep units and each tibetan gazelle was converted to 0 5 sheep units 3 results 3 1 screening of environmental variables and detection of model accuracy a total of 17 and 16 variables with small correlation coefficients were selected to construct the habitat assessment models for tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle respectively table a1 and a2 both species shared 14 variables table 1 the optimal parameters were the combination of linear quadratic and product features in feature class selection the β values of both species were set to 3 0 and 2 5 in the regularization multiplier respectively according to the roc curve the average values of the auctest of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle were 0 933 and 0 894 furthermore the standard deviation sd of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle was 0 013 and 0 010 respectively figure 1 3 2 habitat suitability analysis of large wild herbivores in maduo county the maxent was constructed to simulate habitat suitability based on the environmental variables and the distribution points of the tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle the suitable distribution areas of the tibetan wild ass were mainly located in zhalinghu township middle of machali town the northwest part of huanghe township and the eastern part of huashixia town figure 2 the highly suitable and medium suitable areas were 7 278 1 km2 and 7 185 6 km2 accounting for 28 8 and 28 5 of the area of maduo county respectively table 2 suitable areas for the tibetan gazelle were mainly located in the northeast and southwest of zhalinghu township machali town huanghe township and north and west of huashixia town figure 2 the highly suitable and medium suitable areas were 6 338 0 km2 and 8 968 3 km2 accounting for 25 1 and 35 5 of the total area of maduo county respectively table 2 the areas where both of the species inhabited were mainly located in the middle of maduo county 3 3 assessment of population density and carrying capacity the density was calculated according to the line transects the relative densities of tibetan wild ass in maduo county in winter summer and autumn were 0 5251 0 8418 and 0 5628 individual km2 respectively the average density was 0 6432 individual km2 according to the suitable area of tibetan wild ass in maduo county the estimated number of individuals in winter summer and autumn was 7 595 12 176 and 8 140 respectively the tibetan wild ass in maduo county in winter summer and autumn was converted to 30 380 48 702 and 30 380 sheep units respectively the relative densities of tibetan gazelle in maduo county in winter summer and autumn were 0 2181 0 2764 and 0 2241 individual km2 with an average density of 0 2395 individual km2 similarly the estimated number of individuals of this species in winter summer and autumn was 3 338 4 231 and 3 430 respectively after conversion to sheep units the tibetan gazelles in maduo county were 1 669 2 115 and 1 715 sheep units in winter summer and autumn respectively 3 4 analysis of livestock carrying capacity in maduo county according to the data provided by the bureau of agriculture and animal husbandry and forestry science and technology of maduo county the total grassland area of maduo county was 22 536 86 km2 which was divided into two parts such as prohibited grazing area and livestock balance area the latter area was 5 788 23 km2 and accounted for 25 68 of the total grassland area local herders grazed alternately in summer and winter pastures the grassland of the livestock balance area did not change from 2010 to 2018 however the coverage and grass yield of the grassland gradually increased and the available grassland capacity and the livestock balance area capacity showed an overall rising trend table 3 the overall livestock carrying capacity of maduo county showed a rising trend from 2013 to 2017 the livestock carrying capacity ranged from 305 386 to 316 762 sheep units table 4 in 2014 2015 the analysis of the balance capacity of grass and livestock showed that the livestock was critically overloaded in the livestock balance area also there was no pressure on the entire pasture table 5 4 discussion tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle had the highest population density in summer the suitable distribution highly and medium suitable areas of these species calculated by the maxent model were more than half of the total area of maduo county and were consistent with the actual survey the estimated population was lower than the density and number obtained by an aerial vehicles survey guo et al 2018 there is a deviation in the method of field investigation and calculating the number of individuals the line transect method requires more time and labor however this method can reduce uncertainty and increase data reliability the population density of wildlife based on field surveys combined with the suitable habitat area of the species can more accurately estimate the number of wildlife from the habitat suitability analysis most of the habitats in maduo county were found to be suitable for the survival of the tibetan wild ass and the tibetan gazelle these suitable distribution areas should be regarded as the key protected areas for both ungulates the value of their existence cannot be ignored in poor and unsuitable habitats su et al 2014 similarly suitable habitats can be transformed into unsuitable habitats due to the lack of proper attention which can affect the reproduction and survival of wildlife the number of livestock was more than the number of large wild herbivores and large wild herbivores were wildly distributed in maduo county the carrying pressure index was 0 030 and there was no pressure to overfeed the grassland however the maximum carrying pressure index of livestock was 0 996 overgrazing is the main factor affecting the grassland grassland balance and our results are consistent with the previous study yang et al 2018 from 2010 to 2018 the grassland coverage and grass yield in maduo county gradually increased the strengthening of ecological protection and climate change are the main reasons for this phenomenon gillespie et al 2019 which is conducive to improve the productivity of plateau vegetation guo et al 2008 jian et al 2012 zhu et al 2016 overgrazing leads to high quality forage which is decreasing year by year and the poisonous weeds are growing fast and spreading yan et al 2015 however the control of the number of livestock is the key approach to increase the productivity of the vegetation maduo county is an important livestock area livestock is the main source of economic development for local residents and the government the effective management of grazing by the local governments is very important for the sustainable development of grasslands moderate grazing can increase grassland productivity mcnaughton 1983 besides the number of livestock should be controlled the establishment of a buffer zone for grassland can reduce stress and improve grassland elasticity according to the results there was an overgrazing phenomenon in the livestock balance area of maduo county the high livestock population was found to be the main reason of grassland degradation in further studies the population of wildlife should be monitored to examine the dynamic changes in wildlife and livestock population the analysis of the carrying capacity of the grassland will provide corresponding data to develop animal husbandry and environmental protection 5 conclusion according to the species distribution site we calculated the suitable distribution areas highly suitable and medium suitable of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle by the maxent model we obtained a relatively accurate population of tibetan wild ass and tibetan gazelle the method of calculating the population based on a suitable habitat can increase the reliability of the survey of the wildlife population in the analysis of carrying capacity livestock outnumbered the wildlife population also overgrazing was the main factor affecting the grassland ecosystem therefore it is necessary to control the livestock population and protect grasslands for grassland restoration credit authorship contribution statement hongmei gao conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft writing review editing visualization

24797,the urban building environment has dramatically transited into a high rise style consequently street canyons have changed the daytime solar radiation distribution and indirectly affected the photosynthesis of the surrounding ecosystems because of the interdisciplinary nature of the topic quantitative studies are rare in this study a new approach combining radiation simulation and in situ observations was proposed aiming to provide support towards sustainable urban spatial planning and management taking the central business district cbd of beijing as the research area the range and intensity of the shading effect were assessed based on a digital surface model dsm and solar radiation analysis sra the findings reveal the following 1 the daytime carbon capture of green space was 33 14 12 43 gco2 m 2 d 1 which included 85 6 11 9 and 2 5 from trees shrubs and grassland respectively 2 the carbon capture index cci of the arbor zone was approximately two and five times that of shrubs and grassland respectively the sensitivity of carbon capture to the building height increased in the order shrubs grassland trees to enhance current carbon capture trees and shrubs should play a dominant role in urban greening planning 3 when constructing enclosed buildings and planting inside as well as to the north of high buildings in northern hemisphere cities a setback line is strongly suggested according to the building height 4 when the building height increased by 10 or by one floor the carbon capture declined by 0 29 tco2 km 2 d 1 or 0 40 tco2 km 2 d 1 respectively these results

urbanization process the contradiction between the persistent population migration into cities and the shortage of land sources has driven architectural designers and municipal administrators to explore urban space at the vertical dimension watts et al 2010 consequently the urban building environment has dramatically transited from the original style of low rise and low density buildings into a modern style with tall large and high floor area ratio features joshi and kono 2009 especially in rapidly developing economies and regions the average building volumes and heights in different scales of cities are constantly increasing pan and wei 2015 compared to low rise buildings high rise buildings occupy far fewer land sources at the same usable floor area besides skyscrapers can reduce the construction of pipeline network and other public utilities cut down investment per unit area and provide substantial socioeconomic benefits watts et al 2010 in recent years however the increase in high rise buildings within the boundaries of urban systems has presented the intensive characteristics of continuous clusters and the structures tend to be more complicated which largely reshapes urban skylines and leads to microclimate variation at the city s underlying surface thereby causing a series of eco environmental effects niu 2004 the urban building system and its environmental effects have become a multi disciplinary research hotspot involving architecture urban ecology landscape planning and management cheema and abdur 2015 1 1 a brief review of building environmental effects generally the existing studies involving building environmental effects are mainly focused on different aspects of the residual environment light wind thermos pollutants etc the screen effect is one of the most important research directions in studies of the urban building environment with the number of vehicles rising sharply a large number of studies have focused on the variation in the wind field in street canyons thereby influencing the dispersion of pollutants and particulate matters from vehicle exhaust baik et al 2007 habilomatis and chaloulakou 2015 zhong et al 2015 on site multipoint continuous observations scaling model control experiments wind tunnel flume experiments etc and numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics cfd were conducted to explore the effects of building geometrical shape roof wind and heat on the dynamic pollutant dispersion characteristics in the complex flow field environment baik et al 2007 huang et al 2009 pavageau and schatzmann 1999 with the process of rapid urbanization buildings roads squares and other artificial impervious surfaces have replaced vast natural surfaces which thereby change the hydrothermal exchange of the underlying surfaces xu et al 2018 for the urban thermal effect induced by the building environment researchers have mainly conducted field measurements thermal infrared remote sensing inversion and thermodynamics analysis to study the spatiotemporal temperature fluctuation and time lag characteristics chen et al 2006 creutzig et al 2017 oke 2017 peng et al 2012 moreover some scholars have investigated the relationship between the thermal effect of modern building materials and urban heat islands as well as energy conservation and somatosensory comfort of buildings from the meteorological perspective mirrahimi et al 2015 pasupathy et al 2008 perini and magliocco 2014 high rise buildings accommodate a larger population due to their large volumes however the excessive configuration of skyscrapers causes immense pressures on traffic control energy supply and public safety deng et al 2016 in addition from the view of urban planning blind construction and irrational distribution would impair the harmony of urban landscapes and destroy the original cultural scenes whitehand and gu 2010 for the urban daylight environment the gathering of large buildings around streets blocks overhead solar radiation forming dim street canyons with variations in the solar elevation angle a massive contiguous shadow projects onto the surroundings severely impacting the internal residual environment and the eco environmental condition of nearby streets yu et al 2009 to date studies of the effects of the urban building environment on daytime solar radiation have focused primarily on a indoor comfort analysis marino et al 2015 b guidance of rooftop solar panel distribution based on local solar radiation analysis erdélyi et al 2014 hofierka and kaňuk 2009 yadav and chandel 2013 and c solar radiation effect on pollutant dispersion in street canyons xie et al 2005 but have rarely linked the environmental factor to the typical ecological process caused by the variation in the building environment pugh et al 2012 1 2 structure pattern process function an integrated thinking based on urban complex ecosystems as mentioned above the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of incoming solar radiation drives many of the earth s physical and biological processes e g air and soil temperature regimes evapotranspiration snowmelt patterns soil moisture and light available for photosynthesis budyko 1969 in the urban daytime light environment the artificial structures directly change the spatial distribution of ground received solar radiation shorten the sunshine duration weaken the radiation intensity and alter the spectral composition consequently forming a typical artificial overshadow environment bertamini et al 2006 valladares et al 2012 as relevant research indicated building shade leads to a severe attenuation of near ground shortwave radiation in cities which declines to 21 95 of solar radiation on open ground kjelgren and clark 1992 hamerlynck found that the sunlight intensity under the typical building shading environment in new jersey declined to 10 15 μmol m 2 s 1 which was smaller than 1 5 of total solar radiation intensity hamerlynck 2001 navrátil and bell et al compared the shading spectra between buildings and vegetation canopy and found that the proportion of blue rays in shortwave radiation under the building shade circumstances was higher than that of canopy shade indicating that building shading filtered fewer blue rays bell et al 2000 navrátil et al 2007 further the light environment is closely related to photosynthesis street canyons enclosed by buildings are a significant zone for urban greening and their unique daytime light environment directly causes variation in photosynthesis and carbon storage rates of plants and indirectly affects plant growth and physiological development such as blossoming and fruiting getter et al 2009 szeicz 1974 such changes and effects severely challenge the exertion of ecological service function and the management of urban greening thus conducting a 3d based systematic analysis to reveal how urban buildings featuring different shapes and uneven spatial distributions change the ground solar radiation and further impact the carbon sequestration process of surrounding greening plants dynamically can provide methodological and technical support for the study of efficient utilization of sunlight resources in street canyons sound planning for urban green space and eco friendly building designs that support ecosystem services promotion however since such interdisciplinary research involves the coupling of multiple physical and ecological processes e g 3d modeling light transmission and vegetation photosynthesis between the urban building subsystem and the urban green space subsystem quantitative studies are rare most of the studies concerning the effects of shading on photosynthesis mainly implemented potted plant experiments at different shading levels using light incubators cruz 1997 pierson et al 1990 those studies were unable to reflect the complex light environmental characteristics in real urban street canyons besides the green spaces in cities are highly biodiverse owing to the pursuit of landscape beautification hope et al 2003 reportedly the built up area of beijing possesses 255 101 and 122 species of herbaceous plants shrubs and trees respectively zhao et al 2009 the change of biodiversity under the high intensive human disturbances also increases the difficulty of assessing carbon capture capacity at the block or urban scales in this study a new approach combining radiation simulation and in situ observations was proposed the dynamic changes of buildings on the spatial distribution of solar radiation as well as the effects on the photosynthetic carbon capture of the surrounding green space were investigated on july 10 2017 aiming to assess potentially impairs the ecological service of the urban green space and provide support towards sustainable urban spatial planning and management 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the beijing central business district cbd is located between the east 2nd and 4th ring roads 116 26 32 116 28 24 e 39 54 10 39 55 18 n and has an area of 3 9 km2 fig 1 the cbd houses many chinese headquarters of fortune global 500 enterprises including finance insurance real estate and it industries the district also possesses plenty of magnificent super high buildings guo and shan 2017 some landmark buildings include the cctv buildings and the chinese headquarters of samsung the 528 m high the china zun currently under construction will eventually be the city s tallest skyscraper the average annual total solar radiation of beijing in recent years was 5357 mj m2 and the total sunlight duration in 2017 was 2287 h with a daily average sunlight duration of 6 27 h bmb 2017 the sunlight duration maximized in spring and minimized in winter and that of summer was smaller than that of autumn due to the impact of the rainy season 2 2 methods the technical routes of this study was spatial forms of urban buildings changes in daylight environment impacts on ecological processes service function impairment of the green space s carbon capture an integrated method combining environmental simulation and on site observations was proposed in which a high precision digital surface model dsm based on multisource data was built the daylight environment was simulated through solar radiation analysis sra computation then together with in situ spectral observation and measurement of plant light response curves lrc the shading effects of the urban building environment on the photosynthetic carbon capture capacity of the surrounding green spaces were investigated the detailed technical route is shown in fig 2 2 2 1 dsm generating dsm is a type of refined data format that can portray the topographical fluctuation at a small scale level and includes the positions and shape information for the objects above the terrain mi et al 2013 here a dsm covering the study area was built by combining remote sensing image interpretation existing shapefiles collection and on site surveying and mapping two major procedures were adopted first existing shapefiles of the study area were collected as the base maps together with the high resolution satellite image the interpretation of ground objects was conducted to obtain the 2d vectorized boundaries and areas of buildings and vegetation the height attributes of buildings were measured by using laser distance meters combined with existing 3d laser scanning data and remote sensing stereo images then the relative positioning dsm was generated on arcgis second the ground control points gcps were distributed uniformly for absolute positioning purposes the gcps were surveyed with the real time kinematic rtk gps by using the cross correlation algorithm cca the relative positioning dsm was transformed and localized spatially onto the geodetic coordinate system the registration accuracy was controlled within one pixel and then the dsm with geographical calibration was built the 30 m digital elevation model dem was introduced to eliminate tiny topographic fluctuations finally the normalized digital surface model ndsm was obtained 2 2 2 solar radiation analysis to precisely analyze the solar radiation at the urban block level we introduced the hemispherical viewshed algorithm hva based on the dsm in hva processes a sun map and a sky view map were created for each raster cell in conjunction with the sun s position and sky directional information then the direct diffuse and total direct diffuse radiation for each location was calculated to produce an accurate insolation map of the entire study area fu and rich 2002 the direct radiation dir for a given location is the sum of the direct insolation from all sun map sectors for each sky sector the diffuse radiation dif at its centroid was calculated the variable θ and variable α represent the zenith angle and azimuth angle at the centroid the total solar radiation solartot was calculated by summarizing the direct radiation on the sun map and the diffuse radiation on the sky view map respectively the formula is shown in eq 1 as follows 1 s o l a r t o t d i r θ α d i f θ α by iterative computation of a given area integrated over the time interval and corrected by the gap fraction and angle of incidence the solar radiation within a specified period was acquired in the unit of w m2 2 2 3 in situ spectral observation the solar constant 1367 w m2 was adopted in the hva which assumed the weather was in a clear condition due to the influence of weather conditions and air quality the calculated sra value was overestimated than the actual ground value and should be calibrated by in situ spectral data to retrieve the distribution of solar radiation the sra results were converted via the empirical formula of dir dif and photosynthetically active radiation par to acquire the par distribution without calibration then the hourly spectra from in situ observation were applied to calibrate the par distribution the main steps are as follows first an observation point was selected in a relatively open space the location should be close to the center of the study area to make the observation more representative the hourly spectra and radiation intensity were observed using a spectrograph avaspec uls2048xl 280 1100 nm then solar radiation was converted to par with a spectral range from 380 nm to 710 nm for plant utilization the conversion formula is shown in eq 2 as follows 2 p a r t λ 380 710 a λ t λ 10 5 h c n a where par t is the in situ measured par value at time t μmol s 1 m 2 λ is the wavelength nm aλ t is the measured solar radiation intensity at time t with a wavelength of λ μw cm2 h is the planck constant 6 626 070 150 10 34 j s c is the velocity of light and na is the avogadro constant 6 022 140 76 1023 mol 1 the key derivation processes were detailed in the supplementary materials second the spatial distribution of the solar radiation was converted to par with the unit of photon flux density see eq 3 as follows 3 p a r t α 0 43 d i r t 0 57 d i f t where dirt and dift were the direct radiation and diffuse radiation at time t determined from sra respectively and α was the calibration coefficient which was the ratio of maximum par from spectral measurement to the maximum par determined from hva the coefficients of direct radiation and diffuse radiation were based on decades of meteorological study in beijing zhou et al 2005 2 2 4 community survey and light response curve observation to improve the operability of assessment we assumed the plants in the community were evenly distributed and the carbon capture capacities were generally the same the representative species the species with the highest coverage in the community can replace other species for carbon capture estimation three plots were selected to represent arbor community shrub community and grassland community with a plot area of 10 m 10 m 5 m 5 m and 1 m 1 m respectively vegetation height is a crucial factor in the sunlight duration received by plants here the average heights of the three types of communities were measured when the representative species being defined three of them were randomly selected in the plot to observe lrc by using the photosynthesis system li 6400xt then the non rectangular hyperbolic model was applied with the aid of photosyn assistant software to extract the photosynthetic parameters including the light compensation points lcps light saturation points lsps and the maximum photosynthetic rate pmax the leaf area index lai was obtained by using the plant canopy analyzer lai 2200 in which a fish eye optical sensor and a model of radiative transfer in vegetative canopies were applied together to increase precision based on the par spatial distribution as well as the known characteristics and lrcs of the representative vegetation communities it is possible to compute the capture capacity of carbon dioxide in each pixel at a certain time under the shading effects of buildings see eq 4 as follows 4 c c t 1 t f l r c p a r t 3600 s lai k where cc was the co2 that captured from vegetation photosynthesis under the shading effects of buildings within a specified period gco2 t was the total sunlight duration h par t was the par at time t under the shading effect of buildings μmol m 2 s 1 flrc was the function mapping with par as the independent variable and photosynthetic rate as the dependent variable and determined by lrcs s was the area of vegetation coverage determined as the satellite interpreted community area multiplied by the measured community coverage m2 and k was the conversion coefficient 44 10 6 g μmol to further elaborate the variation driven by building shading and the contribution of individual communities to the total co2 capture on a global scale two indexes were introduced see eqs 5 and 6 5 b i c t 1 t f l r c p a r t f l r c p a r t 3600 s lai k where bic was the difference between the co2 captured with building impacts and that without building impacts in each pixel at a certain time gco2 par t was the par at time t assuming without shading effect impact μmol m 2 s 1 6 c c i c c i s t o t a l where cci was the index representing the co2 captured ability of all the communities on the scale of the overall study area cci was the total carbon dioxide captured from community i see eq 4 stotal was the total area of the study area 2 2 5 setting of scenario analysis building height is a highly influential factor in the photosynthesis carbon capture of the surrounding green space at the block scale however the relationship between building height and green space carbon storage is complicated the core process of this study the dsm based sra makes such quantitative research possible under the assumption that the area of the green space photosynthesis capability and other community features maintain the status quo we set five scenarios based on the current building heights 1 reduced by 10 2 increased by 10 3 20 4 50 and 5 each building elevated by one floor 2 9 m then the dsm was reconstructed in arcgis and further to assess the impact on carbon capture with the indices of cci cci and bic 3 results 3 1 object interpretation and dsm building the ground objects in the cbd were interpreted from the worldview 3 image aug 2017 0 5 m via in situ investigation the revised shapefiles were used for updating the land use information fig 3 the floor area of various buildings was 0 92 km2 and the area of green space was 0 82 km2 which accounts for 23 6 and 21 0 of the total area in the cbd respectively more specifically the areas of trees shrub and grassland communities were 0 57 0 16 and 0 09 km2 respectively which accounted for 69 5 19 5 and 10 0 of total green space respectively the area of impervious surfaces including various roads squares and construction sites was 2 16 km2 accounting for 55 4 of the total area in the cbd according to section 2 2 1 the ndsm was built 0 5 m in horizontal precision 1 m in elevation precision for extracting the 3d information and estimating the shading effect of buildings fig 4 in the model the relative height of buildings was 26 6 30 5 m on average ranging from 2 9 to 214 6 m 3 2 solar radiation analysis of the beijing cbd the solartot dir and dif on 10 july 2017 are shown in fig 5 the solartot on that day ranged from 2 3 to 5844 9 wh with an average of 4495 5 1327 9 wh in particular the dir 3599 4 1111 5 wh and dif 896 1 258 1 wh accounted for 80 and 20 of the solartot respectively and the theoretical sunlight duration was 14 8 h fig 6 shows the results of the daytime solar spectrum on the tested day the weather was relatively clear and the air temperature was 23 36 c with a 2nd force south wind 1 6 3 3 m s the measuring point was set in an open space where buildings were distributed relatively sparsely 116 27 23 6 e 39 54 35 2 n fig 5 observations showed that the solar radiation maximized to 720 98 w m2 at 12 00 noon followed by 14 00 685 97 w m2 and 13 00 684 29 w m2 the minimum occurred at 19 00 with 0 01 w m2 followed by 17 00 0 25 w m2 and 18 00 11 73 w m2 the simulated solar radiation was calibrated and unit transformed using eqs 2 and 3 and the resulting hourly par appears in fig 7 the par maximized to 1805 μmol m 2 s 1 occurring on the top of the highest building at 12 00 for the minimum par a zero value was found at all time intervals due to the impacts of building zenith angle and azimuth angle of the sun 3 3 photosynthesis and community investigation for each type of vegetation three plots were selected during the community investigation table 1 the community coverage ranked as arbor 64 0 grassland 51 6 shrub 42 3 the lai ranked as shrub 5 4 arbor 4 2 grassland 3 6 the abundance rate of populus tomentosa buxus megistophylla levl and poa pratensis l were 39 3 18 7 and 97 4 with average heights of 5 2 m 1 6 m and 0 2 m respectively through the survey populus tomentosa buxus megistophylla levl and poa pratensis l the top frequently appearing species were selected as the representatives of trees shrubs and grassland respectively the the lrcs of these three representatives as well as the light compensation points lcps light saturation points lsps and the maximum photosynthetic rate pmax are shown in fig 8 the lrcs showed that p tomentosa and p pratensis had similar response modes for sunlight utilization namely after reaching the lsp the photosynthetic rate gradually stabilized with the increase in light intensity on the contrary the photosynthetic rate of b megistophylla was significantly inhibited when the light intensity was beyond the lsp with regard to the lcps all three species were below 30 μmol m 2 s 1 where b megistophylla had the lowest lcp 12 μmol m 2 s 1 showing a relatively high shade tolerance concerning the pmax the value of b megistophylla is 5 48 μmol m 2 s 1 which was 39 that of p tomentosa and 48 that of p pratensis with relatively higher lsps and pmax p tomentosa and p pratensis both showed certain traits referring to heliophiles 3 4 spatial distribution of green space carbon capture based on eq 4 the carbon capture capacity of green space in the beijing cbd on july 10 2017 5 00 19 00 beijing time was calculated fig 9 the per unit area of daytime carbon capture in the cbd was 33 14 12 43 gco2 m 2 d 1 and ranged from 4 87 to 61 94 gco2 m 2 d 1 the total carbon capture of the entire green space system in the study day was 26 35 tco2 d 1 and those from the arbor shrub and grassland communities were 22 55 85 6 3 14 11 9 and 0 66 2 5 tco2 with the cci value in 1 23 0 61 0 25 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 scenario analysis of building height increasing impact on the carbon capture of urban vegetation in fig 10 the results indicated that the overall increment of building height pro rata was significantly negatively correlated with the daytime carbon capture of the surrounding green space p 0 01 when the building height increased by 10 the average carbon capture decreased by 0 24 0 06 tco2 d 1 namely 0 29 tco2 km 2 d 1 in the cbd in scenario 5 when the building height increased by one floor the carbon capture of the green space declined by 0 40 tco2 km 2 d 1 the above findings suggest that increases in overall building height either pro rata or by a certain unified level can alter the daytime distribution and intensity of solar radiation and consequently weaken the photosynthetic capacity of the surrounding green space it is worth noting that the building height is positively related to the floor area ratio population and local gdp bertaud and brueckner 2005 to some extent the above results imply that the current building environmental change would potentially impair the ecological service function of the urban green space the four scenarios reconstructed the dsm based on the current building heights scenario 1 reduced by 10 scenario 2 increased by 10 scenario 3 increased by 20 scenario 4 increased by 50 4 2 sensitivity assessment of different vegetation types to the building height increase the cci of the arbor community 1 23 was approximately two and five times that of the shrub 0 61 and grassland 0 25 respectively for enhancing the co2 sequestration and oxygen release from the urban green space it is suggested that urban greening planners should emphasize planting trees with higher biomasses rather than excessively increasing the proportion of lawns solely for landscape beautification table 2 lists the contributions from the three types of vegetation to the total green space carbon capture under five scenarios of building height variation along with the increase in building height from scenario 1 to scenario 4 the proportion of carbon capture from the arbor zone declined from 85 6 to 85 2 whereas the carbon capture increased from 11 9 to 12 1 in the shrub zone and from 2 5 to 2 6 in the grassland zone table 2 thus the current sensitivity of carbon capture to the building height elevation ranked as arbor grassland shrub the outcome indicates that shrubs featured a relatively low lcp with a decent shade tolerance in scenario 5 the results show that the amount of captured co2 within the study area reduced by 0 04t as each building elevated by one floor 4 3 lessons from the current urban green space design based on eq 5 the spatial distribution of carbon capture change was obtained by subtracting the value of scenario 4 from that of scenario 1 in grids a region with a higher bic value suggested where the building shading more severely affected the carbon capture and vice versa fig 11 in a closed or semi closed building cluster the carbon capture capacity of the green space was largely attenuated fig 11a b thus those designs constructing relatively closed building complexes and planting green spaces inside are inadvisable in middle latitude cities in the northern hemisphere such as beijing the layout of planting vegetation to the south of buildings is favorable for photosynthesis and carbon capture fig 11c the grassland is relatively low and its biomass per unit area is not in the same order of magnitude as that of tall trees if a lawn layout is demanded we suggest it should be planted to the south of buildings and from a certain distance of the buildings since the solar radiation in the north is relatively low especially in winter the areas of such places would be enlarged along with the decrease in solar zenith angle conversely if green space is needed to the north of tall and large buildings we strongly suggest setting a particular buffer zone according to the building height fig 11d e the old residential zones in the study area were all designed to be relatively dense however the carbon capture capacity per unit area was more significant when compared to modern residential communities mainly because the building heights are relatively lower therefore the influenced area in the north of a low building is significantly narrower fig 11f another reason is that tall trees which were less affected by the building shade dominated the green space there the bic was the difference between the co2 captured with building impacts and that without building impacts in each pixel at a certain time gco2 a region with a higher bic value suggested where the building shading more severely affected the carbon capture and vice versa 5 conclusions urban ecosystems play an increasingly important role in global climate change pataki et al 2010 currently the urban building environment is undergoing considerable changes following old town renewal and new district construction projects in those emerging countries from the perspective of the urban artificial natural coupling ecosystem this study targeted the variation in the daylight environment in street canyons caused by urban buildings and the variation in sun elevation angle as well as the consequent impact on the carbon capture process of surrounding greening plants an integrated method combining environmental simulation and in situ observations was built from the case study and the scenario analysis the range and intensity of the building shading effect in the beijing cbd were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the daytime carbon capture per unit area of green space in the cbd was 33 14 12 43 gco2 m 2 d 1 and the total carbon capture was 26 35 tco2 d 1 which included 85 6 11 9 and 2 5 from the trees shrubs and grassland respectively 2 the cci of the arbor community was approximately two and five times that of shrubs and grassland respectively the sensitivity of carbon capture to the building height increasing ranked as shrubs grassland trees to enhance current carbon capture service we suggest that trees and shrubs should play dominant roles in urban greening planning 3 those designs that construct relatively closed building complexes and plant green spaces inside are inadvisable if green space is needed to the north of the building it is strongly suggested that planners set a photosynthetic buffer zone according to the building height 4 when the building height increased by 10 and by one floor the carbon capture of green space declined by 0 29 tco2 km 2 d 1 and 0 40 tco2 km 2 d 1 respectively the building height is positively related to the floor area ratio population and local gdp to some extent implying that the current building environmental change would potentially impair the ecological service function of the urban green space methodologically this study initially assessed the carbon capture capacity within a natural day by increasing the frequency of field observations and ultra fine dsm reconstruction we can further reveal the seasonal and annual shading effect of buildings and study the influencing mechanisms under different building densities and spatial layouts in the future related research will also take the light reflection from the glass curtain walls outside the buildings into account and integrate the shading effect of the community into the existing model aiming to provide support towards urban

24797,the urban building environment has dramatically transited into a high rise style consequently street canyons have changed the daytime solar radiation distribution and indirectly affected the photosynthesis of the surrounding ecosystems because of the interdisciplinary nature of the topic quantitative studies are rare in this study a new approach combining radiation simulation and in situ observations was proposed aiming to provide support towards sustainable urban spatial planning and management taking the central business district cbd of beijing as the research area the range and intensity of the shading effect were assessed based on a digital surface model dsm and solar radiation analysis sra the findings reveal the following 1 the daytime carbon capture of green space was 33 14 12 43 gco2 m 2 d 1 which included 85 6 11 9 and 2 5 from trees shrubs and grassland respectively 2 the carbon capture index cci of the arbor zone was approximately two and five times that of shrubs and grassland respectively the sensitivity of carbon capture to the building height increased in the order shrubs grassland trees to enhance current carbon capture trees and shrubs should play a dominant role in urban greening planning 3 when constructing enclosed buildings and planting inside as well as to the north of high buildings in northern hemisphere cities a setback line is strongly suggested according to the building height 4 when the building height increased by 10 or by one floor the carbon capture declined by 0 29 tco2 km 2 d 1 or 0 40 tco2 km 2 d 1 respectively these results

urbanization process the contradiction between the persistent population migration into cities and the shortage of land sources has driven architectural designers and municipal administrators to explore urban space at the vertical dimension watts et al 2010 consequently the urban building environment has dramatically transited from the original style of low rise and low density buildings into a modern style with tall large and high floor area ratio features joshi and kono 2009 especially in rapidly developing economies and regions the average building volumes and heights in different scales of cities are constantly increasing pan and wei 2015 compared to low rise buildings high rise buildings occupy far fewer land sources at the same usable floor area besides skyscrapers can reduce the construction of pipeline network and other public utilities cut down investment per unit area and provide substantial socioeconomic benefits watts et al 2010 in recent years however the increase in high rise buildings within the boundaries of urban systems has presented the intensive characteristics of continuous clusters and the structures tend to be more complicated which largely reshapes urban skylines and leads to microclimate variation at the city s underlying surface thereby causing a series of eco environmental effects niu 2004 the urban building system and its environmental effects have become a multi disciplinary research hotspot involving architecture urban ecology landscape planning and management cheema and abdur 2015 1 1 a brief review of building environmental effects generally the existing studies involving building environmental effects are mainly focused on different aspects of the residual environment light wind thermos pollutants etc the screen effect is one of the most important research directions in studies of the urban building environment with the number of vehicles rising sharply a large number of studies have focused on the variation in the wind field in street canyons thereby influencing the dispersion of pollutants and particulate matters from vehicle exhaust baik et al 2007 habilomatis and chaloulakou 2015 zhong et al 2015 on site multipoint continuous observations scaling model control experiments wind tunnel flume experiments etc and numerical simulations based on computational fluid dynamics cfd were conducted to explore the effects of building geometrical shape roof wind and heat on the dynamic pollutant dispersion characteristics in the complex flow field environment baik et al 2007 huang et al 2009 pavageau and schatzmann 1999 with the process of rapid urbanization buildings roads squares and other artificial impervious surfaces have replaced vast natural surfaces which thereby change the hydrothermal exchange of the underlying surfaces xu et al 2018 for the urban thermal effect induced by the building environment researchers have mainly conducted field measurements thermal infrared remote sensing inversion and thermodynamics analysis to study the spatiotemporal temperature fluctuation and time lag characteristics chen et al 2006 creutzig et al 2017 oke 2017 peng et al 2012 moreover some scholars have investigated the relationship between the thermal effect of modern building materials and urban heat islands as well as energy conservation and somatosensory comfort of buildings from the meteorological perspective mirrahimi et al 2015 pasupathy et al 2008 perini and magliocco 2014 high rise buildings accommodate a larger population due to their large volumes however the excessive configuration of skyscrapers causes immense pressures on traffic control energy supply and public safety deng et al 2016 in addition from the view of urban planning blind construction and irrational distribution would impair the harmony of urban landscapes and destroy the original cultural scenes whitehand and gu 2010 for the urban daylight environment the gathering of large buildings around streets blocks overhead solar radiation forming dim street canyons with variations in the solar elevation angle a massive contiguous shadow projects onto the surroundings severely impacting the internal residual environment and the eco environmental condition of nearby streets yu et al 2009 to date studies of the effects of the urban building environment on daytime solar radiation have focused primarily on a indoor comfort analysis marino et al 2015 b guidance of rooftop solar panel distribution based on local solar radiation analysis erdélyi et al 2014 hofierka and kaňuk 2009 yadav and chandel 2013 and c solar radiation effect on pollutant dispersion in street canyons xie et al 2005 but have rarely linked the environmental factor to the typical ecological process caused by the variation in the building environment pugh et al 2012 1 2 structure pattern process function an integrated thinking based on urban complex ecosystems as mentioned above the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of incoming solar radiation drives many of the earth s physical and biological processes e g air and soil temperature regimes evapotranspiration snowmelt patterns soil moisture and light available for photosynthesis budyko 1969 in the urban daytime light environment the artificial structures directly change the spatial distribution of ground received solar radiation shorten the sunshine duration weaken the radiation intensity and alter the spectral composition consequently forming a typical artificial overshadow environment bertamini et al 2006 valladares et al 2012 as relevant research indicated building shade leads to a severe attenuation of near ground shortwave radiation in cities which declines to 21 95 of solar radiation on open ground kjelgren and clark 1992 hamerlynck found that the sunlight intensity under the typical building shading environment in new jersey declined to 10 15 μmol m 2 s 1 which was smaller than 1 5 of total solar radiation intensity hamerlynck 2001 navrátil and bell et al compared the shading spectra between buildings and vegetation canopy and found that the proportion of blue rays in shortwave radiation under the building shade circumstances was higher than that of canopy shade indicating that building shading filtered fewer blue rays bell et al 2000 navrátil et al 2007 further the light environment is closely related to photosynthesis street canyons enclosed by buildings are a significant zone for urban greening and their unique daytime light environment directly causes variation in photosynthesis and carbon storage rates of plants and indirectly affects plant growth and physiological development such as blossoming and fruiting getter et al 2009 szeicz 1974 such changes and effects severely challenge the exertion of ecological service function and the management of urban greening thus conducting a 3d based systematic analysis to reveal how urban buildings featuring different shapes and uneven spatial distributions change the ground solar radiation and further impact the carbon sequestration process of surrounding greening plants dynamically can provide methodological and technical support for the study of efficient utilization of sunlight resources in street canyons sound planning for urban green space and eco friendly building designs that support ecosystem services promotion however since such interdisciplinary research involves the coupling of multiple physical and ecological processes e g 3d modeling light transmission and vegetation photosynthesis between the urban building subsystem and the urban green space subsystem quantitative studies are rare most of the studies concerning the effects of shading on photosynthesis mainly implemented potted plant experiments at different shading levels using light incubators cruz 1997 pierson et al 1990 those studies were unable to reflect the complex light environmental characteristics in real urban street canyons besides the green spaces in cities are highly biodiverse owing to the pursuit of landscape beautification hope et al 2003 reportedly the built up area of beijing possesses 255 101 and 122 species of herbaceous plants shrubs and trees respectively zhao et al 2009 the change of biodiversity under the high intensive human disturbances also increases the difficulty of assessing carbon capture capacity at the block or urban scales in this study a new approach combining radiation simulation and in situ observations was proposed the dynamic changes of buildings on the spatial distribution of solar radiation as well as the effects on the photosynthetic carbon capture of the surrounding green space were investigated on july 10 2017 aiming to assess potentially impairs the ecological service of the urban green space and provide support towards sustainable urban spatial planning and management 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the beijing central business district cbd is located between the east 2nd and 4th ring roads 116 26 32 116 28 24 e 39 54 10 39 55 18 n and has an area of 3 9 km2 fig 1 the cbd houses many chinese headquarters of fortune global 500 enterprises including finance insurance real estate and it industries the district also possesses plenty of magnificent super high buildings guo and shan 2017 some landmark buildings include the cctv buildings and the chinese headquarters of samsung the 528 m high the china zun currently under construction will eventually be the city s tallest skyscraper the average annual total solar radiation of beijing in recent years was 5357 mj m2 and the total sunlight duration in 2017 was 2287 h with a daily average sunlight duration of 6 27 h bmb 2017 the sunlight duration maximized in spring and minimized in winter and that of summer was smaller than that of autumn due to the impact of the rainy season 2 2 methods the technical routes of this study was spatial forms of urban buildings changes in daylight environment impacts on ecological processes service function impairment of the green space s carbon capture an integrated method combining environmental simulation and on site observations was proposed in which a high precision digital surface model dsm based on multisource data was built the daylight environment was simulated through solar radiation analysis sra computation then together with in situ spectral observation and measurement of plant light response curves lrc the shading effects of the urban building environment on the photosynthetic carbon capture capacity of the surrounding green spaces were investigated the detailed technical route is shown in fig 2 2 2 1 dsm generating dsm is a type of refined data format that can portray the topographical fluctuation at a small scale level and includes the positions and shape information for the objects above the terrain mi et al 2013 here a dsm covering the study area was built by combining remote sensing image interpretation existing shapefiles collection and on site surveying and mapping two major procedures were adopted first existing shapefiles of the study area were collected as the base maps together with the high resolution satellite image the interpretation of ground objects was conducted to obtain the 2d vectorized boundaries and areas of buildings and vegetation the height attributes of buildings were measured by using laser distance meters combined with existing 3d laser scanning data and remote sensing stereo images then the relative positioning dsm was generated on arcgis second the ground control points gcps were distributed uniformly for absolute positioning purposes the gcps were surveyed with the real time kinematic rtk gps by using the cross correlation algorithm cca the relative positioning dsm was transformed and localized spatially onto the geodetic coordinate system the registration accuracy was controlled within one pixel and then the dsm with geographical calibration was built the 30 m digital elevation model dem was introduced to eliminate tiny topographic fluctuations finally the normalized digital surface model ndsm was obtained 2 2 2 solar radiation analysis to precisely analyze the solar radiation at the urban block level we introduced the hemispherical viewshed algorithm hva based on the dsm in hva processes a sun map and a sky view map were created for each raster cell in conjunction with the sun s position and sky directional information then the direct diffuse and total direct diffuse radiation for each location was calculated to produce an accurate insolation map of the entire study area fu and rich 2002 the direct radiation dir for a given location is the sum of the direct insolation from all sun map sectors for each sky sector the diffuse radiation dif at its centroid was calculated the variable θ and variable α represent the zenith angle and azimuth angle at the centroid the total solar radiation solartot was calculated by summarizing the direct radiation on the sun map and the diffuse radiation on the sky view map respectively the formula is shown in eq 1 as follows 1 s o l a r t o t d i r θ α d i f θ α by iterative computation of a given area integrated over the time interval and corrected by the gap fraction and angle of incidence the solar radiation within a specified period was acquired in the unit of w m2 2 2 3 in situ spectral observation the solar constant 1367 w m2 was adopted in the hva which assumed the weather was in a clear condition due to the influence of weather conditions and air quality the calculated sra value was overestimated than the actual ground value and should be calibrated by in situ spectral data to retrieve the distribution of solar radiation the sra results were converted via the empirical formula of dir dif and photosynthetically active radiation par to acquire the par distribution without calibration then the hourly spectra from in situ observation were applied to calibrate the par distribution the main steps are as follows first an observation point was selected in a relatively open space the location should be close to the center of the study area to make the observation more representative the hourly spectra and radiation intensity were observed using a spectrograph avaspec uls2048xl 280 1100 nm then solar radiation was converted to par with a spectral range from 380 nm to 710 nm for plant utilization the conversion formula is shown in eq 2 as follows 2 p a r t λ 380 710 a λ t λ 10 5 h c n a where par t is the in situ measured par value at time t μmol s 1 m 2 λ is the wavelength nm aλ t is the measured solar radiation intensity at time t with a wavelength of λ μw cm2 h is the planck constant 6 626 070 150 10 34 j s c is the velocity of light and na is the avogadro constant 6 022 140 76 1023 mol 1 the key derivation processes were detailed in the supplementary materials second the spatial distribution of the solar radiation was converted to par with the unit of photon flux density see eq 3 as follows 3 p a r t α 0 43 d i r t 0 57 d i f t where dirt and dift were the direct radiation and diffuse radiation at time t determined from sra respectively and α was the calibration coefficient which was the ratio of maximum par from spectral measurement to the maximum par determined from hva the coefficients of direct radiation and diffuse radiation were based on decades of meteorological study in beijing zhou et al 2005 2 2 4 community survey and light response curve observation to improve the operability of assessment we assumed the plants in the community were evenly distributed and the carbon capture capacities were generally the same the representative species the species with the highest coverage in the community can replace other species for carbon capture estimation three plots were selected to represent arbor community shrub community and grassland community with a plot area of 10 m 10 m 5 m 5 m and 1 m 1 m respectively vegetation height is a crucial factor in the sunlight duration received by plants here the average heights of the three types of communities were measured when the representative species being defined three of them were randomly selected in the plot to observe lrc by using the photosynthesis system li 6400xt then the non rectangular hyperbolic model was applied with the aid of photosyn assistant software to extract the photosynthetic parameters including the light compensation points lcps light saturation points lsps and the maximum photosynthetic rate pmax the leaf area index lai was obtained by using the plant canopy analyzer lai 2200 in which a fish eye optical sensor and a model of radiative transfer in vegetative canopies were applied together to increase precision based on the par spatial distribution as well as the known characteristics and lrcs of the representative vegetation communities it is possible to compute the capture capacity of carbon dioxide in each pixel at a certain time under the shading effects of buildings see eq 4 as follows 4 c c t 1 t f l r c p a r t 3600 s lai k where cc was the co2 that captured from vegetation photosynthesis under the shading effects of buildings within a specified period gco2 t was the total sunlight duration h par t was the par at time t under the shading effect of buildings μmol m 2 s 1 flrc was the function mapping with par as the independent variable and photosynthetic rate as the dependent variable and determined by lrcs s was the area of vegetation coverage determined as the satellite interpreted community area multiplied by the measured community coverage m2 and k was the conversion coefficient 44 10 6 g μmol to further elaborate the variation driven by building shading and the contribution of individual communities to the total co2 capture on a global scale two indexes were introduced see eqs 5 and 6 5 b i c t 1 t f l r c p a r t f l r c p a r t 3600 s lai k where bic was the difference between the co2 captured with building impacts and that without building impacts in each pixel at a certain time gco2 par t was the par at time t assuming without shading effect impact μmol m 2 s 1 6 c c i c c i s t o t a l where cci was the index representing the co2 captured ability of all the communities on the scale of the overall study area cci was the total carbon dioxide captured from community i see eq 4 stotal was the total area of the study area 2 2 5 setting of scenario analysis building height is a highly influential factor in the photosynthesis carbon capture of the surrounding green space at the block scale however the relationship between building height and green space carbon storage is complicated the core process of this study the dsm based sra makes such quantitative research possible under the assumption that the area of the green space photosynthesis capability and other community features maintain the status quo we set five scenarios based on the current building heights 1 reduced by 10 2 increased by 10 3 20 4 50 and 5 each building elevated by one floor 2 9 m then the dsm was reconstructed in arcgis and further to assess the impact on carbon capture with the indices of cci cci and bic 3 results 3 1 object interpretation and dsm building the ground objects in the cbd were interpreted from the worldview 3 image aug 2017 0 5 m via in situ investigation the revised shapefiles were used for updating the land use information fig 3 the floor area of various buildings was 0 92 km2 and the area of green space was 0 82 km2 which accounts for 23 6 and 21 0 of the total area in the cbd respectively more specifically the areas of trees shrub and grassland communities were 0 57 0 16 and 0 09 km2 respectively which accounted for 69 5 19 5 and 10 0 of total green space respectively the area of impervious surfaces including various roads squares and construction sites was 2 16 km2 accounting for 55 4 of the total area in the cbd according to section 2 2 1 the ndsm was built 0 5 m in horizontal precision 1 m in elevation precision for extracting the 3d information and estimating the shading effect of buildings fig 4 in the model the relative height of buildings was 26 6 30 5 m on average ranging from 2 9 to 214 6 m 3 2 solar radiation analysis of the beijing cbd the solartot dir and dif on 10 july 2017 are shown in fig 5 the solartot on that day ranged from 2 3 to 5844 9 wh with an average of 4495 5 1327 9 wh in particular the dir 3599 4 1111 5 wh and dif 896 1 258 1 wh accounted for 80 and 20 of the solartot respectively and the theoretical sunlight duration was 14 8 h fig 6 shows the results of the daytime solar spectrum on the tested day the weather was relatively clear and the air temperature was 23 36 c with a 2nd force south wind 1 6 3 3 m s the measuring point was set in an open space where buildings were distributed relatively sparsely 116 27 23 6 e 39 54 35 2 n fig 5 observations showed that the solar radiation maximized to 720 98 w m2 at 12 00 noon followed by 14 00 685 97 w m2 and 13 00 684 29 w m2 the minimum occurred at 19 00 with 0 01 w m2 followed by 17 00 0 25 w m2 and 18 00 11 73 w m2 the simulated solar radiation was calibrated and unit transformed using eqs 2 and 3 and the resulting hourly par appears in fig 7 the par maximized to 1805 μmol m 2 s 1 occurring on the top of the highest building at 12 00 for the minimum par a zero value was found at all time intervals due to the impacts of building zenith angle and azimuth angle of the sun 3 3 photosynthesis and community investigation for each type of vegetation three plots were selected during the community investigation table 1 the community coverage ranked as arbor 64 0 grassland 51 6 shrub 42 3 the lai ranked as shrub 5 4 arbor 4 2 grassland 3 6 the abundance rate of populus tomentosa buxus megistophylla levl and poa pratensis l were 39 3 18 7 and 97 4 with average heights of 5 2 m 1 6 m and 0 2 m respectively through the survey populus tomentosa buxus megistophylla levl and poa pratensis l the top frequently appearing species were selected as the representatives of trees shrubs and grassland respectively the the lrcs of these three representatives as well as the light compensation points lcps light saturation points lsps and the maximum photosynthetic rate pmax are shown in fig 8 the lrcs showed that p tomentosa and p pratensis had similar response modes for sunlight utilization namely after reaching the lsp the photosynthetic rate gradually stabilized with the increase in light intensity on the contrary the photosynthetic rate of b megistophylla was significantly inhibited when the light intensity was beyond the lsp with regard to the lcps all three species were below 30 μmol m 2 s 1 where b megistophylla had the lowest lcp 12 μmol m 2 s 1 showing a relatively high shade tolerance concerning the pmax the value of b megistophylla is 5 48 μmol m 2 s 1 which was 39 that of p tomentosa and 48 that of p pratensis with relatively higher lsps and pmax p tomentosa and p pratensis both showed certain traits referring to heliophiles 3 4 spatial distribution of green space carbon capture based on eq 4 the carbon capture capacity of green space in the beijing cbd on july 10 2017 5 00 19 00 beijing time was calculated fig 9 the per unit area of daytime carbon capture in the cbd was 33 14 12 43 gco2 m 2 d 1 and ranged from 4 87 to 61 94 gco2 m 2 d 1 the total carbon capture of the entire green space system in the study day was 26 35 tco2 d 1 and those from the arbor shrub and grassland communities were 22 55 85 6 3 14 11 9 and 0 66 2 5 tco2 with the cci value in 1 23 0 61 0 25 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 scenario analysis of building height increasing impact on the carbon capture of urban vegetation in fig 10 the results indicated that the overall increment of building height pro rata was significantly negatively correlated with the daytime carbon capture of the surrounding green space p 0 01 when the building height increased by 10 the average carbon capture decreased by 0 24 0 06 tco2 d 1 namely 0 29 tco2 km 2 d 1 in the cbd in scenario 5 when the building height increased by one floor the carbon capture of the green space declined by 0 40 tco2 km 2 d 1 the above findings suggest that increases in overall building height either pro rata or by a certain unified level can alter the daytime distribution and intensity of solar radiation and consequently weaken the photosynthetic capacity of the surrounding green space it is worth noting that the building height is positively related to the floor area ratio population and local gdp bertaud and brueckner 2005 to some extent the above results imply that the current building environmental change would potentially impair the ecological service function of the urban green space the four scenarios reconstructed the dsm based on the current building heights scenario 1 reduced by 10 scenario 2 increased by 10 scenario 3 increased by 20 scenario 4 increased by 50 4 2 sensitivity assessment of different vegetation types to the building height increase the cci of the arbor community 1 23 was approximately two and five times that of the shrub 0 61 and grassland 0 25 respectively for enhancing the co2 sequestration and oxygen release from the urban green space it is suggested that urban greening planners should emphasize planting trees with higher biomasses rather than excessively increasing the proportion of lawns solely for landscape beautification table 2 lists the contributions from the three types of vegetation to the total green space carbon capture under five scenarios of building height variation along with the increase in building height from scenario 1 to scenario 4 the proportion of carbon capture from the arbor zone declined from 85 6 to 85 2 whereas the carbon capture increased from 11 9 to 12 1 in the shrub zone and from 2 5 to 2 6 in the grassland zone table 2 thus the current sensitivity of carbon capture to the building height elevation ranked as arbor grassland shrub the outcome indicates that shrubs featured a relatively low lcp with a decent shade tolerance in scenario 5 the results show that the amount of captured co2 within the study area reduced by 0 04t as each building elevated by one floor 4 3 lessons from the current urban green space design based on eq 5 the spatial distribution of carbon capture change was obtained by subtracting the value of scenario 4 from that of scenario 1 in grids a region with a higher bic value suggested where the building shading more severely affected the carbon capture and vice versa fig 11 in a closed or semi closed building cluster the carbon capture capacity of the green space was largely attenuated fig 11a b thus those designs constructing relatively closed building complexes and planting green spaces inside are inadvisable in middle latitude cities in the northern hemisphere such as beijing the layout of planting vegetation to the south of buildings is favorable for photosynthesis and carbon capture fig 11c the grassland is relatively low and its biomass per unit area is not in the same order of magnitude as that of tall trees if a lawn layout is demanded we suggest it should be planted to the south of buildings and from a certain distance of the buildings since the solar radiation in the north is relatively low especially in winter the areas of such places would be enlarged along with the decrease in solar zenith angle conversely if green space is needed to the north of tall and large buildings we strongly suggest setting a particular buffer zone according to the building height fig 11d e the old residential zones in the study area were all designed to be relatively dense however the carbon capture capacity per unit area was more significant when compared to modern residential communities mainly because the building heights are relatively lower therefore the influenced area in the north of a low building is significantly narrower fig 11f another reason is that tall trees which were less affected by the building shade dominated the green space there the bic was the difference between the co2 captured with building impacts and that without building impacts in each pixel at a certain time gco2 a region with a higher bic value suggested where the building shading more severely affected the carbon capture and vice versa 5 conclusions urban ecosystems play an increasingly important role in global climate change pataki et al 2010 currently the urban building environment is undergoing considerable changes following old town renewal and new district construction projects in those emerging countries from the perspective of the urban artificial natural coupling ecosystem this study targeted the variation in the daylight environment in street canyons caused by urban buildings and the variation in sun elevation angle as well as the consequent impact on the carbon capture process of surrounding greening plants an integrated method combining environmental simulation and in situ observations was built from the case study and the scenario analysis the range and intensity of the building shading effect in the beijing cbd were evaluated the main conclusions are as follows 1 the daytime carbon capture per unit area of green space in the cbd was 33 14 12 43 gco2 m 2 d 1 and the total carbon capture was 26 35 tco2 d 1 which included 85 6 11 9 and 2 5 from the trees shrubs and grassland respectively 2 the cci of the arbor community was approximately two and five times that of shrubs and grassland respectively the sensitivity of carbon capture to the building height increasing ranked as shrubs grassland trees to enhance current carbon capture service we suggest that trees and shrubs should play dominant roles in urban greening planning 3 those designs that construct relatively closed building complexes and plant green spaces inside are inadvisable if green space is needed to the north of the building it is strongly suggested that planners set a photosynthetic buffer zone according to the building height 4 when the building height increased by 10 and by one floor the carbon capture of green space declined by 0 29 tco2 km 2 d 1 and 0 40 tco2 km 2 d 1 respectively the building height is positively related to the floor area ratio population and local gdp to some extent implying that the current building environmental change would potentially impair the ecological service function of the urban green space methodologically this study initially assessed the carbon capture capacity within a natural day by increasing the frequency of field observations and ultra fine dsm reconstruction we can further reveal the seasonal and annual shading effect of buildings and study the influencing mechanisms under different building densities and spatial layouts in the future related research will also take the light reflection from the glass curtain walls outside the buildings into account and integrate the shading effect of the community into the existing model aiming to provide support towards urban

24798,species distribution models can be affected by overprediction when dispersal movement is not incorporated into the modelling process we compared the efficiency of seven methods that take into account spatial constraints to reduce overprediction when using four algorithms for species distribution models by using a virtual ecologist approach we were able to measure the accuracy of each model in predicting actual species distributions we built 40 virtual species distributions within the neotropical realm then we randomly sampled 50 occurrences that were used in seven spatially restricted species distribution models hereafter called m sdms and a non spatially restricted ecological niche model enm we used four algorithms maximum entropy generalized linear models random forest and support vector machine m sdm methods were divided into a priori methods in which spatial restrictions were inserted with environmental variables in the modelling process and a posteriori methods in which reachable and suitable areas were overlapped m sdm efficiency was obtained by calculating the difference in commission and omission errors between m sdms and enms we used linear mixed effects models to test if differences in commission and omission errors varied among the m sdms and algorithms our results indicate that overall m sdms reduce overprediction with no increase in underprediction compared to enms with few exceptions such as a priori methods combined with the support vector machine algorithm there is a high variation in modelling performance among species but there were only a few cases in which overprediction or underprediction increased we only compared methods that do not require species dispersal data guaranteeing that they can be applied to less studied species we advocate that species distribution modellers should not ignore spatial constraints especially because they can be included in models at low costs but high benefits in terms of overprediction reduction keywords ecological niche modelling model overprediction spatial constraints species dispersal species distribution model virtual ecologist approach 1 introduction species geographic distributions were viewed by e h rapoport as chinese lantern shadows produced by different taxa on the continental screen rapoport 1982 the early investigation of factors affecting species distribution built the foundations for several disciplines such as biogeography macroecology and conservation biology guisan et al 2013 nowadays it is accepted that species distributions result from the intermingling of several factors such as phylogenetic constraints lawton 1993 historical events barve et al 2011 ecological adaptations calosi et al 2008 and biotic interactions wisz et al 2013 among others three main components define the actual area of species distributions a grinellian niche a that encompasses abiotic conditions in which a species is able to exist an eltonian niche b encompassing biotic interactions and a third component with locations reachable by the species m soberón and peterson 2005 soberón 2007 barve et al 2011 predicting boundaries of species distributions requires the understanding of these components and the way they interact to generate geographic ranges species distribution models were built to assist these predictions and have been commonly applied in ecological studies since the late 1990s and show no sign of losing popularity lobo et al 2010 it is common to come across two terms for similar but not identical frameworks to predict environmental distributions of species ecological niche models enms and species distribution models sdms enms predict ecological niche limits to species occurrence while sdms predict actual species geographical distributions peterson and soberón 2012 in practical terms enms commonly use scenopoetic variables such as climate variables and species occurrences to indicate environmentally suitable sites in which the species presence is unknown the component a of species distribution sdms include additional steps such as dispersal constraints restrictions in model calibration or suspected absences to build closer predictions to the actual distribution including the movement component m in sdms can be necessary because in natural conditions species seldom occur in all environmentally suitable areas due to historical e g geographical barriers and ecological factors limiting accessibility of areas e g intrinsic dispersal limitations and distribution of suitable areas in the geographical space guisan and theurillat 2000 svenning and skov 2004 araújo pearson and rahbek 2005 therefore enms often predict larger areas than sdms such as environmentally suitable areas never colonised before due to dispersal constraints an approach to develop sdms is to incorporate the accessible area component m into the modelling procedures by taking into account species dispersal history and spatial barriers allouche et al 2008 barve et al 2011 cooper and soberón 2018 there are three common strategies to include the component m in species distribution models 1 delimiting accessible areas 2 including dispersal constraints into models and 3 simulating dispersal through evolutionary time the first option is to restrict model calibration region by hypothesizing a species accessible area e g using expert range maps or biogeographical regions barve et al 2011 broennimann et al 2012 cooper and soberón 2018 holloway et al 2016 kremen et al 2008 accessible areas are regions that can be reached through dispersal within a relevant timeframe depending on the existence of dispersal barriers tingley monahan beissinger and moritz 2009 araújo and rozenfeld 2013 species specific abilities to cross them svenning and skov 2004 vasudev et al 2015 and species evolutionary age weber et al 2014 a common alternative to estimating accessible areas is the use of biotic regions where species have been found holt et al 2013 olson et al 2001 spalding et al 2007 the existence of numerous classifications for biotic regions e g ecoregions or biomes and the lack of correspondence between biotic regions boundaries and species dispersal ability are disadvantages of this method additionally accessibility can be estimated by using dispersal models to create accessibility maps to be overlapped with environmental suitability maps barve et al 2011 holloway et al 2016 it is also possible to include accessibility data after generating environmental suitability maps kremen et al 2008 hereafter a posteriori methods this may function as restriction fields to possible colonization areas sorting out areas inaccessible for species and thus not pertaining to the set of possible distribution areas the second strategy is to incorporate spatial information into the fitting process of enms hereafter a priori methods or to overlap them with suitability maps created by enms hereafter a posteriori methods since species distributions are autocorrelated phenomena spatial predictors can be derived from autoregressive models dormann et al 2007 or from occurrence data itself as a surrogate of accessibility because occurrences of native species are found only in places where they were able to access allouche et al 2008 bahn and mcgill 2007 cardador et al 2014 de marco et al 2008 rodrigues and lima ribeiro 2018 spatial filters distance constraint layers or any type of vector containing spatial information can be added in ecological analyses as model predictors increasing their predictive power by considering spatial autocorrelation de marco et al 2008 griffith et al 2006 a similar advantage could be argued for the inclusion of spatial predictors in sdms allouche et al 2008 these methods do not require previous knowledge on species specific dispersal abilities even though they are based on occurrence data which intrinsically carries information on species evolutionary dispersal mechanisms the third strategy is to generate dynamic movement models to simulate the dispersal capacity of the species through evolutionary time barve et al 2011 brotons et al 2012 cabral and schurr 2010 engler and guisan 2009 holloway et al 2016 the advantage of this approach is considering dynamic environmental changes that must have occurred during range expansion and shifts resulting in more realistic predictions barve et al 2011 cardador et al 2014 however this requires datasets through time hardly available for the majority of the global biodiversity brotons et al 2012 franklin 2010 and intensive computational tools barve et al 2011 different from some previous exercises comparing methods for the incorporation of movement in species distribution models e g barve et al 2011 holloway et al 2016 here we focused on methods that only require data on species presence first and second approaches above for most tropical species very limited biological data are available collen et al 2008 meyer et al 2015 emphasising the urgency in testing the accuracy of models with low data requirements we investigated the effectiveness of seven methods for incorporating spatial constraints into sdms hereafter we call those models m sdms as they are designed to taking account of the accessible area the m movement component of the soberón and peterson 2005 conceptual model for species distributions to investigate the performance of the seven methods five obtained from literature and two new proposals we used a virtual ecologist approach creating 40 virtual species distributions within the neotropical realm climatic data fig 1 we tested the hypothesis that m sdms reduce overprediction compared to non spatially restricted enms all seven methods are feasible with the absence of species specific dispersal data or temporal datasets and can be used for estimating distributions of real species we chose methods with those characteristics because occurrence data is commonly available for most of the world s species the methods use two different approaches 1 a priori methods include distance constraints as covariates with climate variables in the modelling procedure and 2 a posteriori methods overlap environmental suitability maps with accessible areas 2 material and methods 2 1 virtual species to evaluate the effect of the different m sdms approaches we created 40 virtual species distributions within the neotropical realm using a cellular automata model fig s1 we used the protocol developed by de marco et al 2008 with further advances from de marco and nóbrega 2018 this approach comprises a spatially explicit colonization extinction model based on the following steps 1 determination of the fundamental niche of a species based on optimal and tolerance values 2 projection of the fundamental niche into the geographic space to create species suitability and 3 simulation of species distributions based on suitability using a spatially explicit automata cellular model we created the fundamental niches of species from 19 bioclimatic variables from the neotropical realm derived from monthly temperature and rain data available at worldclim v 2 0 http www worldclim org in a resolution of 5 arc minutes c 9 km we used a principal components analysis pca selecting the six first principal components that explained c 95 of the data variability table s1 we used principal components instead of raw climatic variables to reduce the dimensionality and collinearity when creating virtual species distributions de marco and nóbrega 2018 the optimum niche conditions for a virtual species was defined as the climate in a randomly selected seed pixel obtained from its principal components scores virtual species persistence probability in a pixel was conceived as a multivariate gaussian distribution with means equal to the optimum climate conditions and standard deviation equal to 30 of the total standard deviation of the environmental variables this means that all virtual species were equally generalists we rescaled the value of the multivariate gaussian probability distribution function to vary from zero to one by dividing each value by its maximum de marco and nóbrega 2018 finally we projected the persistence probability onto the geographic space being equal to one in pixels with optimum environmental conditions and towards zero as environmental conditions moved away from the optimum a cellular automata model was used to simulate the expansion of virtual species distributions from their seed pixel persistent populations in a pixel produced three propagules that have the potential to colonise adjacent cells that are up to five spaces from the origin following a gaussian distribution the distance of dispersion per iteration from 1 to 5 pixels and the direction of the movement were determined following a uniform probability distribution with equal probability in all eight possible directions from a pixel propagules could colonise or be extinct in a pixel following a boolean function of persistence probability derived from simulated ideal environmental conditions for that species we considered that virtual species do not occupy pixels with persistence probability lower than 0 25 and that they always occupy pixels with persistence probability higher than 0 75 we are aware that this may seem arbitrary at first but we expect a higher range cohesion as we are focusing on a coarser distributional patterns hortal et al 2010 soberón 2010 otherwise this may decrease the chance to occupy cells with low suitability or do not occupy pixels with high suitability due to the colonization extinction process the total number of iterations of 1000 was set to guarantee that the species range size reaches stability which means that the species achieve an equilibrium with the environment de marco et al 2008 virtual species distributions varied from 8 1 104 to 365 104 km² with an average of 100 104 km² and median of 130 104 km² meaning that they are primarily broadly distributed virtual species smaller distributions 25 104 km² occurred in species with their centre of origin placed within uncommon climates such as the andes mountains fig s1 2 2 spatially unrestricted species distribution modelling ecological niche models were performed using the same six first principal components used to create virtual species distribution and 50 randomly sampled pixels within the virtual species distribution as presence records table s2 we used four algorithms maximum entropy mxs support vector machines svm generalized linear models glm and random forests rdf all four methods have been frequently used in literature merow et al 2014 we chose these four methods because they vary in terms of model complexity i e how flexible they are at establishing relationships between predictors and response variables jiménez valverde et al 2008 and their computational complexity garcía callejas and araújo 2015 the less complex algorithm is glm followed by mxs svm and rdf garcía callejas and araújo 2015 as glm rdf and svm use presences and pseudo absences data table s3 we randomly created for each species pseudo absences distributed throughout the study area we used a presence pseudo absence ratio of one mxs models were constructed using 10 000 background points default regularisation values 1 000 maximum iterations and linear and quadratic features we converted suitability maps into binary maps using the threshold of the receiver operating curve pearce and ferrier 2000 which is selected as the point of balance between commission and omission errors we run typical enm without spatial restrictions for all 40 species to compare with m sdms 2 3 spatially restricted species distribution modelling we compiled five and developed two m sdms methods splitting them into two categories a priori and a posteriori methods we used the same set of pseudo absences generated as described above across all modelling approaches for a species we did this so as to make performance metrics of enms and m sdms used in our study directly comparable a priori methods include spatial restrictions as variables into the species distribution modelling comprising three methods meanwhile the four a posteriori methods clip suitable with reachable area maps two of them estimate reachable areas by creating a buffer around species occurrences the remaining two methods calculate connectivity among patches of suitable areas in a framework borrowed from the landscape ecology theory turner 2005 table 1 1 latlong method xy a priori method it assumes that spatial structure can partially explain species distribution bahn and mcgill 2007 and that geographical coordinates can be added as variables to sdms royle et al 2012 two raster layers were created containing the latitude and longitude of pixels in decimal degrees respectively these layers were included with climate layers as covariates in the models 2 cumulative distance cml a priori method compiled and adapted from allouche et al 2008 it assumes that pixels closer to presences are likely included in species distributions a raster layer was created containing the sum of euclidian geographic distances from each pixel to all occurrences of a species obtained values were normalized to vary from zero to one this raster layer was included as a covariate in the models 3 kernel method ker a priori method also compiled and adapted from allouche et al 2008 this method similar to cml assumes that pixels located in areas with a higher density of occurrences are likely included in the actual species distribution a raster layer was created containing gaussian values based on the density of a species occurrences the standard deviation δ of the gaussian distribution was the largest nearest neighbour distance among pairs of occurrences of a species gaussian values were normalized to vary from zero to one this raster layer was included as a covariate in the models 4 occurrences based threshold restriction obr a posteriori method after an enm is performed and binarised with no spatial restriction the area of study is split into suitable and unsuitable patches which are sets of contiguous suitable or unsuitable pixels the method assumes that suitable patches overlapping occurrences s1 are likely a part of species distributions in contrast with suitable patches that do not intercept any occurrence s0 the edge edge distance from all s0 patches to the closest s1 patch was calculated and we reclassified as unsuitable from the model those s0 patches exceeding a species specific distance threshold we calculated this threshold t as the largest nearest neighbour distance among pairs of occurrences the same threshold used in the method ker whenever a suitable pixel is within an s0 patch distant from the closest s1 in greater than t the suitability of the pixel was reduced to zero we assumed that this simple threshold is a surrogate of the species specific dispersal ability 5 lower quantile lr a posteriori method this method is similar to the obr method except by the procedure to define a distance threshold to reclassify as unsuitable s0 patches which is the lower quartile of the distances between each s0 patch and the closest s1 patch whenever a suitable pixel is within an s0 patch i e not within this lower quartile the suitability of the pixel is reduced to zero this means that 75 of s0 patches were reclassified as unsuitable 6 minimum convex polygon mcp a posteriori method compiled and adapted from kremen et al 2008 this method excludes suitable pixels that are not encompassed by a minimum convex polygon with interior angles smaller than 180 enclosing all occurrences of a species as well as the obr method the mcp method uses species presences 7 buffered minimum convex polygon mcpb a posteriori method also compiled and adapted from kremen et al 2008 it is similar to the mcp except by the inclusion of a buffer zone surrounding minimum convex polygons the buffer width was based on the maximum distance of minimal pairwise distances between occurrences we have also used the distance of pixels to the nearest occurrence point as a constraint variable but due to the exceptionally bad performance of this method compared to others we have excluded it from our main analyses table s4 2 4 models comparison and validation we used the binary maps created from suitability patterns and contrasted m sdms to non spatially restricted enms by both omission and commission errors omission errors were calculated as the rate of false negatives and absences based on real distributions commission errors were calculated as the rate of false positives and presences in real distributions omission and commission errors were calculated for all species algorithms and models we calculated commission omission errors as the difference between those errors from an enm and an m sdm using the same modelling algorithm therefore whenever commission omission was positive we interpreted that the m sdm improved the modelling procedures by reducing problems with commission omission errors on the other hand negative commission omission indicates that the m sdm worsen problems with commission omission errors we tested the effects of different spatial restriction methods algorithms and interaction between them on omission errors and commission errors by running linear mixed effect models fixed effects were algorithms methods and interaction while random effects were the simulated species every single model was considered an experimental unit for modelling comparison we had 1 120 sampling units considering 40 species seven methods and four algorithms we used the wald test to evaluate if the estimated coefficients for each fixed effect variable were different from zero considering the sample variance r² was calculated as the marginal r squared that describes the proportion of variance explained only by fixed factors nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 models construction and data analysis were conducted in the r software v3 4 1 r development core team 2017 we used stats v3 4 1 dismo v1 1 4 hijmans et al 2017 randomforest v4 6 12 liaw and wiener 2002 and kernlab v 0 9 25 karatzoglou et al 2004 packages to construct glm mxs rdf and svm models respectively the dismo package was also used to create pseudo absences and models predictions enms were constructed using enmtml package de andrade et al 2020 available at https github com andrefaa enmtml linear mixed effect models were performed using the lme4 v1 1 17 package bates et al 2015 predicted species distribution with no spatial restrictions varied from 9 4 104 to 964 104 km² while predicted species distribution with spatial restrictions varied from 6 4 104 to 1 113 104 km² 3 results 3 1 overprediction across models among a priori methods in which spatial constraints were inserted as variables in the modelling process kernel had lower commission errors than enms for all algorithms confidence interval of δ commission does not surpass zero in fig 2 while latlong xy and cumulative cml had lower commission errors than enms for all algorithms but svm all a posteriori methods in which reachable and suitable areas were overlapped occurrence based threshold obr lower quartile lr minimum convex mcp and buffered minimum convex mpcb had lower commission errors than enms average reduction in commission errors caused by m sdms was higher when using glm and lower when using svm fig 3 3 2 underprediction across models among a priori methods omission errors with the latlong and cumulative methods were as high as for enms for all algorithms confidence interval of δ omission surpassed zero in fig 2 while kernel ker had as much omission errors as enms for all algorithms but svm in which omission errors were higher for a posteriori methods the occurrence based threshold lower quartile and buffered minimum convex had as much omission errors as enms for all algorithms while the minimum convex method had higher omission errors as enms for all algorithms these results indicate that occurrence based threshold lower quartile and buffered minimum convex a posteriori methods can reduce model overprediction with no increase in underprediction for all tested algorithms but the minimum convex another a posteriori method aggravates underprediction with all algorithms a priori methods when interacting with the svm algorithm either aggravate underprediction problems kernel or are ineffective reducing overprediction latlong and cumulative otherwise they work as well as a posteriori methods fig 3 we did not observe greater differences in δ omission among algorithms table 2 3 3 performance variation among algorithms models and species we have not observed major differences in terms of performance among algorithms fig s2 we found that interactions between algorithms and m sdm methods could affect both commission and omission errors table 2 when using the glm algorithm the buffered minimum convex method had a higher performance reducing overprediction without increasing omission errors followed by kernel and cumulative confidence intervals overlapping mean δ commissions fig 2 when using rdf and mxs all methods but minimum convex had similar performance fig 2 when using svm all the three methods that reduced commission without increasing omission errors occurrence based threshold lower quartile and buffered minimum convex had similar performance there is a high variation of both δ commission and omission among species fig 4 indicating that species specific geographic distributions may play an important role in determining those results a higher variance in δ commission was found with the glm algorithm fig 4 there were cases of increased commission errors for some species only for a priori m sdm methods 4 discussion the addition of spatial constraints in species distribution models emerges as a robust approach to deal with model overprediction overprediction is a common problem in climate based species suitability maps given that climatically suitable sites can be located in unreachable areas soberón and nakamura 2009 indeed model overprediction can potentially cause misleading interpretations on species potential distribution as well as erroneous population management actions based on those maps guisan et al 2013 the m sdm methods promise to reduce overprediction problems by including spatial restrictions reducing the prediction of unreachable areas while they do not require extensive knowledge on species specific dispersal abilities and details of their evolutionary history we interpreted that m sdm methods adequately reduce commission errors overprediction while not increasing omission errors underprediction in models otherwise its efficiency is highly dependent on the modelling algorithm being used our findings suggest that the m sdm methods can reduce commission errors when compared to non spatially restricted ecological niche models enms however some m sdm methods can also cause model underprediction in few cases indicating that some combinations of m sdm method and algorithm should be avoided such as the a priori method with the svm algorithm here we discuss the particularities in the performances of m sdm methods suggesting adequate combinations between enm algorithms and m sdm methods we separated methods into a priori and a posteriori depending on the moment spatial restrictions are inserted in models a priori methods incorporate spatial variables as predictors while fitting the model which affect suitability patterns and omission rates those model results are not a climatic suitability map because they also include the information on the spatial interpolation from the observed occurrences allouche et al 2008 their performance was shown to be dependent on the algorithm low model accuracy was observed when using the svm algorithm compared to others as a priori methods lead to changes in the suitability patterns predicted by enms they may allow the increase in omission errors when more variables are introduced in the models which was observed in kernel method with the svm algorithm the same logic could be applied for the lack of performance reducing overprediction observed for the latlong and cumulative methods with the svm algorithm a posteriori methods have the advantage of not interfering with the suitability modelling process since spatial constraints are inserted later but they all rely on some sort of dispersal threshold to determine reachable areas to be overlapped with suitability maps a posteriori methods reduced overprediction without incurring in higher omission errors except by the minimal convex polygon method a major factor causing variation in commission was the enm algorithm used complex algorithms such as mxs or svm are expected to produce predictions closer to the real distribution than simpler envelope algorithms as they can fit more subtle curves and therefore are capable of making less coarse predictions jiménez valverde et al 2008 jiménez valverde et al 2011 m sdm methods focus on reducing commission errors and bringing predictions closer to species distribution so it would theoretically have higher gains when used in combination with less complex enm algorithms disregarding the fact that all four algorithms had similar overall performance our results support that assumption with the less complex glm having the higher gains and just a few m sdm methods improving model performance when using the complex algorithm svm concerning omission errors the minimum convex method which is similar to the buffered minimum convex method exhibited a poor model performance increasing underprediction this a posteriori method simply consists of adding a mask a minimum convex polygon around occurrences clipping the predicted distribution we can explain this increase in underprediction because these masks may not cover all the virtual species distribution restricting predictions to smaller areas around occurrences what can potentially create underprediction in conditions where just a few occurrences are known thus should be avoided in these cases there is a fundamental difference between estimating a species environmental niche and its geographic distribution while estimating a species niche implies looking at the environmental suitability determined often by climate conditions estimating species geographic distribution implies the actual prediction of where species should occur which in turn can be jointly influenced by the environment biotic interactions and accessibility soberón and nakamura 2009 classic correlative models are usually niche models or enms in which the restriction of predictions to accessible areas is a mandatory step to approach the actual species distribution i e creating an sdm barve et al 2011 this step can be applied using different strategies such as estimating the species dispersal through evolutionary time or estimating species dispersal movement in the current time other possibilities include the use occurrences based kernel density coupled with suitability maps to decide where to place pseudo absences that can be later used in correlative models to estimate species distribution hengl et al 2009 or to combine with suitability to estimate niche overlap broennimann et al 2012 lastly we can use occurrence data to model spatial constraints what is the case of all m sdms compared in this research since occurrence data have information of where species have moved to soberón and nakamura 2009 we solely compared presence only methods targeting immediate needs for most tropical species for which often the only available data are occurrences from checklists and museums collen et al 2008 meyer et al 2015 otherwise there is an increase of study design using repeated samplings that allow estimation of species detectability opening a promising solution for modelling species distribution under an imperfect detection approach bled et al 2013 kéry et al 2010 rota et al 2011 under this approach we may move from the simplistic presence absence view to the more robust detection non detection view which may also help the understanding of model limitations and opportunities for improvement by accounting for imperfect detection and nonuniform sampling effort they can potentially provide an alternative solution to m sdms to address issues raised in this paper additionally very little is known about species movement patterns as well as other biological traits for tropical species collen et al 2008 when dispersal abilities data are available such as species specific maximum dispersal distance and capacity to cross different land types least cost pathways can be inferred using landscape connectivity metrics baranyi et al 2011 saura and pascual hortal 2007 vasudev et al 2015 improving the realism of these models by including scenarios of dispersal through evolutionary time therefore the methods we compare here are more appropriate for species in which detection non detection data are not reliable and spread through the distribution and dispersal abilities as well as their dispersal behaviour are not well known yet methodological evaluations based on virtual species are especially useful to deal with species distribution procedures due to its complexity merow et al 2014 and the need for a true distribution for comparison which is rarely possible with real data zurell et al 2010 nevertheless the opportunity carries its costs it is important that those virtual species retain the most important characteristics of real species at least those that may affect model results our virtual species approach is an important improvement in this theme because i it allows a dynamic species range construction retaining colonization extinction mechanisms that we assume to be important for real species ii the relationship between climatic conditions and species performance i e species have an optimal climatic condition and an exponential decrease in its suitability for conditions that depart from this value hirzel and le lay 2008 iii the way we modelled species dispersal which is a key factor for this study distance preferential directions landscape attributes and species traits will largely affect dispersal patterns nathan et al 2008 here we used a simple gaussian kernel approach to model dispersal since it retains the properties of a more general description of the dispersal process the existence of other more complex dispersal schemes may allow the production of more realistic patterns to describe a specific group of species or spatial relations e g ocean currents river drift differences in commission and omission between m sdms and enms varied among the 40 virtual species indicating that centre of origin and geographical range size can be important factors affecting models performance what has already been observed for enms mcpherson et al 2004 however few or no cases of increased overprediction and underprediction were observed among species supporting the use of m sdms as a tool to reduce model overprediction for species with various geographical range sizes and centre of origin the translation of our results to its applications in real modelling exercises needs some precautions the first limitation for all tested methods is the potential bias in real biological collections which could lead to misleading results hortal et al 2008 jarnevich et al 2015 reese et al 2005 virtual species occurrences were randomly sampled avoiding sampling bias problems in the results which may not be realistic to real species occurrences data boakes et al 2010 the only effective solution for this problem is through surveying areas with knowledge gaps on the local biodiversity and consequently contributing to the reduction of wallacean shortfalls bini et al 2006 a priori methods need more in depth inspections on the consequences for their interpretability and transferability model transferability across space and time is an important issue in current species distribution machinery qiao et al 2018 yates et al 2018 and may have consequences on model evaluation and projection in different geographical extents and different periods of times andrade et al 2019 regarding a posteriori methods it is important to assess their sensibility to changes in the component used to calculate the distance thresholds to define reachable areas which could be easily determined with knowledge on the species specific maximum dispersal ability in climatically unsuitable areas bateman et al 2013 methods such as the occurrence based threshold which uses occurrences pattern as a surrogate of maximum dispersal may be sensible to records distribution pattern or geographical or taxonomical error reese et al 2005 e g erroneous presences far from most records may derive a greater distance threshold additionally we projected models for the entire neotropical realm using the same data employed to create virtual species while restricting the projection and validation area can be a useful way to avoid overprediction barve et al 2011 we opted for using this large study area to be able to compare the m sdm methods with enms that completely disregard spatial restrictions otherwise we are also aware that we are not considering many issues such as 1 climate change in the past may be the cause of a previous connection among current suitable patches carnaval and moritz 2008 2 ability to cross the unsuitable matrix may vary among species whitmee and orme 2013 3 how the different m sdm methods deal with disjoint species distributions and 4 there are m sdm methods that we have not addressed in this study such as other distance metrics that could be included in sdms further studies could evaluate the performance of m sdm based on real species and the expert knowledge van zonneveld et al 2014 including if possible the existence of dispersal barriers during the evolutionary history of the species moura et al 2018 the importance of including spatial constraints in enms has been extensively explored in literature from the past decade with a variety of proposed methods allouche et al 2008 bahn and mcgill 2007 cardador et al 2014 de marco et al 2008 griffith et al 2006 holloway et al 2016 rodrigues and lima ribeiro 2018 and the methods proposed have been routinely used by ecologists and conservation biologists when modelling species distributions e g kremen et al 2008 calixto pérez et al 2018 still non spatially restricted enms are more commonly used than m sdms which could be caused by the lack of comparison among the various methods computational requirements or the high demand of species specific data from some methods here we compared methods that are 1 non computationally intense 2 easy to understand and apply and 3 feasible when only presences data are available and no dispersal ability data is known these characteristics are essential to make those spatial restriction methods friendly to scientists that are interested in building more realistic predicted distributions but have few resources time and data to completely understand species historical dispersal dynamics this is particularly important in the current scenario of global biodiversity in which little or nothing is known for the majority of the global species costello 2015 future research should be focused on finding out if simple methods such as the occurrence based methods used in this research perform as well as complex methods using species specific dispersal abilities and evolutionary history 5 conclusions our results indicate that m sdms except by the minimum convex method can be useful to reduce model overprediction compared to enms but a priori methods should be avoided in combination with complex algorithms such as svm furthermore we reinforce that model overprediction might have a great effect on studies that target major macroecological patterns e g species richness or beta diversity which in turn drive applied studies such as those regarding species conservation or climate change scenarios we advocate that researchers must not take the distinction between enm sdm lightly as commission errors might lead to erroneously defining priority areas for conservation or even misestimating the effect of climate change on species persistence therefore due to the cascade effect caused by misinterpreting species geographic distributions estimated by their environmental niches we want to encourage researchers to put the spatial restriction

24798,species distribution models can be affected by overprediction when dispersal movement is not incorporated into the modelling process we compared the efficiency of seven methods that take into account spatial constraints to reduce overprediction when using four algorithms for species distribution models by using a virtual ecologist approach we were able to measure the accuracy of each model in predicting actual species distributions we built 40 virtual species distributions within the neotropical realm then we randomly sampled 50 occurrences that were used in seven spatially restricted species distribution models hereafter called m sdms and a non spatially restricted ecological niche model enm we used four algorithms maximum entropy generalized linear models random forest and support vector machine m sdm methods were divided into a priori methods in which spatial restrictions were inserted with environmental variables in the modelling process and a posteriori methods in which reachable and suitable areas were overlapped m sdm efficiency was obtained by calculating the difference in commission and omission errors between m sdms and enms we used linear mixed effects models to test if differences in commission and omission errors varied among the m sdms and algorithms our results indicate that overall m sdms reduce overprediction with no increase in underprediction compared to enms with few exceptions such as a priori methods combined with the support vector machine algorithm there is a high variation in modelling performance among species but there were only a few cases in which overprediction or underprediction increased we only compared methods that do not require species dispersal data guaranteeing that they can be applied to less studied species we advocate that species distribution modellers should not ignore spatial constraints especially because they can be included in models at low costs but high benefits in terms of overprediction reduction keywords ecological niche modelling model overprediction spatial constraints species dispersal species distribution model virtual ecologist approach 1 introduction species geographic distributions were viewed by e h rapoport as chinese lantern shadows produced by different taxa on the continental screen rapoport 1982 the early investigation of factors affecting species distribution built the foundations for several disciplines such as biogeography macroecology and conservation biology guisan et al 2013 nowadays it is accepted that species distributions result from the intermingling of several factors such as phylogenetic constraints lawton 1993 historical events barve et al 2011 ecological adaptations calosi et al 2008 and biotic interactions wisz et al 2013 among others three main components define the actual area of species distributions a grinellian niche a that encompasses abiotic conditions in which a species is able to exist an eltonian niche b encompassing biotic interactions and a third component with locations reachable by the species m soberón and peterson 2005 soberón 2007 barve et al 2011 predicting boundaries of species distributions requires the understanding of these components and the way they interact to generate geographic ranges species distribution models were built to assist these predictions and have been commonly applied in ecological studies since the late 1990s and show no sign of losing popularity lobo et al 2010 it is common to come across two terms for similar but not identical frameworks to predict environmental distributions of species ecological niche models enms and species distribution models sdms enms predict ecological niche limits to species occurrence while sdms predict actual species geographical distributions peterson and soberón 2012 in practical terms enms commonly use scenopoetic variables such as climate variables and species occurrences to indicate environmentally suitable sites in which the species presence is unknown the component a of species distribution sdms include additional steps such as dispersal constraints restrictions in model calibration or suspected absences to build closer predictions to the actual distribution including the movement component m in sdms can be necessary because in natural conditions species seldom occur in all environmentally suitable areas due to historical e g geographical barriers and ecological factors limiting accessibility of areas e g intrinsic dispersal limitations and distribution of suitable areas in the geographical space guisan and theurillat 2000 svenning and skov 2004 araújo pearson and rahbek 2005 therefore enms often predict larger areas than sdms such as environmentally suitable areas never colonised before due to dispersal constraints an approach to develop sdms is to incorporate the accessible area component m into the modelling procedures by taking into account species dispersal history and spatial barriers allouche et al 2008 barve et al 2011 cooper and soberón 2018 there are three common strategies to include the component m in species distribution models 1 delimiting accessible areas 2 including dispersal constraints into models and 3 simulating dispersal through evolutionary time the first option is to restrict model calibration region by hypothesizing a species accessible area e g using expert range maps or biogeographical regions barve et al 2011 broennimann et al 2012 cooper and soberón 2018 holloway et al 2016 kremen et al 2008 accessible areas are regions that can be reached through dispersal within a relevant timeframe depending on the existence of dispersal barriers tingley monahan beissinger and moritz 2009 araújo and rozenfeld 2013 species specific abilities to cross them svenning and skov 2004 vasudev et al 2015 and species evolutionary age weber et al 2014 a common alternative to estimating accessible areas is the use of biotic regions where species have been found holt et al 2013 olson et al 2001 spalding et al 2007 the existence of numerous classifications for biotic regions e g ecoregions or biomes and the lack of correspondence between biotic regions boundaries and species dispersal ability are disadvantages of this method additionally accessibility can be estimated by using dispersal models to create accessibility maps to be overlapped with environmental suitability maps barve et al 2011 holloway et al 2016 it is also possible to include accessibility data after generating environmental suitability maps kremen et al 2008 hereafter a posteriori methods this may function as restriction fields to possible colonization areas sorting out areas inaccessible for species and thus not pertaining to the set of possible distribution areas the second strategy is to incorporate spatial information into the fitting process of enms hereafter a priori methods or to overlap them with suitability maps created by enms hereafter a posteriori methods since species distributions are autocorrelated phenomena spatial predictors can be derived from autoregressive models dormann et al 2007 or from occurrence data itself as a surrogate of accessibility because occurrences of native species are found only in places where they were able to access allouche et al 2008 bahn and mcgill 2007 cardador et al 2014 de marco et al 2008 rodrigues and lima ribeiro 2018 spatial filters distance constraint layers or any type of vector containing spatial information can be added in ecological analyses as model predictors increasing their predictive power by considering spatial autocorrelation de marco et al 2008 griffith et al 2006 a similar advantage could be argued for the inclusion of spatial predictors in sdms allouche et al 2008 these methods do not require previous knowledge on species specific dispersal abilities even though they are based on occurrence data which intrinsically carries information on species evolutionary dispersal mechanisms the third strategy is to generate dynamic movement models to simulate the dispersal capacity of the species through evolutionary time barve et al 2011 brotons et al 2012 cabral and schurr 2010 engler and guisan 2009 holloway et al 2016 the advantage of this approach is considering dynamic environmental changes that must have occurred during range expansion and shifts resulting in more realistic predictions barve et al 2011 cardador et al 2014 however this requires datasets through time hardly available for the majority of the global biodiversity brotons et al 2012 franklin 2010 and intensive computational tools barve et al 2011 different from some previous exercises comparing methods for the incorporation of movement in species distribution models e g barve et al 2011 holloway et al 2016 here we focused on methods that only require data on species presence first and second approaches above for most tropical species very limited biological data are available collen et al 2008 meyer et al 2015 emphasising the urgency in testing the accuracy of models with low data requirements we investigated the effectiveness of seven methods for incorporating spatial constraints into sdms hereafter we call those models m sdms as they are designed to taking account of the accessible area the m movement component of the soberón and peterson 2005 conceptual model for species distributions to investigate the performance of the seven methods five obtained from literature and two new proposals we used a virtual ecologist approach creating 40 virtual species distributions within the neotropical realm climatic data fig 1 we tested the hypothesis that m sdms reduce overprediction compared to non spatially restricted enms all seven methods are feasible with the absence of species specific dispersal data or temporal datasets and can be used for estimating distributions of real species we chose methods with those characteristics because occurrence data is commonly available for most of the world s species the methods use two different approaches 1 a priori methods include distance constraints as covariates with climate variables in the modelling procedure and 2 a posteriori methods overlap environmental suitability maps with accessible areas 2 material and methods 2 1 virtual species to evaluate the effect of the different m sdms approaches we created 40 virtual species distributions within the neotropical realm using a cellular automata model fig s1 we used the protocol developed by de marco et al 2008 with further advances from de marco and nóbrega 2018 this approach comprises a spatially explicit colonization extinction model based on the following steps 1 determination of the fundamental niche of a species based on optimal and tolerance values 2 projection of the fundamental niche into the geographic space to create species suitability and 3 simulation of species distributions based on suitability using a spatially explicit automata cellular model we created the fundamental niches of species from 19 bioclimatic variables from the neotropical realm derived from monthly temperature and rain data available at worldclim v 2 0 http www worldclim org in a resolution of 5 arc minutes c 9 km we used a principal components analysis pca selecting the six first principal components that explained c 95 of the data variability table s1 we used principal components instead of raw climatic variables to reduce the dimensionality and collinearity when creating virtual species distributions de marco and nóbrega 2018 the optimum niche conditions for a virtual species was defined as the climate in a randomly selected seed pixel obtained from its principal components scores virtual species persistence probability in a pixel was conceived as a multivariate gaussian distribution with means equal to the optimum climate conditions and standard deviation equal to 30 of the total standard deviation of the environmental variables this means that all virtual species were equally generalists we rescaled the value of the multivariate gaussian probability distribution function to vary from zero to one by dividing each value by its maximum de marco and nóbrega 2018 finally we projected the persistence probability onto the geographic space being equal to one in pixels with optimum environmental conditions and towards zero as environmental conditions moved away from the optimum a cellular automata model was used to simulate the expansion of virtual species distributions from their seed pixel persistent populations in a pixel produced three propagules that have the potential to colonise adjacent cells that are up to five spaces from the origin following a gaussian distribution the distance of dispersion per iteration from 1 to 5 pixels and the direction of the movement were determined following a uniform probability distribution with equal probability in all eight possible directions from a pixel propagules could colonise or be extinct in a pixel following a boolean function of persistence probability derived from simulated ideal environmental conditions for that species we considered that virtual species do not occupy pixels with persistence probability lower than 0 25 and that they always occupy pixels with persistence probability higher than 0 75 we are aware that this may seem arbitrary at first but we expect a higher range cohesion as we are focusing on a coarser distributional patterns hortal et al 2010 soberón 2010 otherwise this may decrease the chance to occupy cells with low suitability or do not occupy pixels with high suitability due to the colonization extinction process the total number of iterations of 1000 was set to guarantee that the species range size reaches stability which means that the species achieve an equilibrium with the environment de marco et al 2008 virtual species distributions varied from 8 1 104 to 365 104 km² with an average of 100 104 km² and median of 130 104 km² meaning that they are primarily broadly distributed virtual species smaller distributions 25 104 km² occurred in species with their centre of origin placed within uncommon climates such as the andes mountains fig s1 2 2 spatially unrestricted species distribution modelling ecological niche models were performed using the same six first principal components used to create virtual species distribution and 50 randomly sampled pixels within the virtual species distribution as presence records table s2 we used four algorithms maximum entropy mxs support vector machines svm generalized linear models glm and random forests rdf all four methods have been frequently used in literature merow et al 2014 we chose these four methods because they vary in terms of model complexity i e how flexible they are at establishing relationships between predictors and response variables jiménez valverde et al 2008 and their computational complexity garcía callejas and araújo 2015 the less complex algorithm is glm followed by mxs svm and rdf garcía callejas and araújo 2015 as glm rdf and svm use presences and pseudo absences data table s3 we randomly created for each species pseudo absences distributed throughout the study area we used a presence pseudo absence ratio of one mxs models were constructed using 10 000 background points default regularisation values 1 000 maximum iterations and linear and quadratic features we converted suitability maps into binary maps using the threshold of the receiver operating curve pearce and ferrier 2000 which is selected as the point of balance between commission and omission errors we run typical enm without spatial restrictions for all 40 species to compare with m sdms 2 3 spatially restricted species distribution modelling we compiled five and developed two m sdms methods splitting them into two categories a priori and a posteriori methods we used the same set of pseudo absences generated as described above across all modelling approaches for a species we did this so as to make performance metrics of enms and m sdms used in our study directly comparable a priori methods include spatial restrictions as variables into the species distribution modelling comprising three methods meanwhile the four a posteriori methods clip suitable with reachable area maps two of them estimate reachable areas by creating a buffer around species occurrences the remaining two methods calculate connectivity among patches of suitable areas in a framework borrowed from the landscape ecology theory turner 2005 table 1 1 latlong method xy a priori method it assumes that spatial structure can partially explain species distribution bahn and mcgill 2007 and that geographical coordinates can be added as variables to sdms royle et al 2012 two raster layers were created containing the latitude and longitude of pixels in decimal degrees respectively these layers were included with climate layers as covariates in the models 2 cumulative distance cml a priori method compiled and adapted from allouche et al 2008 it assumes that pixels closer to presences are likely included in species distributions a raster layer was created containing the sum of euclidian geographic distances from each pixel to all occurrences of a species obtained values were normalized to vary from zero to one this raster layer was included as a covariate in the models 3 kernel method ker a priori method also compiled and adapted from allouche et al 2008 this method similar to cml assumes that pixels located in areas with a higher density of occurrences are likely included in the actual species distribution a raster layer was created containing gaussian values based on the density of a species occurrences the standard deviation δ of the gaussian distribution was the largest nearest neighbour distance among pairs of occurrences of a species gaussian values were normalized to vary from zero to one this raster layer was included as a covariate in the models 4 occurrences based threshold restriction obr a posteriori method after an enm is performed and binarised with no spatial restriction the area of study is split into suitable and unsuitable patches which are sets of contiguous suitable or unsuitable pixels the method assumes that suitable patches overlapping occurrences s1 are likely a part of species distributions in contrast with suitable patches that do not intercept any occurrence s0 the edge edge distance from all s0 patches to the closest s1 patch was calculated and we reclassified as unsuitable from the model those s0 patches exceeding a species specific distance threshold we calculated this threshold t as the largest nearest neighbour distance among pairs of occurrences the same threshold used in the method ker whenever a suitable pixel is within an s0 patch distant from the closest s1 in greater than t the suitability of the pixel was reduced to zero we assumed that this simple threshold is a surrogate of the species specific dispersal ability 5 lower quantile lr a posteriori method this method is similar to the obr method except by the procedure to define a distance threshold to reclassify as unsuitable s0 patches which is the lower quartile of the distances between each s0 patch and the closest s1 patch whenever a suitable pixel is within an s0 patch i e not within this lower quartile the suitability of the pixel is reduced to zero this means that 75 of s0 patches were reclassified as unsuitable 6 minimum convex polygon mcp a posteriori method compiled and adapted from kremen et al 2008 this method excludes suitable pixels that are not encompassed by a minimum convex polygon with interior angles smaller than 180 enclosing all occurrences of a species as well as the obr method the mcp method uses species presences 7 buffered minimum convex polygon mcpb a posteriori method also compiled and adapted from kremen et al 2008 it is similar to the mcp except by the inclusion of a buffer zone surrounding minimum convex polygons the buffer width was based on the maximum distance of minimal pairwise distances between occurrences we have also used the distance of pixels to the nearest occurrence point as a constraint variable but due to the exceptionally bad performance of this method compared to others we have excluded it from our main analyses table s4 2 4 models comparison and validation we used the binary maps created from suitability patterns and contrasted m sdms to non spatially restricted enms by both omission and commission errors omission errors were calculated as the rate of false negatives and absences based on real distributions commission errors were calculated as the rate of false positives and presences in real distributions omission and commission errors were calculated for all species algorithms and models we calculated commission omission errors as the difference between those errors from an enm and an m sdm using the same modelling algorithm therefore whenever commission omission was positive we interpreted that the m sdm improved the modelling procedures by reducing problems with commission omission errors on the other hand negative commission omission indicates that the m sdm worsen problems with commission omission errors we tested the effects of different spatial restriction methods algorithms and interaction between them on omission errors and commission errors by running linear mixed effect models fixed effects were algorithms methods and interaction while random effects were the simulated species every single model was considered an experimental unit for modelling comparison we had 1 120 sampling units considering 40 species seven methods and four algorithms we used the wald test to evaluate if the estimated coefficients for each fixed effect variable were different from zero considering the sample variance r² was calculated as the marginal r squared that describes the proportion of variance explained only by fixed factors nakagawa and schielzeth 2013 models construction and data analysis were conducted in the r software v3 4 1 r development core team 2017 we used stats v3 4 1 dismo v1 1 4 hijmans et al 2017 randomforest v4 6 12 liaw and wiener 2002 and kernlab v 0 9 25 karatzoglou et al 2004 packages to construct glm mxs rdf and svm models respectively the dismo package was also used to create pseudo absences and models predictions enms were constructed using enmtml package de andrade et al 2020 available at https github com andrefaa enmtml linear mixed effect models were performed using the lme4 v1 1 17 package bates et al 2015 predicted species distribution with no spatial restrictions varied from 9 4 104 to 964 104 km² while predicted species distribution with spatial restrictions varied from 6 4 104 to 1 113 104 km² 3 results 3 1 overprediction across models among a priori methods in which spatial constraints were inserted as variables in the modelling process kernel had lower commission errors than enms for all algorithms confidence interval of δ commission does not surpass zero in fig 2 while latlong xy and cumulative cml had lower commission errors than enms for all algorithms but svm all a posteriori methods in which reachable and suitable areas were overlapped occurrence based threshold obr lower quartile lr minimum convex mcp and buffered minimum convex mpcb had lower commission errors than enms average reduction in commission errors caused by m sdms was higher when using glm and lower when using svm fig 3 3 2 underprediction across models among a priori methods omission errors with the latlong and cumulative methods were as high as for enms for all algorithms confidence interval of δ omission surpassed zero in fig 2 while kernel ker had as much omission errors as enms for all algorithms but svm in which omission errors were higher for a posteriori methods the occurrence based threshold lower quartile and buffered minimum convex had as much omission errors as enms for all algorithms while the minimum convex method had higher omission errors as enms for all algorithms these results indicate that occurrence based threshold lower quartile and buffered minimum convex a posteriori methods can reduce model overprediction with no increase in underprediction for all tested algorithms but the minimum convex another a posteriori method aggravates underprediction with all algorithms a priori methods when interacting with the svm algorithm either aggravate underprediction problems kernel or are ineffective reducing overprediction latlong and cumulative otherwise they work as well as a posteriori methods fig 3 we did not observe greater differences in δ omission among algorithms table 2 3 3 performance variation among algorithms models and species we have not observed major differences in terms of performance among algorithms fig s2 we found that interactions between algorithms and m sdm methods could affect both commission and omission errors table 2 when using the glm algorithm the buffered minimum convex method had a higher performance reducing overprediction without increasing omission errors followed by kernel and cumulative confidence intervals overlapping mean δ commissions fig 2 when using rdf and mxs all methods but minimum convex had similar performance fig 2 when using svm all the three methods that reduced commission without increasing omission errors occurrence based threshold lower quartile and buffered minimum convex had similar performance there is a high variation of both δ commission and omission among species fig 4 indicating that species specific geographic distributions may play an important role in determining those results a higher variance in δ commission was found with the glm algorithm fig 4 there were cases of increased commission errors for some species only for a priori m sdm methods 4 discussion the addition of spatial constraints in species distribution models emerges as a robust approach to deal with model overprediction overprediction is a common problem in climate based species suitability maps given that climatically suitable sites can be located in unreachable areas soberón and nakamura 2009 indeed model overprediction can potentially cause misleading interpretations on species potential distribution as well as erroneous population management actions based on those maps guisan et al 2013 the m sdm methods promise to reduce overprediction problems by including spatial restrictions reducing the prediction of unreachable areas while they do not require extensive knowledge on species specific dispersal abilities and details of their evolutionary history we interpreted that m sdm methods adequately reduce commission errors overprediction while not increasing omission errors underprediction in models otherwise its efficiency is highly dependent on the modelling algorithm being used our findings suggest that the m sdm methods can reduce commission errors when compared to non spatially restricted ecological niche models enms however some m sdm methods can also cause model underprediction in few cases indicating that some combinations of m sdm method and algorithm should be avoided such as the a priori method with the svm algorithm here we discuss the particularities in the performances of m sdm methods suggesting adequate combinations between enm algorithms and m sdm methods we separated methods into a priori and a posteriori depending on the moment spatial restrictions are inserted in models a priori methods incorporate spatial variables as predictors while fitting the model which affect suitability patterns and omission rates those model results are not a climatic suitability map because they also include the information on the spatial interpolation from the observed occurrences allouche et al 2008 their performance was shown to be dependent on the algorithm low model accuracy was observed when using the svm algorithm compared to others as a priori methods lead to changes in the suitability patterns predicted by enms they may allow the increase in omission errors when more variables are introduced in the models which was observed in kernel method with the svm algorithm the same logic could be applied for the lack of performance reducing overprediction observed for the latlong and cumulative methods with the svm algorithm a posteriori methods have the advantage of not interfering with the suitability modelling process since spatial constraints are inserted later but they all rely on some sort of dispersal threshold to determine reachable areas to be overlapped with suitability maps a posteriori methods reduced overprediction without incurring in higher omission errors except by the minimal convex polygon method a major factor causing variation in commission was the enm algorithm used complex algorithms such as mxs or svm are expected to produce predictions closer to the real distribution than simpler envelope algorithms as they can fit more subtle curves and therefore are capable of making less coarse predictions jiménez valverde et al 2008 jiménez valverde et al 2011 m sdm methods focus on reducing commission errors and bringing predictions closer to species distribution so it would theoretically have higher gains when used in combination with less complex enm algorithms disregarding the fact that all four algorithms had similar overall performance our results support that assumption with the less complex glm having the higher gains and just a few m sdm methods improving model performance when using the complex algorithm svm concerning omission errors the minimum convex method which is similar to the buffered minimum convex method exhibited a poor model performance increasing underprediction this a posteriori method simply consists of adding a mask a minimum convex polygon around occurrences clipping the predicted distribution we can explain this increase in underprediction because these masks may not cover all the virtual species distribution restricting predictions to smaller areas around occurrences what can potentially create underprediction in conditions where just a few occurrences are known thus should be avoided in these cases there is a fundamental difference between estimating a species environmental niche and its geographic distribution while estimating a species niche implies looking at the environmental suitability determined often by climate conditions estimating species geographic distribution implies the actual prediction of where species should occur which in turn can be jointly influenced by the environment biotic interactions and accessibility soberón and nakamura 2009 classic correlative models are usually niche models or enms in which the restriction of predictions to accessible areas is a mandatory step to approach the actual species distribution i e creating an sdm barve et al 2011 this step can be applied using different strategies such as estimating the species dispersal through evolutionary time or estimating species dispersal movement in the current time other possibilities include the use occurrences based kernel density coupled with suitability maps to decide where to place pseudo absences that can be later used in correlative models to estimate species distribution hengl et al 2009 or to combine with suitability to estimate niche overlap broennimann et al 2012 lastly we can use occurrence data to model spatial constraints what is the case of all m sdms compared in this research since occurrence data have information of where species have moved to soberón and nakamura 2009 we solely compared presence only methods targeting immediate needs for most tropical species for which often the only available data are occurrences from checklists and museums collen et al 2008 meyer et al 2015 otherwise there is an increase of study design using repeated samplings that allow estimation of species detectability opening a promising solution for modelling species distribution under an imperfect detection approach bled et al 2013 kéry et al 2010 rota et al 2011 under this approach we may move from the simplistic presence absence view to the more robust detection non detection view which may also help the understanding of model limitations and opportunities for improvement by accounting for imperfect detection and nonuniform sampling effort they can potentially provide an alternative solution to m sdms to address issues raised in this paper additionally very little is known about species movement patterns as well as other biological traits for tropical species collen et al 2008 when dispersal abilities data are available such as species specific maximum dispersal distance and capacity to cross different land types least cost pathways can be inferred using landscape connectivity metrics baranyi et al 2011 saura and pascual hortal 2007 vasudev et al 2015 improving the realism of these models by including scenarios of dispersal through evolutionary time therefore the methods we compare here are more appropriate for species in which detection non detection data are not reliable and spread through the distribution and dispersal abilities as well as their dispersal behaviour are not well known yet methodological evaluations based on virtual species are especially useful to deal with species distribution procedures due to its complexity merow et al 2014 and the need for a true distribution for comparison which is rarely possible with real data zurell et al 2010 nevertheless the opportunity carries its costs it is important that those virtual species retain the most important characteristics of real species at least those that may affect model results our virtual species approach is an important improvement in this theme because i it allows a dynamic species range construction retaining colonization extinction mechanisms that we assume to be important for real species ii the relationship between climatic conditions and species performance i e species have an optimal climatic condition and an exponential decrease in its suitability for conditions that depart from this value hirzel and le lay 2008 iii the way we modelled species dispersal which is a key factor for this study distance preferential directions landscape attributes and species traits will largely affect dispersal patterns nathan et al 2008 here we used a simple gaussian kernel approach to model dispersal since it retains the properties of a more general description of the dispersal process the existence of other more complex dispersal schemes may allow the production of more realistic patterns to describe a specific group of species or spatial relations e g ocean currents river drift differences in commission and omission between m sdms and enms varied among the 40 virtual species indicating that centre of origin and geographical range size can be important factors affecting models performance what has already been observed for enms mcpherson et al 2004 however few or no cases of increased overprediction and underprediction were observed among species supporting the use of m sdms as a tool to reduce model overprediction for species with various geographical range sizes and centre of origin the translation of our results to its applications in real modelling exercises needs some precautions the first limitation for all tested methods is the potential bias in real biological collections which could lead to misleading results hortal et al 2008 jarnevich et al 2015 reese et al 2005 virtual species occurrences were randomly sampled avoiding sampling bias problems in the results which may not be realistic to real species occurrences data boakes et al 2010 the only effective solution for this problem is through surveying areas with knowledge gaps on the local biodiversity and consequently contributing to the reduction of wallacean shortfalls bini et al 2006 a priori methods need more in depth inspections on the consequences for their interpretability and transferability model transferability across space and time is an important issue in current species distribution machinery qiao et al 2018 yates et al 2018 and may have consequences on model evaluation and projection in different geographical extents and different periods of times andrade et al 2019 regarding a posteriori methods it is important to assess their sensibility to changes in the component used to calculate the distance thresholds to define reachable areas which could be easily determined with knowledge on the species specific maximum dispersal ability in climatically unsuitable areas bateman et al 2013 methods such as the occurrence based threshold which uses occurrences pattern as a surrogate of maximum dispersal may be sensible to records distribution pattern or geographical or taxonomical error reese et al 2005 e g erroneous presences far from most records may derive a greater distance threshold additionally we projected models for the entire neotropical realm using the same data employed to create virtual species while restricting the projection and validation area can be a useful way to avoid overprediction barve et al 2011 we opted for using this large study area to be able to compare the m sdm methods with enms that completely disregard spatial restrictions otherwise we are also aware that we are not considering many issues such as 1 climate change in the past may be the cause of a previous connection among current suitable patches carnaval and moritz 2008 2 ability to cross the unsuitable matrix may vary among species whitmee and orme 2013 3 how the different m sdm methods deal with disjoint species distributions and 4 there are m sdm methods that we have not addressed in this study such as other distance metrics that could be included in sdms further studies could evaluate the performance of m sdm based on real species and the expert knowledge van zonneveld et al 2014 including if possible the existence of dispersal barriers during the evolutionary history of the species moura et al 2018 the importance of including spatial constraints in enms has been extensively explored in literature from the past decade with a variety of proposed methods allouche et al 2008 bahn and mcgill 2007 cardador et al 2014 de marco et al 2008 griffith et al 2006 holloway et al 2016 rodrigues and lima ribeiro 2018 and the methods proposed have been routinely used by ecologists and conservation biologists when modelling species distributions e g kremen et al 2008 calixto pérez et al 2018 still non spatially restricted enms are more commonly used than m sdms which could be caused by the lack of comparison among the various methods computational requirements or the high demand of species specific data from some methods here we compared methods that are 1 non computationally intense 2 easy to understand and apply and 3 feasible when only presences data are available and no dispersal ability data is known these characteristics are essential to make those spatial restriction methods friendly to scientists that are interested in building more realistic predicted distributions but have few resources time and data to completely understand species historical dispersal dynamics this is particularly important in the current scenario of global biodiversity in which little or nothing is known for the majority of the global species costello 2015 future research should be focused on finding out if simple methods such as the occurrence based methods used in this research perform as well as complex methods using species specific dispersal abilities and evolutionary history 5 conclusions our results indicate that m sdms except by the minimum convex method can be useful to reduce model overprediction compared to enms but a priori methods should be avoided in combination with complex algorithms such as svm furthermore we reinforce that model overprediction might have a great effect on studies that target major macroecological patterns e g species richness or beta diversity which in turn drive applied studies such as those regarding species conservation or climate change scenarios we advocate that researchers must not take the distinction between enm sdm lightly as commission errors might lead to erroneously defining priority areas for conservation or even misestimating the effect of climate change on species persistence therefore due to the cascade effect caused by misinterpreting species geographic distributions estimated by their environmental niches we want to encourage researchers to put the spatial restriction

24799,to understand the biological process in an aquaculture dominant coastal system and to provide a tool for further aquaculture management an ecosystem model has been implemented to study the aquaculture environmental interaction and the carrying capacity for sanggou bay the model coupled the pelagic system kelp growth dynamics oyster energetics and population dynamics with hourly hydrodynamic and water quality data the study area was divided into four boxes according to similarities in the hydrological environment and aquaculture layout scenario simulations were conducted with different combinations of oyster and kelp seeding densities to examine the environmental impacts and production under different aquaculture layouts results showed that the model could capture the main characteristics of observed environmental variables and culture organism growth increased seeding density of both oysters and kelp generally leads to increased production with diminished individual growth kelp aquaculture plays a leading role in the nutrient cycle in the bay acting as a large reception tank during the rapid growth period the model results indicate that there is still potential to increase production for both oyster and kelp in sanggou bay the current aquaculture practice seems to have the right balance of carrying capacity management efforts and other costs under the existing production procedures the ecosystem model is a promising tool for further study with sustained observation effort and better boundary conditions keywords sanggou bay bivalve seaweed integrated aquaculture ecosystem model individual growth model carrying capacity estimation 1 introduction aquaculture has contributed up to 46 8 of the world total seafood supplement in 2016 of which china had produced 49 2 mt of cultured animals fish crustaceans mollusks and 14 5 mt of cultured aquatic plants this is accounting for about 61 5 and 48 0 of the world total production respectively

and a thriving commercial scale imta of bivalves currently pacific oyster crassostrea gigas and seaweed kelp saccharina japonica has been operated since the mid 1980s in sanggou bay china the bay has become a demonstration site for domestic and global research projects related to carrying capacity estimation and environmental impact assessment sanggou bay fig 1 is a shallow semi enclosed bay located at the east end of the shandong peninsula 37 01 09 n 122 24 35 e the bay s total area is about 144 km2 with the topography deepening from the central coast to outside and the average depth of

and cedric bacher 2001 have implemented a finite element circulation model to study the current modification by the culture structures for bivalves and seaweed in sanggou bay which brought in the consideration of local hydrodynamics to the problem of carrying capacity the simulation concluded a 41 decrease in the water exchange due to the presence of the aquaculture facilities which may lead to an overestimation of particle renewal time and as a result thus overestimating the carrying capacity shi et al 2011 have developed a three dimensional physical biological coupled model for sanggou

carnivores and benthic detritivores in waihinau bay and pelorus sound new zealand in their study hydrodynamic computed boundary volume fluxes drive the model defined physiological processes these numerical models above parameterized the interactions between cultured organisms and the ecosystem components and predicting individual growth and population state of targeted biological groups as well as the significantly correlated environmental variables ecosystem models often have specific regional characteristics like the natural environment the ecosystem compositions the aquaculture method and the bio physiology of the cultured organisms a general frameworks should be modified with detailed localization calibration and validation for use in solving specific problems the purpose of this study is to establish an ecosystem model to examine the interaction between the integrated aquaculture of bivalve and seaweed and the local environment in sanggou bay the model can be a tool

of the model is shown in fig 2 the ecosystem model is deterministic with no random processes considered it was simulated based on the box model concept with the identical structure in each box the environmental terms including dissolved inorganic nitrogen din phytoplankton and pelagic organic matter particle organic carbon poc are assumed to be uniformly mixed in each box and properties can be exchanged with adjacent boxes and the outer sea a hydrodynamic model was incorporated to compute the water volume exchange the exchange of a given box at each time step is determined by the inflow and outflow volume as δex δ v in e x in δ v out e x out v where δv in and δv out are the inflow and outflow at each boundary exin and exout are the concentration from inflow box and the target box respectively the exchange at each boundary is then summed up and divided by the target box volume v to obtain the concentration variation the state variables and differential equations describing the aquaculture system are listed in table 1 the biological processes and their definitions are listed in table 2 the parameters and their sources are listed in table 3 the detailed explanation can be found from referred studies zhang et al 2016 cai et al 2018 ren et al 2008 2012 an arrhenius relationship is used to describe the impact of the water temperature on the growth and respiration of phytoplankton as the physiological rates increase exponentially with rising temperature until a maximum and then decrease with further temperature increase ren et al 2012 the growth of phytoplankton is described by two state variables the phytoplankton carbon cp and nitrogen np the uptake of carbon u cp and nitrogen u np is internally connected by the n quota n c ratio to prevent the unrealistic absorption of carbon or nitrogen ren et al 2012 the uptake of carbon is limited by temperature irradiance and the n quota and the uptake of nitrogen follows the michaelis menten equation caperon and meyer 1972 which is a well known model to describe the rate of enzymatic reactions the biomass loss of phytoplankton consists of three processes their own respiration oyster grazing u bp and natural sinking m p the detailed parameterization of these biological processes is listed in table 2 the detritus in the model is described with the state variable particle organic carbon poc poc serves as food u bo for cultured oyster in the model meantime the feces om of oyster is also the source of the poc the sedimentation of poc and the exchange expoc between boundaries also change the concentrations dissolved inorganic nitrogen din is the nutrient flux tracking the interaction among trophic groups within the system excretion of oysters oexcr is the biological source of din while kelp u nk and phytoplankton u np absorb din from the system as the ecosystem is dominated by kelp aquaculture the din exchange with the outer sea is crucial for the nutrient supplement the individual based model applied in this study for oyster follows ren et al 2008 the three state variables to describe the energetics of the oyster are reserves e reproduction reserves e r and biovolume v the reserves are replenished with assimilated energy pa deducting the metabolic expenditure pc food availability and temperature are the major factors that determine oyster growth the temperature limitation of the oyster is formulated as an arrhenius relationship that affects most of the physiological processes the energy uptake follows a type ii functional response to food density which assumes a deaccelerated rate with food density holling c s 1959 described as f f f f h where f is the food concentration and f h is the half saturation coefficient for food uptake by oysters the energy acquired is then distributed according to the κ rule kooijman 2010 a fixed fraction of κ is utilized in body maintenance pm and growth which lead to a increase in biovolume and the remaining 1 κ fraction is allocated to reproduction detailed equations and definitions of the state variables and biological processes can be found in table 1 and table 2 the biological function of the oyster is to graze phytoplankton and particle organic matter from the surrounding water and to excrete nitrogen and feces into the system the population dynamics of oyster n is determined by culture harvest δh and natural mortality δr when harvested the oyster is removed from the system the natural mortality will lead to a continuous biomass loss during the simulation the growth of kelp is simulated with an individual growth model from zhang et al 2016 and cai et al 2018 three state variables are used to describe kelp growth the individual kelp biomass b kelp length l and the tissue nitrogen content nint the individual kelp biomass variation is defined as growth minus respiration and erosion growth of kelp is defined as a maximum growth rate μmax multiplied by a limiting factors from 0 1 due to water temperature light intensity and nutrients concentration table 2 the temperature limitation f t is an exponential function to produce a partial normal distribution according to the optimum temperature for kelp growth radach et al 1993 for simplicity only the nitrogen limitation f n is considered cai et al 2018 and is calculated by the michaelis menten equation the light limitation f i is defined according to steele 1962 with the optimum light intensity i opt the kelp respiration rate and erosion rate limited by temperature are parameterized with a similar exponential form table 2 the uptake of external din by kelp φ also follows a michaelis menten function based on the tissue nitrogen content the population dynamics of kelp a is the same as the oyster currently no stochastic processes disease and disaster are considered as we assume a thorough vertical mixing in the bay the benthic processes are not considered in the model of this study 2 2 study area and hydrodynamics the model is applied to sanggou bay and the domain is separated into four boxes according to hydrodynamic and aquaculture layout similarities as shown in fig 1 the volumes for box 1 to 4 are 0 367 km3 0 239 km3 0 504 km3 and 0 352 km3 and the average depths for each box are 6 3 m 7 3 m 8 0 m and 8 1 m respectively the aquaculture in sanggou bay mainly takes place in box 2 box 3 and box 4 due to the shallow water depth little aquaculture can be found in box 1 so we neglect the culture activities there the hydrodynamic properties of each box are simulated with the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom chen et al 2006 and the details are described by xuan et al 2019 in brief the model was implemented on an unstructured grid with the horizontal grid resolution varying from 50 400 m in the study area and there are 20 vertical σ layers the model was forced by atmospheric data from ecmwf era interim european medium range weather forecast atmospheric reanalysis https ecmwf int tidal data from tpxo 7 0 egbert and erofeeva 2002 and the ocean current from the hybrid coordinate ocean model bleck 2002 the model was run for the period from july 2010 to june 2011 and the results include hourly depth averaged current water temperature and salinity interpolated to a rectangular grid with a horizontal resolution of 100 m an offline coupled water quality model was implemented to simulate the environmental variables including din poc and phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration following xuan et al 2019 in this study model current results were used for the volume exchange estimation between boxes and the outer boundary and the water temperature time series were used for estimation of physiological rates the water quality model results were used as the far field boundary forcing of the ecosystem model 2 3 observations the biophysical data for model validation and optimization is from previous observational data and is summarized in table 4 for the deb model of oyster shell height cm and tissue wet weight tww data were recorded from 20 samples approximately twice a month from august 2016 to february 2017 the sampling location is shown in fig 1 at the long term station the corresponding surface chlorophyll a concentration and the water temperature were also recorded by a jfe advantec infinity clw fluorometer with a time interval of 4 h for the individual growth of kelp around ten samples were collected every month from february 2018 to june 2018 the kelp samples are mostly taken close to the long term station and the kelp length and tissue dry weight tdw were measured each time the water temperature and din concentration in the kelp farming area were measured every month din from previous cruises during 2011 2012 was collected and assigned to each box according to sampling sites fig 1 2 4 model setup most of the parameters in the individual models and the ecosystem model are taken from previous studies and the values and sources are listed in table 3 in terms of the difference in geographical conditions some parameters e g oyster half saturation food uptake concentration maximum phytoplankton kelp daily growth rate etc were calibrated and validated using previous local studies and observations calibrated parameters were applied to all models for consistency validation runs were conducted for the individual models and the ecosystem model and the results were compared to observations for the oyster observed chlorophyll a and water temperature data from 2016 2017 were used as the external driving force for the deb model with a time interval of 4 h t 1 6 day the initial reserve energy for oyster was set as 40 j the reproductive reserve was set as 10 j the initial bio volume was 0 6 cm3 with an initial oyster tww being around 0 2 g for kelp the individual model was forced with the observed interpolated din and water temperature during 2017 2018 the monthly values were interpolated to a time series with an interval of 6 h t 1 4 day from cai et al 2018 the hourly averaged light intensity was set constant irradiance 340 μ m o l m 2 s the initial kelp biomass tissue dry weight tdw is set at 0 5 g for all boxes and the initial tissue internal nitrogen nint is set as 1071 μ mol g dw zhang et al 2016 for the performance test of the ecosystem model the initial values of phytoplankton poc and din concentration were set equal to box averaged water quality model results the averaged culture density which is necessary to represent the situation with varieties of aquaculture companies and self employed households is scaled as individuals per m2 for oyster and kelp currently oyster culture in sanggou bay starts around june and usually lasts for 12 months then they are transferred to another region to fatten up to market size given the existing aquaculture spatial distribution oysters were cultured only in box 3 with a farm density of around 50 ind m2 the kelp was cultured in box 2 box 3 and box 4 with the seeding starting in november and the harvest starting in may the culture density was estimated to be 4 5 kelps per m2 mao et al 2018 the individual model results were compared to observations for performance evaluation the ecosystem model results were compared to data from the previous cruise and moored devices for the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the environmental variables the ecosystem model equations were computed with the open source programming language python 3 7 https www python org 2 5 scenario simulation the ecosystem model was run for ten scenarios representing different seeding combinations scenario iii is the validation simulation that represents the existing aquaculture practice scenarios i tovi aimed to study the response of the phytoplankton and production with different oyster seeding densities under a fixed amount of cultured kelp scenarios iii vii viii ix x aimed to study the growth and environmental feedback of different kelp seeding densities under a fixed number of cultured oyster the combinations are summarized in table 5 3 results 3 1 model validation the comparisons of simulated and observed values of oyster tww are showed in fig 3 together with the time series of water temperature and the chlorophyll a concentration error bars represent the standard deviation for each measurement of 20 oysters the simulated oyster growth starts in may which is approximately the seeding time of the sampled oysters both the observed and simulated oysters showed rapid growth from august with suitable temperature and relatively abundant food and tended to slow down after november as the environment changes as the oyster grows the tww tends to be diverse as a result of individual differences the most substantial standard deviation is 2 6 g which is about 27 of the mean value the simulated results have reproduced the growth situations the root mean square error between the observation and the simulations is 0 6 g however the simulated growth of oyster slightly deviates from the observation after december as it showed a continuous but small growth the simulated oyster did not spawn in the first year as the gonad index did not reach 35 the oyster spawned as the model ran to next august and approximately a 40 weight drop was predicted as the gonad emptied the comparison of simulated kelp tissue dry weight and the observed values are shown in fig 4 together with the corresponding environmental data and the 6 hourly interpolated curve the observations are mean kelp tdw g from 10 samples of the same farm error bars represent the standard deviation for each measurement harvest of kelp begins in may and lasts until late august in the simulation the kelp was cultured to the end of november with a computational time step of 6 h the simulated and observed kelp growth showed the right consistency of the general trend of the tdw increase the root mean square error is 17 03 g for the modeled and observed values although the model tends to underestimate the tdw during april when the kelp starts to proliferate a precise growth condition reproduction of the cultured organism is difficult the model is applicable to describe the kelp growth with reasonable forcing and uncertainties fig 5 compares simulated phytoplankton biomass converted to chlorophyll a with a ratio of phytoplankton carbon chl a 40 of each box with the observed chlorophyll a during 2016 2017 near the long term station the ecosystem model reproduced the proper chlorophyll a content and the seasonal variation during the vigorous growth seasons from may to october however when kelp was cultured the chlorophyll a development was not captured fully and underestimated in the model the magnitude of general chlorophyll a content and the short term peaks and valleys induced by water exchange are well reproduced in the model results fig 6 compares simulated din in each box with the observed values averaged from sample sites during 2011 2012 a ratio of 14 is used to convert the unit from mgn m3 to μmol l although the simulation period is different from the observations the simulated seasonal variation confirms the trend with the absence of kelp in july the din in each box is above 10 μmol l during winter the simulated din remained at a high level around 12 5 μmol l but the observed values already dropped to around 7 5 μmol l in january indicating that the kelp growth is underestimated in the model when the kelp starts to proliferate around march the modeled din decreases sharply as harvest starts in may the kelp growth slows down and the modeled din stabilized at a low level around 2 5 μmol l for box 3 and box 4 after the kelp is harvested in june the din in the ecosystem model rapidly recovered for each box according to the outer boundary constraints the observed din for each box was averaged from water samples taken from cruises in 2011 2012 fig 1 the standard deviation was large across each box with these limitations the model properly reproduced the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the environmental variables 3 2 pacific oyster c gigas the individual oyster tww growth under scenarios i vi are shown in fig 7 and the corresponding phytoplankton biomass in box 3 is also displayed the simulation results illustrated that oyster growth decrease with increased seeding density the individual tww at the end of the culture period for scenarios ii vi are 7 81 5 77 4 63 3 59 2 64 g ind respectively and such decrease is non linear for scenario i there is no oyster cultured the presence of oyster imposed a feeding pressure on the phytoplankton and a significant drop of phytoplankton concentration is observed for scenarios ii iii iv v and vi the available phytoplankton apn for individual oyster under different scenarios can be defined as cp 0 cp n n where cp n is the mean chlorophyll a averaged from the culture period with the seeding density of n and cp 0 is the mean chlorophyll a for no oyster situation the values of available phytoplankton are 0 024 0 017 0 014 0 011 and 0 008 μg chl a l ind for scenarios ii vi respectively regression analysis of the final oyster tww and the available phytoplankton for all seeding densities showed a significant linear correlation with the r value of 0 99 and p value of 7 6 10 7 increased oyster numbers have diminished the available phytoplankton resource for each individual and lead to a declined expectancy of oyster growth the harvested oyster tww oyster production kg ww ha phytoplankton depletion rate and the production efficiency for each seed density are shown in fig 8 the oyster production per ha is calculated as p n wn n where wn is the oyster individual tww and n is the harvested oyster numbers for initial seeding density n the phytoplankton depletion rate is calculated as dr cp 0 cp n cp 0 100 the production efficiency pe is defined as the summed seed tww divided by the final oyster production per ha the simulated production after one year is 1627 2002 2247 2292 and 2744 kg ww ha for scenarios ii vi less culture density has led to better individual growth however the production is increasing with the culture density under the pre defined constant mortality of 0 1 day the phytoplankton depletion increased as more oysters are cultured in the box the values are 43 2 52 4 58 2 64 0 and 70 0 for scenarios ii vi as the least seeding density simulated 30 oysters cultured per m2 still lead to more than 43 depletion of the phytoplankton when seed density was increased by five times the phytoplankton depletion increased to 70 the production efficiencies are 8 8 6 5 5 2 4 1 and 3 0 for scenarios ii vi 3 3 kelp s japonica the individual kelp tissue dry weight tdw growth under scenarios iii for box 2 box 3 and box 4 are shown in fig 9 and the corresponding din concentration is also displayed for each box the kelp grows differently in each box under different environmental conditions the maximum tdws are 166 5 210 8 and 229 2 g ind for box 2 box 3 and box 4 box 2 has less nutrients compared to the other two boxes the supply of din is insufficient to maintain a high growth since may the kelp in box 3 and box 4 maintain a relatively high growth until june and as box 4 has the most abundant din supply the final tdw of kelp in box 4 is higher than that in box 3 similar trends of kelp growth and din variation were observed for scenarios vii x the maximum kelp tdw became smaller and the mean din content level was lower with increased kelp seeding density the kelp tdw production ton ha for each box and the expected individual tdw g at harvest for different seeding density are shown in fig 10 the kelp is harvested on the 15th of june and the production is then calculated through multiplying the individual tdw by harvested numbers the kelp production overall showed an increase trend with densities the increment is not uniform for each box for box 2 when 80 000 kelp were cultured per ha the production increased to 6 39 ton ha against 5 23 ton ha with half seeding density at 40 000 ha and the increase rate is 22 2 the same operation in box 3 lead to a 32 7 production increase from 6 63 ton ha to 8 80 ton ha and for box 4 this lead to a 43 8 increase from 7 2 ton ha to 10 36 ton ha 3 4 din budget the contribution of oyster kelp phytoplankton and the current exchange to the din content in box 3 for scenario iii is illustrated in fig 11 the amount from each contributor is computed from the ecosystem model equation listed in table 1 and then summed up for each month fig 11 shows that the kelp aquaculture plays a vital role in the simulated din budget cycle for box 3 when the oyster is in the appropriate environment with exuberant physiological activties the din excretion from oyster peaked in september at 16 5 mgn m3 month as the temperature decreases and phytoplankton biomass drops the din output of oyster decreases to a negeligible level around 0 33 mgn m3 month and it starts to rise again when the environment becomes suitable similar behavior for din absorption is also presented for the phytoplankton with a peak uptake in august at 43 6 mgn m3 month and decreases as the water cools later on the din concentration diffference between adjacent boxes determines the din budget which is induced by the water exchange before the kelp seeding box 3 can be a pool that export din to other boxes with lower din content after the kelp aquaculture starts and the biomass increases rapidly the imported din is taken up by the cultured kelp and the amount increases like exponentially from december to june kelp is also aquacultured in box 2 and box 4 indicating that the additional din mainly comes from outside the bay in june the monthly uptake of din by kelp exceeds 0 5 g m3 suggesting that the cultured kelp absorbs a considerable amount of nutrients from adjacent seas 4 discussion an ecosystem model which consists of the individual based models for pacific oyster c gigas and kelp s japonica has been implemented based on previous literature pouvrou et al 2006 ren et al 2008 wu et al 2009 ren et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 cai et al 2018 the individual model were validated by observations and the results agree reasonably well the simulated din and phytoplankton reproduced the observed values in magnitude and seasonal cycle the model performed well for describing the ecosystem with aquaculture being a significant component and can be used to study different aquaculture scenarios 4 1 performance of the ecosystem model ecosystem models are practical tools to study the dynamics and characteristics of a particular ecosystem shown in several applications grant et al 2007 shi et al 2011 filgueira et al 2014 reid et al 2018 reviewed the various models and their performance testing method for imta in open waters furthermore they stated that the assessment of nutrient transfer and growth in imta systems requires careful consideration for many aspects including environmental conditions ecological transfer efficiencies and timing of production cycles we have used hourly hydrodynamic model results for the computation of the water exchange between each box the tidal induced short term environmental variation is introduced to the ecosystem model and the enhanced temporal resolution helps to reconstruct the dynamic environment still there are necessary assumptions on the physiological process population dynamics and environmental organism interactions during the model operation so the validation of model results to synchronous and systematical observations are required to optimize model performance for our case the spatial scale of the ecosystem model is tens of kilometers with complicated aquaculture activities as there are numbers of aquaculture companies and self employed households the distribution of facilities and aquaculture management lacks uniformity due to the difficulties in obtaining synchronized observations the accurate reproduction of past facts is extremely difficult the ecosystem model results for the seasonal phytoplankton and din fig 5 and fig 6 have reproduced the general cycle and eligible magnitude from observations this indicates the model s critical biological processes are sufficiently describing the major ecosystem characteristics the phytoplankton biomass was underestimated during winter an explanation is that temperature restriction omits low temperature tolerant species resulting in an extremely low phytoplankton reproduction during winter seasons it is also possible that the observations were made near the outer boundary fig 1 where the outer boundary condition does not capture the winter phytoplankton abundance in the yellow sea the discrepancy of simulated din and phytoplankton probably resulted from a robust outer boundary constraint or the averaged spatial data the model s assumptions may be insufficient to interpret the complicated natural variability individual models are essential components of the ecosystem model and reasonably parameterization of the physiological process of cultured organisms under different environmental conditions is of vital importance for the overall performance of the ecosystem model the individual model we applied for oyster is implemented with the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 and the deb model is apply well for bivalve duarte et al 2003 pouvreau et al 2006 ren et al 2008 indeed the validation results fig 3 prove that the model correctly described the growth of oysters in a given environment the deviation between the observed and modeled oyster growth can be aroused from uncertainties in the environmental forcing the dynamic growth model for kelp was based on an exponential growth formula gregor et al 2018 which requires a careful selection of parameters such as the basic daily growth rate there are recent publications on the modeling of kelp in sanggou bay with different daily growth rates zhang et al 2016 cai et al 2018 in our model the daily growth rate was calibrated from the observations and set to be μ max 0 115 day different model parameterization for the specific species and region may be due to differences in the mathematical expressions environmental data quality or the sample quality pertinent environmental data with good quality temporal and spatial is required for further coupling of useful models for production prediction gregor et al 2018 the individual kelp growth model showed good agreement with the observations in the given period but whether it is sufficiently representative for sanggou bay still requires more data for validation and optimization 4 2 aquaculture management with the ecosystem model using the ecosystem model as a tool we can investigate the carrying capacity of the cultured organism for each model box within sanggou bay currently there are no unified criteria on how to define the carrying capacity for a specific environment filgueira et al 2014 implemented a fully spatial ecosystem model in richibucto estuary for oyster crassostrea virginica aquaculture and used the phytoplankton depletion as an indicator for carrying capacity zhao et al 2019 implemented a coupled scamod for the bottom cultured scallop patinopecten yessoensis and estimated the carrying capacity based on the economic benefit evaluation for pacific oyster aquaculture in sanggou bay fig 8 the simulated production per ha increase as seeding density increases indicating a higher available physical carrying capacity the phytoplankton depletion increased proportionally with the oyster biomass growth illustrating an enhanced transfer from phytoplankton biomass to the oyster equally less cultured oyster leads to a higher production efficiency during the simulation period as individual oyster occupies more resource for the practical aquaculture there is a requirement for harvest size at the end of the year the ecosystem model provides predictions for oyster growth and offers options for appropriate culture densities around 50 oysters cultured per m2 based on the practical experience is close to the optimal solution under the current condition kelp is the main seaweed cultured in sanggou bay and the growth and culture carrying capacity are different from that of the oyster from the kelp simulation scenarios the kelp biomass increases slightly for each culture density in box 2 indicating that the kelp biomass is getting close to the carrying capacity limited by the nutrient supply since may in box 3 and box 4 the kelp production maintained a certain growth with increased culture numbers with abundant din and the increment is much higher with doubled kelp seed density these results indicate there is still allowance to the carrying capacity nevertheless under fixed mortality increased kelp numbers in the aquaculture farms will lead to smaller individual sizes when kelp grows to a certain extent the effect of respiration and erosion increases and it starts to produce spores such a process which is not fully resolved in the model will affect the kelp quality in actual aquaculture production the limitation of kelp production is not only from physiological and ecological processes but also from the limitation of the physical living space the current kelp aquaculture around 40 000 ind ha based on decades of accumulated experience is a balanced choice of production individual quality moderate management efforts and less seed cost the model results of predicted kelp growth and production could help farmers in make decisions based on environmental conditions market demand and policy requirements 4 3 model limitations and future improvements although our model followed the observations to a reasonable extent it is based on a relatively crude spatial scale at tens of kilometers and several assumptions and simplifications the model application requires uniform aquaculture layout covering a typical surface more than tens of kilometer square which makes sanggou bay an ideal site due to its homogeneous and dense aquaculture distribution a fully spatial coupled ecosystem model e g filgueira et al 2014 will better reproduce the spatial distribution and the impact of scattered aquaculture layout however such a model usually requires more stringent boundary conditions and validation data and the model configuration is often specific to a localization and less general it is reasonable to choose a more effective simulation method based on actual aquaculture and environment conditions the lack of synchronized and continuous observations during the ecosystem model simulation periods hinders the further calibration and optimization of the model however to obtain continuous data is not easy as this depends significantly on the sampling difficulty measurement accuracy and local aquaculture production processes sustaining data acquisition and continuous monitoring are required for model optimization the improvement of the individual models relies on the progress of the physiological and ecological research describing the process of nutrient absorption kinetics filter feeding dynamics and population dynamics 5 conclusion the sanggou bay provides an excellent site to apply model study on the ecosystem controlled by commercial scale aquaculture the present ecosystem model generally reproduced seasonal variation of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phytoplankton concentrations the predicted oyster and kelp growth validated well with observations scenario simulations showed that 50 cultured oysters per meter square is the optimal choice which comply with the current practical aquaculture the model also concluded that the nutrient source for the kelp aquaculture in the bay was mainly from the adjacent sea moreover in the region with inadequate nutrient supply the kelp production was approaching the carrying capacity the model can be a useful tool for integrated aquaculture management and spatial planning credit authorship contribution statement l i n fan conceptualization methodology

24799,to understand the biological process in an aquaculture dominant coastal system and to provide a tool for further aquaculture management an ecosystem model has been implemented to study the aquaculture environmental interaction and the carrying capacity for sanggou bay the model coupled the pelagic system kelp growth dynamics oyster energetics and population dynamics with hourly hydrodynamic and water quality data the study area was divided into four boxes according to similarities in the hydrological environment and aquaculture layout scenario simulations were conducted with different combinations of oyster and kelp seeding densities to examine the environmental impacts and production under different aquaculture layouts results showed that the model could capture the main characteristics of observed environmental variables and culture organism growth increased seeding density of both oysters and kelp generally leads to increased production with diminished individual growth kelp aquaculture plays a leading role in the nutrient cycle in the bay acting as a large reception tank during the rapid growth period the model results indicate that there is still potential to increase production for both oyster and kelp in sanggou bay the current aquaculture practice seems to have the right balance of carrying capacity management efforts and other costs under the existing production procedures the ecosystem model is a promising tool for further study with sustained observation effort and better boundary conditions keywords sanggou bay bivalve seaweed integrated aquaculture ecosystem model individual growth model carrying capacity estimation 1 introduction aquaculture has contributed up to 46 8 of the world total seafood supplement in 2016 of which china had produced 49 2 mt of cultured animals fish crustaceans mollusks and 14 5 mt of cultured aquatic plants this is accounting for about 61 5 and 48 0 of the world total production respectively fao 2018 the high biomass produced from aquaculture has brought increased concerns on the pressure of coastal ecosystem and sustainability worldwide milewski i 2001 cao et al 2007 ferreira et al 2007 whitmarsh d and palmieri m g 2008 galparsoro et al 2020 integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta is considered as an effective method for aquaculture productivity and sustainability the theory behind imta is to recycle the nutrients and waste through integrating cultured species at different trophic levels chopin et al 2001 integrated aquaculture has been practiced in china for centuries naca 1989 and a thriving commercial scale imta of bivalves currently pacific oyster crassostrea gigas and seaweed kelp saccharina japonica has been operated since the mid 1980s in sanggou bay china the bay has become a demonstration site for domestic and global research projects related to carrying capacity estimation and environmental impact assessment sanggou bay fig 1 is a shallow semi enclosed bay located at the east end of the shandong peninsula 37 01 09 n 122 24 35 e the bay s total area is about 144 km2 with the topography deepening from the central coast to outside and the average depth of about 7 5 m tidal currents particularly the semi diurnal constituents dominate the flow in the bay zhao et al 1996 nearly two thirds of the bay area have been occupied by bivalve and seaweed aquaculture the annual production of kelp is estimated to be up to 84 500 tons in dry weight mao et al 2018 and the annual production of shellfish is approximately 100 000 tons in wet weight zhang et al 2009 fang et al 1996 were the first to study the carrying capacity of cultured kelp using the nitrogen budget and estimated water exchange in sanggou bay and the capacity was estimated to be about 54 000 mt in dry weight with the development of observation instruments and computing capabilities numerical models have gradually become main tools to study the aquaculture sustainability jon grant and cedric bacher 2001 have implemented a finite element circulation model to study the current modification by the culture structures for bivalves and seaweed in sanggou bay which brought in the consideration of local hydrodynamics to the problem of carrying capacity the simulation concluded a 41 decrease in the water exchange due to the presence of the aquaculture facilities which may lead to an overestimation of particle renewal time and as a result thus overestimating the carrying capacity shi et al 2011 have developed a three dimensional physical biological coupled model for sanggou bay with a parameterized surface drag from culture structures the kelp production nitrogen budget and current field were simulated for different culture densities to seek the optimum values for sustainable development from studies of carrying capacity of suspended oyster aquaculture in québec canada an oyster individual growth model was integrated into the ecosystem model and hydrodynamic model results were used to compute water exchange at the box boundaries grant et al 2007 the model results were useful in the management of sustainable development of local oyster industries guyondet

farms with the larger scale coastal ecosystem ren et al 2012 have developed an ecosystem model for imta with multiple biological modules including finfish seaweed shellfish phytoplankton zooplankton carnivores and benthic detritivores in waihinau bay and pelorus sound new zealand in their study hydrodynamic computed boundary volume fluxes drive the model defined physiological processes these numerical models above parameterized the interactions between cultured organisms and the ecosystem components and predicting individual growth and population state of targeted biological groups as well as the significantly correlated environmental variables ecosystem models often have specific regional characteristics like the natural environment the ecosystem compositions the aquaculture method and the bio physiology of the cultured organisms a general frameworks should be modified with detailed localization calibration and validation for use in solving specific problems the purpose of this study is to establish an ecosystem model to examine the interaction between the integrated aquaculture of bivalve and seaweed and the local environment in sanggou bay the model can be a tool to study the biogeochemical flux variation due to different culture management and to seek optimum aquaculture principles based on carrying capacity estimation 2 methods 2 1 model description the ecosystem model for the co cultured oyster and kelp in sanggou bay is developed from several previous studies at the individual level for organism growth zhang et al 2016 cai et al 2018 ren et al 2008 and at population level for biological group interaction grant et al al 2007 ren et al 2012 filgueira et al 2015 the model was established based on a typical nitrogen phytoplankton zooplankton detritus npzd model instead of zooplankton pacific oyster c gigas is the model grazer because of the dominant biomass kelp s japonica is introduced as an additional nutrient consumer a concept diagram of the model is shown in fig 2 the ecosystem model is deterministic with no random processes considered it was simulated based on the box model concept with the identical structure in each box the environmental terms including dissolved inorganic nitrogen din phytoplankton and pelagic organic matter particle organic carbon poc are assumed to be uniformly mixed in each box and properties can be exchanged with adjacent boxes and the outer sea a hydrodynamic model was incorporated to compute the water volume exchange the exchange of a given box at each time step is determined by the inflow and outflow volume as δex δ v in e x in δ v out e x out v where δv in and δv out are the inflow and outflow at each boundary exin and exout are the concentration from inflow box and the target box respectively the exchange at each boundary is then summed up and divided by the target box volume v to obtain the concentration variation the state variables and differential equations describing the aquaculture system are listed in table 1 the biological processes and their definitions are listed in table 2 the parameters and their sources are listed in table 3 the detailed explanation can be found from referred studies zhang et al 2016 cai et al 2018 ren et al 2008 2012 an arrhenius relationship is used to describe the impact of the water temperature on the growth and respiration of phytoplankton as the physiological rates increase exponentially with rising temperature until a maximum and then decrease with further temperature increase ren et al 2012 the growth of phytoplankton is described by two state variables the phytoplankton carbon cp and nitrogen np the uptake of carbon u cp and nitrogen u np is internally connected by the n quota n c ratio to prevent the unrealistic absorption of carbon or nitrogen ren et al 2012 the uptake of carbon is limited by temperature irradiance and the n quota and the uptake of nitrogen follows the michaelis menten equation caperon and meyer 1972 which is a well known model to describe the rate of enzymatic reactions the biomass loss of phytoplankton consists of three processes their own respiration oyster grazing u bp and natural sinking m p the detailed parameterization of these biological processes is listed in table 2 the detritus in the model is described with the state variable particle organic carbon poc poc serves as food u bo for cultured oyster in the model meantime the feces om of oyster is also the source of the poc the sedimentation of poc and the exchange expoc between boundaries also change the concentrations dissolved inorganic nitrogen din is the nutrient flux tracking the interaction among trophic groups within the system excretion of oysters oexcr is the biological source of din while kelp u nk and phytoplankton u np absorb din from the system as the ecosystem is dominated by kelp aquaculture the din exchange with the outer sea is crucial for the nutrient supplement the individual based model applied in this study for oyster follows ren et al 2008 the three state variables to describe the energetics of the oyster are reserves e reproduction reserves e r and biovolume v the reserves are replenished with assimilated energy pa deducting the metabolic expenditure pc food availability and temperature are the major factors that determine oyster growth the temperature limitation of the oyster is formulated as an arrhenius relationship that affects most of the physiological processes the energy uptake follows a type ii functional response to food density which assumes a deaccelerated rate with food density holling c s 1959 described as f f f f h where f is the food concentration and f h is the half saturation coefficient for food uptake by oysters the energy acquired is then distributed according to the κ rule kooijman 2010 a fixed fraction of κ is utilized in body maintenance pm and growth which lead to a increase in biovolume and the remaining 1 κ fraction is allocated to reproduction detailed equations and definitions of the state variables and biological processes can be found in table 1 and table 2 the biological function of the oyster is to graze phytoplankton and particle organic matter from the surrounding water and to excrete nitrogen and feces into the system the population dynamics of oyster n is determined by culture harvest δh and natural mortality δr when harvested the oyster is removed from the system the natural mortality will lead to a continuous biomass loss during the simulation the growth of kelp is simulated with an individual growth model from zhang et al 2016 and cai et al 2018 three state variables are used to describe kelp growth the individual kelp biomass b kelp length l and the tissue nitrogen content nint the individual kelp biomass variation is defined as growth minus respiration and erosion growth of kelp is defined as a maximum growth rate μmax multiplied by a limiting factors from 0 1 due to water temperature light intensity and nutrients concentration table 2 the temperature limitation f t is an exponential function to produce a partial normal distribution according to the optimum temperature for kelp growth radach et al 1993 for simplicity only the nitrogen limitation f n is considered cai et al 2018 and is calculated by the michaelis menten equation the light limitation f i is defined according to steele 1962 with the optimum light intensity i opt the kelp respiration rate and erosion rate limited by temperature are parameterized with a similar exponential form table 2 the uptake of external din by kelp φ also follows a michaelis menten function based on the tissue nitrogen content the population dynamics of kelp a is the same as the oyster currently no stochastic processes disease and disaster are considered as we assume a thorough vertical mixing in the bay the benthic processes are not considered in the model of this study 2 2 study area and hydrodynamics the model is applied to sanggou bay and the domain is separated into four boxes according to hydrodynamic and aquaculture layout similarities as shown in fig 1 the volumes for box 1 to 4 are 0 367 km3 0 239 km3 0 504 km3 and 0 352 km3 and the average depths for each box are 6 3 m 7 3 m 8 0 m and 8 1 m respectively the aquaculture in sanggou bay mainly takes place in box 2 box 3 and box 4 due to the shallow water depth little aquaculture can be found in box 1 so we neglect the culture activities there the hydrodynamic properties of each box are simulated with the finite volume coastal ocean model fvcom chen et al 2006 and the details are described by xuan et al 2019 in brief the model was implemented on an unstructured grid with the horizontal grid resolution varying from 50 400 m in the study area and there are 20 vertical σ layers the model was forced by atmospheric data from ecmwf era interim european medium range weather forecast atmospheric reanalysis https ecmwf int tidal data from tpxo 7 0 egbert and erofeeva 2002 and the ocean current from the hybrid coordinate ocean model bleck 2002 the model was run for the period from july 2010 to june 2011 and the results include hourly depth averaged current water temperature and salinity interpolated to a rectangular grid with a horizontal resolution of 100 m an offline coupled water quality model was implemented to simulate the environmental variables including din poc and phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration following xuan et al 2019 in this study model current results were used for the volume exchange estimation between boxes and the outer boundary and the water temperature time series were used for estimation of physiological rates the water quality model results were used as the far field boundary forcing of the ecosystem model 2 3 observations the biophysical data for model validation and optimization is from previous observational data and is summarized in table 4 for the deb model of oyster shell height cm and tissue wet weight tww data were recorded from 20 samples approximately twice a month from august 2016 to february 2017 the sampling location is shown in fig 1 at the long term station the corresponding surface chlorophyll a concentration and the water temperature were also recorded by a jfe advantec infinity clw fluorometer with a time interval of 4 h for the individual growth of kelp around ten samples were collected every month from february 2018 to june 2018 the kelp samples are mostly taken close to the long term station and the kelp length and tissue dry weight tdw were measured each time the water temperature and din concentration in the kelp farming area were measured every month din from previous cruises during 2011 2012 was collected and assigned to each box according to sampling sites fig 1 2 4 model setup most of the parameters in the individual models and the ecosystem model are taken from previous studies and the values and sources are listed in table 3 in terms of the difference in geographical conditions some parameters e g oyster half saturation food uptake concentration maximum phytoplankton kelp daily growth rate etc were calibrated and validated using previous local studies and observations calibrated parameters were applied to all models for consistency validation runs were conducted for the individual models and the ecosystem model and the results were compared to observations for the oyster observed chlorophyll a and water temperature data from 2016 2017 were used as the external driving force for the deb model with a time interval of 4 h t 1 6 day the initial reserve energy for oyster was set as 40 j the reproductive reserve was set as 10 j the initial bio volume was 0 6 cm3 with an initial oyster tww being around 0 2 g for kelp the individual model was forced with the observed interpolated din and water temperature during 2017 2018 the monthly values were interpolated to a time series with an interval of 6 h t 1 4 day from cai et al 2018 the hourly averaged light intensity was set constant irradiance 340 μ m o l m 2 s the initial kelp biomass tissue dry weight tdw is set at 0 5 g for all boxes and the initial tissue internal nitrogen nint is set as 1071 μ mol g dw zhang et al 2016 for the performance test of the ecosystem model the initial values of phytoplankton poc and din concentration were set equal to box averaged water quality model results the averaged culture density which is necessary to represent the situation with varieties of aquaculture companies and self employed households is scaled as individuals per m2 for oyster and kelp currently oyster culture in sanggou bay starts around june and usually lasts for 12 months then they are transferred to another region to fatten up to market size given the existing aquaculture spatial distribution oysters were cultured only in box 3 with a farm density of around 50 ind m2 the kelp was cultured in box 2 box 3 and box 4 with the seeding starting in november and the harvest starting in may the culture density was estimated to be 4 5 kelps per m2 mao et al 2018 the individual model results were compared to observations for performance evaluation the ecosystem model results were compared to data from the previous cruise and moored devices for the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the environmental variables the ecosystem model equations were computed with the open source programming language python 3 7 https www python org 2 5 scenario simulation the ecosystem model was run for ten scenarios representing different seeding combinations scenario iii is the validation simulation that represents the existing aquaculture practice scenarios i tovi aimed to study the response of the phytoplankton and production with different oyster seeding densities under a fixed amount of cultured kelp scenarios iii vii viii ix x aimed to study the growth and environmental feedback of different kelp seeding densities under a fixed number of cultured oyster the combinations are summarized in table 5 3 results 3 1 model validation the comparisons of simulated and observed values of oyster tww are showed in fig 3 together with the time series of water temperature and the chlorophyll a concentration error bars represent the standard deviation for each measurement of 20 oysters the simulated oyster growth starts in may which is approximately the seeding time of the sampled oysters both the observed and simulated oysters showed rapid growth from august with suitable temperature and relatively abundant food and tended to slow down after november as the environment changes as the oyster grows the tww tends to be diverse as a result of individual differences the most substantial standard deviation is 2 6 g which is about 27 of the mean value the simulated results have reproduced the growth situations the root mean square error between the observation and the simulations is 0 6 g however the simulated growth of oyster slightly deviates from the observation after december as it showed a continuous but small growth the simulated oyster did not spawn in the first year as the gonad index did not reach 35 the oyster spawned as the model ran to next august and approximately a 40 weight drop was predicted as the gonad emptied the comparison of simulated kelp tissue dry weight and the observed values are shown in fig 4 together with the corresponding environmental data and the 6 hourly interpolated curve the observations are mean kelp tdw g from 10 samples of the same farm error bars represent the standard deviation for each measurement harvest of kelp begins in may and lasts until late august in the simulation the kelp was cultured to the end of november with a computational time step of 6 h the simulated and observed kelp growth showed the right consistency of the general trend of the tdw increase the root mean square error is 17 03 g for the modeled and observed values although the model tends to underestimate the tdw during april when the kelp starts to proliferate a precise growth condition reproduction of the cultured organism is difficult the model is applicable to describe the kelp growth with reasonable forcing and uncertainties fig 5 compares simulated phytoplankton biomass converted to chlorophyll a with a ratio of phytoplankton carbon chl a 40 of each box with the observed chlorophyll a during 2016 2017 near the long term station the ecosystem model reproduced the proper chlorophyll a content and the seasonal variation during the vigorous growth seasons from may to october however when kelp was cultured the chlorophyll a development was not captured fully and underestimated in the model the magnitude of general chlorophyll a content and the short term peaks and valleys induced by water exchange are well reproduced in the model results fig 6 compares simulated din in each box with the observed values averaged from sample sites during 2011 2012 a ratio of 14 is used to convert the unit from mgn m3 to μmol l although the simulation period is different from the observations the simulated seasonal variation confirms the trend with the absence of kelp in july the din in each box is above 10 μmol l during winter the simulated din remained at a high level around 12 5 μmol l but the observed values already dropped to around 7 5 μmol l in january indicating that the kelp growth is underestimated in the model when the kelp starts to proliferate around march the modeled din decreases sharply as harvest starts in may the kelp growth slows down and the modeled din stabilized at a low level around 2 5 μmol l for box 3 and box 4 after the kelp is harvested in june the din in the ecosystem model rapidly recovered for each box according to the outer boundary constraints the observed din for each box was averaged from water samples taken from cruises in 2011 2012 fig 1 the standard deviation was large across each box with these limitations the model properly reproduced the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the environmental variables 3 2 pacific oyster c gigas the individual oyster tww growth under scenarios i vi are shown in fig 7 and the corresponding phytoplankton biomass in box 3 is also displayed the simulation results illustrated that oyster growth decrease with increased seeding density the individual tww at the end of the culture period for scenarios ii vi are 7 81 5 77 4 63 3 59 2 64 g ind respectively and such decrease is non linear for scenario i there is no oyster cultured the presence of oyster imposed a feeding pressure on the phytoplankton and a significant drop of phytoplankton concentration is observed for scenarios ii iii iv v and vi the available phytoplankton apn for individual oyster under different scenarios can be defined as cp 0 cp n n where cp n is the mean chlorophyll a averaged from the culture period with the seeding density of n and cp 0 is the mean chlorophyll a for no oyster situation the values of available phytoplankton are 0 024 0 017 0 014 0 011 and 0 008 μg chl a l ind for scenarios ii vi respectively regression analysis of the final oyster tww and the available phytoplankton for all seeding densities showed a significant linear correlation with the r value of 0 99 and p value of 7 6 10 7 increased oyster numbers have diminished the available phytoplankton resource for each individual and lead to a declined expectancy of oyster growth the harvested oyster tww oyster production kg ww ha phytoplankton depletion rate and the production efficiency for each seed density are shown in fig 8 the oyster production per ha is calculated as p n wn n where wn is the oyster individual tww and n is the harvested oyster numbers for initial seeding density n the phytoplankton depletion rate is calculated as dr cp 0 cp n cp 0 100 the production efficiency pe is defined as the summed seed tww divided by the final oyster production per ha the simulated production after one year is 1627 2002 2247 2292 and 2744 kg ww ha for scenarios ii vi less culture density has led to better individual growth however the production is increasing with the culture density under the pre defined constant mortality of 0 1 day the phytoplankton depletion increased as more oysters are cultured in the box the values are 43 2 52 4 58 2 64 0 and 70 0 for scenarios ii vi as the least seeding density simulated 30 oysters cultured per m2 still lead to more than 43 depletion of the phytoplankton when seed density was increased by five times the phytoplankton depletion increased to 70 the production efficiencies are 8 8 6 5 5 2 4 1 and 3 0 for scenarios ii vi 3 3 kelp s japonica the individual kelp tissue dry weight tdw growth under scenarios iii for box 2 box 3 and box 4 are shown in fig 9 and the corresponding din concentration is also displayed for each box the kelp grows differently in each box under different environmental conditions the maximum tdws are 166 5 210 8 and 229 2 g ind for box 2 box 3 and box 4 box 2 has less nutrients compared to the other two boxes the supply of din is insufficient to maintain a high growth since may the kelp in box 3 and box 4 maintain a relatively high growth until june and as box 4 has the most abundant din supply the final tdw of kelp in box 4 is higher than that in box 3 similar trends of kelp growth and din variation were observed for scenarios vii x the maximum kelp tdw became smaller and the mean din content level was lower with increased kelp seeding density the kelp tdw production ton ha for each box and the expected individual tdw g at harvest for different seeding density are shown in fig 10 the kelp is harvested on the 15th of june and the production is then calculated through multiplying the individual tdw by harvested numbers the kelp production overall showed an increase trend with densities the increment is not uniform for each box for box 2 when 80 000 kelp were cultured per ha the production increased to 6 39 ton ha against 5 23 ton ha with half seeding density at 40 000 ha and the increase rate is 22 2 the same operation in box 3 lead to a 32 7 production increase from 6 63 ton ha to 8 80 ton ha and for box 4 this lead to a 43 8 increase from 7 2 ton ha to 10 36 ton ha 3 4 din budget the contribution of oyster kelp phytoplankton and the current exchange to the din content in box 3 for scenario iii is illustrated in fig 11 the amount from each contributor is computed from the ecosystem model equation listed in table 1 and then summed up for each month fig 11 shows that the kelp aquaculture plays a vital role in the simulated din budget cycle for box 3 when the oyster is in the appropriate environment with exuberant physiological activties the din excretion from oyster peaked in september at 16 5 mgn m3 month as the temperature decreases and phytoplankton biomass drops the din output of oyster decreases to a negeligible level around 0 33 mgn m3 month and it starts to rise again when the environment becomes suitable similar behavior for din absorption is also presented for the phytoplankton with a peak uptake in august at 43 6 mgn m3 month and decreases as the water cools later on the din concentration diffference between adjacent boxes determines the din budget which is induced by the water exchange before the kelp seeding box 3 can be a pool that export din to other boxes with lower din content after the kelp aquaculture starts and the biomass increases rapidly the imported din is taken up by the cultured kelp and the amount increases like exponentially from december to june kelp is also aquacultured in box 2 and box 4 indicating that the additional din mainly comes from outside the bay in june the monthly uptake of din by kelp exceeds 0 5 g m3 suggesting that the cultured kelp absorbs a considerable amount of nutrients from adjacent seas 4 discussion an ecosystem model which consists of the individual based models for pacific oyster c gigas and kelp s japonica has been implemented based on previous literature pouvrou et al 2006 ren et al 2008 wu et al 2009 ren et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 cai et al 2018 the individual model were validated by observations and the results agree reasonably well the simulated din and phytoplankton reproduced the observed values in magnitude and seasonal cycle the model performed well for describing the ecosystem with aquaculture being a significant component and can be used to study different aquaculture scenarios 4 1 performance of the ecosystem model ecosystem models are practical tools to study the dynamics and characteristics of a particular ecosystem shown in several applications grant et al 2007 shi et al 2011 filgueira et al 2014 reid et al 2018 reviewed the various models and their performance testing method for imta in open waters furthermore they stated that the assessment of nutrient transfer and growth in imta systems requires careful consideration for many aspects including environmental conditions ecological transfer efficiencies and timing of production cycles we have used hourly hydrodynamic model results for the computation of the water exchange between each box the tidal induced short term environmental variation is introduced to the ecosystem model and the enhanced temporal resolution helps to reconstruct the dynamic environment still there are necessary assumptions on the physiological process population dynamics and environmental organism interactions during the model operation so the validation of model results to synchronous and systematical observations are required to optimize model performance for our case the spatial scale of the ecosystem model is tens of kilometers with complicated aquaculture activities as there are numbers of aquaculture companies and self employed households the distribution of facilities and aquaculture management lacks uniformity due to the difficulties in obtaining synchronized observations the accurate reproduction of past facts is extremely difficult the ecosystem model results for the seasonal phytoplankton and din fig 5 and fig 6 have reproduced the general cycle and eligible magnitude from observations this indicates the model s critical biological processes are sufficiently describing the major ecosystem characteristics the phytoplankton biomass was underestimated during winter an explanation is that temperature restriction omits low temperature tolerant species resulting in an extremely low phytoplankton reproduction during winter seasons it is also possible that the observations were made near the outer boundary fig 1 where the outer boundary condition does not capture the winter phytoplankton abundance in the yellow sea the discrepancy of simulated din and phytoplankton probably resulted from a robust outer boundary constraint or the averaged spatial data the model s assumptions may be insufficient to interpret the complicated natural variability individual models are essential components of the ecosystem model and reasonably parameterization of the physiological process of cultured organisms under different environmental conditions is of vital importance for the overall performance of the ecosystem model the individual model we applied for oyster is implemented with the dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 and the deb model is apply well for bivalve duarte et al 2003 pouvreau et al 2006 ren et al 2008 indeed the validation results fig 3 prove that the model correctly described the growth of oysters in a given environment the deviation between the observed and modeled oyster growth can be aroused from uncertainties in the environmental forcing the dynamic growth model for kelp was based on an exponential growth formula gregor et al 2018 which requires a careful selection of parameters such as the basic daily growth rate there are recent publications on the modeling of kelp in sanggou bay with different daily growth rates zhang et al 2016 cai et al 2018 in our model the daily growth rate was calibrated from the observations and set to be μ max 0 115 day different model parameterization for the specific species and region may be due to differences in the mathematical expressions environmental data quality or the sample quality pertinent environmental data with good quality temporal and spatial is required for further coupling of useful models for production prediction gregor et al 2018 the individual kelp growth model showed good agreement with the observations in the given period but whether it is sufficiently representative for sanggou bay still requires more data for validation and optimization 4 2 aquaculture management with the ecosystem model using the ecosystem model as a tool we can investigate the carrying capacity of the cultured organism for each model box within sanggou bay currently there are no unified criteria on how to define the carrying capacity for a specific environment filgueira et al 2014 implemented a fully spatial ecosystem model in richibucto estuary for oyster crassostrea virginica aquaculture and used the phytoplankton depletion as an indicator for carrying capacity zhao et al 2019 implemented a coupled scamod for the bottom cultured scallop patinopecten yessoensis and estimated the carrying capacity based on the economic benefit evaluation for pacific oyster aquaculture in sanggou bay fig 8 the simulated production per ha increase as seeding density increases indicating a higher available physical carrying capacity the phytoplankton depletion increased proportionally with the oyster biomass growth illustrating an enhanced transfer from phytoplankton biomass to the oyster equally less cultured oyster leads to a higher production efficiency during the simulation period as individual oyster occupies more resource for the practical aquaculture there is a requirement for harvest size at the end of the year the ecosystem model provides predictions for oyster growth and offers options for appropriate culture densities around 50 oysters cultured per m2 based on the practical experience is close to the optimal solution under the current condition kelp is the main seaweed cultured in sanggou bay and the growth and culture carrying capacity are different from that of the oyster from the kelp simulation scenarios the kelp biomass increases slightly for each culture density in box 2 indicating that the kelp biomass is getting close to the carrying capacity limited by the nutrient supply since may in box 3 and box 4 the kelp production maintained a certain growth with increased culture numbers with abundant din and the increment is much higher with doubled kelp seed density these results indicate there is still allowance to the carrying capacity nevertheless under fixed mortality increased kelp numbers in the aquaculture farms will lead to smaller individual sizes when kelp grows to a certain extent the effect of respiration and erosion increases and it starts to produce spores such a process which is not fully resolved in the model will affect the kelp quality in actual aquaculture production the limitation of kelp production is not only from physiological and ecological processes but also from the limitation of the physical living space the current kelp aquaculture around 40 000 ind ha based on decades of accumulated experience is a balanced choice of production individual quality moderate management efforts and less seed cost the model results of predicted kelp growth and production could help farmers in make decisions based on environmental conditions market demand and policy requirements 4 3 model limitations and future improvements although our model followed the observations to a reasonable extent it is based on a relatively crude spatial scale at tens of kilometers and several assumptions and simplifications the model application requires uniform aquaculture layout covering a typical surface more than tens of kilometer square which makes sanggou bay an ideal site due to its homogeneous and dense aquaculture distribution a fully spatial coupled ecosystem model e g filgueira et al 2014 will better reproduce the spatial distribution and the impact of scattered aquaculture layout however such a model usually requires more stringent boundary conditions and validation data and the model configuration is often specific to a localization and less general it is reasonable to choose a more effective simulation method based on actual aquaculture and environment conditions the lack of synchronized and continuous observations during the ecosystem model simulation periods hinders the further calibration and optimization of the model however to obtain continuous data is not easy as this depends significantly on the sampling difficulty measurement accuracy and local aquaculture production processes sustaining data acquisition and continuous monitoring are required for model optimization the improvement of the individual models relies on the progress of the physiological and ecological research describing the process of nutrient absorption kinetics filter feeding dynamics and population dynamics 5 conclusion the sanggou bay provides an excellent site to apply model study on the ecosystem controlled by commercial scale aquaculture the present ecosystem model generally reproduced seasonal variation of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phytoplankton concentrations the predicted oyster and kelp growth validated well with observations scenario simulations showed that 50 cultured oysters per meter square is the optimal choice which comply with the current practical aquaculture the model also concluded that the nutrient source for the kelp aquaculture in the bay was mainly from the adjacent sea moreover in the region with inadequate nutrient supply the kelp production was approaching the carrying capacity the model can be a useful tool for integrated aquaculture management and spatial planning credit authorship contribution statement l i n fan conceptualization methodology
