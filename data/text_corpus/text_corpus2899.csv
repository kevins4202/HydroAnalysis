14495,eutectic freeze crystallization efc can be used to recover several resources from wastewater streams by operating at sub zero temperatures where both ice and salts form the type of salt the amount formed and the salt purity at these conditions will determine the potential profit for a specific wastewater composition while thermodynamic modelling has been shown to accurately predict the type of salt and yield of this salt it has not been used to predict the potential financial benefits of a wastewater when operating under efc conditions in this paper a generic equation and procedure is developed to estimate the potential financial benefits for three different types of waste waters an ro brine sea water and stored urine this methodology is aimed at equipping engineers with a valuable tool to be used as a means of determining the preliminary feasibility of an efc process without having to run sophisticated and time consuming experiments if shown to be profitable a more detailed kinetic study can be conducted to facilitate the detailed technical design and a cost benefit analysis of utilising an efc process for a specific type of wastewater can be perfomed keywords desalination fertilizers ice concentration operating cost salts 1 introduction the desalination of seawater and the reuse recycling of wastewaters are critical for supplementing the increasing global demands for fresh water the numerous advantages of reverse osmosis ro has made it the dominant desalination technology producing 74 of the global desalination capacity 1 however a major drawback to more widespread adoption of ro is that it produces a highly concentrated brine waste that is either disposed of in the ocean in the case of seawater desalination 2 or in evaporation ponds in the case of inland treatment plants 3 improper disposal of these brines can pollute groundwater 4 the seawater feed to an ro process could also be contaminated with bacteria and pharmaceuticals if sewage is discharged into the ocean and this could result in contaminated process water 5 a more sustainable approach would be to recover and recycle the multitude of potential value added resources energy materials fertilizers etc in addition to the water 6 which is by and large the primary objective from various waste streams for example the brines from ro plants are rich in useful salts that could be used to produce valuable products this approach of resource recovery from waste waters would ultimately create a more sustainable and circular economy in addition to water and resource recovery from sea water and ro brines urine could also be used to produce water and salts using crystallization technologies 7 a recent review has described urine as the liquid gold of wastewater because of the value it holds in terms of valuable resources that could be recovered 8 for example urine can produce an extensive range of fertilizers which could ultimately reduce the need to mine for these resources freeze crystallization could also be used to recover water in the form of ice from all these wastewater streams researchers have also described using freeze crystallization processes for the treatment of sea water 9 10 while a hybrid ro and freeze crystallization process could be used for maximum water production at reduced costs 11 13 in general freeze crystallization is an energy efficient process because the heat of freezing is almost 7 times less when compared to the latent heat of evaporation 14 if wastewaters are cooled to low enough temperatures salt begins to crystallize along with ice at the eutectic point this process is called eutectic freeze crystallization efc and is described in more detail in a 2015 review paper 11 essentially as the ice and individual salts sequentially crystallize out at their respective eutectic temperatures the two solids species ice and salt can be separated based on their density differences owing to the unique property of ice being less dense than liquid water and the salt s this means that salts can be selectively removed from wastewaters by operating cascading crystallizers at different temperatures to date efc has successfully been used to treat the following streams sodium sulfate 15 copper sulfate 16 magnesium sulfate 17 and a kno3 hno3 ternary system 18 eutectic freeze crystallization conditions have also been achieved using cool air 19 thus reducing the energy demand even further however these results have to a large extent only been demonstrated at either laboratory or pilot scale though in 2017 a full scale 750 000 l day efc plant was constructed at a coal mine in south africa for the treatment of a mining wastewater 20 this is the first efc plant of its kind in the world which has been used to successfully demonstrate the technology at a large scale the aqueous chemistry of wastewaters is inherently complex owing to its multicomponent nature predicting which salts can be recovered and from any specific wastewater without the need for performing laboratory scale experimental work would greatly expedite the process of ascertaining the economic feasibility of treating the wastewater in question towards generating value through resource recovery this can be achieved by using aqueous thermodynamic modelling tools to predict freezing temperatures of individual salts and yields macedonio and co workers 21 modelled a brine generated from an ro plant in order to determine which salts would crystallise out and the order in which they would crystallize out they then applied membrane crystallization to the brine in order to recover nacl and showed that the experimental results agreed well with the simulation results phase diagrams can be used as a tool to predict the components present in wastewaters at specific conditions temperature and concentration fernández torres and co workers give a good explanation of how binary phase diagrams can be used to understand the efc process 22 however phase diagrams are limited in that they cannot be applied to systems with multiple components for example binary phase diagrams h2o salt only show thermodynamic data for one salt while a ternary phase diagram shows the data for two salts a quaternary phase diagram can be used to show the phases present with 4 different ions in solution phase diagrams are therefore limited in their applicability conversely more advanced thermodynamic modelling software can be used to predict which salts will form and their yields as a function of the system operating conditions 15 the use of software such as oli stream analyser can accurately model efc systems lewis and co workers 15 first used oli to predict which salts would crystallize from wastewaters operating under efc conditions while randall developed a brine treatment protocol for efc incorporating three major steps brine analysis thermodynamic modelling and kinetic investigations involving experimental work 23 lewis 15 designed a preliminary efc process using thermodynamic modelling results however the link between these thermodynamic results and basic operating costs is currently limited this paper presents a method for predicting which resources can be recovered from three common wastewater streams an ro brine seawater and stored urine along with this a procedure for determining the potential profits of an efc process to treat these streams is also presented the generic method developed in this paper is aimed at equipping engineers with a valuable tool to be used as a means of determining the preliminary feasibility of an efc process without having to run sophisticated and time consuming experiments this method will provide the first step before more detailed designs and costing estimations are conducted 2 material and methods 2 1 analysis the brine treatment protocol specifically developed for the treatment of wastewaters using efc by randall 23 and was adopted for this study the first step of the protocol involves a detailed analysis of the major ions present in the aqueous stream it is important that the ion balance between cations and anions is less than 10 to ensure accurate thermodynamic modelling results are obtained 23 in the event of an ion imbalance the dominant ion addition method of balancing was used the compositions of the three different streams i e an ro brine seawater and stored urine that were used in this study are given in table 1 it was assumed that sea water was a type of waste water since it needs to be desalinated to produce fresh water 2 2 thermodynamic modelling firstly the typical information that can be obtained from phase diagrams needs to be understood fig 1 a shows a binary na2so4 h2o phase diagram with the vertical coloured line representing a fixed composition of 6 wt this line can be visualized as the recovery of ice the percentage of pure ice relative to the initial amount of water fig 1b and of na ions in solid form fig 1c but also as a combined graph with temperature now on the x axis fig 1d and ice and na2so4 10h2o on the y axis the temperature where both ice and salt begin to crystallize represents the eutectic temperature in this instance 1 1 c this revised method of visualizing a fixed concentration within a binary phase diagrams can be used to visualize any complex wastewater as shown in fig 4 the recovery of ice for this system is never 100 because 10 mol of water are used to produce na2so4 10h2o this approach is used for all subsequent graphs and calculations in this paper oli stream analyzer 27 was used to generate data for the thermodynamic graphs presented in this paper the thermodynamic software package uses the revised helgeson kirkham flowers hkf model for the calculation of standard thermodynamic properties of aqueous species as well as the frameworks of bromley zemaitis pitzer debye huckel 15 and more details of how the software works is described by randall 23 the analysis of any aqueous stream in terms of cations and anions should theoretically be equal in terms of molar concentrations in reality this is not the case due to limitations in analytical methods however before thermodynamic modelling of a stream can be conducted it is a prerequisite to balance the molar concentration of cations and anions one of the methods of doing this in oli stream analyser 27 is to use the dominant ion balancing method whereby the charge imbalance is resolved by adding exactly the correct amount of the dominant species of either the cation or anion depending on which of these is deficient such that the molar concentration of anions equals the molar concentration of cations for example 2633 g m 3 na ions were added to the ro brine while 496 g m 3 nh4 ions were added to the stored urine stream table 1 to obtain a charge balance for these streams 2 3 profit and operating cost estimations accurately determining the economic viability of an efc process would need to take a number of items in account such as capex opex financing costs etc however the purposes of the paper is to provide a quick method for establishing indicative costs to inform the decision of whether to choose an efc process or not for an efc process the energy requirement for cooling a wastewater down to a specific operating temperature is a major contributor to the overall operating cost and hence the economic feasibility of the process a lower operating temperature requires a greater cooling capacity and therefore consumes more energy as shown in fig 2 fig 2 also shows the capital costs for the cooling units but these are only provided for comparison purposes and were not used for the calculations in this study since it does not focus on capital cost estimations a linear trendline was fitted to the data in fig 2 such that the power consumption could be directly linked to the operating temperature the generic equation under these conditions 0 to 30 c is defined as follows 1 pc 0 069 t 1 3325 where pc is the power consumption in units kw m 3 and t is the crystallization temperature in units c the thermodynamic results such as operating temperature masses of salts and ice corresponding power consumption obtained from eq 1 price of electricity and sale price for the products can then be used to calculate the economic benefit as a function of the operating temperature fig 3 shows a process flow for these calculations the dotted blue line indicates the feedback loop such that a maximum economic benefit is obtained as a function of the operating temperature the choice of refrigeration unit is merely used to determine the capital cost of the cooling equipment required the following calculations were used to calculate the economic benefit for a specific operating temperature 2 eb sp mp pc ec where eb economic benefit usd sp sale price usd t mp mass of product t m 3 obtained from thermodynamic modelling ec electricity cost usd kwh assumed to be 1 usd kwh 28 the sale price for the various components formed for the ro brine seawater and stored urine operating under efc conditions is given in table 2 importantly hydrous salts form during efc na2so4 10h2o nacl 2h2o etc but the commercial products are generally anhydrous salts therefore for the purposes of all calculations in this paper the masses of these salts were adjusted to the equivalent anhydrous mass the energy requirement for drying these salts was not considered in the calculations and these costs would have to be considered in the final design the calculations for eb were performed in microsoft excel with thermodynamic data obtained from oli stream analyzer 27 a sample spreadsheet for the ro brine for a temperature range 0 c to 5 c is given in the supplementary information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 resource recovery under eutectic freeze crystallization conditions it is useful to predict what resources can be recovered during efc for different streams since these can be used to determine the profitability of the process fig 4 shows the predictions of various resources that can be recovered under efc conditions for a ro brine fig 4a stored urine fig 4b and sea water fig 4c in the temperature range 0 to 30 c a comparison between the different streams show the difference in components that could theoretically form under efc conditions along with the crystallization temperatures and yields a list of compounds and their corresponding crystallization temperatures are given in table s2 the dominant species for the ro brine and seawater examples are very similar the results only differ in terms of individual species crystallization temperatures and their yields for example a significant amount of na2so4 10h2o will crystallize from the ro brine at a relatively high operating temperature 1 4 c in comparison to the sea water stream that has a relatively low yield of this salt 9 g from 6 2 c until about 23 8 c after which the yield begins to decrease the salt yields for the stored urine are considerably less 15 g than yields for the ro brine and seawater streams 45 g this is because stored urine is more dilute and hence the quantity of solids is much lower however when comparing the yields of ice obtained from the urine stream and the ro brine stream these were found to be very similar whereas the yield of ice from the seawater stream was less importantly salts can be trapped in the ice thus reducing the recovery of these salts the efficiency of separation of ice salt should be considered during the design of the crystallization equipment the thermodynamic results also help determine the theoretical purity of the salts formed under efc conditions for example for the ro brine the most abundant salt that forms in the temperature range 1 4 c to 24 c crystallizes together with caso4 2h2o but the quantities of caso4 2h2o are much lower and hence the purity of na2so4 10h2o is always above 98 in reality salt seeding could be utilised to increase the purity of the desired salt by selectively forcing it to crystallize instead of the undesired salt 30 this is important as is shown in fig 4b with the stored urine stream in the temperature range of 22 c to 30 c where many salts form thus resulting in a highly contaminated product importantly the thermodynamic results show the value of being able to predict the range of salts that can be recovered under efc conditions and consequently provides an indispensable tool to help with the design process importantly by using the design information generated in this process engineers would be better equipped to carry out quick feasibility checks on using efc without having to perform detailed designs and calculations 3 2 using thermodynamic modelling to evaluate the benefits of manipulating system aqueous chemistry towards improving the efc economics the manipulation of the aqueous chemistry of an efc process can be used to raise the efc crystallization operating temperature through the addition of specific reagents that generate an alternative salt with a higher crystallization temperature this can improve the overall economic viability of efc and is described in a patent by lewis and nathoo 31 the results of adding an acid to stored urine to improve the yields and increase the operating temperatures is given in fig 5 a for example the addition of hcl or h2so4 to stored urine can increase the yields of ammonium bicarbonate fig 5b ammonium chloride fig 5c and sodium sulfate fig 5d notwithstanding the additional cost of raising the ph back up to neutral the addition of an acid to any stream operated under efc conditions will increase the crystallization temperature of several salts and hence reduce the energy demand and by extension the cost the addition of an acid helps shift the speciation of certain anions for example bicarbonate ions are dominant in low ph ranges while carbonate ions are dominant in high ph ranges hence when an acid is added to streams with carbonate ions the bicarbonate ion will be the dominant ion see fig 5b surprisingly the addition of h2so4 results in a greater quantity of nh4cl even though the anion so4 2 is not common similarly hcl leads to a greater quantity of na2so4 10h2o even though the anion cl is not common the addition of an acid can also help improve the purity of the salts recovered in a specific temperature range by reducing the number of components that crystallize out particularly in instances where two or more salts have crystallization temperatures that are very close to one another as mentioned although the addition of an acid has some obvious advantages the cost implication of adding a reagent to the process needs to be carefully considered to ensure the overall financial feasibility of the process in addition the overall sustainability of the process for adding an acid would also have to be considered ideally no additional chemicals should be added to the efc process but if there is an economic incentive to do so this might be warranted 3 3 economic benefit as a function of temperature having knowledge of the operating conditions e g temperatures and salt yields which informs the process design capital and operating costs and ultimately the feasibility of using efc for any industrial process or wastewater treatment process is essential in particular the operating temperature is directly related to the crystallization temperature during a cooling process in the efc process and informs the design and cost of the refrigeration system which is a significant contributor to the overall capital cost of the equipment and by far the largest operating cost contributor through its electricity requirement therefore in developing a feasibility determination protocol a means of quickly determining the temperatures and yields is required this can be achieved via the thermodynamic modelling of any wastewater stream for example the thermodynamic modelling of the ro brine and sea water fig 6 shows the direct relationship between the operating temperature and the potential profits along with an indication of what components form we see that the ro brine theoretically generates a much higher economic benefit 300 usd h at 23 c than the seawater stream 110 usd h at 23 c predominantly because of the greater yields of na2so4 10h2o as previously shown in fig 4 in this instance when an additional salt forms nacl 2h2o the economic benefit increases but the purity of the product s would have to be considered because two salts would be forming at these conditions fig 6b shows the economic benefit between sea water no acid addition and seawater with h2so4 addition it can be seen that the addition of an acid initially results in a significant decrease in profit 300 up to the temperature 9 8 c where the process breaks even thereafter the difference in economic benefit between adding acid and not adding the acid is 52 at a temperature of 22 8 c the economic benefit decreases at lower temperatures once nacl 2h2o forms because na ions are now used to produce this salt instead of sodium sulfate and sodium chloride is less valuable than sodium sulfate importantly the costing calculation methodology presented in this paper only considers the operating costs and not the capital cost of the process that would have to be paid off over time nonetheless this procedure provides valuable data for a first estimation of the economic benefit of an efc process the costing calculations do not take into account energy saving initiatives such as cooling the incoming brine with outgoing ice and using the ice as a heat sink for the refrigeration system this would further reduce the energy requirements and should be considered during the design of the refrigeration system as this would improve the economic viability of the process the procedure developed in this paper can also be utilised to estimate the operating costs of a hybrid ro efc process on the basis that it is generally cheaper to operate an efc process using a feed solution that is near the eutectic temperature 11 furthermore an iterative process can be adopted whereby through the modelling process different degrees of concentration to determine the optimal operating conditions can be investigated 3 4 kinetic considerations the results in the preceding sections show the potency of applying thermodynamic modelling for establishing preliminary cost estimations for an efc process however thermodynamic models do not consider the kinetics of the system i e the rates of crystallization this can be determined experimentally or by using kinetics crystallization methods 32 fig 7 shows the thermodynamic ice and salt lines for a binary na2so4 h2o system as well as various crystallization points that were obtained experimentally theoretically ice crystallization should have started immediately after the thermodynamic ice line but it starts at much lower temperatures this is because the crystallization process is stochastic in nature and therefore homogeneous nucleation primary nucleation occurs within a wide range of temperatures in a region defined as the metastable zone width 33 which cannot be thermodynamically predicted in addition the region defined as the eutectic metastable zone width can produce ice or salt or both by adding the relevant seed material to a solution at these conditions this selective seeding method would then result in the spontaneous crystallization of the component added 30 as is shown by the addition of an ice seed in fig 7 selective seeding is also useful for only crystallizing one salt when two salts can thermodynamically form for example randall and co workers showed that selective seeding could be used to produce single salts in the ternary na2so4 mgso4 h2o system 30 aspects such as the temperature driving force degree of agitation and residence time are other important aspects to consider during actual efc operation 34 and these are not considered by thermodynamic modelling while the results presented in fig 7 are for a binary system similar trends in terms of supercooling would be observed for more complex systems we suggest detailed experimental work be conducted that focuses on the kinetics of these system essentially the kinetics of an efc should always be considered for any final design 4 conclusions the increasing use of desalination as one of the key processes for the provision of water is an inevitability consequently creating additional value through the beneficiation of resources in the brine waste becomes an imperative from a sustainability perspective as well as a means of offsetting the treatment costs the recovery of several salts from three different streams ro brine sea water and stored urine has been shown to be thermodynamically feasible when operating under efc conditions the application of a generic power consumption equation for sub zero temperatures is useful for determining the economic benefit of an efc process also the addition of acids to different efc streams can help increase the economic benefit of the process by producing more salts and at higher temperatures ultimately the method developed and described here will help engineers determine the feasibility of an efc process for

estimations are conducted 2 material and methods 2 1 analysis the brine treatment protocol specifically developed for the treatment of wastewaters using efc by randall 23 and was adopted for this study the first step of the protocol involves a detailed analysis of the major ions present in the aqueous stream it is important that the ion balance between cations and anions is less than 10 to ensure accurate thermodynamic modelling results are obtained 23 in the event of an ion imbalance the dominant ion addition method of balancing was used the compositions of the three different streams i e an ro brine seawater and stored urine that were used in this study are given in table 1 it was assumed that sea water was a type of waste water since it needs to be desalinated to produce fresh water 2 2 thermodynamic modelling firstly the typical information that can be obtained from phase diagrams needs to be understood fig 1 a shows a binary na2so4 h2o phase diagram with the vertical coloured line representing a fixed composition of 6 wt this line can be visualized as the recovery of ice the percentage of pure ice relative to the initial amount of water fig 1b and of na ions in solid form fig 1c but also as a combined graph with temperature now on the x axis fig 1d and ice and na2so4 10h2o on the y axis the temperature where both ice and salt begin to crystallize represents the eutectic temperature in this instance 1 1 c this revised method of visualizing a fixed concentration within a binary phase diagrams can be used to visualize any complex wastewater as shown in fig 4 the recovery of ice for this system is never 100 because 10 mol of water are used to produce na2so4 10h2o this approach is used for all subsequent graphs and calculations in this paper oli stream

standard thermodynamic properties of aqueous species as well as the frameworks of bromley zemaitis pitzer debye huckel 15 and more details of how the software works is described by randall 23 the analysis of any aqueous stream in terms of cations and anions should theoretically be equal in terms of molar concentrations in reality this is not the case due to limitations in analytical methods however before thermodynamic modelling of a stream can be conducted it is a prerequisite to balance the molar concentration of cations and anions one of the methods of doing this in oli stream analyser 27 is to use the dominant ion balancing method whereby the charge imbalance is resolved by adding exactly the correct amount of the dominant species of either the cation or anion depending on which of these is deficient such that the molar concentration of anions equals the molar concentration of cations for example 2633 g m 3 na ions were added to the ro brine while 496 g m 3 nh4 ions were added to the stored urine stream table 1 to obtain a charge balance for these streams 2 3 profit and operating cost estimations accurately determining the economic viability of an efc process would need to take a number of items in account such as capex opex financing costs etc however the purposes of the paper is to provide a quick method for establishing indicative costs to inform the decision of whether to choose an efc process or not for an efc process the energy requirement for cooling a wastewater down to a specific operating temperature is a major contributor to the overall operating cost and hence the economic feasibility of the process a lower operating temperature requires a greater cooling capacity and therefore consumes more energy as shown in fig 2 fig 2 also shows the capital costs for the cooling units but these are only provided for comparison purposes and were not used for the calculations in this study since it does not focus on capital cost estimations a linear trendline was fitted to the data in fig 2 such that the power consumption could be directly linked to the operating temperature the generic equation under these conditions 0 to 30 c is defined

salts and ice corresponding power consumption obtained from eq 1 price of electricity and sale price for the products can then be used to calculate the economic benefit as a function of the operating temperature fig 3 shows a process flow for these calculations the dotted blue line indicates the feedback loop such that a maximum economic benefit is obtained as a function of the operating

na2so4 10h2o nacl 2h2o etc but the commercial products are generally anhydrous salts therefore for the purposes of all calculations in this paper the masses of these salts were adjusted to the equivalent anhydrous mass the energy requirement for drying these salts was not considered in the calculations and these costs would have to be considered in the final design the calculations for eb were performed in microsoft excel with thermodynamic data obtained from oli stream analyzer 27 a sample spreadsheet for the ro brine for a temperature range 0 c to 5 c is given in the supplementary information table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 resource recovery under eutectic freeze crystallization conditions it is useful to predict what resources can be recovered during efc for different streams since these can be used to determine the profitability of the process fig 4 shows the predictions of various resources that can be recovered under efc conditions for a ro brine fig 4a stored urine fig 4b and sea water fig 4c in the temperature range 0 to 30 c a comparison between the different streams show the difference in components that could theoretically form under efc conditions along with the crystallization temperatures and yields a list of compounds and their corresponding crystallization temperatures are given in table s2 the dominant species for the ro brine and seawater examples are very similar the results only differ in terms of individual species crystallization temperatures and their yields for example a significant amount of na2so4 10h2o will crystallize from the ro brine at a relatively high operating temperature 1 4 c in comparison to the sea water stream that has a relatively low yield of this salt 9 g from 6 2 c until about 23 8 c after which the yield begins to decrease the salt yields for the stored urine are considerably less 15 g than yields for the ro brine and seawater streams 45 g this is because stored urine is more dilute and hence the quantity of solids is much lower however when comparing the yields of ice obtained from the urine stream and the ro brine stream these were found to be very similar whereas the yield of ice from the seawater stream was less importantly salts can be trapped in the ice thus reducing the recovery of these salts the efficiency of separation of ice salt should be considered during the design of the crystallization equipment the thermodynamic results also help determine the theoretical purity of the salts formed under efc conditions for example for the ro brine the most abundant salt that forms in the temperature range 1 4 c to 24 c crystallizes together with caso4 2h2o but the quantities of caso4 2h2o are much lower and hence the purity of na2so4 10h2o is always above 98 in reality salt seeding could be utilised to increase the purity of the desired salt by selectively forcing it to crystallize instead of the undesired salt 30 this is important as is shown in fig 4b with the stored urine stream in the temperature range of 22 c to 30 c where many salts form thus resulting in a highly contaminated product importantly the thermodynamic results show the value of being able to predict the range of salts that can be recovered under efc conditions and consequently provides an indispensable tool to help with the design process importantly by using the design information generated in this process engineers would be better equipped to carry out quick feasibility checks on using efc without having to perform detailed designs and calculations 3 2 using thermodynamic modelling to evaluate the benefits of manipulating system aqueous chemistry towards improving the efc economics the manipulation of the aqueous chemistry of an efc process can be used to raise the efc crystallization operating temperature through the addition of specific reagents that generate an alternative salt with a higher crystallization temperature this can improve the overall economic viability of efc and is described in a patent by lewis and nathoo 31 the results of adding an acid to stored urine to improve the yields and increase the operating temperatures is given in fig 5 a for example the addition of hcl or h2so4 to stored urine can increase the yields of ammonium bicarbonate fig 5b ammonium chloride fig 5c and sodium sulfate fig 5d notwithstanding the additional cost of raising the ph back up to neutral the addition of an acid to any stream operated under efc conditions will increase the crystallization temperature of several salts and hence reduce the energy demand and by extension the cost the addition of an acid helps shift the speciation of certain anions for example bicarbonate ions are dominant in low ph ranges while carbonate ions are dominant in high ph ranges hence when an acid is added to streams with carbonate ions the bicarbonate ion will be the dominant ion see fig 5b surprisingly the addition of h2so4 results in a greater quantity of nh4cl even though the anion so4 2 is not common similarly hcl leads to a greater quantity of na2so4 10h2o even though the anion cl is not common the addition of an acid can also help improve the purity of the salts recovered in a specific temperature range by reducing the number of components that crystallize out particularly in instances where two or more salts have crystallization temperatures that are very close to one another as mentioned although the addition of an acid has some obvious advantages the cost implication of adding a reagent to the process needs to be carefully considered to ensure the overall financial feasibility of the process in addition the overall sustainability of the process for adding an acid would also have to be considered ideally no additional chemicals should be added to the efc process but if there is an economic incentive to do so this might be warranted 3 3 economic benefit as a function of temperature having knowledge of the operating conditions e g temperatures and salt yields which informs the process design capital and operating costs and ultimately the feasibility of using efc for any industrial process or wastewater treatment process is essential in particular the operating temperature is directly related to the crystallization temperature during a cooling process in the efc process and informs the design and cost of the refrigeration system which is a significant contributor to the overall capital cost of the equipment and by far the largest operating cost contributor through its electricity requirement therefore in developing a feasibility determination protocol a means of quickly determining the temperatures and yields is required this can be achieved via the thermodynamic modelling of any wastewater stream for example the thermodynamic modelling of the ro brine and sea water fig 6 shows the direct relationship between the operating temperature and the potential profits along with an indication of what components form we see that the ro brine theoretically generates a much higher economic benefit 300 usd h at 23 c than the seawater stream 110 usd h at 23 c predominantly because of the greater yields of na2so4 10h2o as previously shown in fig 4 in this instance when an additional salt forms nacl 2h2o the economic benefit increases but the purity of the product s would have to be considered because two salts would be forming at these conditions fig 6b shows the economic benefit between sea water no acid addition and seawater with h2so4 addition it can be seen that the addition of an acid initially results in a significant decrease in profit 300 up to the temperature 9 8 c where the process breaks even thereafter the difference in economic benefit between adding acid and not adding the acid is 52 at a temperature of 22 8 c the economic benefit decreases at lower temperatures once nacl 2h2o forms because na ions are now used to produce this salt instead of sodium sulfate and sodium chloride is less valuable than sodium sulfate importantly the costing calculation methodology presented in this paper only considers the operating costs and not the capital cost of the process that would have to be paid off over time nonetheless this procedure provides valuable data for a first estimation of the economic benefit of an efc process the costing calculations do not take into account energy saving initiatives such as cooling the incoming brine with outgoing ice and using the ice as a heat sink for the refrigeration system this would further reduce the energy requirements and should be considered during the design of the refrigeration system as this would improve the economic viability of the process the procedure developed in this paper can also be utilised to estimate the operating costs of a hybrid ro efc process on the basis that it is generally cheaper to operate an efc process using a feed solution that is near the eutectic temperature 11 furthermore an iterative process can be adopted whereby through the modelling process different degrees of concentration to determine the optimal operating conditions can be investigated 3 4 kinetic considerations the results in the preceding sections show the potency of applying thermodynamic modelling for establishing preliminary cost estimations for an efc process however thermodynamic models do not consider the kinetics of the system i e the rates of crystallization this can be determined experimentally or by using kinetics crystallization methods 32 fig 7 shows the thermodynamic ice and salt lines for a binary na2so4 h2o system as well as various crystallization points that were obtained experimentally theoretically ice crystallization should have started immediately after the thermodynamic ice line but it starts at much lower temperatures this is because the crystallization process is stochastic in nature and therefore homogeneous nucleation primary nucleation occurs within a wide range of temperatures in a region defined as the metastable zone width 33 which cannot be thermodynamically predicted in addition the region defined as the eutectic metastable zone width can produce ice or salt or both by adding the relevant seed material to a solution at these conditions this selective seeding method would then result in the spontaneous crystallization of the component added 30 as is shown by the addition of an ice seed in fig 7 selective seeding is also useful for only crystallizing one salt when two salts can thermodynamically form for example randall and co workers showed that selective seeding could be used to produce single salts in the ternary na2so4 mgso4 h2o system 30 aspects such as the temperature driving force degree of agitation and residence time are other important aspects to consider during actual efc operation 34 and these are not considered by thermodynamic modelling while the results presented in fig 7 are for a binary system similar trends in terms of supercooling would be observed for more complex systems we suggest detailed experimental work be conducted that focuses on the kinetics of these system essentially the kinetics of an efc should always be considered for any final design 4 conclusions the increasing use of desalination as one of the key processes for the provision of water is an inevitability consequently creating additional value through the beneficiation of resources in the brine waste becomes an imperative from a sustainability perspective as well as a means of offsetting the treatment costs the recovery of several salts from three different streams ro brine sea water and stored urine has been shown to be thermodynamically feasible when operating under efc conditions the application of a generic power consumption equation for sub zero temperatures is useful for determining the economic benefit of an efc process also the addition of acids to different efc streams can help increase the economic benefit of the process by producing more salts and at higher temperatures ultimately the method developed and described here will help engineers determine the feasibility of an efc process for

14496,microalgae is considered the most promising source of oils for biodiesel production beside microalgae contain proteins and pigments which have large applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries combining the cultivation of microalgae for the production of these compounds with wastewater treatment renders the overall process very attractive and economically feasible however the selection of the most suitable application to be coupled with the wastewater treatment depends on the composition of the harvested microalgae in the present work the effectiveness of chlorella sp for the degradation of p cresol have been evaluated at a concentration ranging from 35 to 330 mg l the effect of initial concentration on the contaminants removal biomass productivity and the chemical composition of microalgae has been determined results shows that chlorella sp can degrade p cresol at concentration up to 330 mg l and use it for biomass growth biochemical assay showed an improvement in the lipid productivity at higher concentrations combined with the reduction in the protein content the highest pigment composition was obtained at the optimum biomass growth at 150 mg l these results give deep understanding of the factors that must be considered when integrating wastewater treatment with using the harvested biomass in other applications keywords microalgae cresols chemical composition wastewater treatment 1 introduction wastewater discharged from refineries contain high concentrations of cresols in the range of 99 130 mg l table 1 1 several techniques have been tested for the removal of cresols from refinery wastewater including physical chemical and biological methods 2 3 compared to other techniques biological treatment is less expensive more environmental friendly and leads to complete mineralization of the toxic compounds 4 due to their higher contaminants biodegradation rates bacteria has been the most commonly used microorganism in biological treatment units 5 despite the successful use of fungi 6 and yeasts 7 however the bacteria commonly used for cresols removal such as pseudomonas putida are pathogenic in addition the collected biomass after the treatment does not have a clear economic value some strains of microalgae on the other hand have shown good capacity to utilize toxic compounds including phenols as a source of carbon and energy among these were fresh water strains such as chlorella sp 9 and scenedesmus obliquus and 10 and marine strains nannochloropsis sp 11 using microalgae for removing phenols allows the utilization of the produced biomass for producing valuable compounds 12 including lipids for biodiesel production 12 14 and proteins and pigments for food and pharmaceutical applications due to their abundance and amino acid profile microalgae proteins have long been considered as an alternative protein source in foods more importantly these proteins have been tested as antitumor agents and shown promising results 15 microalgae pigments also have large applications in the pharmaceutical industries as antioxidant anticancer immune regulation and immune suppressive for example carotenoids can be used as pro vitamin a source antioxidant and anticancer 16 cresols are known to be more harmful compounds than phenol 17 in addition as shown in table 1 cresols are found in amounts higher 5 6 times than that of phenol in refinery wastewaters nevertheless most studies reported on the treatment of phenols using microalgae were done on phenol furthermore the study of the effect of the concentration of the cresols in the wastewater to be treated on the composition of the microalgae is lacking in literature this work provides a deep understanding of this effect which allows integrating the wastewater treatment with using the harvested biomass in other applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and culture medium two strains of microalgae namely freshwater chlorella sp and marine nannochloropsis sp were obtained from a local marine environment research center in umm al quwain uae the freshwater strain was cultivated in the modified bold bassel medium 3n bbm and the marine strain was grown in guillard f 2 medium as described in our previous publication 18 chemicals required for the preparation of the microalgae media synthetic wastewater analysis reagents and solvents

cresol koh naoh phenols standard pigment standard methanol acetone acetonitrile chloroform and ethanol 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 screening experiments screening experiments were first carried out on the biodegradation of p and o cresol to compare the general performances of freshwater and marine strains in these experiments two sets of 10 ml culture media 3n bbm and f 2 for freshwater and marine cultures respectively were prepared with initial biomass concentration of 1 18 0 16 106 cell ml containing chlorella sp or nannochloropsis sp with p and o cresols at an initial concentration of 95 mg l were used as a sole carbon source the concentration of the cresol used was similar to that of total cresols found in real refinery wastewater which was reported to be 99 mg l 8 the cultures

analysis whereas the harvested biomass were suspended in 10 ml distilled water to determine its concentration 2 2 2 biodegradation experiments in this section experiments were carried out on the treatment of p cresol using with chlorella sp cultures in 200 ml volume the cultures consisted of the 3n bbm medium with different concentrations of p cresol ranging from 95 to 330 mg l and inoculated with chlorella sp at an initial concentration of 1 18 0 16 x106 cell ml which corresponds to an optical density of 1 2771 the flasks were covered with cotton and placed in the same water bath at the same condition used in the screening experiment the flasks were subjected to sufficient light with a photoperiod of 12 h light 12 h dark control experiments were carried out using the same mixtures but without microalgae subjected to similar conditions on a daily basis 5 ml samples were collected and the microalgae cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min the supernatants were sent for cresols analysis whereas the harvested biomass were suspended in 5 ml distilled water to determine its concentration at the end of the experiment in day 5 the biomass was harvested by centrifugation and was analyzed for its proteins lipids carbohydrates and pigments contents 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 cresols analysis for measurement of residual cresols concentration the collected supernatant after centrifugation were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter and analyzed using hplc prostar varian usa equipped with uv vis detector operating at 280 nm and a c 18 column maintained at 45 c the analysis was performed using two mobile phases the gradient profile started with mobile phase consists of 30 methanol 70 water the ratio of the methanol was increased until reaching 100 the run time was about 30 min with flow rate of 1 ml min for the mobile phase mixture the instrument was calibrated using samples of standard cresols of known concentrations 2 3 2 biomass analysis the harvested cells were re suspended in distilled water and the biomass cell count concentration was determined using uv spectrophotometer uve1800 shimadzu japan at 680 nm the concentration cells ml was calculated from a pre prepared calibration curves of optical density vs cell concentration determined using neubauer hemocytometer placed on a nikon eclipse lv100 pol microscope 2 3 3 cells

were withdrawn and centrifuged the harvested cells were suspended in 0 2 ml of distilled and 0 4 ml of 40 w v koh were added the mixture was heated at 90 c for 1 h and after cooling to room temperature 1 2 ml ethanol was added and kept overnight at 20 c the sample was then centrifuged again and the harvested cells were re suspended in 1 5 ml distilled water and mixed with 0 8 ml of 75 h2so and 0 4 ml of anthrone reagent 2 g l in 75 h2so4 and then boiled at 100 c for 15 min after cooling the absorbance at 578 nm was recorded using a spectrophotometer a blank absorbance for each sample was read without the anthrone reagent the instrument was calibrated using serial dilutions of known concentrations of d glucose the proteins were determined using the microbiuret method 21 two aliquots of 0 1 ml of sample was centrifuged one as sample and one as blank the harvested cells were suspended in 1 ml 0 5 n naoh and kept at 80 c for 10 min the sample was then centrifuged and the supernatant was collected the process was repeated three times to make sure that all the proteins were extracted 0 05 ml of copper sulphate 0 21 cuso4 5h2o in 30 naoh was added to the 3 ml of the samples and optical density was measured at 310 nm the instrument was calibrated using serial dilutions of known concentrations of bovine serum albumin for lipids assay the harvested cells were re suspended in 20 μl phosphate buffer 0 05 m ph 7 4 and 0 48 ml solution of 25 methanol in 1 n naoh the mixture was ultrasonicated branson sonifier 450 usa for 10 min another 1 ml of the methanol in naoh solution was added and saponified by heating at 100 c for 30 min an aliquot of 0 5 ml was added to 0 75 ml of a solvent mixture chloroform methanol 2 1 v v and vortexed for 2 min the mixture was then centrifuged to get two phases the lower organic layer was collected and reacted with 1 m triethanolamine 1 n acetic acid 9 1 v v solution the sample were vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged to separate the sample in two layers the organic layer was collected and the absorptivity was measured at 260 nm the concentrations were determined by comparing the optical density to that of serial dilutions of known concentrations of standard fatty acids of carbon length c7 c18 2 3 4 pigments analysis the pigments content was determined using hplc equipped with the same column used for the cresols analysis the mobile phase consisted of two solvents solvent a acetonitrile methanol 60 40 and solvent b methanol ethyl acetate 70 30 the flow rate through the column was 1 3 ml min a gradient flow composition of mobile phase was used for best chromatographic results the mobile phase gradient started with 100 solvent a and changed to 100 solvent b in 8 min and kept in that composition for 7 min then returned to 100 a in 1 min it was then left at this composition for another 25 min to stabilize the column for next injection the sample injection volume was 20 μl and the wavelength was 436 nm the instrument was calibrated using serial dilution of standard pigments chlorophyll a and b and total carotenoids in acetone the calibration curve ranged between 0 005 μg ml to 5 μg ml was used 2 4 statistical analysis each experiment was performed in duplicate and the average values of the results were determined the accuracy of the experimental results was evaluated from the standard deviations shown as error bars in the figures to determine the significance of a factor the regression p value was calculated using anova test by minitab 16 statistical software minitab inc second order regression was selected for data that shows an increase then decrease behavior whereas linear regression was selected for data that has single trend 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioremoval of p and o cresols the work started with a screening test to compare the effectiveness of marine and freshwater strains in degrading p and o cresols the objective of this screening test was to find out whether one of the two strains may not grow in the cresols or show superior performance compared to the other as mentioned earlier the selected concentration was similar to that of total cresols found in real refinery wastewater 8 fig 1 a and b show the percentage removal of cresols and the concentration of the biomass after seven days x over the initial biomass concentration xo which was 1 18 106 cell ml respectively both strains were found to degrade almost the same percentage of p cresol within the 5 days the marine strain nannochloropsis sp showed a slightly better growth rate than the freshwater strain chlorella sp with o cresol the marine stain showed slightly better biodegradation performance but surprisingly its growth was lower as the cells use the degraded substrates for two functions namely production of new cells and maintenance of existing cells therefore these results suggest that with o cresol a smaller portion was directed towards nannochloropsis sp cells growth as compared to chlorella sp both strains performed almost equally well however chlorella sp growth and biodegradation were both better with p cresol than with o cresol all whereas with nannochloropsis sp the degradation of both types of cresols were similar but the growth was much better in p cresol therefore subsequent deeper investigations were selected to be conducted on chlorella sp using p cresol the work can be extended in the future to do deeper analyses on the other strain and the other cresol 3 2 biomass growth and cresols degradation the effect of cultivation of chlorella sp in 3n bbm medium of different initial p cresol concentrations ranging from 35 to 330 mg l was tested at initial biomass concertation xo of 1 18 106 cell ml temperature of 30 c and agitation of 110 rpm the changes in the cresol and the biomass growth presented as ln x xo over a period of five days are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively running a parallel experiment without microalgae showed minimal drop in the concentration over the five days which did not exceed 1 5 at the highest concentration of 330 mg l this proves that the drop on p cresol was mainly due to the bioactivity of the microalgae the biodegradation procedure of p cresol was proposed to go through two step process 22 in the first step the methyl group is split which could be converted to methanol and in the second the intermediately produced phenol is broken it should be noted that the data shown in figs 2 and 3 are average values of two runs the reproducibility of the data is confirmed from the small error bars shown in fig 2 the error bars in fig 3 were not shown to avoid overcrowding the graph but the average relative error was 7 6 the error bars for the growth can still be seen from the specific growth rate results shown in fig 4 it was clearly seen from fig 2 that except for the highest concentration of 330 mg l chlorella sp was capable of removing most of the p cresol within 4 days for concentrations up to 260 mg l chlorella sp was able to completely remove p cresol however concentrations higher than 260 mg l appeared to be inhibiting the microalgae capacity to degrade p cresols and at 330 mg l only 20 removal percentage was achieved within 5 days fig 3 shows that the microalgae was able to grow in all concentrations of p cresols but with different growth rates it was also noticed that as the initial concentration of p cresol increased the lag phase increased this was expected as the cells needed more time to adapt to the high substrate concentration as mentioned earlier the investigation of p cresol removal using microalgae was rarely studied and even in these limited studies the concentrations tested were much lower than those found in real refinery wastewater for example eukaryotic algae ochromonas danica was tested for the biodegradation of p cresol at initial concentrations in the range of 0 54 to 4 3 mg l the study showed complete removal of the p cresol in the concentration range within a maximum period of 12 days 23 green microalgae scenedesmus obliquus was also tested for the biodegradation but at even lower concentrations in the range 0 162 to 2 7 mg l 22 the effect of the initial substrate concentration on the percentage removal was shown to be significant dropping from 100 to 29 when the initial concentration was increased from 0 162 to 2 7 mg l 22 as the concentrations of p cresol in real refinery wastewater are order of magnitude higher than these tested ranges the importance of the results found in this study at the higher concentrations becomes more obvious table 2 shows comparison in p cresol biodegradation using several microorganisms at different initial concentration range filamentous fungal strain gliomastix indicus showed higher performance for p cresol removal than that of the tested microalgae in this work 24 at high concentrations of up to 700 mg l more than 90 p cresol was removed within about 4 days in a more recent study isolated bacteria from activated sludge were tested for p cresol biodegradation 25 results showed high applicability at initial concentration of p cresol biodegradation of 750 mg l within 100 h in addition a bacterial strain pseudomonas putida immobilized in pva gel was also used for the biodegradation of p cresol at concentrations range similar to the one used in this study 25 to 200 mg l 26 complete removal was achieved within only 40 min on the other hand using aerobic granulates a longer time was required to remove p cresol even at a low concentration 100 mg l 27 to better understand the behavior the biodegradation and specific growth rates were determined and the results are shown in fig 4 the biodegradation rate was determined from the slope of the straight line in the initial part of the degradation whereas the specific growth rate was determined from the slope of the logarithmic of x xo vs time in the exponential part after the lag period as expected it was found that both rates biodegradation and specific growth had similar trends when the growth rate increased the biodegradation rate increased and vice versa it was found that the growth rate of chlorella sp increased with increasing the initial concentration of p cresol up to 140 mg l at which the optimum growth rate of 2 17 0 17 day 1 was reached beyond that concentration the growth started to slightly drop at 210 mg l and then sharply dropped after that due to substrate inhibition similar behavior was observed for the p cresol degradation but the optimum drop was 51 51 mg l day at 210 mg l the effect of initial concentration on both the biodegradation rate and growth rate was significant with a p value of 0 05 the effect however was less significant on the growth rate with a p value of 0 085 this results agree with previous study done using the same strain for phenol degradation 29 the maximum biodegradation and growth rates were also obtained at an initial phenol concentration of 200 mg l the optimum drop rate was 54 5 mg l day which were very close but slightly higher than the one found in this work however a much lower growth rate of only 0 25 day 1 was reported in addition to using a different substrate the lower rate was due to the limited light intensity used in the previous study suggested to enhance the heterotrophic growth when p cresol biodegradation was tested using a green microalgae scenedesmus obliquus he highest bioremoval of 100 was achieved at initial concentration of 0 162 mg l at which the biomass concentration increased by 20 of the initial value 22 at higher concretions the growth was inhibited the results shown in fig 3 were used to determine the parameters of three growth models that incorporate limiting substrate inhibition kinetics the models used were haldane aiba and andrews given in eqs 1 3 respectively 1 μ μ m s o k s s o s o 2 k i 2 μ μ m s o k s s o exp s o k i 3 μ μ m k s s o 1 1 s o k i where μ and μm are the specific and maximum specific growth rates day 1 respectively so is the initial substrate concentration mg l and ks and ki are the substrate and inhibition constants mg l respectively the estimated values for the model kinetic parameters were determined by fitting non linear regression model using excel solver with an objective function o f given by eq 4 and shown in table 3 4 o f i n μ e x p μ p r e d 2 where μ e x p and μ p r e d are the experimental and model predicted specific growth rates from the values of the coefficient of determination r2 it can be seen that all three models fitted the data well with the aiba model being the best followed by the haldane model the goodness of the fitting can also be seen in fig 5 which shows the comparison between experimental data and models predictions the results show that the values of μm for all models were similar with that of the aiba model being relatively the highest the values of ks and ki of the haldane and andrews models were similar whereas those of the aiba model were higher no previous studies on the kinetics of microalgae biodegradation of p cresol are reported in open literature the only available ones are with other microorganisms such as bacteria and fungus for example kinetic of p cresol degradation by fungal strains gliomastix indicus have been studied using five several models 24 the values of μm of haldane aiba and andrews were 9 5 7 02 and 14 2 day 1 respectively which are close to the ones found in this work in addition similar to this work the highest value of μm was for aiba model however with the fungal strains the r2 values suggested that the haldane and andrews models represented the data better than aiba model 3 3 effect of p cresol on biochemical composition the most important aspect of this work was to determine the effect of the concentration of p cresol on the chemical composition of the harvested microalgae as mentioned earlier this is important information for the determination of the application to be coupled with the wastewater treatment microalga biomass with high lipid content could serve as a good feedstock for biodiesel production whereas the biomass with high protein content may be more suitable for pharmaceutical applications generally the composition of the growth medium affects the biochemical composition of microalgae cells by alternating of metabolic pathways in response to stress conditions 30 therefore at the end of the 5 days the biomass was collected and analyzed for proteins carbohydrates lipid and pigments content the percentage compositions of proteins carbohydrates and lipids are in fig 6 and those of the pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids are shown in fig 7 it was found that the lipids content increased with the increase in the p cresol concentration growing in medium containing no p cresol the lipids content was 8 9 this amount increased by 3 7 folds to 33 by growing for 5 days in medium containing an initial concentration of 330 mg l the effect of the initial concentration of p cresol on the lipid content was significant with a p value of 0 041 in contrast the proteins content decreased with the increase in p cresol concentration from 58 7 with no p cresol to 31 3 at 330 mg l the effect was also significant with a similar extent to that on of lipids with a p value of 0 044 no significant change was observed in the carbohydrate level this insignificant effect was also confirmed from the p value which was found to be 0 146 this finding suggests that for coupling wastewater treatment with biodiesel production it would be preferable to cultivate the microalgae in wastewaters containing high concentrations of p cresol whereas cultivation in low concentrations may be more suitable for coupling with proteins extraction the results found in this work agree with those found when the concentrations of nonylphenols bisphenol 17alpha ethynylestradiol and estradiol were increased in the media used for the cultivation of the marine diatom navicula incerta 31 it was also found that the proteins content declined with the increasing in all compounds the behavior of the lipids content was also similar showing an increase in the lipid contents with the increase in the concertation of the compounds in the media an increase in the lipids content in diatom skeletonema costatum was also observed by increasing the concentration of 2 4 dichlorophenol in the cultivating medium 32 however this was coupled with a decrease in carbohydrates content and the proteins showed no changes under environmental stress microalgae direct their pathways towards storing energy in the form of lipid instead of using it as source of growth 33 this was shown when chlorella maxicana was cultivated under stress of salinity showing an increase in lipids content from 23 to 37 as the nacl concentration increased from 0 43 to 25 mm 34 an increase in lipids was also observed when the cultures were stressed with nitrogen and phosphorus limitations 21 25 26 in addition previous studies confirmed the accumulation of lipids in chlorella pyrenoidosa when the cells are exposed to high phenol concentration and the lipid accumulation was increased with increasing the incubation period 12 increasing of lipid biosynthesis was also reported during phenol degradation in diatom bd1iitg cells 35 as shown in fig 7 chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and carotenoids composition were found to be highly dependent on the initial p cresol concentration it was found that the pigments concentration increased with the increase in p cresol concentration to reach a maximum at 140 mg l then stated to drop after that at low p cresol concentrations the contents of both chlorophylls a and b were higher than that of carotenoids the drop in chlorophylls content with the increase in p cresol concentration was more drastic that of carotenoids and above 250 mg l the carotenoids content started to exceed that of chlorophyll b chlorophyll a remained the main pigment under all tested concentrations of p cresols the effect of the initial p cresol was most significant on chlorophyll a with a p value of 0 093 followed by carotenoids with a p value of 0 118 and least significant on chlorophyll b with p value of 0 203 these results are related to the enhancement in the biomass growth that encourage algal cells to produce more pigments at concentration with highest biomass growth rate similar trend was also obtained when chlorella kessleri was cultivated in different concentrations of crude oils 36 with the maximum chlorophyll a and b contents achieved at the initial concentration that resulted in the highest biomass growth 36 however with scenedesmus obliquus the pigments production was found to decline with the increase in the initial concentration of crude oil having the highest chlorophyll a content at the lowest oil concentration 37 on the other hand no changes in chlorophylls content of diatoms navicula incerta 31 and skeletonema costatum 32 was observed with increasing the initial concentration of the endocrine disrupting chemicals to study the initial rate of the changes in proteins carbohydrates and pigments composition the experiment was repeated at the initial p cresol concentration of 190 mg l that showed the optimum degradation and growth rates in this experiment the cells composition was measured twice a day for a period of two days and the rate of the change was measured from the slope of the changes with time the results show that the drop rate of proteins was 15 4 per day a drop was also observed for carbohydrates but at a much lower rate of 7 3 per day the lipids show an increase with a rate of 19 1 per day 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the capacity of chlorella sp for the biological treatment of wastewater contaminated with p cresol the biodegradability and cell growth were found to be affected by the initial cresol concentration however the highest biomass productivity and biodegradation rate were obtained at initial p cresol of 150 and 200 mg l respectively the biodegradation kinetics were presented well by haldane aiba and andrews models with aiba model showing the best fit the biomass composition of chlorella sp was also found to be affected by the initial concentration of p cresol in the growth medium as the initial concentration increased the proteins reduced and the lipids increased whereas the carbohydrates remains constant the pigments content increased with the increase in p cresol concentration to reach a maximum at 150 mg l p cresol but then dropped at higher concentrations acknowledgement this work was supported by the emirates center for energy and environment research grant number 31r070 
14496,microalgae is considered the most promising source of oils for biodiesel production beside microalgae contain proteins and pigments which have large applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries combining the cultivation of microalgae for the production of these compounds with wastewater treatment renders the overall process very attractive and economically feasible however the selection of the most suitable application to be coupled with the wastewater treatment depends on the composition of the harvested microalgae in the present work the effectiveness of chlorella sp for the degradation of p cresol have been evaluated at a concentration ranging from 35 to 330 mg l the effect of initial concentration on the contaminants removal biomass productivity and the chemical composition of microalgae has been determined results shows that chlorella sp can degrade p cresol at concentration up to 330 mg l and use it for biomass growth biochemical assay showed an improvement in the lipid productivity at higher concentrations combined with the reduction in the protein content the highest pigment composition was obtained at the optimum biomass growth at 150 mg l these results give deep understanding of the factors that must be considered when integrating wastewater treatment with using the harvested biomass in other applications keywords microalgae cresols chemical composition wastewater treatment 1 introduction wastewater discharged from refineries contain high concentrations of cresols in the range of 99 130 mg l table 1 1 several techniques have been tested for the removal of cresols from refinery wastewater including physical chemical and biological methods 2 3 compared to other techniques biological treatment is less expensive more environmental friendly and leads to complete mineralization of the toxic compounds 4 due to their higher contaminants biodegradation rates bacteria has been the most commonly used microorganism in biological treatment units 5 despite the successful use of fungi 6 and yeasts 7 however the bacteria commonly used for cresols removal such as pseudomonas putida are pathogenic in addition the collected biomass after the treatment does not have a clear economic value some strains of microalgae on the other hand have shown good capacity to utilize toxic compounds including phenols as a source of carbon and energy among these were fresh water strains such as chlorella sp 9 and scenedesmus obliquus and 10 and marine strains nannochloropsis sp 11 using microalgae for removing phenols allows the utilization of the produced biomass for producing valuable compounds 12 including lipids for biodiesel production 12 14 and proteins and pigments for food and pharmaceutical applications due to their abundance and amino acid profile microalgae proteins have long been considered as an alternative protein source in foods more importantly these proteins have been tested as antitumor agents and shown promising results 15 microalgae pigments also have large applications in the pharmaceutical industries as antioxidant anticancer immune regulation and immune suppressive for example carotenoids can be used as pro vitamin a source antioxidant and anticancer 16 cresols are known to be more harmful compounds than phenol 17 in addition as shown in table 1 cresols are found in amounts higher 5 6 times than that of phenol in refinery wastewaters nevertheless most studies reported on the treatment of phenols using microalgae were done on phenol furthermore the study of the effect of the concentration of the cresols in the wastewater to be treated on the composition of the microalgae is lacking in literature this work provides a deep understanding of this effect which allows integrating the wastewater treatment with using the harvested biomass in other applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and culture medium two strains of microalgae namely freshwater chlorella sp and marine nannochloropsis sp were obtained from a local marine environment research center in umm al quwain uae the freshwater strain was cultivated in the modified bold bassel medium 3n bbm and the marine

cresol koh naoh phenols standard pigment standard methanol acetone acetonitrile chloroform and ethanol 2 2 experimental set up 2 2 1 screening experiments screening experiments were first carried out on the biodegradation of p and o cresol to compare the general performances of freshwater and marine strains in these experiments two sets of 10 ml culture media 3n bbm and f 2 for freshwater and marine cultures respectively were prepared with initial biomass concentration of 1 18 0 16 106 cell ml containing chlorella sp or nannochloropsis sp with p and o cresols at an initial concentration of 95 mg l were used as a sole carbon source the concentration of the cresol used was similar to that of total cresols found in real refinery wastewater which was reported to be 99 mg l 8 the cultures

analysis whereas the harvested biomass were suspended in 10 ml distilled water to determine its concentration 2 2 2 biodegradation experiments in this section experiments were carried out on the treatment of p cresol using with chlorella sp cultures in 200 ml volume the cultures consisted of the 3n bbm medium with different concentrations of p cresol ranging from 95 to 330 mg l and inoculated with chlorella sp at an initial concentration of 1 18 0 16 x106 cell ml which corresponds to an optical density of 1 2771 the flasks were covered with cotton and placed in the same water bath at the same condition used in the screening experiment the flasks were subjected to sufficient light with a photoperiod of 12 h light 12 h dark control experiments were carried out using the same mixtures but without microalgae subjected to similar conditions on a daily basis 5 ml samples were collected and the microalgae cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min the supernatants were sent for cresols analysis whereas the harvested biomass were suspended in 5 ml distilled water to determine its concentration at the end of the experiment in day 5 the biomass was harvested by centrifugation and was analyzed for its proteins lipids carbohydrates and pigments contents 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 cresols analysis for measurement of residual cresols concentration the collected supernatant after centrifugation were filtered using a 0 45 μm syringe filter and analyzed using hplc prostar varian usa equipped with uv vis detector operating at 280 nm and a c 18 column maintained at 45 c the analysis was performed using two mobile phases the gradient profile started with mobile phase consists of 30 methanol 70 water the ratio of the methanol was increased until reaching 100 the run time was about 30 min with flow rate of 1 ml min for the mobile phase mixture the instrument was calibrated using samples of standard cresols of known concentrations 2 3 2 biomass analysis the harvested cells were re suspended in distilled water and the biomass cell count concentration was determined using uv spectrophotometer uve1800 shimadzu japan at 680 nm the concentration cells ml was calculated from a pre prepared calibration curves of optical density vs cell concentration determined using neubauer hemocytometer placed on a nikon eclipse lv100 pol microscope 2 3 3 cells

were withdrawn and centrifuged the harvested cells were suspended in 0 2 ml of distilled and 0 4 ml of 40 w v koh were added the mixture was heated at 90 c for 1 h and after cooling to room temperature 1 2 ml ethanol was added and kept overnight at 20 c the sample was then centrifuged again and the harvested cells were re suspended in 1 5 ml distilled water and mixed with 0 8 ml of 75 h2so and 0 4 ml of anthrone reagent 2 g l in 75 h2so4 and then boiled at 100 c for 15 min after cooling the absorbance at 578 nm was recorded using a spectrophotometer a blank absorbance for each sample was read without the anthrone reagent the instrument was calibrated using serial dilutions of known concentrations of d glucose the proteins were determined using the microbiuret method 21 two aliquots of 0 1 ml of sample was centrifuged one as sample and one as blank the harvested cells were suspended in 1 ml 0 5 n naoh and kept at 80 c for 10 min the sample was then centrifuged and the supernatant was collected the process was repeated three times to make sure that all the proteins were extracted 0 05 ml of copper sulphate 0 21 cuso4 5h2o in 30 naoh was added to the 3 ml of the samples and optical density was measured at 310 nm the instrument was calibrated using serial dilutions of known concentrations of bovine serum albumin for lipids assay the harvested cells were re suspended in 20 μl phosphate buffer 0 05 m ph 7 4 and 0 48 ml solution of 25 methanol in 1 n naoh the mixture was ultrasonicated branson sonifier 450 usa for 10 min another 1 ml of the methanol in naoh solution was added and saponified by heating at 100 c for 30 min an aliquot of 0 5 ml was added to 0 75 ml of a solvent mixture chloroform methanol 2 1 v v and vortexed for 2 min the mixture was then centrifuged to get two phases the lower organic layer was collected and reacted with 1 m triethanolamine 1 n acetic acid 9 1 v v solution the sample were vortexed for 2 min and centrifuged to separate the sample in two layers the organic layer was collected and the absorptivity was measured at 260 nm the concentrations were determined by comparing the optical density to that of serial dilutions of known concentrations of standard fatty acids of carbon length c7 c18 2 3 4 pigments analysis the pigments content was determined using hplc equipped with the same column used for the cresols analysis the mobile phase consisted of two solvents solvent a acetonitrile methanol 60 40 and solvent b methanol ethyl acetate 70 30 the flow rate through the column was 1 3 ml min a gradient flow composition of mobile phase was used for best chromatographic results the mobile phase gradient started with 100 solvent a and changed to 100 solvent b in 8 min and kept in that composition for 7 min then returned to 100 a in 1 min it was then left at this composition for another 25 min to stabilize the column for next injection the sample injection volume was 20 μl and the wavelength was 436 nm the instrument was calibrated using serial dilution of standard pigments chlorophyll a and b and total carotenoids in acetone the calibration curve ranged between 0 005 μg ml to 5 μg ml was used 2 4 statistical analysis each experiment was performed in duplicate and the average values of the results were determined the accuracy of the experimental results was evaluated from the standard deviations shown as error bars in the figures to determine the significance of a factor the regression p value was calculated using anova test by minitab 16 statistical software minitab inc second order regression was selected for data that shows an increase then decrease behavior whereas linear regression was selected for data that has single trend 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioremoval of p and o cresols the work started with a screening test to compare the effectiveness of marine and freshwater strains in degrading p and o cresols the objective of this screening test was to find out whether one of the two strains may not grow in the cresols or show superior performance compared to the other as mentioned earlier the selected concentration was similar to that of total cresols found in real refinery wastewater 8 fig 1 a and b show the percentage removal of cresols and the concentration of the biomass after seven days x over the initial biomass concentration xo which was 1 18 106 cell ml respectively both strains were found to degrade almost the same percentage of p cresol within the 5 days the marine strain nannochloropsis sp showed a slightly better growth rate than the freshwater strain chlorella sp with o cresol the marine stain showed slightly better biodegradation performance but surprisingly its growth was lower as the cells use the degraded substrates for two functions namely production of new cells and maintenance of existing cells therefore these results suggest that with o cresol a smaller portion was directed towards nannochloropsis sp cells growth as compared to chlorella sp both strains performed almost equally well however chlorella sp growth and biodegradation were both better with p cresol than with o cresol all whereas with nannochloropsis sp the degradation of both types of cresols were similar but the growth was much better in p cresol therefore subsequent deeper investigations were selected to be conducted on chlorella sp using p cresol the work can be extended in the future to do deeper analyses on the other strain and the other cresol 3 2 biomass growth and cresols degradation the effect of cultivation of chlorella sp in 3n bbm medium of different initial p cresol concentrations ranging from 35 to 330 mg l was tested at initial biomass concertation xo of 1 18 106 cell ml temperature of 30 c and agitation of 110 rpm the changes in the cresol and the biomass growth presented as ln x xo over a period of five days are shown in figs 2 and 3 respectively running a parallel experiment without microalgae showed minimal drop in the concentration over the five days which did not exceed 1 5 at the highest concentration of 330 mg l this proves that the drop on p cresol was mainly due to the bioactivity of the microalgae the biodegradation procedure of p cresol was proposed to go through two step process 22 in the first step the methyl group is split which could be converted to methanol and in the second the intermediately produced phenol is broken it should be noted that the data shown in figs 2 and 3 are average values of two runs the reproducibility of the data is confirmed from the small error bars shown in fig 2 the error bars in fig 3 were not shown to avoid overcrowding the graph but the average relative error was 7 6 the error bars for the growth can still be seen from the specific growth rate results shown in fig 4 it was clearly seen from fig 2 that except for the highest concentration of 330 mg l chlorella sp was capable of removing most of the p cresol within 4 days for concentrations up to 260 mg l chlorella sp was able to completely remove p cresol however concentrations higher than 260 mg l appeared to be inhibiting the microalgae capacity to degrade p cresols and at 330 mg l only 20 removal percentage was achieved within 5 days fig 3 shows that the microalgae was able to grow in all concentrations of p cresols but with different growth rates it was also noticed that as the initial concentration of p cresol increased the lag phase increased this was expected as the cells needed more time to adapt to the high substrate concentration as mentioned earlier the investigation of p cresol removal using microalgae was rarely studied and even in these limited studies the concentrations tested were much lower than those found in real refinery wastewater for example eukaryotic algae ochromonas danica was tested for the biodegradation of p cresol at initial concentrations in the range of 0 54 to 4 3 mg l the study showed complete removal of the p cresol in the concentration range within a maximum period of 12 days 23 green microalgae scenedesmus obliquus was also tested for the biodegradation but at even lower concentrations in the range 0 162 to 2 7 mg l 22 the effect of the initial substrate concentration on the percentage removal was shown to be significant dropping from 100 to 29 when the initial concentration was increased from 0 162 to 2 7 mg l 22 as the concentrations of p cresol in real refinery wastewater are order of magnitude higher than these tested ranges the importance of the results found in this study at the higher concentrations becomes more obvious table 2 shows comparison in p cresol biodegradation using several microorganisms at different initial concentration range filamentous fungal strain gliomastix indicus showed higher performance for p cresol removal than that of the tested microalgae in this work 24 at high concentrations of up to 700 mg l more than 90 p cresol was removed within about 4 days in a more recent study isolated bacteria from activated sludge were tested for p cresol biodegradation 25 results showed high applicability at initial concentration of p cresol biodegradation of 750 mg l within 100 h in addition a bacterial strain pseudomonas putida immobilized in pva gel was also used for the biodegradation of p cresol at concentrations range similar to the one used in this study 25 to 200 mg l 26 complete removal was achieved within only 40 min on the other hand using aerobic granulates a longer time was required to remove p cresol even at a low concentration 100 mg l 27 to better understand the behavior the biodegradation and specific growth rates were determined and the results are shown in fig 4 the biodegradation rate was determined from the slope of the straight line in the initial part of the degradation whereas the specific growth rate was determined from the slope of the logarithmic of x xo vs time in the exponential part after the lag period as expected it was found that both rates biodegradation and specific growth had similar trends when the growth rate increased the biodegradation rate increased and vice versa it was found that the growth rate of chlorella sp increased with increasing the initial concentration of p cresol up to 140 mg l at which the optimum growth rate of 2 17 0 17 day 1 was reached beyond that concentration the growth started to slightly drop at 210 mg l and then sharply dropped after that due to substrate inhibition similar behavior was observed for the p cresol degradation but the optimum drop was 51 51 mg l day at 210 mg l the effect of initial concentration on both the biodegradation rate and growth rate was significant with a p value of 0 05 the effect however was less significant on the growth rate with a p value of 0 085 this results agree with previous study done using the same strain for phenol degradation 29 the maximum biodegradation and growth rates were also obtained at an initial phenol concentration of 200 mg l the optimum drop rate was 54 5 mg l day which were very close but slightly higher than the one found in this work however a much lower growth rate of only 0 25 day 1 was reported in addition to using a different substrate the lower rate was due to the limited light intensity used in the previous study suggested to enhance the heterotrophic growth when p cresol biodegradation was tested using a green microalgae scenedesmus obliquus he highest bioremoval of 100 was achieved at initial concentration of 0 162 mg l at which the biomass concentration increased by 20 of the initial value 22 at higher concretions the growth was inhibited the results shown in fig 3 were used to determine the parameters of three growth models that incorporate limiting substrate inhibition kinetics the models used were haldane aiba and andrews given in eqs 1 3 respectively 1 μ μ m s o k s s o s o 2 k i 2 μ μ m s o k s s o exp s o k i 3 μ μ m k s s o 1 1 s o k i where μ and μm are the specific and maximum specific growth rates day 1 respectively so is the initial substrate concentration mg l and ks and ki are the substrate and inhibition constants mg l respectively the estimated values for the model kinetic parameters were determined by fitting non linear regression model using excel solver with an objective function o f given by eq 4 and shown in table 3 4 o f i n μ e x p μ p r e d 2 where μ e x p and μ p r e d are the experimental and model predicted specific growth rates from the values of the coefficient of determination r2 it can be seen that all three models fitted the data well with the aiba model being the best followed by the haldane model the goodness of the fitting can also be seen in fig 5 which shows the comparison between experimental data and models predictions the results show that the values of μm for all models were similar with that of the aiba model being relatively the highest the values of ks and ki of the haldane and andrews models were similar whereas those of the aiba model were higher no previous studies on the kinetics of microalgae biodegradation of p cresol are reported in open literature the only available ones are with other microorganisms such as bacteria and fungus for example kinetic of p cresol degradation by fungal strains gliomastix indicus have been studied using five several models 24 the values of μm of haldane aiba and andrews were 9 5 7 02 and 14 2 day 1 respectively which are close to the ones found in this work in addition similar to this work the highest value of μm was for aiba model however with the fungal strains the r2 values suggested that the haldane and andrews models represented the data better than aiba model 3 3 effect of p cresol on biochemical composition the most important aspect of this work was to determine the effect of the concentration of p cresol on the chemical composition of the harvested microalgae as mentioned earlier this is important information for the determination of the application to be coupled with the wastewater treatment microalga biomass with high lipid content could serve as a good feedstock for biodiesel production whereas the biomass with high protein content may be more suitable for pharmaceutical applications generally the composition of the growth medium affects the biochemical composition of microalgae cells by alternating of metabolic pathways in response to stress conditions 30 therefore at the end of the 5 days the biomass was collected and analyzed for proteins carbohydrates lipid and pigments content the percentage compositions of proteins carbohydrates and lipids are in fig 6 and those of the pigments chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids are shown in fig 7 it was found that the lipids content increased with the increase in the p cresol concentration growing in medium containing no p cresol the lipids content was 8 9 this amount increased by 3 7 folds to 33 by growing for 5 days in medium containing an initial concentration of 330 mg l the effect of the initial concentration of p cresol on the lipid content was significant with a p value of 0 041 in contrast the proteins content decreased with the increase in p cresol concentration from 58 7 with no p cresol to 31 3 at 330 mg l the effect was also significant with a similar extent to that on of lipids with a p value of 0 044 no significant change was observed in the carbohydrate level this insignificant effect was also confirmed from the p value which was found to be 0 146 this finding suggests that for coupling wastewater treatment with biodiesel production it would be preferable to cultivate the microalgae in wastewaters containing high concentrations of p cresol whereas cultivation in low concentrations may be more suitable for coupling with proteins extraction the results found in this work agree with those found when the concentrations of nonylphenols bisphenol 17alpha ethynylestradiol and estradiol were increased in the media used for the cultivation of the marine diatom navicula incerta 31 it was also found that the proteins content declined with the increasing in all compounds the behavior of the lipids content was also similar showing an increase in the lipid contents with the increase in the concertation of the compounds in the media an increase in the lipids content in diatom skeletonema costatum was also observed by increasing the concentration of 2 4 dichlorophenol in the cultivating medium 32 however this was coupled with a decrease in carbohydrates content and the proteins showed no changes under environmental stress microalgae direct their pathways towards storing energy in the form of lipid instead of using it as source of growth 33 this was shown when chlorella maxicana was cultivated under stress of salinity showing an increase in lipids content from 23 to 37 as the nacl concentration increased from 0 43 to 25 mm 34 an increase in lipids was also observed when the cultures were stressed with nitrogen and phosphorus limitations 21 25 26 in addition previous studies confirmed the accumulation of lipids in chlorella pyrenoidosa when the cells are exposed to high phenol concentration and the lipid accumulation was increased with increasing the incubation period 12 increasing of lipid biosynthesis was also reported during phenol degradation in diatom bd1iitg cells 35 as shown in fig 7 chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and carotenoids composition were found to be highly dependent on the initial p cresol concentration it was found that the pigments concentration increased with the increase in p cresol concentration to reach a maximum at 140 mg l then stated to drop after that at low p cresol concentrations the contents of both chlorophylls a and b were higher than that of carotenoids the drop in chlorophylls content with the increase in p cresol concentration was more drastic that of carotenoids and above 250 mg l the carotenoids content started to exceed that of chlorophyll b chlorophyll a remained the main pigment under all tested concentrations of p cresols the effect of the initial p cresol was most significant on chlorophyll a with a p value of 0 093 followed by carotenoids with a p value of 0 118 and least significant on chlorophyll b with p value of 0 203 these results are related to the enhancement in the biomass growth that encourage algal cells to produce more pigments at concentration with highest biomass growth rate similar trend was also obtained when chlorella kessleri was cultivated in different concentrations of crude oils 36 with the maximum chlorophyll a and b contents achieved at the initial concentration that resulted in the highest biomass growth 36 however with scenedesmus obliquus the pigments production was found to decline with the increase in the initial concentration of crude oil having the highest chlorophyll a content at the lowest oil concentration 37 on the other hand no changes in chlorophylls content of diatoms navicula incerta 31 and skeletonema costatum 32 was observed with increasing the initial concentration of the endocrine disrupting chemicals to study the initial rate of the changes in proteins carbohydrates and pigments composition the experiment was repeated at the initial p cresol concentration of 190 mg l that showed the optimum degradation and growth rates in this experiment the cells composition was measured twice a day for a period of two days and the rate of the change was measured from the slope of the changes with time the results show that the drop rate of proteins was 15 4 per day a drop was also observed for carbohydrates but at a much lower rate of 7 3 per day the lipids show an increase with a rate of 19 1 per day 4 conclusion this study demonstrates the capacity of chlorella sp for the biological treatment of wastewater contaminated with p cresol the biodegradability and cell growth were found to be affected by the initial cresol concentration however the highest biomass productivity and biodegradation rate were obtained at initial p cresol of 150 and 200 mg l respectively the biodegradation kinetics were presented well by haldane aiba and andrews models with aiba model showing the best fit the biomass composition of chlorella sp was also found to be affected by the initial concentration of p cresol in the growth medium as the initial concentration increased the proteins reduced and the lipids increased whereas the carbohydrates remains constant the pigments content increased with the increase in p cresol concentration to reach a maximum at 150 mg l p cresol but then dropped at higher concentrations acknowledgement this work was supported by the emirates center for energy and environment research grant number 31r070 
14497,a comparative study on electrosorptive rates of metal ions in capacitive deionization yanting li a ty c stewart b hao l tang b a school of environment harbin institute of technology harbin heilongjiang 150090 china school of environment harbin institute of technology harbin heilongjiang 150090 china b department of chemistry indiana university of pennsylvania indiana pa 15705 usa department of chemistry indiana university of pennsylvania indiana pa 15705 usa corresponding author a comparative study on electrosorptive rates was conducted to explore the affinity preference of na k mg2 ca2 cd2 pb2 and cu2 to activated carbon cloth electrodes of capacitive deionization cdi in mono component solutions results showed the electrosorptive kinetics of these metal ions followed the lagergren equation for alkali and alkali earth metal ions the order of electrosorptive rates followed k na ca2 mg2 which revealed an inversely proportional relationship with their ionic hydrated radii the relationship between electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii however did not hold for heavy metal ions and the order was cu2 pb2 cd2 the abnormal electrosorptive behaviors of cu2 and pb2 could be attributed to electrodeposition and formation of oh complexes during electrosorption besides cu2 and pb2 showed significantly low desorption efficiencies during the electrode regeneration processes indicating serious electrode fouling during the electrosorptive process this work provides fundamental aspects on individual removal of metal ions and the results can be beneficially used as a reference for treatment and recovery of metal ions by cdi technology keywords electrosorption heavy metal ionic hydrated radius kinetics capacitive deionization 1 introduction metal pollution of fresh water resources by industrial discharges has received significant worldwide concerns for the last few decades waste streams containing one or more toxic metals are often encountered in metallurgical tannery chemical pharmaceutical mining battery manufacturing fertilizers and many other industries 1 since the substantial build up of toxic metals in food chains poses a high health risk to human consumers it is necessary to remove these metals from the waste streams before discharging to the fresh water environment there are many methods for metal removal such as chemical precipitation membrane filtration ion exchange adsorption etc however some disadvantages of these methods make them unsuitable for all scenarios of industrial wastewater treatment 2 for example conventional chemical precipitation is known to have poor performance in low strength heavy metal removal and its operation is dependent on many factors such as ph and chemical doses it is also costly and generates a lot of sludge that poses environmental disposal problems 3 in recent years capacitive deionization cdi is studied as a cost effective technology with no sludge production and could compete with other commonly used alternatives e g ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis etc for the treatment of various strengths of metal laden waters 4 it has a simple structure using juxtaposed pairs of charged electrodes and is highly energy efficient using a low voltage 0 6 1 2 vdc to attract ions from water by electrostatic force after the adsorption capacity is reached the ions are desorbed into brine water by removing the electric field and the regenerated electrodes are ready to use for the next cycle 5 therefore the adsorption cycles generate an effluent with reduced concentrations of anions 6 9 and metal cations 10 14 such as sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and heavy metals such as lead pb2 cadmium cd2 and copper cu2 resulting in water deionization and purification while the desorption cycles produce a brine stream with concentrated such ions which offers easier recovery of these metals with other terminal processes e g evaporation although many studies have indicated that metal ions can be removed by cdi and a variety of electrode materials have been proposed to enhance cdi performances 15 17 the affinity preference of these metal ions to the electrodes remains obscure and literatures on cdi research using multi ionic solutions sometimes presents contradictory results 18 the first study reporting this obscurity was by gabelich et al 11 who observed the adsorption in molarity followed a trend of na ca2 mg2 k in surface water with a low total organic carbon toc concentration while the trend changed to na mg2 ca2 k in water with a high toc results on produced water treatment by xu et al 12 supported the former trend the discrepancy was thought to be attributable to different water types with various initial concentrations of metal ions in a competitive multi ionic environment the inconsistent uses of units for description of adsorption e g milligram salt per gram electrode mg g millimole ion per gram electrode mmol g removal percentage etc further added to this obscurity for example li et al 13 reported an order of fe3 0 62 mg fecl3 g ca2 0 55 mg cacl2 g mg2 0 52 mg mgcl2 g na 0 45 mg nacl g in mono component solutions while the order became na mg2 ca2 fe3 in unit of mmol g besides removal of certain heavy metals by cdi was complicated and an observed trend of cr2 pb2 cd2 in percentage removal by huang et al 14 was under the influence of physical adsorption which introduced uncertainties to the quantification of the sole electrosorption amount because the existing results reporting the electrosorption of metal ions in multi ionic conditions are limited due to incomparable experimental details from one research to another there is a need to explore the affinity of different metal ions to cdi electrodes in mono component solutions with comparable settings in this research mono component solutions of metal chloride nacl kcl cacl2 mgcl2 pbcl2 cdcl2 and cucl2 were used for a series of batch cdi treatment electrosorption was started with the same initial mole concentrations of these metal ions in a non competitive environment using cdi apparatuses with virgin electrodes the influence of physical adsorption was reduced by equilibrating the cdi system with target salt solutions prior to each electrosorptive experiment the objective of this study was to obtain the electrosorptive rates of different metal ions so that the relative affinity of these metal ions to cdi electrodes could be compared the study aids in gaining a better understanding of metal removal during the cdi process 2 experimental 2 1 assembly of cdi cells multiple cdi cells measured as 4 cm 4 cm were assembled with layers of titanium wire mesh the current collector 0 55 g virgin activated carbon cloth acc the electrode and 2 mm thick rubber slices the separator to prevent short circuiting the layers in the order shown in fig 1 were firmly pressed together with a cable tie the electrode material was commercially available acc from chemviron uk model no zorflex fm10 which had a specific surface area of 1000 m2 g and a thickness of 0 5 mm the pore size distribution and surface chemistry of the acc were described elsewhere 19 the acc was cut into multiple 4 cm 4 cm square shaped pieces weighing approximately 0 55 g for the cdi cells 2 2 metal ions and pretreatment of cdi cells seven analytical grade salts nacl kcl cacl2 mgcl2 pbcl2 cdcl2 and cucl2 purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co shanghai china were used to make stock mono component solutions with distilled water each salt solution was made at an initial concentration of 7 5 mm by direct dilution of the corresponding stock solution prior to the electrosorptive experiment on each salt a cdi cell was washed with distilled water to remove any impurities and was then immersed in the target salt solution for at least 2 h while stirring after physical adsorption of the salt was completed the cell was transferred to a new target salt solution where the electrosorptive experiment was conducted the pre treatment procedures of each cdi cell reduced the physical adsorption influence of the target metal ion and all electrosorptive experiments for different metal ions started with the same concentration at 7 5 mm 2 3 the electrosorptive experiments the electrosorptive experiments were carried out at room temperature in batch series depicted in fig 1 the system consisted of a beaker with 85 ml single electrolyte solution a cdi cell with virgin acc electrodes a conductivity meter a potentiostat as external power supply and a magnetic stirring plate with a stirrer for mixing a voltage of 1 2 v was consistently applied to the cell until desorption by short circuiting at equilibrium solution ph values before and after the electrosorptive experiments were recorded the ph values of the nacl kcl cacl2 mgcl2 and cdcl2 solutions were fluctuating around a base level close to neutral while the starting ph values of the pbcl2 and cucl2 were 3 26 and 5 19 respectively and a complete electrosorption desorption cycle caused ph fluctuations around the two starting levels conductivity data was continuously monitored at a 30 second interval and was converted to mole concentrations of the salt based on calibration curves the electrosorptive amount of metal ion per unit mass of acc q in mmol g at any time was calculated as 1 q c 0 c t m v where c0 mm and ct mm are the concentrations of the metal ion at time zero and time t during the cdi treatment respectively m g is the mass of acc and v l is the volume of the solution the concentration of the metal ion after desorption cd was also measured and the desorption efficiency d 20 was calculated as 2 d c d c e c 0 c e 100 where ce and cd are the equilibrium concentrations mm of the metal ion after cdi electrosorption and desorption respectively after one complete electrosorption desorption cycle of each target metal ion the used acc electrodes were removed from the cdi cell and the microstructure of the electrode surface was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy sem 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrosorptive kinetics in order to investigate the electrosorptive rates of metal ions by cdi the pseudo first order lagergren equation eq 3 and pseudo second order eq 4 equations were applied to fit the experimental data using the method of least squares 21 22 3 ln q e ln q e q k 1 t 4 t q 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k1 is the rate constant min 1 of the lagergren equation k2 is the rate constant g mmol 1 min 1 of the pseudo second order equation qe and q are the amount of electrosorbed metal ion mmol g at equilibrium and any time during the cdi treatment respectively it was found that the lagergren equation fit the experimental data for the metal ions better than the pseudo second order equation due to the higher r2 values table 1 the electrosorptive kinetics of these metal ions was well presented by the lagergren equation which agreed with mossad et al 23 on cdi removal of salinity and hardness from brackish groundwater the pseudo second order kinetics on the other hand was reported to fit better on physical adsorption of some heavy metals according to wang et al 24 the less preferred application of the pseudo second order kinetics in the present study implied the lump sum influences from physical adsorption was minimal and the monolayer electrosorption via electrical double layer edl was the predominant mechanism during the cdi treatment 3 2 effect of metal carryover on electrosorptive kinetics the use of a single cdi cell for tests of multiple metal ions was found limited due to the carryover of metal ions from the previous run fig 2 shows the electrosorptive kinetics of k using a same cdi cell in two scenarios 1 the use of virgin electrodes for the electrosorption of k and 2 the use of the same electrodes for the electrosorption of k after one complete electrosorption desorption cycle of pb2 the initial use of the cdi cell reported electrosorption of k with a lagergren rate constant of 0 1232 min 1 however after one complete electrosorption desorption cycle of pb2 the cdi cell reported much slower electrosorption of k with a lagergren rate constant of 0 0859 min 1 the 30 reduction on the electrosorptive rate constant of k was attributed to inorganic fouling of the acc electrodes by formation of lead hydroxide complexes on the electrodes 25 the phenomenon reduced the effective surface area for ion electrosorption similar observations were reported by mossad and zou 26 who found when ferric ion was added the salt removal efficiency started to decline the results indicate if a single cdi cell is used for the tests of multiple metal ions the influence from the carryover of other metal ions would make the electrosorptive results difficult to reproduce and thus invalidate any comparisons acid treatment is known capable of controlling the accumulation of inorganic salts retained on the electrode surface considering the externally introduced h ions may become another variable the electrosorption could otherwise be affected by competition between the externally introduced h and the metal ion 27 28 irreversibile portion of fouling and potential change of functional groups on the electrode surface 29 multiple cdi cells made with the same mass of virgin acc electrodes allowed each set of electrosorptive experiment using its own apparatus so as to avoid errors due to the carryover of miscellaneous metals from the used electrodes na is known to have no noticeable effect on long term operation of cdi process 26 in the present study na was used as the reference ion and each cdi cell was used to obtain the electrosorptive kinetics for the reference ion and the target ion it has been noted that a tiny difference in spacer width would lead to a significant change in electrosorptive kinetics 30 to address any possible discrepancy among the cdi cells during the assembly process the electrosorptive kinetics of metal ions were compared against the na and a normalization process was presented in eq 5 as follows the lagergren rate constant of the target ion was divided by that of the reference ion 5 n o r m a l i z e d e l e c t r o s o r p t i v e r a t e k m k r e f where km and kref are the lagargren rate constants of the target metal ion and reference metal ion respectively using a same cdi cell the ratios representing the normalized electrosorptive rate for each metal ion were compared and discussed in the following section 3 3 comparative study of the normalized electrosorptive rates 3 3 1 electrosorption of alkali metal ions comparison of two monovalent alkali metal ions is illustrated in fig 3 a k showed faster electrosorption as evidenced by a higher lagergren rate constant 0 0897 min 1 than that of na 0 0742 min 1 the normalized electrosorptive rate of k was 1 21 the trend of k na was opposite to those of gabelich et al 11 and xu et al 12 whose results were obtained from multi ionic solutions with different initial molar concentrations of metal ions since the present experiment started with the same initial molar concentrations in a mono component system the phenomenon could be attributed to the difference in their ionic hydrated radii it is known that for two ions with the same charge the one with larger ionic hydrated radius was encountered with a stronger edl overlapping which caused restrictions for the ion moving onto the electrode surface 31 since k is smaller in hydrated radius 331 pm than na 358 pm table 2 32 the electrosorption of k is more favorable to the cdi electrode 3 3 2 electrosorption of alkali earth metal ions fig 3b and c show the electrosorptive kinetics of mg2 and ca2 in reference to na respectively the sequence of the normalized electrosorptive rates was ca2 0 66 mg2 0 58 again the result could be explained by the difference in their ionic hydrated radii ca2 412 pm mg2 428 pm and thus the electrosorption of ca2 is more favorable compared to that of mg2 it is important to note that the normalized electrosorptive rates were both less than 1 indicating less preferred electrosorption of divalent cations compared to the monovalent cations it is proposed that although the divalent cations are associated with stronger columbic interactions between the charged surfaces they may have more restrictions to penetrate the pores of the electrode due to stronger edl overlapping summing up the above the sequence of normalized electrosorptive rates for alkali and alkali earth metal ions was as follows k 1 21 na 1 00 ca2 0 66 mg2 0 58 this was partially contradictory with literatures reporting both mass and percentage removals in competitive multi ionic solutions 11 12 33 but largely agreed with electrosorptive behaviors in unit of mmol g in single electrolyte solutions 13 3 3 3 electrosorption of heavy metal ions fig 3d f show the electrosorptive kinetics of cd2 pb2 and cu2 in reference to na respectively all normalized electrosorptive rates of these heavy metal ions were less than 1 indicating slower electrosorption compared to the monovalent na the order of the normalized electrosorptive rates followed cu2 0 72 pb2 0 62 cd2 0 59 because the trend of ionic hydrated radii for the three metal ions was pb2 401 pm cu2 419 pm cd2 426 pm an inversely proportional relationship between electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii did not hold for these heavy metal ions the result was also partially contrary to the affinity order of pb2 cu2 cd2 during a competitive physical adsorption 34 it is commonly believed that the chemical interaction between the metal ions and the surface functional groups of adsorbent is the major sorption mechanism during physical adsorption 35 the electrosorption mechanisms of these heavy metal ions on the other hand could be more complex which are discussed as follows cu2 showed faster electrosorption than other tested heavy metal ions the mechanism of enhanced cu2 removal by cdi was two fold 1 electrosorption via formation of edl upon an applied voltage increased cu2 removal was observed with application of a voltage as low as 0 3 v compared to that of an open circuit 36 37 and 2 electrodeposition of cu2 via electrochemical reactions although there were no evident redox reactions in the voltage range of 0 0 9 v 38 the present study used a cell voltage of 1 2 v and cu2 could be reduced to cuprous oxide cu2o or and copper metal by electrodeposition 36 the mechanism for the removal of pb2 by cdi was more complex as evidenced by the relatively poor r2 value 0 8873 of lagergren equation fig 3e reduction of pb2 and deposition on the surface of cathode was observed by liu et al 27 at a voltage of 1 5 v because the standard reduction potential of pb2 was higher than that of cu2 the electrodeposition effect of pb2 could be smaller than that of cu2 moreover in addition to the edl charging oxygen could be reduced to oh at the cathode 39 which might facilitate the formation of hydrolyzed lead complexes on the electrode 25 and reduce the accessible pores for ion storage on the other hand the acc electrode material had been quantified with 0 4 meq g lactonic groups 0 2 meq g phenolic groups and 0 1 meq g total basic groups 19 the ph value at the point of zero charge ph pzc was 6 80 for the heavy metal solutions that started with a lower ph than ph pzc the surface charge of acc electrodes and the degree of protonation of the functional groups were affected suggesting heavy metals being adsorbed by chelation instead of edl capacitors based electrosorption 40 it has been noted that the solutions became more acidic after electrosorption of the three heavy metal ions and electrodeposition of cu was observed on the cathode huang et al 14 discussed smaller stability constant pka values for stronger metal ligands to oh and lower oh stability although the ph conditions affect the oh complex formation such concentrations of oh complexes were not quantified in this study the present research agreed with huang et al 14 on the discovery of slower electrosorption of cd2 than pb2 since cd2 had been reported to demonstrate less physical adsorption in mono component solutions 41 the slower kinetics of both electrosorption and physical adsorption for cd2 could be attributed to its larger ionic hydrated radius 426 pm it was proposed that edl charging was the predominant mechanism for cd2 removal by cdi the effect of oh complex formation however might be insignificant because the pka1 of cd2 10 08 is higher than that of pb2 7 71 the sem images shown in fig 4 further confirm that the acc electrodes were less influenced by cd2 fig 4b compared to the heavily influenced electrodes by pb2 and cu2 fig 4c and d 3 3 4 relationship between the normalized electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii transport of anions and cations to their respective electrode is by convection diffusion and electromigration 3 since there is evidence that counterions also played an important role in an individual ion s sorption 11 the present research used chloride as the only external anion and thus it can be deduced that the differences in observation of electrosorptive rates solely depend on the affinity of cations to the cdi electrode comparison of all tested metal ions regarding their normalized electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii is presented in fig 5 it was found that except the abnormal behaviors of cu2 and pb2 due to their complex mechanisms during electrosorption all other metal ions followed a trend of inversely proportional relationship it was deduced that the ionic hydrated radii generally dictated the removal phenomena of metal ions in mono component solutions which was in some aspects similar to the ion exchange and membrane separation processes 11 42 3 4 regeneration of cdi electrodes table 3 shows the desorption performance of cdi electrodes after one electrosorption cycle of metal ions it was found that the alkali metal ions including na and k had no noticeable effect on electrode regeneration since the electrosorbed ions could be 100 desorbed by short circuiting in 0 5 h the alkali earth metal ions including mg2 and ca2 however took longer time for desorption and there were slight losses of electrosorption capacity due to scaling 26 the desorption of heavy metal ions were found most time consuming the desorption efficiencies of cu2 and pb2 were only 62 and 24 respectively the occurrence of electrodeposition formation of oh complexes and slow diffusion of heavy metal ions due to their large atomic masses may contribute to the poor desorption efficiencies the surface analysis of the acc by sem also reveals loss of active electrosorption sites by cu2 and pb2 fig 4 during two additional cdi cycles the desorption efficiencies of alkali alkali earth metals and cd2 were consistently as high as their first reported values considering the desorption of cu2 and pb2 could not proceed to completion the salt adsorption capacity of electrodes had been undermined which affected their continuous uses the results indicate that the cdi electrodes are susceptible to serious inorganic fouling by cu2 and pb2 during the cdi treatment frequent acid washes are needed to ensure long term operational efficiency in practical engineering applications 4 conclusions the electrosorptive behaviors of na k mg2 ca2 cd2 pb2 and cu2 in mono component solutions during the cdi treatment were investigated it was found that the electrosorptive kinetics of all tested metal ions followed the lagergren equation by comparing the normalized electrosorptive rates of tested ions in reference to na the study revealed an affinity preference order of k na ca2 mg2 for alkali and alkali earth metals and cu2 pb2 cd2 for heavy metals during the cdi treatment it was deduced that the ionic hydrated radii generally dictated the affinity preference of tested ions except cu2 and pb2 the abnormal electrosorptive behaviors of cu2 and pb2 were attributed to the complex mechanisms occurring during electrosorption such as electrodeposition and oh complexes formation beside edl charging moreover cu2 and pb2 showed significantly low desorption efficiency during electrode regeneration which implied serious fouling potential during the cdi treatment this work provides fundamental aspects on individual removal of metal ions and the findings can be beneficially used as a reference for the treatment of industrial effluents by cdi acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the start up fund provided by college of natural sciences and

k mg2 ca2 cd2 pb2 and cu2 to activated carbon cloth electrodes of capacitive deionization cdi in mono component solutions results showed the electrosorptive kinetics of these metal ions followed the lagergren equation for alkali and alkali earth metal ions the order of electrosorptive rates followed k na ca2 mg2 which revealed an inversely proportional relationship with their ionic hydrated radii the relationship between electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii however did not hold for heavy metal ions and the order was cu2 pb2 cd2 the abnormal electrosorptive behaviors of cu2 and pb2 could be attributed to electrodeposition and formation of oh complexes during electrosorption besides cu2 and pb2 showed significantly low desorption efficiencies during the electrode regeneration processes indicating serious electrode fouling during the electrosorptive process this work provides fundamental aspects on individual removal of metal ions and the results can be beneficially used as a reference for treatment and recovery of metal ions by cdi technology keywords electrosorption heavy metal ionic hydrated radius kinetics capacitive deionization 1 introduction metal pollution of fresh water resources by industrial discharges has received significant worldwide concerns for the last few decades waste streams containing one or more toxic metals are often encountered in metallurgical tannery chemical pharmaceutical mining battery manufacturing fertilizers and many other industries 1 since the substantial build up of toxic metals in food chains poses a high health risk to human consumers it is necessary to remove these metals from the waste streams before discharging to the fresh water environment there are many methods for metal removal such as chemical precipitation membrane filtration ion exchange adsorption etc however some disadvantages of these methods make them unsuitable for all scenarios of industrial wastewater treatment 2 for example conventional chemical precipitation is known to have poor performance in low strength heavy metal removal and its operation is dependent on many factors such as ph and chemical doses it is also costly and generates a lot of sludge that poses environmental disposal problems 3 in recent years capacitive deionization cdi is studied as a cost effective technology with no sludge production and could compete with other commonly used alternatives e g ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis etc for the treatment of various strengths of metal laden waters 4 it has a simple structure using juxtaposed pairs of charged electrodes and is highly energy efficient using a low voltage 0 6 1 2 vdc to attract ions from water by electrostatic force after the adsorption capacity is reached the ions are desorbed into brine water by removing the electric field and the regenerated electrodes are ready to use for the next cycle 5 therefore the adsorption cycles generate an effluent with reduced concentrations of anions 6 9 and metal cations 10 14 such as sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 and heavy metals such as lead pb2 cadmium cd2 and copper cu2 resulting in water deionization and purification while the desorption cycles produce a brine stream with concentrated such ions which offers easier recovery of these metals with other terminal processes e g evaporation although many studies have indicated that metal ions can be removed by cdi and a variety of electrode materials have been proposed to enhance cdi performances 15 17 the affinity preference of these metal ions to the electrodes remains obscure and literatures on cdi research using multi ionic solutions sometimes presents contradictory results 18 the first study reporting this obscurity was by gabelich et al 11 who observed the adsorption in molarity followed a trend of na ca2 mg2 k in surface water with a low total organic carbon toc concentration while the trend changed to na mg2 ca2 k in water with a high toc results on produced water treatment by xu et al 12 supported the former trend the discrepancy was thought to be attributable to different water types with various initial concentrations of metal ions in a competitive multi ionic environment the inconsistent uses of units for description of adsorption e g milligram salt per gram electrode mg g millimole ion per gram electrode mmol g removal percentage etc further added to this obscurity for example li et al 13 reported an order of fe3 0 62 mg fecl3 g ca2 0 55 mg cacl2 g mg2 0 52 mg mgcl2 g na 0 45 mg nacl g in mono component solutions while the order became na mg2 ca2 fe3 in unit of mmol g besides removal of certain heavy metals by cdi was complicated and an observed trend of cr2 pb2 cd2 in percentage removal by huang et al 14 was under the influence of physical adsorption which introduced uncertainties to the quantification of the sole electrosorption amount because the existing results reporting the electrosorption of metal ions in multi ionic conditions are limited due to incomparable experimental details from one research to another there is a need to explore the affinity of different metal ions to cdi electrodes in mono component solutions with comparable settings in this research mono component solutions of metal chloride nacl kcl cacl2 mgcl2 pbcl2 cdcl2 and cucl2 were used for a series of batch cdi treatment electrosorption was started with the same initial mole concentrations of these metal ions in a non competitive environment using cdi apparatuses with virgin electrodes the influence of physical adsorption was reduced by equilibrating the cdi system with target salt solutions prior to each electrosorptive experiment the objective of this study was to obtain the electrosorptive rates of different metal ions so that the relative affinity of these metal ions to cdi electrodes could be compared the study aids in gaining a better understanding of metal removal during the cdi process 2 experimental 2 1 assembly of cdi cells multiple cdi cells measured as 4 cm 4 cm were assembled with layers of titanium wire mesh the current collector 0 55 g virgin activated

conductivity data was continuously monitored at a 30 second interval and was converted to mole concentrations of the salt based on calibration curves the electrosorptive amount of metal ion per unit

with huang et al 14 on the discovery of slower electrosorption of cd2 than pb2 since cd2 had been reported to demonstrate less physical adsorption in mono component solutions 41 the slower kinetics of both electrosorption and physical adsorption for cd2 could be attributed to its larger ionic hydrated radius 426 pm it was proposed that edl charging was the predominant mechanism for cd2 removal by cdi the effect of oh complex formation however might be insignificant because the pka1 of cd2 10 08 is higher than that of pb2 7 71 the sem images shown in fig 4 further confirm that the acc electrodes were less influenced by cd2 fig 4b compared to the heavily influenced electrodes by pb2 and cu2 fig 4c and d 3 3 4 relationship between the normalized electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii transport of anions and cations to their respective electrode is by convection diffusion and electromigration 3 since there is evidence that counterions also played an important role in an individual ion s sorption 11 the present research used chloride as the only external anion and thus it can be deduced that the differences in observation of electrosorptive rates solely depend on the affinity of cations to the cdi electrode comparison of all tested metal ions regarding their normalized electrosorptive rates and ionic hydrated radii is presented in fig 5 it was found that except the abnormal behaviors of cu2 and pb2 due to their complex mechanisms during electrosorption all other metal ions followed a trend of inversely proportional relationship it was deduced that the ionic hydrated radii generally dictated the removal phenomena of metal ions in mono component solutions which was in some aspects similar to the ion exchange and membrane separation processes 11 42 3 4 regeneration of cdi electrodes table 3 shows the desorption performance of cdi electrodes after one electrosorption cycle of metal ions it was found that the alkali metal ions including na and k had no noticeable effect on electrode regeneration since the electrosorbed ions could be 100 desorbed by short circuiting in 0 5 h the alkali earth metal ions including mg2 and ca2 however took longer time for desorption and there were slight losses of electrosorption capacity due to scaling 26 the desorption of heavy metal ions were found most time consuming the desorption efficiencies of cu2 and pb2 were only 62 and 24 respectively the occurrence of electrodeposition formation of oh complexes and slow diffusion of heavy metal ions due to their large atomic masses may contribute to the poor desorption efficiencies the surface analysis of the acc by sem also reveals loss of active electrosorption sites by cu2 and pb2 fig 4 during two additional cdi cycles the desorption efficiencies of alkali alkali earth metals and cd2 were consistently as high as their first reported values considering the desorption of cu2 and pb2 could not proceed to completion the salt adsorption capacity of electrodes had been undermined which affected their continuous uses the results indicate that the cdi electrodes are susceptible to serious inorganic fouling by cu2 and pb2 during the cdi treatment frequent acid washes are needed to ensure long term operational efficiency in practical engineering applications 4 conclusions the electrosorptive behaviors of na k mg2 ca2 cd2 pb2 and cu2 in mono component solutions during the cdi treatment were investigated it was found that the electrosorptive kinetics of all tested metal ions followed the lagergren equation by comparing the normalized electrosorptive rates of tested ions in reference to na the study revealed an affinity preference order of k na ca2 mg2 for alkali and alkali earth metals and cu2 pb2 cd2 for heavy metals during the cdi treatment it was deduced that the ionic hydrated radii generally dictated the affinity preference of tested ions except cu2 and pb2 the abnormal electrosorptive behaviors of cu2 and pb2 were attributed to the complex mechanisms occurring during electrosorption such as electrodeposition and oh complexes formation beside edl charging moreover cu2 and pb2 showed significantly low desorption efficiency during electrode regeneration which implied serious fouling potential during the cdi treatment this work provides fundamental aspects on individual removal of metal ions and the findings can be beneficially used as a reference for the treatment of industrial effluents by cdi acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the start up fund provided by college of natural sciences and

14498,microbial fuel cells mfcs were the first bioelectrochemical systems to have been intensively studied and applied in this study two double chamber mfcs mfc1 and mfc2 identically designed and

tracer tests 21 22 as well with cfd 23 25 has been conducted on mfcs however hydrodynamic studies performed so far on mfc reactors did not directly investigate possibly existing correlations between hydrodynamic behavior and mfc performance the purpose of this paper is to investigate these relationships in the case of two identically built and fed but differently performing mfcs some interesting considerations can be drawn from the study on mfc constructive methods and on the influence of internal hydrodynamics on mfc s performance 2 materials methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation two identical mfcs in this manuscript mfc1 and mfc2 were built and operated as described by cecconet et al 18 they each consisted of anodic and cathodic chamber each filled with 800 g of granular graphite

membrane cmi 7000 membranes international inc usa allowing migration of cations from the anode to the cathode external electrical connections are established by graphite rod electrodes 250 x 4 mm

continuously with dairy wastewater collected periodically from a nearby cheese factory and stored at 4 c using collapsible 10 l jerry cans to limit contact with the atmosphere wastewater characteristics are reported in table 1 on the account of its variability the experimentation herein described was divided in three periods each corresponding to a different composition of the industrial wastewater due to different types of ongoing production an average feeding rate of 1 l d 1 was maintained the same feeding mode was adopted at the cathode side with a solution containing trace elements and an inorganic source of carbon 507 mg l 1 nah2po4 819 mg l 1 na2hpo4 1000 mg l 1 nahco3 130 mg l 1 kcl 310 mg l 1 nh4cl and other trace elements added to a phosphate buffer solution pbs 10 mm ph 7 to achieve the development of a biocathode 28 an internal recirculation loop of 10 l d 1 was activated in each chamber two external aeration buffers equipped with a fishtank air pump were included in the cathodic recirculation loops to obtain oxygen saturated catholyte 1 1 this approach was necessary due to the initial design of this experimental setup in a scaled up redesigned system internal recycle and mechanical aeration may not be necessary after all the catholyte left the system via an overflow in the aeration buffer the ensemble of cathode and aeration buffer will be referred from now on as cathode system the complete experimental setup is reported in fig 1 2 2 analysis and data evaluation anodic potentials were monitored with an ag agcl reference electrode 197 mv

connected to a pc overall mfc potentials were recorded with the same time interval power p was determined from continuous current i and voltage measurement v current and power densities were then calculated dividing the respective value of i and p by the nac volume of each compartment anodic coulombic efficiency ce was computed as described in molognoni et al 16 determination of effluent cod one sample per mfc at intervals of 3 4 days and wastewater influent cod one common sample for every feed bag refill was performed using a spectrophotometer hi83224 wastewater treatment photometer hanna instruments italy samples were stored at 4 c prior to analysis for no more than 48 h organic matter removal efficiency ηcod was determined as described in molognoni et al 29 conductivity and ph

to 10 44 h for both anode and cathode chambers on the other hand t for the cathode system was determined as 14 76 h due to the aeration buffers additional volume the normalized energy recovery ner of the mfcs a parameter that expresses the amount of energy recovered per removed mass of cod ners kwh kgcodrem 1 and per volume of treated wastewater nerv kwh m 3 treated was calculated for each period and for the total experiment with the following equations as proposed in ge et al 30 1 n e r v p t v t r e a t e d 2 n e r s p t k g c o d r e m o v e d 2 3 tracer test apparatus and procedure hydrodynamic tests were performed on mfc1 and mfc2 from past studies it was known that two identical mfcs could express significantly different performances due to random local phenomena 18 to perform rtd analysis three pulse tests were conducted on each mfc simultaneously for both anode and cathode chambers with a solution of distilled water containing 1 m nacl as tracer it was necessary to perform the tests simultaneously for both chambers to maintain a stable electrolytic equilibrium between anode and cathode and to avoid excessive cation transport through the membrane nacl was chosen due of its low cost wide availability and its conservative properties i e not biodegradable nor subject to adsorption onto biomass 31 in addition nacl is not detrimental to biomass performance 32 nacl concentration was measured indirectly using a conductivity probe the same used for ordinary conductivity measurements a 10 ml volume of tracer solution was injected directly in each of the anode and cathode influent sections performing mass balances for each test to ensure test reliability and detect any losses of tracer an automatic sampling and measuring system connected to the data acquisition pc was developed to follow pulse tests responses the conductivity probes were located after the aeration buffer prior to the effluent tank in the case of the cathode system while in the case of the anode the sampling system was located after its outlet prior to the effluent tank as shown in fig 1 the main results obtained from tracer tests are normalized curves c t adimensional defining the concentration of the tracer in the reactor at time t c t is calculated as the ratio of the concentration of tracer measured in the effluent c t gnacl l 1 and p which is the area below the c t curve 3

to represent mfc hydrodynamic behavior cstr equations 26 were fitted to observed tracer data initially referred to single cstr curves shown in equation 5 and continuing with multiple reactors in series equation 6 with possible dead space presence equations 7 and 8 respectively for single and multiple reactors in series 5 c 1 t e t t 6 c 1 t i 1 n 1 t t i n 1 e t t i 7 c 1 1 v d t e t 1 v d t 8 c 1 1 v d t i 1 n 1 t 1 v d t i n 1 e t 1 v d t i where n is the number of reactors in series t i is the hrt for each of the n reactors in series and vd is the dead volume a two step procedure based on the minimization of the ssr sum of squared residuals was followed to identify best fit values for n and an eventual presence of dead space vd in the 1st step c t was compared to the calculated c m t the curve corresponding to a series of m cstrs in the assumption of vd 0 n was calculated as the m that would minimize 9 s s r n i 1 n c t i c m t i 2 where c t i is the normalized concentration of the tracer leaving the system at time t and c m t i is the computed value using the corresponding m cstrs in series curve equation then in the 2nd step once n had been determined c t was compared to the calculated c n v t the curve correspondent to n cstrs in series with a dead volume v vd was computed as the v that would minimize 10 s s r v d i 1 n c t i c n v t i 2 where c n v t i is the calculated value of c n v t at time t analyzing the anode of a similar mfc vilà rovira et al 23 concluded that velocity distribution in the chamber was not uniform being higher in its central part and along the recirculation line due to the difference in influent effluent flow rate and recirculation flow rate this velocity distribution heterogeneity prevented an immediate diffusion of the tracer in the input and output zones therefore data concerning the first hour of the test were specifically ignored in the present study at the conclusions of the tests the mfcs were dismantled and their internal configuration e g position and dislocation of granular graphite was investigated 3 results and discussion 3 1 electric production during the 1st period high loads of organic matter induced good electric performance as shown in fig 2 by the voltage generated by the mfcs the considerable current decrease on day 4 in mfc2 was due to a feed interruption caused by the rupture of a conduit in the feeding system oscillations in the 1st period are caused by short duration pipe plug ups induced by feed density at the beginning of the 3rd period a drop in electric production of both mfcs was noticed caused by high ph 11 of the wastewater causing temporary biomass inhibition 33 the anolyte ph was then conditioned to a value around 7 for the remaining duration of the 3rd period electric production was generally better for mfc1 with the exception of the last 15 days of testing current density varied between 6 98 a m 3 and 37 21 a m 3 for mfc1 while in the case of mfc2 the reported values were in the range 4 65 32 56 a m 3 average power densities are reported as 12 21 w m 3 for mfc1 and 9 11 w m 3 for mfc2 table 2 in the 1st and 2nd period potential at the anode of both mfcs stabilized around 100 mv vs she the cathodic potential varied between 400 and 300 mv vs she for mfc1 and between 300 and 200 mv vs she for mfc2 fig 3 strong oscillations of anode and cathode potentials of both the mfcs were reported in the 3rd period due to varying wastewater characteristics 3 2 organic matter removal efficiency mfc1 and mfc2 showed the same behavior in terms of organic matter removal efficiency with slightly better performance shown by mfc2 mfc1 achieved cod removal of 77 12 against 80 9 of mfc2 fig 4 in each period cod removal of mfc2 was higher than that obtained by mfc1 table 3 ce values were strongly variable depending on applied olr the highest ce values 24 6 30 4 for mfc1 and 15 4 16 5 for mfc2 were obtained in presence of low olrs 1 22 1 4 kg cod m 3 d 1 while the lowest ces 2 8 for mfc1 and 1 9 for mfc2 were observed at high olr 10 4 kgcod m 3 d 1 it was indeed reported from previous studies that in presence of elevated olr mfcs tend to develop methanogenic biomass component which is in competition with eabs and thus decreases the mfc s electric efficiency 34 while at lower olrs eabs demonstrate higher growth rate due to more favorable kinetics 33 35 it has been reported that while electric current generation may suffer from competing internal methane production overall organic matter removal may remain the same or even higher due to this additional removal pathway 34 3 3 hydraulic characterization results of rtd tests showed that the hydrodynamic behavior of the two mfcs can in fact be appropriately described by cstr models in the case of the anodic chambers of both mfcs fig 5 a and c rtd curves demonstrated that a single cstr reactor model described the compartment hydrodynamics in case of the cathode chambers the situation was made more complex by the presence of the aeration buffers for mfc1 tests showed that the cathode system s behavior was similar to that of 2 cstr reactors in series i e the presence of the small aeration volume in series acts as an additional cstr on the other hand for mfc2 hydrodynamics could be assimilated to a single cstr reactor dead space volume was calculated for each chamber results are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that no significant dead volumes developed in the anode chambers the situation is different for the cathodes mfc1 showed an overall dead space estimated in the range 9 13 according to the best fit 2 reactors in series model mfc2 showed different dead space values estimated in different tests concerning the cathode systems dead volume estimated seemed linked with the variability in time of the liquid volumes contained in the aeration buffers a notable fact was that even if both mfcs are identically designed built and operated rtd tests disclosed different hydrodynamics behaviors with the mfc2 cathode and aeration buffer acting as a single cstr evidence found after dismantling the system suggested that small previously undetected obstructions in pressure lines or small flaws in construction may have cause fluid backup and disrupted uniform hydraulic system behavior 3 4 internal configuration forensic examination other than performance in terms of electric production organic matter removal and hydrodynamics internal configuration of mfcs was visually examined in autopsy mode to gain a deeper understanding of their behavior during operation in mfc2 graphite filler granules in the compartment volume appeared to have been compacted by flow effects leaving a 2 5 cm empty volume at the top of the compartment corresponding to a 14 compaction of filler volume this effect was limited to only 1 cm of empty space 5 in mfc1 furthermore mfc2 was not systematically filled with catholyte as its level fluctuated between the top of the chamber and the level of granular graphite lower than the level of the compartment s overflow discharge from mfc2 cathode chamber to the aeration buffer was possible only when the chamber was completely full ending when the level reached the level of the graphite fig 6 consequently catholyte reached the aeration buffer only intermittently the majority of it being discharged to the effluent holding tank almost immediately without being recirculated to the cathode in contrast discharge from mfc1 s cathode chamber to the respective aeration buffer in mfc1 was regular allowing circulation of a less exhausted catholyte and full volume utilization of the cathode system flow rate measurements over recirculation loops confirmed the difference within the two cathodic systems in mfc1 recirculation rate was measured as 9 8 0 3 l d 1 close to the design value while in the other mfc the rate was irregular with values between 8 5 and 10 0 l d 1 as this difference could not be completely ascribed to the pumping circuit both mfcs were operated with the same pump motor but with two different rotor heads in series it could also be ascribed to the hydrodynamic differences in the compartments and to the possible development of preferential flow pathways the discrepancy in hydraulic behavior and in the displacement and compaction of graphite granules happened despite mfc1 and mfc2 were identically built and operated and may suggest that the use of granular graphite electrodes due to their characteristics can lead to the absence of hydrodynamics invariance and a related difference in performance 3 5 relationships between hydrodynamic behavior and mfc performances the influence of hydrodynamics on mfc performance can be related mostly to the amount of dead space identified by the tracer test procedure results showed that in mfc2 dead space percentage was higher than that in mfc1 in two out of three tests leading to reduction in cathode performances and thus affecting overall performance as in any chemical or biochemical reactor the amount of dead space must be minimized to increase overall performance 25 its presence decreases the available bioelectrochemical reaction volume affecting the exchange of substrate and products between the biofilm and the suspension and slowing down overall reaction velocity at equal unit reaction rates 24 in a previous study on an identical mfcs system cecconet et al 18 identified the highest energy loss in the cathodes 35 and 39 respectively for mfc1 and mfc2 the discrepancy between the assumed hydrodynamics of the cathode system and its effective behavior in this experimentation s mfc2 could explain the reduced effectiveness of the cathode furthermore the fluctuating dead space amount in mfc2 cathode chamber indicates that a non negligible part of the granular graphite filling is not properly reached by the catholyte flow or reached discontinuously leading to non optimal growth of the cathode biofilm and to reduced transmission of the generated electrons through the external circuit additionally heterogeneity of the flux can lead to a non uniform distribution of the biomass in the chamber as reported in pous et al 36 biomass in mfc1 cathode appears more stable and resistant to changes in operational conditions e g composition of the influent than that in mfc2 and this is reflected by its better electric production by contrast mfc2 shows better organic matter removal performance due to the activity of competitive biomass methanogenic with better performance at high olr 3 6 consequences on the design and scaling up of future mfc systems the findings of this study can influence the design of future mfc reactors aiming at a better performance in terms of both organic matter removal and electric production as shown anode chambers behaved like real cstr reactors in absence of dead spaces very closely to the intended design this means that the adopted design is relatively functional and would likely work even at scaled up size on the contrary the system composed by cathode and aeration buffer showed different behaviors in the two mfcs and in both exhibited a variable but non negligible fraction of dead volume therefore some additional consideration on this matter could be appropriate it was in fact ascertained that in mfc2 the aeration buffer had been bypassed by most of the catholyte while oxygen was sufficiently supplied to the cathode providing the desired terminal electron acceptor the oxygen supply was in fact way in excess of actual requirements the initial design of the system contemplated the possibility of excess oxygenation of the catholyte due to the difficulties of regulating it precisely at this test scale however in future upscaling of the reactor design oxygenation could be significantly reduced without negative impact on the process possibly supplied by simple gravity oxygenation of the catholyte itself cathode electrode and aeration system should be consolidated in the same reactor volume to overcome problems linked with a non optimal catholyte recirculation between compartments dismissing the symmetrical design of commonly used rectangular methacrylate mfcs thus to improve overall mfc performance the cathode system should be optimized to increase biocathode efficiency visual and tracer tests inexpensive and relatively simple should be performed regularly to assess variations of the internal chamber configurations such as gravity and flow driven compaction of granular graphite fillers possibly lead to a graphite free spaces in the upper part of a mfc formation of dead space could also be monitored via this operation evaluation of different filler materials should also be performed as seen graphite is subject to compaction and displacement is addition to possess non scalable properties 37 38 it is therefore difficult to imagine foolproof scale up designs in these circumstances conductive engineered fillers should therefore be investigated the application of 3d additive manufacturing has been recently proposed as a way to offer an higher degree of design freedom and increase the rapidity in prototyping 39 40 cfd simulations may help in the optimization of the process and in particular in the determination of the effects on the hydrodynamic behavior of the use of different conductive materials and in the connected substrate distribution 23 mfc modelling has reached a good level of development allowing the simulation of substrate depletion and energy production 41 44 the integration of cfd with existing bioelectrochemical models may lead to a deeper understanding of the interaction between hydrodynamics and performance of mfcs 4 conclusions hydrodynamic characterization of two identically designed and operated mfcs treating dairy wastewater using rtd tests was assessed showing different behavior of the two cathode systems while anodes showed no substantial performance differences the differences in electric production and removal efficiencies observed in this study could be related to the disparities of hydrodynamic behavior of the cathode systems in the two mfc which contributed to the generation of a relevant amount of dead volume in mfc2 s cathode it is a fact that the most critical aspect in mfcs industrial applications lays in the uncertainty of system scale up methodologies rather than in the microbiology of these systems the absence of hydrodynamics invariance in mfcs equipped with granular graphite electrodes suggests that their scaling up is dependent on factors that cannot be suitably controlled and therefore may not guarantee performance replication while granular graphite is considered a suitable material for inexpensive assembly of research laboratory mfcs its use in industrial systems should be avoided in favor of materials for which hydrodynamic invariance effects could be more exactly predicted

one sample per mfc at intervals of 3 4 days and wastewater influent cod one common sample for every feed bag refill was performed using a spectrophotometer hi83224 wastewater treatment photometer hanna instruments italy samples were stored at 4 c prior to analysis for no more than 48 h organic matter removal efficiency ηcod was determined as described in molognoni et al 29 conductivity and ph were measured at least once every 5 days for both anode and cathode influents and effluents intellical probes hqd digital meter hach lange italy identical conductivity probes were used for the rtd tests anodic organic loading rate olr was calculated as the daily organic matter concentration in terms of cod divided by the anode s hydraulic retention time hrt t the value of t was calculated equal to 10 44 h for both anode and cathode chambers on the other hand t for the cathode system was determined as 14 76 h due to the aeration buffers additional volume the normalized energy recovery ner of the mfcs a parameter that expresses the amount of energy recovered per removed mass of cod ners kwh kgcodrem 1 and per volume of treated wastewater nerv kwh m 3 treated was calculated for each period and for the total experiment with the following equations as proposed in ge et al 30 1 n e r v p t v t r e a t e d 2 n e r s p t k g c o d r e m o v e d 2 3 tracer test apparatus and procedure hydrodynamic tests were performed on mfc1 and mfc2 from past studies it was known that two identical mfcs could express significantly different performances due to random local phenomena 18 to perform rtd analysis three pulse tests were conducted on each mfc simultaneously for both anode and cathode chambers with a solution of distilled water containing 1 m nacl as tracer it was necessary to perform the tests simultaneously for both chambers to maintain a stable electrolytic equilibrium between anode and cathode and to avoid excessive cation transport through the membrane nacl was chosen due of its low cost wide availability and its conservative properties i e not biodegradable nor subject to adsorption onto biomass 31 in addition nacl is not detrimental to biomass performance 32 nacl concentration was measured indirectly using a conductivity probe the same used for ordinary conductivity measurements a 10 ml volume of tracer solution was injected directly in each of the anode and cathode influent sections performing mass balances for each test to ensure test reliability and detect any losses of tracer an automatic sampling and measuring system connected to the data acquisition pc was developed to follow pulse tests responses the conductivity probes were located after the aeration buffer prior to the effluent tank in the case of the cathode system while in the case of the anode the sampling system was located after its outlet prior to the effluent tank as shown in fig 1 the main results obtained from tracer tests are normalized curves c t adimensional defining the concentration of the tracer in the reactor at time t c t is calculated as the ratio of the concentration of tracer measured in the effluent c t gnacl l 1 and p which is the area below the c t curve 3

to represent mfc hydrodynamic behavior cstr equations 26 were fitted to observed tracer data initially referred to single cstr curves shown in equation 5 and continuing with multiple reactors in

8 c 1 1 v d t i 1 n 1 t 1 v d t i n 1 e t 1 v d t i where n is the number of reactors in series t i is the hrt for each of the n reactors in series and vd is the dead volume a two step procedure based on the minimization of the ssr sum of squared residuals was followed to identify best fit values for n and an eventual presence of dead space vd in the 1st step c t was compared to the calculated c m

the tracer leaving the system at time t and c m t i is the computed value using the corresponding m cstrs in series curve equation then in the 2nd step once n had been determined c t was compared to the calculated c n v t the curve correspondent to n cstrs in series with a dead volume v vd was computed as the v that would minimize 10 s s r v d i 1 n c t i c n v t i 2 where c n v t i is the calculated value of c n v t at time t analyzing the anode of a similar mfc vilà rovira et al 23 concluded that velocity distribution in the chamber was not uniform being higher in its central part and along the recirculation line due to the difference in influent effluent flow rate and recirculation flow rate this velocity distribution heterogeneity prevented an immediate diffusion of the tracer in the input and output zones therefore data concerning the first hour of the test were specifically ignored in the present study at the conclusions of the tests the mfcs were dismantled and their internal configuration e g position and dislocation of granular graphite was investigated 3 results and discussion 3 1 electric production during the 1st period high loads of organic matter induced good electric performance as shown in fig 2 by the voltage generated by the mfcs the considerable current decrease on day 4 in mfc2 was due to a feed interruption caused by the rupture of a conduit in the feeding system oscillations in the 1st period are caused by short duration pipe plug ups induced by feed density at the beginning of the 3rd period a drop in electric production of both mfcs was noticed caused by high ph 11 of the wastewater causing temporary biomass inhibition 33 the anolyte ph was then conditioned to a value around 7 for the remaining duration of the 3rd period electric production was generally better for mfc1 with the exception of the last 15 days of testing current density varied between 6 98 a m 3 and 37 21 a m 3 for mfc1 while in the case of mfc2 the reported values were in the range 4 65 32 56 a m 3 average power densities are reported as 12 21 w m 3 for mfc1 and 9 11 w m 3 for mfc2 table 2 in the 1st and 2nd period potential at the anode of both mfcs stabilized around 100 mv vs she the cathodic potential varied between 400 and 300 mv vs she for mfc1 and between 300 and 200 mv vs she for mfc2 fig 3 strong oscillations of anode and cathode potentials of both the mfcs were reported in the 3rd period due to varying wastewater characteristics 3 2 organic matter removal efficiency mfc1 and mfc2 showed the same behavior in terms of organic matter removal efficiency with slightly better performance shown by mfc2 mfc1 achieved cod removal of 77 12 against 80 9 of mfc2 fig 4 in each period cod removal of mfc2 was higher than that obtained by mfc1 table 3 ce values were strongly variable depending on applied olr the highest ce values 24 6 30 4 for mfc1 and 15 4 16 5 for mfc2 were obtained in presence of low olrs 1 22 1 4 kg cod m 3 d 1 while the lowest ces 2 8 for mfc1 and 1 9 for mfc2 were observed at high olr 10 4 kgcod m 3 d 1 it was indeed reported from previous studies that in presence of elevated olr mfcs tend to develop methanogenic biomass component which is in competition with eabs and thus decreases the mfc s electric efficiency 34 while at lower olrs eabs demonstrate higher growth rate due to more favorable kinetics 33 35 it has been reported that while electric current generation may suffer from competing internal methane production overall organic matter removal may remain the same or even higher due to this additional removal pathway 34 3 3 hydraulic characterization results of rtd tests showed that the hydrodynamic behavior of the two mfcs can in fact be appropriately described by cstr models in the case of the anodic chambers of both mfcs fig 5 a and c rtd curves demonstrated that a single cstr reactor model described the compartment hydrodynamics in case of the cathode chambers the situation was made more complex by the presence of the aeration buffers for mfc1 tests showed that the cathode system s behavior was similar to that of 2 cstr reactors in series i e the presence of the small aeration volume in series acts as an additional cstr on the other hand for mfc2 hydrodynamics could be assimilated to a single cstr reactor dead space volume was calculated for each chamber results are shown in table 4 table 4 shows that no significant dead volumes developed in the anode chambers the situation is different for the cathodes mfc1 showed an overall dead space estimated in the range 9 13 according to the best fit 2 reactors in series model mfc2 showed different dead space values estimated in different tests concerning the cathode systems dead volume estimated seemed linked with the variability in time of the liquid volumes contained in the aeration buffers a notable fact was that even if both mfcs are identically designed built and operated rtd tests disclosed different hydrodynamics behaviors with the mfc2 cathode and aeration buffer acting as a single cstr evidence found after dismantling the system suggested that small previously undetected obstructions in pressure lines or small flaws in construction may have cause fluid backup and disrupted uniform hydraulic system behavior 3 4 internal configuration forensic examination other than performance in terms of electric production organic matter removal and hydrodynamics internal configuration of mfcs was visually examined in autopsy mode to gain a deeper understanding of their behavior during operation in mfc2 graphite filler granules in the compartment volume appeared to have been compacted by flow effects leaving a 2 5 cm empty volume at the top of the compartment corresponding to a 14 compaction of filler volume this effect was limited to only 1 cm of empty space 5 in mfc1 furthermore mfc2 was not systematically filled with catholyte as its level fluctuated between the top of the chamber and the level of granular graphite lower than the level of the compartment s overflow discharge from mfc2 cathode chamber to the aeration buffer was possible only when the chamber was completely full ending when the level reached the level of the graphite fig 6 consequently catholyte reached the aeration buffer only intermittently the majority of it being discharged to the effluent holding tank almost immediately without being recirculated to the cathode in contrast discharge from mfc1 s cathode chamber to the respective aeration buffer in mfc1 was regular allowing circulation of a less exhausted catholyte and full volume utilization of the cathode system flow rate measurements over recirculation loops confirmed the difference within the two cathodic systems in mfc1 recirculation rate was measured as 9 8 0 3 l d 1 close to the design value while in the other mfc the rate was irregular with values between 8 5 and 10 0 l d 1 as this difference could not be completely ascribed to the pumping circuit both mfcs were operated with the same pump motor but with two different rotor heads in series it could also be ascribed to the hydrodynamic differences in the compartments and to the possible development of preferential flow pathways the discrepancy in hydraulic behavior and in the displacement and compaction of graphite granules happened despite mfc1 and mfc2 were identically built and operated and may suggest that the use of granular graphite electrodes due to their characteristics can lead to the absence of hydrodynamics invariance and a related difference in performance 3 5 relationships between hydrodynamic behavior and mfc performances the influence of hydrodynamics on mfc performance can be related mostly to the amount of dead space identified by the tracer test procedure results showed that in mfc2 dead space percentage was higher than that in mfc1 in two out of three tests leading to reduction in cathode performances and thus affecting overall performance as in any chemical or biochemical reactor the amount of dead space must be minimized to increase overall performance 25 its presence decreases the available bioelectrochemical reaction volume affecting the exchange of substrate and products between the biofilm and the suspension and slowing down overall reaction velocity at equal unit reaction rates 24 in a previous study on an identical mfcs system cecconet et al 18 identified the highest energy loss in the cathodes 35 and 39 respectively for mfc1 and mfc2 the discrepancy between the assumed hydrodynamics of the cathode system and its effective behavior in this experimentation s mfc2 could explain the reduced effectiveness of the cathode furthermore the fluctuating dead space amount in mfc2 cathode chamber indicates that a non negligible part of the granular graphite filling is not properly reached by the catholyte flow or reached discontinuously leading to non optimal growth of the cathode biofilm and to reduced transmission of the generated electrons through the external circuit additionally heterogeneity of the flux can lead to a non uniform distribution of the biomass in the chamber as reported in pous et al 36 biomass in mfc1 cathode appears more stable and resistant to changes in operational conditions e g composition of the influent than that in mfc2 and this is reflected by its better electric production by contrast mfc2 shows better organic matter removal performance due to the activity of competitive biomass methanogenic with better performance at high olr 3 6 consequences on the design and scaling up of future mfc systems the findings of this study can influence the design of future mfc reactors aiming at a better performance in terms of both organic matter removal and electric production as shown anode chambers behaved like real cstr reactors in absence of dead spaces very closely to the intended design this means that the adopted design is relatively functional and would likely work even at scaled up size on the contrary the system composed by cathode and aeration buffer showed different behaviors in the two mfcs and in both exhibited a variable but non negligible fraction of dead volume therefore some additional consideration on this matter could be appropriate it was in fact ascertained that in mfc2 the aeration buffer had been bypassed by most of the catholyte while oxygen was sufficiently supplied to the cathode providing the desired terminal electron acceptor the oxygen supply was in fact way in excess of actual requirements the initial design of the system contemplated the possibility of excess oxygenation of the catholyte due to the difficulties of regulating it precisely at this test scale however in future upscaling of the reactor design oxygenation could be significantly reduced without negative impact on the process possibly supplied by simple gravity oxygenation of the catholyte itself cathode electrode and aeration system should be consolidated in the same reactor volume to overcome problems linked with a non optimal catholyte recirculation between compartments dismissing the symmetrical design of commonly used rectangular methacrylate mfcs thus to improve overall mfc performance the cathode system should be optimized to increase biocathode efficiency visual and tracer tests inexpensive and relatively simple should be performed regularly to assess variations of the internal chamber configurations such as gravity and flow driven compaction of granular graphite fillers possibly lead to a graphite free spaces in the upper part of a mfc formation of dead space could also be monitored via this operation evaluation of different filler materials should also be performed as seen graphite is subject to compaction and displacement is addition to possess non scalable properties 37 38 it is therefore difficult to imagine foolproof scale up designs in these circumstances conductive engineered fillers should therefore be investigated the application of 3d additive manufacturing has been recently proposed as a way to offer an higher degree of design freedom and increase the rapidity in prototyping 39 40 cfd simulations may help in the optimization of the process and in particular in the determination of the effects on the hydrodynamic behavior of the use of different conductive materials and in the connected substrate distribution 23 mfc modelling has reached a good level of development allowing the simulation of substrate depletion and energy production 41 44 the integration of cfd with existing bioelectrochemical models may lead to a deeper understanding of the interaction between hydrodynamics and performance of mfcs 4 conclusions hydrodynamic characterization of two identically designed and operated mfcs treating dairy wastewater using rtd tests was assessed showing different behavior of the two cathode systems while anodes showed no substantial performance differences the differences in electric production and removal efficiencies observed in this study could be related to the disparities of hydrodynamic behavior of the cathode systems in the two mfc which contributed to the generation of a relevant amount of dead volume in mfc2 s cathode it is a fact that the most critical aspect in mfcs industrial applications lays in the uncertainty of system scale up methodologies rather than in the microbiology of these systems the absence of hydrodynamics invariance in mfcs equipped with granular graphite electrodes suggests that their scaling up is dependent on factors that cannot be suitably controlled and therefore may not guarantee performance replication while granular graphite is considered a suitable material for inexpensive assembly of research laboratory mfcs its use in industrial systems should be avoided in favor of materials for which hydrodynamic invariance effects could be more exactly predicted

14499,typical chemical precipitation methods using lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and sodium sulfide na2s for removals of heavy metals i e zn ii cu ii and pb ii from aqueous solutions were compared by jar tests a focus was especially given to particle size differences and chemical phase conversion of precipitates a removal of 99 99 from aqueous solutions with three precipitants was achieved for copper and zinc at an initial concentration of 100 mg l and lead was efficiently removed 99 75 by sodium sulfide in contrast the maximal lead removals with lime or soda ash precipitation were only 76 14 and 97 78 the mean particle size of precipitates was in the range of 55 nm 45 μm depending on properties of precipitants and heavy metal to precipitant ratios the settling performance of the sludge derived from precipitation was dominated by particle size and zeta potential of precipitates it was observed that ultra fine copper sulfide particles resulted from the precipitation were around 55 nm and did not settle in 12 h due to electrostatic repulsion force between particles the main compounds in the sludge obtained from precipitation were metal hydroxides and metal sulfides however spontaneous dehydration of metal hydroxide oxidation of sulfide and atmospheric carbonation were identified by means of xrd and thermal analyses which is invaluable to the disposal and utilization of the sludge keywords heavy metal precipitation sludge characteristics particle size solid liquid separation 1 introduction heavy metal bearing wastewater discharged into environment have disastrous impacts on surface water ground water sediment and soil 1 2 to remove heavy metals from the contaminated wastewater various treatment approaches such as chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation ion flotation adsorption ion exchange and membrane filtration have been employed 3 6 of these methods chemical precipitation is most widely practiced in industry mainly for the simplicity of process control effective over a wide range of temperature and low cost of operation it employs ph adjustment to convert heavy metal ions to hydroxide sulfide carbonates or other less soluble compounds which then can be removed by physical means such as sedimentation flotation or filtration these processes depend on the size density and surface charge of particles to be removed 7 9 common inorganic precipitants used for heavy metal precipitation are lime ca oh 2 caustic soda naoh soda ash na2co3 sodium bicarbonate na hco3 2 sodium sulfide na2s and sodium hydrosulfide nahs the selection of these chemicals should be able to meet the maximum contaminant level mcl standards or to reach the desired final concentration required for recycling 10 13 heavy metals exhibit divergent precipitation behavior at different ph as the ph affects the solubility of metals 14 18 on the other hand ph is dependent on pollutants in wastewater and the dosage of precipitants which should be constantly monitored and controlled during the precipitation process the further studies on the removal effectiveness for heavy metals at a common concentration of around 100 mg l and the detailed comparison of heavy metal precipitation with typical precipitants are required as legislation for metal discharge to environment becomes more stringent and metal resources become increasingly scarce heavy metal sludge may need to be recyclable 19 the detailed understanding of chemical compounds formed in precipitation as well as possible conversion of heavy metal compounds during sludge processing is in an urgent need which is invaluable to the disposal and utilization of the sludge 20 in the present work precipitations of heavy metals namely zinc copper and lead from aqueous solutions with lime calcium hydroxide soda ash sodium carbonate and sodium sulfide were investigated effect of chemical type on the removal efficiency of heavy metals was evaluated and the settling performance of metal precipitates was compared the characteristics of sludge resulted from precipitation were discussed based on measurements of particle size and zeta potential thermal analyses and xrd examinations 2 experimental 2 1 materials aqueous solutions of copper zinc or lead were prepared in the laboratory from metal sulfates or nitrates cuso4 5h2o znso4 7h2o and pb no3 2 each metal salt was dissolved in de ionized water at a concentration of 100 mg l for precipitation studies these metal salts precipitants lime soda ash and sodium sulfide and other chemical reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade quality 2 2 method fig 1 illustrates the schematic of experiments and main operations are described as follows 2 2 1 jar test jar tests with a series of five beakers 1 l each were conducted to investigate the effect of precipitant dosages on heavy metal removal at room temperature of 20 2 c in each beaker calculated dosages of lime soda ash and sodium sulfide were added into heavy metal solutions which were then fast stirred for 3 min followed by gentle stirring for 7 min using magnetic stirring rode to promote coagulation and agglomeration suspension samples of 30 ml at different settling time were drawn from the supernatant in the beaker using a syringe for turbidity measurements using turbid meter wgz 1 desktop scattering light turbid meter volumetric method was used to estimate the volume of the decanted sludge the sludge volume was determined using a graduated cylinder 50 ml at different settling time the ph was monitored by phs 3d digital ph meter calibrated by buffer solutions of known value the suspensions settled for 60 min and the supernatants nearly 1 cm below the water surface was collected using a syringe and filtered through 0 45 μm membranes acidified by nitric acid and analyzed using z 200 series polarized zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer according to requirements of china standards for heavy metal analyses 21 it was calibrated for each element using the standard solution of known concentration before sample injection the detection limits of the equipment were 0 01 mg l 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l for cu pb and zn within a relative error of 5 with standard metal solutions all measurements of metal concentrations were done in triplicates and the arithmetic mean concentrations of heavy metals were reported 2 2 2 particle size measurement of precipitate the particle size of precipitates was measured using laser diffraction technique malvern zetasizer model nano zs and coulter ls13320 with the suspension at the end of stir particle size was mean particle size automatically calculated based on the size distribution function size fraction frequency and measurements were conducted under the same conditions as jar tests of the precipitation to compare effects of precipitants and precipitant dosages 2 2 3 zeta potential measurement of precipitate zeta potential of particle relates the magnitude of electrical charge surrounding the colloidal particles and is a key factor in understanding the stability of particles in suspensions 20 22 in this work gg317 zeta meter 3 0 micro electrophoresis apparatus was used to measure zeta potential of precipitates with suspensions zeta potential of particles was determined by the particle velocity which was induced by a potential difference across the capillary cell containing the suspension sample 2 2 4 xrd examinations the precipitates were dried at 60 c for 24 h and ground below 30 μm and then analyzed by d max 2550pc x ray powder diffraction apparatus xrd operating parameters were as follows wavelength of 1 54 å voltage of 40 kv current of 200 ma 2θ scan range of 3 90 step length of 0 02 and time of 10 s per step 2 2 5 thermal analyses thermal analyses were used to identify chemical compounds in precipitates as some chemical compounds may be amorphous or very poorly crystallized particles which cannot be detected by xrd when the sample is heated the chemical decomposition or dehydration may give information of chemical compositions based on the mass loss and heat evolution in thermal analyses with wrt 2 apparatus shanghai kexue instrument co ltd tg shows the weight loss during the heating process while dtg identifies the main reaction that occurred the samples of each metal precipitates dried at a temperature of 60 c for 72 h were ground below 30 μm and then placed in the rhodium platinum crucible of 5 8 mm diameter and 4 mm high during the examination the samples were subjected to heating rate of 20 c min under flowing nitrogen gas 80 cm3 min in the temperature range of 30 900 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 zinc system the calculated amount of precipitant at different stoichiometric molar ratios of zinc to precipitant shown in table 1 was weighed accurately and added into five batches of solutions containing zinc ii ions the treated wastewater settled for 60 min and then the supernatant was analyzed for zinc concentrations adding lime to adjust the ph value to 11 2 zinc concentration could be reduced to below the maximum effluent discharge standards of 2 mg l at a lime dosage of 170 mg l table 1 the reaction equation eq 1 depicts this precipitation 1 zn2 aq so4 2 aq ca oh 2 aq zn oh 2 s caso4 2h2o s as shown in table 1 if lime dosage exceeded 170 mg l the ph increased approximately to 12 leading to the dissolution of zinc hydroxide eq 2 as a result zinc removal decreased from 99 65 to 98 31 2 zn oh 2 s 2oh aq zn oh 4 2 aq at a na2co3 to zn2 molar ratio of 2 324 mg l of soda ash the ph increased to 9 3 and maximal zinc removal of 99 96 occurred however chemical reaction eq 3 may not occur and the precipitation mechanism could be described by eq 4 this was supported by results of thermal analyses and xrd given in the latter part of this section 3 zn2 aq na2co3 aq znco3 s 2na aq 4 zn2 aq na2co3 aq h2o zn oh 2 s co2 g 2na aq it can be seen from table 1 that 99 89 of zinc removal was achieved at sulfide dosage of 735 mg l if sulfide addition exceeded 918 mg l the ph increased above 11 resulting in a decrease tendency in the removal efficiency the stoichiometric equation of zinc sulfide precipitation is given in eq 5 5 zn2 aq na2s aq zns s 2na aq low effluent turbidity was observed across the particle zeta potential range between 3 37 mv and 14 84 mv table 1 as absolute value of negative zeta potentials increased the effluent turbidity increased significantly since suspended particles became effectively stabilized in the water due to mutual electrostatic repulsion in all the three precipitants applied the zeta potential of particles became more negative with an increase in the precipitant dosage table 1 fig 2 shows the turbidity variation of treated zinc solution during settling the turbidity from lime or soda ash treated effluent was very low and settling was fast while sodium sulfide treated effluents were slower in settling and the turbidity was stable after 15 min of sedimentation fig 3 shows sedimentation curves of zinc precipitates at different precipitant dosages the particle size of precipitates was measured to explain the settling behavior of precipitates as shown in fig 4 the particle size of precipitates using lime and soda ash as precipitants was around 35 μm at precipitant to zinc molar ratios of 1 3 and did not vary for 12 h however the particle size of zinc precipitates with sodium sulfide was dependent on sodium sulfide dosages it decreased significantly with the increment of sodium sulfide dosages at sodium sulfide to zinc molar ratios of 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 mean particle sizes of precipitates were 21 21 μm 23 74 μm 776 nm 470 nm and 268 nm respectively according to crystallization theory nucleation and growth of particles depends on super saturation level of the solution the greater of saturation number si lg ion activity product lgksp the greater the rate of particle nucleation low concentration of precipitant tends to promote particle growth on preexisting solids while the high concentration leads to the rapid formation of new solid particles which increases the particle number and reduces the particle size 23 note that the particle size did not vary due to the mutual electrostatic repulsion between particles table 1 according to x ray diffraction results shown in fig 5 when lime was added zinc precipitates consisted of calcite caco3 and zincite zno zincite formation was due to the dehydration of zinc hydroxide and the presence of caco3 was attributed to the atmospheric carbonation during the precipitation process zinc precipitates generated by addition of soda ash were mainly composed of zincite while the main crystal phase was sphalerite zns if sodium sulfide was added according to x ray diffraction examinations solubility limiting phases of zinc systems were typically of zincite and sphalerite a similar phenomenon has been observed previously by baltpurvins et al 24 in addition to crystal phases amorphous zinc compounds may form possibly because the nucleation of particles occurred quickly due to very high super saturation and ions had insufficient mobility or time to undergo proper orientation and alignment the tg dtg curves obtained from zinc precipitates are presented in fig 6 which gives additional information on chemical compounds in the precipitate in the case of lime precipitation the first mass loss at 32 110 c was associated to the evaporation of surface water in the precipitate and the second step at 200 350 c was due to the decomposition of amorphous zn oh 2 whereas the third step at 370 400 c and the fourth step around 600 700 c was due to the decomposition of amorphous cazn2 oh 6 2h2o 25 which was not detected by xrd technique in the case of soda ash precipitation only one step of mass loss was evident which was attributed to the decomposition of amorphous zn oh 2 resulting in the formation of zincite in the case of sodium sulfide precipitation the mass loss at 50 200 c was due to the evaporation of surface water in precipitates and the decomposition of amorphous zn oh 2 whereas the mass loss at 650 c was due to the oxidation of sphalerite 3 2 copper system table 2 shows the average concentration of copper in the supernatant ph and the removal of copper after additions of three precipitants lime was the most efficient in removing copper and the copper concentration could be reduced to 0 01 mg l with 99 99 removal with the addition of soda ash 334 mg l to adjust the ph value to 9 3 the copper concentration reduced to 0 19 mg l when adding sodium sulfide dosage of 378 mg l to adjust the ph value to 5 5 the copper ion content could be reduced to 1 5 mg l more sodium sulfide addition resulted in copper concentration reduction to 0 11 mg l zeta potential of copper precipitate became more negative with increasing sodium sulfide and soda ash while it became less negative with more lime addition table 2 this implies that caoh ions may adsorb on the surface of precipitates as shown in fig 7 the turbidity of the treated wastewater during settling was highly dependent on the nature and dosages of precipitants the turbidity of lime and soda ash treated copper solutions increased with the increasing precipitant dosages while the turbidity of sodium sulfide treated copper solutions was nearly zero table 2 after 15 min of settling the turbidities of lime and soda ash treated copper solutions were in the range of 1 6 ntu these turbidities can meet the effluent standard regulations integrated wastewater discharge standard of china gb8978 1996 fig 8 shows the sludge volume against sedimentation time the amount recorded after 60 min of settling was depending on the dosage 8 25 ml l for lime and 15 27 ml l for soda ash it was observed that precipitates using sodium sulfide did not settle down in 12 h the particle size of copper precipitates is presented in table 3 it was very small around 55 nm and did not vary for 12 h this is the reason why the turbidity of sodium sulfide treated copper solutions was close to zero and the precipitate did not settle crystal compounds in copper precipitates were qualitatively analyzed using xrd and results are shown in fig 9 in the case of lime precipitation the main crystal compounds in precipitates were tenorite cuo and gypsum caso4 2h2o cuo formation was due to spontaneous dehydration of cu oh 2 in the case of soda ash precipitation posnjakite cu4 so4 oh 6 2h2o and tenorite were identified when copper sulfate solution was mixed with sodium sulfide the most significant crystal compounds in the precipitate were covellite cus and chalcanthite cuso4 5h2o which was postulated to be the product of atmospheric oxidation of cus in the precipitates 26 27 the tg dtg curves obtained from copper precipitates are presented in fig 10 in the precipitate using lime the mass loss at 32 110 c was associated to the evaporation of surface water and the second step at 110 250 c was due to the decomposition of gypsum whereas the third step around 400 c was attributed to the dehydration of cu oh 2 and fourth step around 750 850 c was due to the decomposition of amorphous calcium carbonate which was the product of atmospheric carbonation of lime in the precipitate using soda ash four major steps of mass losses were observed the mass loss at 32 110 c was associated to the evaporation of surface water the second and third mass loss steps may arise from the decomposition of posnjakite cu4 so4 oh 6 2h2o resulting in the formation of cuso4 the last mass loss at 700 830 c was due to the decomposition of cuso4 leading to the formation of cuo as shown in fig 10c six major mass loss peaks were observed for sodium sulfide precipitation the mass loss at 30 110 c was due to loss of surface water in the sludge and the mass loss at 200 400 c was due to the decomposition of chalcanthite cuso4 5h2o 3 3 lead system table 4 shows the average concentration of lead in the supernatant ph and the removal of lead after the addition of three precipitants a removal of 76 was attained after adding 89 mg l of lime more addition of lime resulted in a dramatic decrease of lead removals since more lime led into an increase in ph and resulted in lead hydroxide to dissolve into the solution as shown in table 4 the optimum soda ash dosage for lead precipitation was in the range of 51 77 mg l lead removal of up to 99 7 was attained after addition of 174 mg l of sodium sulfide as more sodium sulfide was added ph of the solution increased to above 10 and hence resulted in the reduction of lead removal the precipitating agent used for removing lead ions from solutions exhibited significant influence on the resulting sludge and turbidity table 4 also shows zeta potential of precipitates suspension turbidity and ph obtained from different dosages of three precipitants negative zeta potential of precipitates increased with the precipitant dosage increase the turbidity of sodium sulfide treated solutions increased with the increasing precipitants dosage but decreased immediately after attaining optimum ph 10 maximum removal efficiency for lime treated solutions turbidity decreased with the increasing lime dosages note that soda ash treated solutions exhibited very high turbidity which was more than 200 ntu in all the three precipitants applied sodium sulfide resulted in the lowest turbidity after 60 min of sedimentation fig 11 the particle size of lead precipitates is presented in figs 12 and 13 it was found that the particle size of lead precipitates decreased significantly with the increase of sodium sulfide dosages in other words at higher dosage of sodium sulfide nucleation numbers of particles increased and particle size decreased accordingly particle size of precipitates increased with time using lime as a precipitant however the agglomeration phenomenon did not occur in 12 h for other precipitants even the mean particle size of precipitates was only 100 300 nm with high surface energy the stabilization of fine particles could be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between particles table 4 in contrast the absolute value of zeta potential of particles in lime precipitation was small this is the reason why the coagulation and agglomeration occurred using lime as a precipitant 28 fig 14 shows xrd patterns of lead precipitates using three precipitants using lime as a precipitant the crystal lead compounds in the precipitate were pb5o8 and pbo the formation of pbo was due to the dehydration of lead hydroxide and the presence of pb5o8 was attributed to the atmospheric oxidation when soda ash was added to the lead nitrate solution the precipitate generated was mainly composed of cerussite pbco3 and when sodium sulfide was added the main crystal lead compounds of the precipitate generated were lead sulfide pbs lead oxide carbonate hydroxide pb10 co3 6 oh 6o and lead sulfate pbso4 according to baltpurvins et al 24 the chemical compounds in the precipitate were dependent on anions in liquid they reported that phases of lead precipitates were typically of blixite pb4 oh 6cl2 and laurionite pb oh cl for 0 002 mol l cl and 0 100 mol l cl systems of anglesite pbso4 for 0 001 0 100 mol l so4 2 systems and of cerussite pbco3 for 0 001 0 100 mol l co3 2 systems the main chemical reactions during the precipitation process and compound conversion in the precipitate may occur as follows 6 pb2 2oh pb oh 2 7 pb oh 2 pbo h2o 8 2pbo 3pbo2 pb5o8 9 3pb oh 2 2co2 pb3 co3 2 oh 2 2h2o 10 pb3 co3 2 oh 2 h2o co2 pb10 co3 6 oh 6o 11 pb2 s2 pbs 12 pbs 2o2 pbso4 the simultaneous tg dtg curves obtained from lead precipitates are presented in fig 15 it can be seen from fig 15a and b the dehydration of lead hydroxide occurred at 250 400 c resulting in major mass loss and cerussite decomposition occurred at 400 450 c lead precipitates with sodium sulfide exhibited two mass loss steps the major mass loss occurred in the temperature range of 30 250 c which was due to the evaporation of water and the decomposition of pb oh 2 the minor mass loss at 400 500 c could be attributed to the decomposition of lead oxide carbonate hydroxide pb10 co3 6 oh 6o the decomposition reactions of lead compounds are illustrated as follows 29 13 pb10 co3 6 oh 6o pb3 co3 2 oh 2 h2o co2 14 pb3 co3 2 oh 2 pb oh 2 pbco3

compare the precipitation properties of typical heavy metals with three types of precipitants and to investigate chemical compound conversions of the resulting precipitates lime precipitation achieved an effective removal of copper and zinc by which removals can be up to 99 65 and 99 99 accordingly a considerable reduction of zn ii from 100 mg l to 0 35 mg l was noticed while cu ii was reduced from 100 mg l to 0 01 mg l which attained the chinese discharge limits 2 mg l for zinc 0 5 mg l for copper 21 lime precipitation could remove pb ii from 100 mg l to 23 90 mg l which exceeded the chinese discharge limit 0 1 mg l for pb 21 the maximal removal efficiency of zn ii cu ii and pb ii occurred at a lime dosage of 170 mg l 117 mg l and 89 mg l the residual concentrations of pb ii and zn ii exceeded the solubility of pb oh 2 and zn oh 2 the minimum concentrations of pb ii and zn ii that could theoretically be achieved by hydroxide precipitation are 2 80 mg l and 0 01 mg l this may imply that the major precipitation products were not pb oh 2 and zn oh 2 xrd examinations indicated that metal oxides were present in the precipitates carbonate precipitation was an effective treatment alternative to hydroxide precipitation the removals were 99 96 and 99 81 for zinc and copper which can be comparable to those of lime precipitation it is noted that carbonate precipitation was preferred over lime precipitation for the removal of lead resulting in much lower final residual lead concentrations the effective doses of soda ash to reach the maximal zn ii cu ii and pb ii removals were 324 mg l 334 mg l and 77 mg l respectively this process produced metal carbonates for lead and metal oxides for zinc and copper sulfide precipitation was the most effective method to treat heavy metal solutions the removal efficiency was in the sequence cu zn pb this means that the precipitation of lead ions was least effective in three metals investigated in the present work 98 89 of lead removal was achieved with an addition of 174 mg l of sodium sulfide ph 10 0 the precipitation process is ph sensitive and there is maximum ph value for every metal to precipitate out of solution if ph exceeded 11 there was a dramatic decrease in removals of zn and pb this decrease was due to the dissolution of heavy metal compounds in precipitates and the formation of soluble metal hydroxyl complexes that can increase metal solubility the maximum removal efficiency of mixed metals cannot be achieved at a single precipitation ph value this imply that multiple stages of precipitation at different ph levels may be required for real industry acid wastewater contaminated with a variety of heavy metals for zinc or copper aqueous solutions lime and soda ash precipitation exhibited a rather favorable settling speed with turbidity of the supernatant being less than 40 ntu after 60 min of settling however in the case of lead aqueous solutions precipitates formed were too small to naturally settle and the turbidity of the suspension remained high after 60 min of settling in fact lead precipitates resulted from soda ash precipitation did not settle in 12 h by comparing the sludge volume for three metals the following general ascending order was obtained for three precipitates zn cu pb in addition to copper precipitation with sodium sulfide lead formed ultra fine precipitates with soda ash that were very difficult to solid liquid separation by sedimentation the precipitate size formed at low precipitant concentrations was larger than that formed at the high precipitant concentration in practice in addition to controlling the number of nuclei to avoid the outbreak of nucleation seeds can be used as growth nucleus which may promote the growth of crystals 30 31 it may be necessary to point out that the sludge containing heavy metals resulted from the precipitation are treated by cement based solidification stabilization and then disposed by landfill in industrial practices if the leaching test results reach the landfill standards in addition the sludge may also be used as a raw material for heavy metal extraction or recycled for reuse where dissolution studies of heavy metals may be needed to satisfy the special purpose 4 conclusions three typical precipitants namely lime soda ash and sodium sulfide were used to remove copper zinc and lead from aqueous solutions in this work based on measurements of the ph particle size zeta potential of particles supernatant turbidity and sludge volume the influence of the precipitant dosage on heavy metal removals was examined based on xrd and thermal analysis results the chemical compounds and phase conversion in precipitates were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn lime was quite efficient in removing copper and zinc by which removal can be up to 99 65 and 99 99 but it was less efficient for lead removal carbonate precipitation was an effective treatment alternative to hydroxide precipitation and dissolved heavy metals can be removed from wastewaters using soda ash na2co3 the advantage of carbonate precipitation was that it can operate at a relative lower ph range typically around ph 9 sulfide precipitation by adding na2s was the most viable and efficient in removing three heavy metals investigated from aqueous solutions where 99 75 of removal was achieved and the residual concentration of heavy metals was less than 0 28 mg l which meets the stringent discharge level of 2 mg l for zinc 0 5 mg l for copper but exceeds discharge level of 0 1 mg l for lead integrated wastewater discharge standard of china gb8978 1996 the particle size of precipitates varied from precipitant to precipitant depending on heavy metal to precipitant ratios the

14499,typical chemical precipitation methods using lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and sodium sulfide na2s for removals of heavy metals i e zn ii cu ii and pb ii from aqueous solutions were compared by jar tests a focus was especially given to particle size differences and chemical phase conversion of precipitates a removal of 99 99 from aqueous solutions with three precipitants was achieved for copper and zinc at an initial concentration of 100 mg l and lead was efficiently removed 99 75 by sodium sulfide in contrast the maximal lead removals with lime or soda ash precipitation were only 76 14 and 97 78 the mean particle size of precipitates was in the range of 55 nm 45 μm depending on properties of precipitants and heavy metal to precipitant ratios the settling performance of the sludge derived from precipitation was dominated by particle size and zeta potential of precipitates it was observed that ultra fine copper sulfide particles resulted from the precipitation were around 55 nm and did not settle in 12 h due to electrostatic repulsion force between particles the main compounds in the sludge obtained from precipitation were metal hydroxides and metal sulfides however spontaneous dehydration of metal hydroxide oxidation of sulfide and atmospheric carbonation were identified by means of xrd and thermal analyses which is invaluable to the disposal and utilization of the sludge keywords heavy metal precipitation sludge characteristics particle size solid liquid separation 1 introduction heavy metal bearing wastewater discharged into environment have disastrous impacts on surface water ground water sediment and soil 1 2 to remove heavy metals from the contaminated wastewater various treatment approaches such as chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation ion flotation adsorption ion exchange and membrane filtration have been employed 3 6 of these methods chemical precipitation is most widely practiced in industry mainly for the simplicity of process control effective over a wide range of temperature and low cost of operation it employs ph adjustment to convert heavy metal ions to hydroxide sulfide carbonates or other less soluble compounds which then can be removed by physical means such as sedimentation flotation or filtration these processes depend on the size density and surface charge of particles to be removed 7 9 common inorganic precipitants used for heavy metal precipitation are lime ca oh 2 caustic soda naoh soda ash na2co3 sodium bicarbonate na hco3 2 sodium sulfide na2s and sodium hydrosulfide nahs the selection of these chemicals should be able to meet the maximum contaminant level mcl standards or to reach the desired final concentration required for recycling 10 13 heavy metals exhibit divergent precipitation behavior at different ph as the ph affects the solubility of metals 14 18 on the other hand ph is dependent on pollutants in wastewater and the dosage of precipitants which should be constantly monitored and controlled during the precipitation process the further studies on the removal effectiveness for heavy metals at a common concentration of around 100 mg l and the detailed comparison of heavy metal precipitation with typical precipitants are required as legislation for metal discharge to environment becomes more stringent and metal resources become increasingly scarce heavy metal sludge may need to be recyclable 19 the detailed understanding of chemical compounds formed in precipitation as well as possible conversion of heavy metal compounds during sludge processing is in an urgent need which is invaluable to the disposal and utilization of the sludge 20 in the present work precipitations of heavy metals namely zinc copper and lead from aqueous solutions with lime calcium hydroxide soda ash sodium carbonate and sodium sulfide were investigated effect of chemical type on the removal efficiency of heavy metals was evaluated and the settling performance of metal precipitates was compared the characteristics of sludge resulted from precipitation were discussed based on measurements of particle size and zeta potential thermal analyses and xrd examinations 2 experimental 2 1 materials aqueous solutions of copper zinc or lead were prepared in the laboratory from metal sulfates or nitrates cuso4 5h2o znso4 7h2o and pb no3 2 each metal salt was dissolved in de ionized water at a concentration of 100 mg l for precipitation studies these metal salts precipitants lime soda ash and sodium sulfide and other chemical reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade quality 2 2 method fig 1 illustrates the schematic of experiments and main operations are described as follows 2 2 1 jar test jar tests with a series of five beakers 1 l each were conducted to investigate the effect of precipitant dosages on heavy metal removal at room temperature of 20 2 c in each beaker calculated dosages of lime soda ash and sodium sulfide were added into heavy metal solutions which were then fast stirred for 3 min followed by gentle stirring for 7 min using magnetic stirring rode to promote coagulation and agglomeration suspension samples of 30 ml at different settling time were drawn from the supernatant in the beaker using a syringe for turbidity measurements using turbid meter wgz 1 desktop scattering light turbid meter volumetric method was used to estimate the volume of the decanted sludge the sludge volume was determined using a graduated cylinder 50 ml at different settling time the ph was monitored by phs 3d digital ph meter calibrated by buffer solutions of known value the suspensions settled for 60 min and the supernatants nearly 1 cm below the water surface was collected using a syringe and filtered through 0 45 μm membranes acidified by nitric acid and analyzed using z 200 series polarized zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer according to requirements of china standards for heavy metal analyses 21 it was calibrated for each element using the standard solution of known concentration before sample injection the detection limits of the equipment were 0 01 mg l 0 02 mg l and 0 01 mg l for cu pb and zn within a relative error of 5 with standard metal solutions all measurements of metal concentrations were done in triplicates and the arithmetic mean concentrations of heavy metals were reported 2 2 2 particle size measurement of precipitate the particle size of precipitates was measured using laser diffraction technique malvern zetasizer model nano zs and coulter ls13320 with the suspension at the end of stir particle size was mean particle size automatically calculated based on the size distribution function size fraction frequency and measurements were conducted under the same conditions as jar tests of the precipitation to compare effects of precipitants and precipitant dosages 2 2 3 zeta potential measurement of precipitate zeta potential of particle relates the magnitude of electrical charge surrounding the colloidal particles and is a key factor in understanding the stability of particles in suspensions 20 22 in this work gg317 zeta meter 3 0 micro electrophoresis apparatus was used to measure zeta potential of precipitates with suspensions zeta potential of particles was determined by the particle velocity which was induced by a potential difference across the capillary cell containing the suspension sample 2 2 4 xrd examinations the precipitates were dried at 60 c for 24 h and ground below 30 μm and then analyzed by d max 2550pc x ray powder diffraction apparatus xrd operating parameters were as follows wavelength of 1 54 å voltage of 40 kv current of 200 ma 2θ scan range of 3 90 step length of 0 02 and time of 10 s per step 2 2 5 thermal analyses thermal analyses were used to identify chemical compounds in precipitates as some chemical compounds may be amorphous or very poorly crystallized particles which cannot be detected by xrd when the sample is heated the chemical decomposition or dehydration may give information of chemical compositions based on the mass loss and heat evolution in thermal analyses with wrt 2 apparatus shanghai kexue instrument co ltd tg shows the weight loss during the heating process while dtg identifies the main reaction that occurred the samples of each metal precipitates dried at a temperature of 60 c for 72 h were ground below 30 μm and then placed in the rhodium platinum crucible of 5 8 mm diameter and 4 mm high during the examination the samples were subjected to heating rate of 20 c min under flowing nitrogen gas 80 cm3 min in the temperature range of 30 900 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 zinc system the calculated amount of precipitant at different stoichiometric molar ratios of zinc to precipitant shown in table 1 was weighed accurately and added into five batches of solutions containing zinc ii ions the treated wastewater settled for 60 min and then the supernatant was analyzed for zinc concentrations adding lime to adjust the ph value to 11 2 zinc concentration could be reduced to below the maximum effluent discharge standards of 2 mg l at a lime dosage of 170 mg l table 1 the reaction equation eq 1 depicts this precipitation 1 zn2 aq so4 2 aq ca oh 2 aq zn oh 2 s caso4 2h2o s as shown in table 1 if lime dosage exceeded 170 mg l the ph increased approximately to 12 leading to the dissolution of zinc hydroxide eq 2 as a result zinc removal decreased from 99 65 to 98 31 2 zn oh 2 s 2oh aq zn oh 4 2 aq at a na2co3 to zn2 molar ratio of 2 324 mg l of soda ash the ph increased to 9 3 and maximal zinc removal of 99 96 occurred however chemical reaction eq 3 may not occur and the precipitation mechanism could be described by eq 4 this was supported by results of thermal analyses and xrd given in the latter part of this section 3 zn2 aq na2co3 aq znco3 s 2na aq 4 zn2 aq na2co3 aq h2o zn oh 2 s co2 g 2na aq it can be seen from table 1 that 99 89 of zinc removal was achieved at sulfide dosage of 735 mg l if sulfide addition exceeded 918 mg l the ph increased above 11 resulting in a decrease tendency in the removal efficiency the stoichiometric equation of zinc sulfide precipitation is given in eq 5 5 zn2 aq na2s aq zns s 2na aq low effluent turbidity was observed across the particle zeta potential range between 3 37 mv and 14 84 mv table 1 as absolute value of negative zeta potentials increased the effluent turbidity increased significantly since suspended particles became effectively stabilized in the water due to mutual electrostatic repulsion in all the three precipitants applied the zeta potential of particles became more negative with an increase in the precipitant dosage table 1 fig 2 shows the turbidity variation of treated zinc solution during settling the turbidity from lime or soda ash treated effluent was very low and settling was fast while sodium sulfide treated effluents were slower in settling and the turbidity was stable after 15 min of sedimentation fig 3 shows sedimentation curves of zinc precipitates at different precipitant dosages the particle size of precipitates was measured to explain the settling behavior of precipitates as shown in fig 4 the particle size of precipitates using lime and soda ash as precipitants was around 35 μm at precipitant to zinc molar ratios of 1 3 and did not vary for 12 h however the particle size of zinc precipitates with sodium sulfide was dependent on sodium sulfide dosages it decreased significantly with the increment of sodium sulfide dosages at sodium sulfide to zinc molar ratios of 1 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 mean particle sizes of precipitates were 21 21 μm 23 74 μm 776 nm 470 nm and 268 nm respectively according to crystallization theory nucleation and growth of particles depends on super saturation level of the solution the greater of saturation number si lg ion activity product lgksp the greater the rate of particle nucleation low concentration of precipitant tends to promote particle growth on preexisting solids while the high concentration leads to the rapid formation of new solid particles which increases the particle number and reduces the particle size 23 note that the particle size did not vary due to the mutual electrostatic repulsion between particles table 1 according to x ray diffraction results shown in fig 5 when lime was added zinc precipitates consisted of calcite caco3 and zincite zno zincite formation was due to the dehydration of zinc hydroxide and the presence of caco3 was attributed to the atmospheric carbonation during the precipitation process zinc precipitates generated by addition of soda ash were mainly composed of zincite while the main crystal phase was sphalerite zns if sodium sulfide was added according to x ray diffraction examinations solubility limiting phases of zinc systems were typically of zincite and sphalerite a similar phenomenon has been observed previously by baltpurvins et al 24 in addition to crystal phases amorphous zinc compounds may form possibly because the nucleation of particles occurred quickly due to very high super saturation and ions had insufficient mobility or time to undergo proper orientation and alignment the tg dtg curves obtained from zinc precipitates are presented in fig 6 which gives additional information on chemical compounds in the precipitate in the case of lime precipitation the first mass loss at 32 110 c was associated to the evaporation of surface water in the precipitate and the second step at 200 350 c was due to the decomposition of amorphous zn oh 2 whereas the third step at 370 400 c and the fourth step around 600 700 c was due to the decomposition of amorphous cazn2 oh 6 2h2o 25 which was not detected by xrd technique in the case of soda ash precipitation only one step of mass loss was evident which was attributed to the decomposition of amorphous zn oh 2 resulting in the formation of zincite in the case of sodium sulfide precipitation the mass loss at 50 200 c was due to the evaporation of surface water in precipitates and the decomposition of amorphous zn oh 2 whereas the mass loss at 650 c was due to the oxidation of sphalerite 3 2 copper system table 2 shows the average concentration of copper in the supernatant ph and the removal of copper after additions of three precipitants lime was the most efficient in removing copper and the copper concentration could be reduced to 0 01 mg l with 99 99 removal with the addition of soda ash 334 mg l to adjust the ph value to 9 3 the copper concentration reduced to 0 19 mg l when adding sodium sulfide dosage of 378 mg l to adjust the ph value to 5 5 the copper ion content could be reduced to 1 5 mg l more sodium sulfide addition resulted in copper concentration reduction to 0 11 mg l zeta potential of copper precipitate became more negative with increasing sodium sulfide and soda ash while it became less negative with more lime addition table 2 this implies that caoh ions may adsorb on the surface of precipitates as shown in fig 7 the turbidity of the treated wastewater during settling was highly dependent on the nature and dosages of precipitants the turbidity of lime and soda ash treated copper solutions increased with the increasing precipitant dosages while the turbidity of sodium sulfide treated copper solutions was nearly zero table 2 after 15 min of settling the turbidities of lime and soda ash treated copper solutions were in the range of 1 6 ntu these turbidities can meet the effluent standard regulations integrated wastewater discharge standard of china gb8978 1996 fig 8 shows the sludge volume against sedimentation time the amount recorded after 60 min of settling was depending on the dosage 8 25 ml l for lime and 15 27 ml l for soda ash it was observed that precipitates using sodium sulfide did not settle down in 12 h the particle size of copper precipitates is presented in table 3 it was very small around 55 nm and did not vary for 12 h this is the reason why the turbidity of sodium sulfide treated copper solutions was close to zero and the precipitate did not settle crystal compounds in copper precipitates were qualitatively analyzed using xrd and results are shown in fig 9 in the case of lime precipitation the main crystal compounds in precipitates were tenorite cuo and gypsum caso4 2h2o cuo formation was due to spontaneous dehydration of cu oh 2 in the case of soda ash precipitation posnjakite cu4 so4 oh 6 2h2o and tenorite were identified when copper sulfate solution was mixed with sodium sulfide the most significant crystal compounds in the precipitate were covellite cus and chalcanthite cuso4 5h2o which was postulated to be the product of atmospheric oxidation of cus in the precipitates 26 27 the tg dtg curves obtained from copper precipitates are presented in fig 10 in the precipitate using lime the mass loss at 32 110 c was associated to the evaporation of surface water and the second step at 110 250 c was due to the decomposition of gypsum whereas the third step around 400 c was attributed to the dehydration of cu oh 2 and fourth step around 750 850 c was due to the decomposition of amorphous calcium carbonate which was the product of atmospheric carbonation of lime in the precipitate using soda ash four major steps of mass losses were observed the mass loss at 32 110 c was associated to the evaporation of surface water the second and third mass loss steps may arise from the decomposition of posnjakite cu4 so4 oh 6 2h2o resulting in the formation of cuso4 the last mass loss at 700 830 c was due to the decomposition of cuso4 leading to the formation of cuo as shown in fig 10c six major mass loss peaks were observed for sodium sulfide precipitation the mass loss at 30 110 c was due to loss of surface water in the sludge and the mass loss at 200 400 c was due to the decomposition of chalcanthite cuso4 5h2o 3 3 lead system table 4 shows the average concentration of lead in the supernatant ph and the removal of lead after the addition of three precipitants a removal of 76 was attained after adding 89 mg l of lime more addition of lime resulted in a dramatic decrease of lead removals since more lime led into an increase in ph and resulted in lead hydroxide to dissolve into the solution as shown in table 4 the optimum soda ash dosage for lead precipitation was in the range of 51 77 mg l lead removal of up to 99 7 was attained after addition of 174 mg l of sodium sulfide as more sodium sulfide was added ph of the solution increased to above 10 and hence resulted in the reduction of lead removal the precipitating agent used for removing lead ions from solutions exhibited significant influence on the resulting sludge and turbidity table 4 also shows zeta potential of precipitates suspension turbidity and ph obtained from different dosages of three precipitants negative zeta potential of precipitates increased with the precipitant dosage increase the turbidity of sodium sulfide treated solutions increased with the increasing precipitants dosage but decreased immediately after attaining optimum ph 10 maximum removal efficiency for lime treated solutions turbidity decreased with the increasing lime dosages note that soda ash treated solutions exhibited very high turbidity which was more than 200 ntu in all the three precipitants applied sodium sulfide resulted in the lowest turbidity after 60 min of sedimentation fig 11 the particle size of lead precipitates is presented in figs 12 and 13 it was found that the particle size of lead precipitates decreased significantly with the increase of sodium sulfide dosages in other words at higher dosage of sodium sulfide nucleation numbers of particles increased and particle size decreased accordingly particle size of precipitates increased with time using lime as a precipitant however the agglomeration phenomenon did not occur in 12 h for other precipitants even the mean particle size of precipitates was only 100 300 nm with high surface energy the stabilization of fine particles could be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between particles table 4 in contrast the absolute value of zeta potential of particles in lime precipitation was small this is the reason why the coagulation and agglomeration occurred using lime as a precipitant 28 fig 14 shows xrd patterns of lead precipitates using three precipitants using lime as a precipitant the crystal lead compounds in the precipitate were pb5o8 and pbo the formation of pbo was due to the dehydration of lead hydroxide and the presence of pb5o8 was attributed to the atmospheric oxidation when soda ash was added to the lead nitrate solution the precipitate generated was mainly composed of cerussite pbco3 and when sodium sulfide was added the main crystal lead compounds of the precipitate generated were lead sulfide pbs lead oxide carbonate hydroxide pb10 co3 6 oh 6o and lead sulfate pbso4 according to baltpurvins et al 24 the chemical compounds in the precipitate were dependent on anions in liquid they reported that phases of lead precipitates were typically of blixite pb4 oh 6cl2 and laurionite pb oh cl for 0

naturally settle and the turbidity of the suspension remained high after 60 min of settling in fact lead precipitates resulted from soda ash precipitation did not settle in 12 h by comparing the sludge volume for three metals the following general ascending order was obtained for three precipitates zn cu pb in addition to copper precipitation with sodium sulfide lead formed ultra fine precipitates with soda ash that were very difficult to solid liquid separation by sedimentation the precipitate size formed at low precipitant concentrations was larger than that formed at the high precipitant concentration in practice in addition to controlling the number of nuclei to avoid the outbreak of nucleation seeds can be used as growth nucleus which may promote the growth of crystals 30 31 it may be necessary to point out that the sludge containing heavy metals resulted from the precipitation are treated by cement based solidification stabilization and then disposed by landfill in industrial practices if the leaching test results reach the landfill standards in addition the sludge may also be used as a raw material for heavy metal extraction or recycled for reuse where dissolution studies of heavy metals may be needed to satisfy the special purpose 4 conclusions three typical precipitants namely lime soda ash and sodium sulfide were used to remove copper zinc and lead from aqueous solutions in this work based on measurements of the ph particle size zeta potential of particles supernatant turbidity and sludge volume the influence of the precipitant dosage on heavy metal removals was examined based on xrd and thermal analysis results the chemical compounds and phase conversion in precipitates were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn lime was quite efficient in removing copper and zinc by which removal can be up to 99 65 and 99 99 but it was less efficient for lead removal carbonate precipitation was an effective treatment alternative to hydroxide precipitation and dissolved heavy metals can be removed from wastewaters using soda ash na2co3 the advantage of carbonate precipitation was that it can operate at a relative lower ph range typically around ph 9 sulfide precipitation by adding na2s was the most viable and efficient in removing three heavy metals investigated from aqueous solutions where 99 75 of removal was achieved and the residual concentration of heavy metals was less than 0 28 mg l which meets the stringent discharge level of 2 mg l for zinc 0 5 mg l for copper but exceeds discharge level of 0 1 mg l for lead integrated wastewater discharge standard of china gb8978 1996 the particle size of precipitates varied from precipitant to precipitant depending on heavy metal to precipitant ratios the
