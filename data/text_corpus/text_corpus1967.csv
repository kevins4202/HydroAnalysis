9835,controlled drainage cd sometimes called drainage water management is a practice whereby the drainage system outflow is managed during specific periods to retain more water in the field although cd has been shown to reduce downstream nitrate n no3 n load seasonal patterns have been less consistent which can potentially impact the effectiveness of conservation practices the main objective of this study was to assess the regional and seasonal impact of conventional free drainage fd and cd on drainage flow and nitrate n load using experimental data from ongoing and historical cd experiments across the corn belt and in north carolina we evaluated subsurface drain flow nitrate n load and performance of cd systems across the data set and regions there was little difference in annual flow from fd conditions seasonally more northern and western sites experienced a greater percentage of the annual flow occurring in the spring there was no nitrate n concentration reduction with cd flow and nitrate n load reductions with cd did not vary by plant hardiness zone across the region but the season with the greatest reduction did shift from winter to spring moving north and west in the study area absolute flow reductions in mm were similar regardless of precipitation category consequently the percent reduction was lower as the amount of precipitation category increased overall this analysis found cd to be an effective practice for reducing drain flow and nitrate n loading directly delivered by the drains to downstream water bodies across the region keywords drainage water management nitrate loss seasonal drainage 1 introduction agricultural producers are under increasing pressure to reduce downstream export of nutrients originating from their land nutrient export from agricultural lands contributes to hypoxic zones in downstream water bodies rabalais et al 2002 in addition the timing of nutrient loading is also important as spring loading to the gulf of mexico has been implicated as a key factor in the hypoxic zone size in any given year us epa sab 2007 overall a significant portion of nitrate n no3 n that flows down the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico originates from subsurface drainage systems in the upper midwest of the united states david et al 2010 controlled drainage cd sometimes called drainage water management is a practice whereby the drainage system s outflow elevation is managed during certain periods of the year to retain more water in the field typically the drainage system is managed or controlled during periods when drainage is unnecessary to ensure field and crop suitability such as in winter when there is no crop or in summer when high crop water consumption occurs individual field and modeling studies have shown cd to be an effective strategy in reducing the magnitude of drain flow and nitrate n export downstream skaggs et al 2012 ross et al 2016 field studies across the region have identified different patterns in regional subsurface drainage especially regarding the timing and length of the drainage season the magnitude of subsurface drainage is the greatest in winter and spring months in the humid regions of north america but frozen soil can stop winter drain flow kladivko et al 2001 resulting in shorter drainage seasons that start later in the year than in southern parts of the region kladivko et al 2004 observed year round drainage in southern portions of the corn belt indiana whereas in the northern portion of the corn belt minnesota strock et al 2004 only observed drainage from mid march through early august most field studies focus on a single field site location and it is difficult to assess large scale drain flow trends with such spatially and temporally limited data therefore the synthesis of regional field studies is crucial to assess the performance of cd over a range of conditions understanding seasonal performance is particularly important for providing recommendations to stakeholders where seasonal nutrient flux may be critical for environmental benefits in addition understanding the seasonality of drain flow and nitrate n load may be important for implementing other conservation practices and evaluating the potential impact on downstream water bodies based on this need for a regional and seasonal assessment of conventional free drainage fd and cd systems this study had two primary objectives 1 to quantify the magnitude of the difference in drain flow and nitrate n load both seasonally and annually at drainage sites spanning the upper midwest and in north carolina usa and 2 to determine the impact of cd on drain flow and nitrate n load on an annual and seasonal basis across these geographic areas addressing these spatial and temporal questions necessitates a database with plot level daily measurements that are standardized across historical and ongoing research sites herzmann et al 2014 eagle et al 2017 data from the usda nifa funded project managing water for increased resiliency of drained agricultural landscapes referred to as the transforming drainage project https transformingdrainage org provided the needed resolution of cd research studies across the region these data enable the first publication of regional variation in the seasonality of drainage water flow and nutrient load and highlight noteworthy similarities and differences for meeting water quality goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was conducted at 13 sites across six states in the midwest and north carolina usa fig 1 the site descriptions are summarized in table 1 most were on university owned and managed research farms and the remainder on private farm cooperator fields the research area extended from 35 to 44 north latitude and 76 96 west longitude this research spanned five usda plant hardiness zones phz table 2 the soil drainage class ranged from somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained as determined using the usda soil survey the subsurface drainage of all sites consisted of 100 mm perforated corrugated tubing and included both cd and fd treatments tile depth ranged from 0 61 m to 1 22 m and tile spacing varied from 6 m to 36 m all of the sites had similar drainage designs across treatments except ia story2 where tile spacing was 27 and 36 m for fd and cd plots respectively five sites had replications and these were in general smaller in size with an average drainage area of 1 3 ha sites that did not include replications were larger farm fields with an average drainage area of 11 1 ha except one a university research field with an average drainage area of 1 8 ha in total 40 experimental units were used for this synthesis study replications were averaged at mo knox1 and ia story2 2 2 field management 2 2 1 agronomic factors the paired treatments fd and cd plots were managed similarly in terms of cropping system tillage fertilizer application and residue management during the study period most of the sites were in continuous maize or maize soybean rotation although there was some variation popcorn soybean rotation oh auglaize1 maize soybean with occasional wheat oh auglaize2 and a two year three crop maize wheat soybean rotation with winter wheat and soybean double cropped during the same year nc washington the crop was not established as a treatment in the experimental design in most locations except for ia washington in which both maize and soybean were grown each year the amount of nitrogen n applied to maize and popcorn varied across locations and years with site average rates ranging from 165 kg n ha 1 at nc washington to 259 kg n ha 1 at in randolph table 3 in any given year an average rate of nitrogen applied was between 150 and 250 kg n ha 1 soybean was not fertilized while wheat received 130 kg n ha 1 on average the timing of application was typically in the spring or split between a spring application followed by a sidedress application approximately two to four weeks later exceptions were mn redwood1 where manure was applied during the fall in some years and ia washington where n fertilizer application was split across years fall followed by spring application a few times fields were managed and operated according to common farm practices for the area including tillage and herbicide applications planting and harvest dates are summarized in table 3 2 2 2 controlled drainage in general the water table was actively managed in the cd plots using an inline water level control structure the nc washington site used stop logs in a ditch to maintain the water table at a constant depth throughout the study period typical cd management of the outlet height for each site is illustrated in fig 2 at all sites except nc washington the outlet elevation was adjusted throughout the year to different heights fig 2 typically the cd outlet elevation was maintained at a set height from late fall after harvest until early april a few weeks before planting the elevation was lowered to drain the soil profile and limit saturated soil conditions for field trafficability and the consequent enhancement of the crop establishment by reducing excess water stress during summer the outlet elevation was raised to potentially retain available water for the crop and was kept at that level until a few weeks before harvest when it was lowered again during relatively dry years the outlet elevation was less intensively adjusted or unaltered throughout the growing season as the water table level was often below the tile depth nevertheless these site years were regarded as cd within the analysis 2 3 data collection research data were collected from 2007 to 2017 variables monitored included drain flow and drainage water nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentration and the latter was measured in all but two sites the number of measurement years varied between sites table 2 but was not less than two years for any location the majority of the data 65 were collected during a five year period from 2009 to 2013 with an average number of sites each year greater than 8 during the remaining years there were less than four sites from which data were collected field management data including planting fertilization and cd management information were collected although variations in reporting frequency and specificity differed between sites data from these experiments are published at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 and iowa state university https drainagedata org 2 3 1 drain flow and nitrate n concentration measurement drain flow was monitored year round across all sites except the two northernmost locations sd clay and mn redwood1 where measuring instrumentations were removed during winter months to avoid frost damage at 10 of the 13 sites the amount of drainage was estimated by measuring water depth in the inline water level control structure via a pressure transducer or a bubbler flow meter and converting to flow rates using corresponding rating curves at ia story2 and nc washington a sump pump was used with a digital flow meter while at in randolph an inline electromagnetic flow meter was installed in 2012 allowing measurement of both forward and backward flow flow rates were divided by the area drained and aggregated into an area weighted total daily flow in mm nitrate n concentration was measured at 11 of the 13 sites during the study period methods for collecting water samples varied from discrete grab to automated composite time and flow proportional sampling time proportional samples were generally combined into weekly composite samples before laboratory analysis grab and flow proportional samples were usually obtained weekly or bi weekly when water was present during the growing season and less frequently during the winter the samples were stored in a refrigerator or freezer and typically analyzed for no3 n plus no2 n concentration within a month daily drain flow data from some sites contained gaps typically caused by instrument failure or environmental conditions such as flooding the missing values were estimated for gaps no larger than 150 continuous days using a gap filling process developed by the project team chighladze et al 2020 first missing data during the no flow periods of the year typically due to frozen soil were filled in with zeros next if replicated or adjacent plots were available missing data were estimated by fitting a linear regression model for each season individually otherwise if on site precipitation data were available missing data were imputed in two steps for days when rain occurred an empirical relationship was established between the 3 day moving average precipitation and observed daily peak flow for days with no precipitation drainage was estimated from the previous day using a 1st order recession equation with a coefficient calculated from observed data assuming a linear slope between peak and inflection points of log transformed daily drainage gaps at sites without replicate plots or onsite precipitation data or longer than 150 days were not filled as a result 144 individual stretches of missing periods with an average length of less than one month were imputed using this method a detailed description of the methods used for drain flow and water quality measurements at each site are published with the research data at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 and iowa state university https drainagedata org as noted previously 2 3 2 nitrate n load for sites with flow proportional samples no3 n loads were determined by multiplying the no3 n concentration of the composite sample by the volume of water flow when the composite sample was collected for sites with time proportional samples the no3 n concentration was in general linearly interpolated between samples and multiplied by the drain flow for a corresponding day to estimate nutrient loads from the tile outlets a slightly different procedure was used in oh delaware where the volume of water associated with any single sample was determined using the midpoint approach the temporal midpoint between each sample was determined and the volume of water was calculated between two consecutive temporal points because no3 n concentrations in tile drains are fairly consistent time proportional sampling has been shown to provide estimates of annual load within 10 for the sampling frequencies used williams et al 2015 and sites with different sampling procedures were not distinguished in the analysis 2 3 3 precipitation the iowa environmental mesonet iem 2017 was used to obtain precipitation data from the nearest weather stations at all locations annual and seasonal precipitations were calculated for each site year included in the analysis and categorized as wet normal or dry based on 30 year precipitation data collected between 1986 and 2015 precipitation category table 2 shows the 30 year average annual precipitation for each location annual precipitation within 0 5 standard deviations from the mean of these 30 year data was identified as normal any value exceeding the range was classified as wet while anything below was classified as dry upper and lower limits were similarly defined for each season and used to categorize values accordingly for each site year 2 4 data processing variables measured across sites included drain flow n 13 and nitrate n load n 11 annual flow and load were calculated based on a water year herein referred to as year which begins october 1 and ends september 30 seasonal flow and load were categorized by seasons spring apr may june n 91 d summer july aug sept n 92 d fall oct nov dec n 92 d and winter jan feb mar n 90 or 91 d daily drain flow data from some sites contained gaps typically caused by instrument failure or environmental conditions such as flooding the missing values were estimated for gaps no larger than 150 continuous days and for which on site precipitation was available using a gap filling process developed by the project team chighladze et al 2020 there were 144 individual stretches of missing periods with an average length of less than one month that were imputed using this method and these data were used in this synthesis daily drain flow and load data were further processed based on standards applied across all sites to ensure missing data were handled uniformly first sites with data from fewer than 80 of days in a year less than 292 of 365 were removed second each individual season was required to have data from 80 of days 73 d or more the only exception to this was the winter season in northern and western sites which was required to have 45 of days 45 d or more third replicates were removed if the paired treatment of that replication was missing fourth an individual season was removed if the number of available days with data differed by more than 10 between cd and fd within a replication finally a water year was removed if all four seasons were not present following these processing steps the processed data for flow include 65 756 daily observations of fd and cd this number equates to 90 paired comparisons between cd and fd on an annual basis and 360 on a seasonal basis the processed data for nitrate n load include 57 722 daily observations of fd and cd this number equates to 79 paired comparisons between cd and fd on an annual basis and 316 on a seasonal basis 2 5 statistical analyses to assess broad regional differences the sites were grouped by usda plant hardiness zone usda ars 2012 plant hardiness zones are defined by the long term average of the coldest temperature observed per year therefore the phzs are correlated with differences in snowfall and soil frost between the sites five phzs are represented in this study fig 1 table 2 assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed among sites and phzs for all variables absolute drain flow from the fd treatment reduction in drain flow due to cd nitrate n load from the fd treatment and reduction in nitrate n load due to cd normality was tested using the shapiro wilk test and all of the annual and seasonal variables violated the assumption of normality except for annual fd flow the homogeneity of variance assumption was assessed using the bartlett test with annual absolute fd flow and load meeting the assumption of equal variances but the reduction in annual flow and load due to cd did not none of the seasonal measures met the assumption of equal variances given the lack of normality and homogeneity of variance several non parametric models were examined such as kruskal wallis and friedman however these models were not adequate due to the presence of multiple groupings site phz seasons and incomplete blocking therefore all data were natural log transformed for statistical analyses using a mixed model anova with error assigned to replicate within site year within site and site within phz the median values from non transformed data are included in all tables and figures sites phzs seasons and the interactions were considered statistically significant when p 0 10 overall statistical significance is shown in the tables pairwise comparisons among the interactions are provided in the supplemental materials data analyses graphing model fitting and statistical analyses were performed using the r statistical package within r studio version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 rstudio team 2016 2 5 1 nitrate n transport dynamics the relationship between weekly nitrate n load and drain flow was evaluated to assess the nitrate n transport dynamics this analysis identifies whether nitrate n concentration changes with variation in drain flow weeks with zero flow were not used in this analysis a linear regression was fit between the natural log of weekly nitrate n load l in kg n ha 1 and drain flow d mm as described in tomer et al 2003 1 ln l b ln d ln a in which a is a constant and b is the slope which is also known as an elasticity coefficient alexander et al 1996 when the slope of the linear regression is equal to one nitrate n concentration remains constant with varying flow depth when the slope is greater than one high flows coincide with higher nitrate n concentrations furthermore the slope is the percent increase in nitrate n load caused by a 1 increase in flow depth the durbin watson statistic showed the presence of serial correlation in the weekly data as a result we used a similar procedure as outlined by ghane et al 2016 to determine the slope of the regression while accounting for serial correlation the autoreg procedure of sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc was used to estimate the slope of the regression we constructed the 90 confidence interval to determine if the slope of the linear regression was significantly different from one 3 results 3 1 drain flow characteristics the fd treatment was evaluated across the 13 sites to identify the difference in magnitude of flow across the study region the median annual drain flow range 136 450 mm was significantly different across the sites p 0 007 fig 3 grouping by plant hardiness zone showed that the median annual drainage ranged from 294 mm for zone 5b to 422 mm for zone 5a relative to annual precipitation this annual drain flow ranged from 28 to 49 table 4 there was no statistically significant difference in annual drain flow across the phzs table 4 this lack of statistically significant differences is due in part to the wide variation in drain flow at most sites and the number of site years within each phz although there was little difference in annual drain flow by phz the seasonal variation in drain flow was substantial across phzs fig 4 table s1 zones 4b and 5a southern mn south eastern sd and northern ia had greater flow in the spring than other seasons in contrast the greatest drain flow was in the winter season in phzs 6a and 8a oh and nc based on this seasonal analysis regions to the north and west had a greater percentage of the total annual drainage occurring in the spring whereas winter was the dominant period for drainage to the east and south the magnitude of drain flow varied across wet normal and dry years from 205 to 414 mm table 5 and these differences are statistically significant between all three categories 3 2 nitrate n load patterns similar to drain flow there were no statistically significant differences in annual nitrate n load across phzs table 4 on an absolute basis the highest nitrate n loss was in phz 5a and the lowest nitrate n loss was in phz 8a across the region the nitrate n load from fd systems was similar for the conditions and years studied however when analyzed on a seasonal basis there were nitrate n loading differences by phz and season fig 4 table s1 similar to the drain flow phzs 4b and 5a had the greatest seasonal nitrate n load in the spring while in phzs 6a and 8a the winter season demonstrated the greatest nitrate n loading from the drainage systems when precipitation is compared across precipitation categories there was approximately a 20 increase or decrease in annual precipitation between the wet or dry category and normal table 5 compared to the normal values these differences resulted in a 27 increase in flow and a 28 increase in load in the wet category and a 37 decrease in flow and 49 decrease in load in the dry category the differences in annual nitrate n load were also statistically significant across all three precipitation categories 3 3 nitrate n concentration patterns annual and seasonal flow weighted mean fwm nitrate n concentrations were calculated as the seasonal or annual nitrate n load divided by the seasonal or annual drain flow overall on an annual basis the difference in nitrate n fwm concentration by phz was not statistically significant table 4 when the nitrate n concentration was evaluated across seasons and phzs there were differences in only 11 of 29 comparisons fig 5 table s1 therefore in general the nitrate n fwm concentrations in drain flow were fairly stable and did not reflect seasonal differences in nitrogen fertilizer application at most sites nitrogen fertilizer was applied for maize in the spring season table 3 3 4 impacts of controlled drainage on drain flow the change in drain flow when cd was implemented was calculated on an absolute basis as the difference between cd and fd and as a percent of fd negative values represent a reduction in drain flow due to cd which performed similarly across phzs with a change in median annual drain flow from 88 to 135 mm 28 to 49 table 6 the reduction in drain flow with cd differed by phz on a seasonal basis fig 6 table s2 the change in drain flow ranged from 0 to 85 mm depending on the phz and season the season with the greatest reduction in drain flow differed by zone with the greatest flow reduction in the spring for phzs 4b and 5a and in the winter period for 6a and 8a as might be expected the season of greatest flow reduction was also the season of greatest flow the change in drain flow with cd was also similar across precipitation categories table 5 the amount of precipitation did not affect the absolute change in annual drain flow although the change in percent drain flow was less in wetter years the analysis was also conducted on a seasonal basis which did not differ for phz and precipitation category data not shown overall during wet normal and dry years cd reduced drain flow by 107 116 mm across the study region resulting in a 28 reduction in flow in wet years and a 52 reduction in dry years 3 5 impacts of controlled drainage on nitrate n load the change in annual nitrate n load with cd ranged from 3 7 to 19 1 kg n ha 1 table 6 the change in nitrate n load with cd varied among phzs when analyzed on a seasonal basis fig 6 table s2 the change in nitrate n load ranged from 1 1 to 7 4 kg n ha 1 depending on the phz and season the greatest load reduction occurred in the spring for all phzs except 6a where in spring there was a load increase with cd given that 51 of the annual flow occurred within the winter season in zone 6a the large load reduction was likely due to water held back with cd during the winter being released during the spring period for phz 6a in the winter the median flow for free drainage was 173 mm and there was a median flow reduction with cd of 78 mm 3 6 impacts of drain flow and controlled drainage on nitrate n concentrations and load the relationship between nitrate n load and drain flow depth was not different between cd and fd systems fig 7 as the slopes of the linear regression models are not significantly different p value 0 293 this result indicates no significant difference in flow weighted nitrate n concentration between cd and fd the reason for not detecting changes in nitrate n concentration between cd and fd could be that when all the site years are combined in fig 7 there are other factors affecting cd rather than just cd affecting nitrate n concentartion factors that could have affected nitrate n concentration include differences in location weather drainage design depth and spacing soil and farm management the plot of the natural log of weekly nitrate n load and drain flow shows that most nitrate n concentrations varied from approximately 1 to 30 mg l 1 for each of the cd and fd datasets fig 8 results showed that nitrate n concentration was less than 10 mg l 1 the drinking water standard 39 and 41 of the weeks for cd and fd datasets respectively while nitrate n concentration varied from one site to another and from year to year the slope of the linear regressions slope 0 99 for cd and slope 1 02 for fd were not significantly different from one in each of the cd and fd datasets the lack of slope difference from one indicates that nitrate n concentration remained constant with variation in drain flow across all site years fig 8 in other words a 1 increase in drain flow coincided with an approximately 1 increase in nitrate n load this means that change in nitrate n load is proportional to the change in drain flow fig 8 the linear regression slope for each season was also not significantly different than one showing no change in nitrate n concentration with drain flow within each season fig s1 4 discussion drain flow and nitrate n load from subsurface drainage systems were similar across a large geographical region on an annual basis despite differences in annual precipitation soil types drainage design and site specific agronomic management however there were seasonal differences as we looked across the study region as we move east and south in our study region we see a greater percentage of drain flow and nitrate n loss occurring in the winter it is necessary to consider the effectiveness of the implemented conservation practices for winter drainage flow and load to reduce downstream nitrate n loading in these areas in the west and north areas of our study region more of the drain flow and nitrate n load occurred in the spring and conservation practice implementation should consider this result for example cover crops have been found to be quite effective for reducing nitrate n concentrations in spring in parts of this region especially if cover crops can be effectively established qi et al 2011 these areas with greater loading in the spring may be the most important targets for conservation practice implementation since spring loading to the gulf of mexico may have the greatest impact on the hypoxic zone us epa sab 2007 in our study cd reduced drainage volume by 28 33 and 52 for the wet normal and dry precipitation categories respectively this reduction is consistent with a recent meta analysis by wang et al 2020 which found that cd reduced subsurface drainage volume by approximately 30 for dry land crops cd was found to reduce annual drain flow and nitrate n load across the region but sites north and west had greater flow and load reduction in the spring since this period experienced the greatest flow and load in many locations the outlet of the cd system is not managed in the weeks leading up to planting to allow the soil to reach a more trafficable state controlled drainage outlet controls will need to be implemented as long as possible to consistently reduce flow and load from systems in the north and west active management of drainage outlets during the growing season may be most critical in these areas to get as much benefit as possible during that late spring season in the future automation may facilitate active management and possibly be paired with other items such as nitrate n sensors to inform management e g identifying and prioritizing periods of when to manage aggressively or passively a period to manage aggressively could be following a drought when nitrate n loss could be high in subsequent drainage events in addition understanding the timing of drain flow and ultimately nitrate n loss may have implications for the performance of other crop management practices such as cover crops and enhanced efficiency fertilizers also the timing of drain flow and nutrient loading could be critical for water quality in receiving water bodies us epa sab 2007 controlled drainage reduced flow and load a consistent absolute amount across wet normal and dry precipitation years so from the data collected we would not expect cd to be an effective strategy for providing a greater reduction in wet years i e cd would not absorb the extra loading in wet years this observation has implications when trying to meet water quality goals as multiple conservation practices would likely be required on one piece of land as expected cd did not decrease nitrate n concentration coming directly from the drainage systems despite reducing downstream nitrate n loading so if local water quality protection is most dependent on nitrate n concentration reductions directly coming from the drains other conservation and fertilizer management practices beyond cd should be considered to reduce nitrate n load synergistically while there were no significant differences in nitrate n concentration by phz there was a general trend for decreasing nitrate n concentrations as we moved from the northwest locations to the southeast this trend could result from various factors including climate controls on nutrient cycling nitrogen management cropping practices and soils for example the site in north carolina included wheat as part of a two year maize wheat soybean rotation this aspect is one that should be investigated further especially in studies where there are greater similarities in agronomic management the high coefficient of determination r square of 0 92 in fig 8 confirms that drain flow dictated nitrate n load in subsurface drainage from this subsurface drainage would be the dominant pathway of nitrate n loss also nitrate n concentration remained constant with variation in drain flow across all site years insignificant variation in nitrate n concentration with a change in flow at a specific site has been reported previously tomer et al 2003 in addition consistent with the discussion by skaggs et al 2012 we found that cd did not reduce nitrate n concentrations and the nitrate n load reductions were related to flow reductions overall subsurface drainage flow not surface runoff is well known to be the dominant pathway for nitrate n loss schilling et al 2020 craft et al 2018 therefore practices that reduce drainage discharge such as cd and shallow drains can reduce nitrate n load from subsurface drained fields the transforming drainage project brought together experimental data from 13 ongoing and historical cd experiments across the corn belt and in north carolina in a unique data set chighladze et al 2021 these sites varied in climate soil and agronomic practices as the cooperating farmers and projects under which data collection began had different goals data collection at each site followed a minimum set of protocols for inclusion in the database but many procedures differed across the sites although more questions could be answered if all experiments had been conducted with consistent protocols the dataset provides unprecedented opportunity for the comparison and synthesis across sites conducted here 5 conclusions we evaluated subsurface drainage flow nitrate n load and performance of controlled drainage cd systems across the corn belt and in north carolina across the data set and regions there was little difference in annual flow from free drainage fd conditions on a seasonal basis sites more north and west experience a greater percentage of the annual flow in the spring which may impact the choice of conservation practices and the relative influence on hypoxia in the gulf of mexico nitrate n loads followed similar trends as the drain flow for the fd conditions annual flow and nitrate n load reductions with cd drainage did not vary by plant hardiness zone phz across the region but the season with the greatest reduction did shift later in the north and west drain flow reductions with cd did not vary based on precipitation category such that there were similar absolute flow reductions regardless of precipitation category consequently the percent reduction was lower as the amount of precipitation category increased this result indicates we would expect similar absolute flow reductions in wet years and would not get a disproportionately positive impact from cd during wet years the analysis found that observed nitrate n load reduction was directly related to drain flow reduction i e no nitrate n concentration reduction with cd overall this analysis found cd to effectively reduce direct drain flow and nitrate n loading to downstream water bodies declaration of competing interest the authors

9835,controlled drainage cd sometimes called drainage water management is a practice whereby the drainage system outflow is managed during specific periods to retain more water in the field although cd has been shown to reduce downstream nitrate n no3 n load seasonal patterns have been less consistent which can potentially impact the effectiveness of conservation practices the main objective of this study was to assess the regional and seasonal impact of conventional free drainage fd and cd on drainage flow and nitrate n load using experimental data from ongoing and historical cd experiments across the corn belt and in north carolina we evaluated subsurface drain flow nitrate n load and performance of cd systems across the data set and regions there was little difference in annual flow from fd conditions seasonally more northern and western sites experienced a greater percentage of the annual flow occurring in the spring there was no nitrate n concentration reduction with cd flow and nitrate n load reductions with cd did not vary by plant hardiness zone across the region but the season with the greatest reduction did shift from winter to spring moving north and west in the study area absolute flow reductions in mm were similar regardless of precipitation category consequently the percent reduction was lower as the amount of precipitation category increased overall this analysis found cd to be an effective practice for reducing drain flow and nitrate n loading directly delivered by the drains to downstream water bodies across the region keywords drainage water management nitrate loss seasonal drainage 1 introduction agricultural producers are under increasing pressure to reduce downstream export of nutrients originating from their land nutrient export from agricultural lands contributes to hypoxic zones in downstream water bodies rabalais et al 2002 in addition the timing of nutrient loading is also important as spring loading to the gulf of mexico has been implicated as a key factor in the hypoxic zone size in any given year us epa sab 2007 overall a significant portion of nitrate n no3 n that flows down the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico originates from subsurface drainage systems in the upper midwest of the united states david et al 2010 controlled drainage cd sometimes called drainage water management is a practice whereby the drainage system s outflow elevation is managed during certain periods of the year to retain more water in the field typically the drainage system is managed or controlled during periods when drainage is unnecessary to ensure field and crop suitability such as in winter when there is no crop or in summer when high crop water consumption occurs individual field and modeling studies have shown cd to be an effective strategy in reducing the magnitude of drain flow and nitrate n export downstream skaggs et al 2012 ross et al 2016 field studies across the region have identified different patterns in regional subsurface drainage especially regarding the timing and length of the drainage season the magnitude of subsurface drainage is the greatest in winter and spring months in the humid regions of north america but frozen soil can stop winter drain flow kladivko et al 2001 resulting in shorter drainage seasons that start later in the year than in southern parts of the region kladivko et al 2004 observed year round drainage in southern portions of the corn belt indiana whereas in the northern portion of the corn belt minnesota strock et al 2004 only observed drainage from mid march through early august most field studies focus on a single field site location and it is difficult to assess large scale drain flow trends with such spatially and temporally limited data therefore the synthesis of regional field studies is crucial to assess the performance of cd over a range of conditions understanding seasonal performance is particularly important for providing recommendations to stakeholders where seasonal nutrient flux may be critical for environmental benefits in addition understanding the seasonality of drain flow and nitrate n load may be important for implementing other conservation practices and evaluating the potential impact on downstream water bodies based on this need for a regional and seasonal assessment of conventional free drainage fd and cd systems this study had two primary objectives 1 to quantify the magnitude of the difference in drain flow and nitrate n load both seasonally and annually at drainage sites spanning the upper midwest and in north carolina usa and 2 to determine the impact of cd on drain flow and nitrate n load on an annual and seasonal basis across these geographic areas addressing these spatial and temporal questions necessitates a database with plot level daily measurements that are standardized across historical and ongoing research sites herzmann et al 2014 eagle et al 2017 data from the usda nifa funded project managing water for increased resiliency of drained agricultural landscapes referred to as the transforming drainage project https transformingdrainage org provided the needed resolution of cd research studies across the region these data enable the first publication of regional variation in the seasonality of drainage water flow and nutrient load and highlight noteworthy similarities and differences for meeting water quality goals 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was conducted at 13 sites across six states in the midwest and north carolina usa fig 1 the site descriptions are summarized in table 1 most were on university owned and managed research farms and the remainder on private farm cooperator fields the research area extended from 35 to 44 north latitude and 76 96 west longitude this research spanned five usda plant hardiness zones phz table 2 the soil drainage class ranged from somewhat poorly drained to very poorly drained as determined using the usda soil survey the subsurface drainage of all sites consisted of 100 mm perforated corrugated tubing and included both cd and fd treatments tile depth ranged from 0 61 m to 1 22 m and tile spacing varied from 6 m to 36 m all of the sites had similar drainage designs across treatments except ia story2 where tile spacing was 27 and 36 m for fd and cd plots respectively five sites had replications and these were in general smaller in size with an average drainage area of 1 3 ha sites that did not include replications were larger farm fields with an average drainage area of 11 1 ha except one a university research field with an average drainage area of 1 8 ha in total 40 experimental units were used for this synthesis study replications were averaged at mo knox1 and ia story2 2 2 field management 2 2 1 agronomic factors the paired treatments fd and cd plots were managed similarly in terms of cropping system tillage fertilizer application and residue management during the study period most of the sites were in continuous maize or maize soybean rotation although there was some variation popcorn soybean rotation oh auglaize1 maize soybean with occasional wheat oh auglaize2 and a two year three crop maize wheat soybean rotation with winter wheat and soybean double cropped during the same year nc washington the crop was not established as a treatment in the experimental design in most locations except for ia washington in which both maize and soybean were grown each year the amount of nitrogen n applied to maize and popcorn varied across locations and years with site average rates ranging from 165 kg n ha 1 at nc washington to 259 kg n ha 1 at in randolph table 3 in any given year an average rate of nitrogen applied was between 150 and 250 kg n ha 1 soybean was not fertilized while wheat received 130 kg n ha 1 on average the timing of application was typically in the spring or split between a spring application followed by a sidedress application approximately two to four weeks later exceptions were mn redwood1 where manure was applied during the fall in some years and ia washington where n fertilizer application was split across years fall followed by spring application a few times fields were managed and operated according to common farm practices for the area including tillage and herbicide applications planting and harvest dates are summarized in table 3 2 2 2 controlled drainage in general the water table was actively managed in the cd plots using an inline water level control structure the nc washington site used stop logs in a ditch to maintain the water table at a constant depth throughout the study period typical cd management of the outlet height for each site is illustrated in fig 2 at all sites except nc washington the outlet elevation was adjusted throughout the year to different heights fig 2 typically the cd outlet elevation was maintained at a set height from late fall after harvest until early april a few weeks before planting the elevation was lowered to drain the soil profile and limit saturated soil conditions for field trafficability and the consequent enhancement of the crop establishment by reducing excess water stress during summer the outlet elevation was raised to potentially retain available water for the crop and was kept at that level until a few weeks before harvest when it was lowered again during relatively dry years the outlet elevation was less intensively adjusted or unaltered throughout the growing season as the water table level was often below the tile depth nevertheless these site years were regarded as cd within the analysis 2 3 data collection research data were collected from 2007 to 2017 variables monitored included drain flow and drainage water nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentration and the latter was measured in all but two sites the number of measurement years varied between sites table 2 but was not less than two years for any location the majority of the data 65 were collected during a five year period from 2009 to 2013 with an average number of sites each year greater than 8 during the remaining years there were less than four sites from which data were collected field management data including planting fertilization and cd management information were collected although variations in reporting frequency and specificity differed between sites data from these experiments are published at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 and iowa state university https drainagedata org 2 3 1 drain flow and nitrate n concentration measurement drain flow was monitored year round across all sites except the two northernmost locations sd clay and mn redwood1 where measuring instrumentations were removed during winter months to avoid frost damage at 10 of the 13 sites the amount of drainage was estimated by measuring water depth in the inline water level control structure via a pressure transducer or a bubbler flow meter and converting to flow rates using corresponding rating curves at ia story2 and nc washington a sump pump was used with a digital flow meter while at in randolph an inline electromagnetic flow meter was installed in 2012 allowing measurement of both forward and backward flow flow rates were divided by the area drained and aggregated into an area weighted total daily flow in mm nitrate n concentration was measured at 11 of the 13 sites during the study period methods for collecting water samples varied from discrete grab to automated composite time and flow proportional sampling time proportional samples were generally combined into weekly composite samples before laboratory analysis grab and flow proportional samples were usually obtained weekly or bi weekly when water was present during the growing season and less frequently during the winter the samples were stored in a refrigerator or freezer and typically analyzed for no3 n plus no2 n concentration within a month daily drain flow data from some sites contained gaps typically caused by instrument failure or environmental conditions such as flooding the missing values were estimated for gaps no larger than 150 continuous days using a gap filling process developed by the project team chighladze et al 2020 first missing data during the no flow periods of the year typically due to frozen soil were filled in with zeros next if replicated or adjacent plots were available missing data were estimated by fitting a linear regression model for each season individually otherwise if on site precipitation data were available missing data were imputed in two steps for days when rain occurred an empirical relationship was established between the 3 day moving average precipitation and observed daily peak flow for days with no precipitation drainage was estimated from the previous day using a 1st order recession equation with a coefficient calculated from observed data assuming a linear slope between peak and inflection points of log transformed daily drainage gaps at sites without replicate plots or onsite precipitation data or longer than 150 days were not filled as a result 144 individual stretches of missing periods with an average length of less than one month were imputed using this method a detailed description of the methods used for drain flow and water quality measurements at each site are published with the research data at the usda national agricultural library ag data commons chighladze et al 2021 and iowa state university https drainagedata org as noted previously 2 3 2 nitrate n load for sites with flow proportional samples no3 n loads were determined by multiplying the no3 n concentration of the composite sample by the volume of water flow when the composite sample was collected for sites with time proportional samples the no3 n concentration was in general linearly interpolated between samples and multiplied by the drain flow for a corresponding day to estimate nutrient loads from the tile outlets a slightly different procedure was used in oh delaware where the volume of water associated with any single sample was determined using the midpoint approach the temporal midpoint between each sample was determined and the volume of water was calculated between two consecutive temporal points because no3 n concentrations in tile drains are fairly consistent time proportional sampling has been shown to provide estimates of annual load within 10 for the sampling frequencies used williams et al 2015 and sites with different sampling procedures were not distinguished in the analysis 2 3 3 precipitation the iowa environmental mesonet iem 2017 was used to obtain precipitation data from the nearest weather stations at all locations annual and seasonal precipitations were calculated for each site year included in the analysis and categorized as wet normal or dry based on 30 year precipitation data collected between 1986 and 2015 precipitation category table 2 shows the 30 year average annual precipitation for each location annual precipitation within 0 5 standard deviations from the mean of these 30 year data was identified as normal any value exceeding the range was classified as wet while anything below was classified as dry upper and lower limits were similarly defined for each season and used to categorize values accordingly for each site year 2 4 data processing variables measured across sites included drain flow n 13 and nitrate n load n 11 annual flow and load were calculated based on a water year herein referred to as year which begins october 1 and ends september 30 seasonal flow and load were categorized by seasons spring apr may june n 91 d summer july aug sept n 92 d fall oct nov dec n 92 d and winter jan feb mar n 90 or 91 d daily drain flow data from some sites contained gaps typically caused by instrument failure or environmental conditions such as flooding the missing values were estimated for gaps no larger than 150 continuous days and for which on site precipitation was available using a gap filling process developed by the project team chighladze et al 2020 there were 144 individual stretches of missing periods with an average length of less than one month that were imputed using this method and these data were used in this synthesis daily drain flow and load data were further processed based on standards applied across all sites to ensure missing data were handled uniformly first sites with data from fewer than 80 of days in a year less than 292 of 365 were removed second each individual season was required to have data from 80 of days 73 d or more the only exception to this was the winter season in northern and western sites which was required to have 45 of days 45 d or more third replicates were removed if the paired treatment of that replication was missing fourth an individual season was removed if the number of available days with data differed by more than 10 between cd and fd within a replication finally a water year was removed if all four seasons were not present following these processing steps the processed data for flow include 65 756 daily observations of fd and cd this number equates to 90 paired comparisons between cd and fd on an annual basis and 360 on a seasonal basis the processed data for nitrate n load include 57 722 daily observations of fd and cd this number equates to 79 paired comparisons between cd and fd on an annual basis and 316 on a seasonal basis 2 5 statistical analyses to assess broad regional differences the sites were grouped by usda plant hardiness zone usda ars 2012 plant hardiness zones are defined by the long term average of the coldest temperature observed per year therefore the phzs are correlated with differences in snowfall and soil frost between the sites five phzs are represented in this study fig 1 table 2 assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed among sites and phzs for all variables absolute drain flow from the fd treatment reduction in drain flow due to cd nitrate n load from the fd treatment and reduction in nitrate n load due to cd normality was tested using the shapiro wilk test and all of the annual and seasonal variables violated the assumption of normality except for annual fd flow the homogeneity of variance assumption was assessed using the bartlett test with annual absolute fd flow and load meeting the assumption of equal variances but the reduction in annual flow and load due to cd did not none of the seasonal measures met the assumption of equal variances given the lack of normality and homogeneity of variance several non parametric models were examined such as kruskal wallis and friedman however these models were not adequate due to the presence of multiple groupings site phz seasons and incomplete blocking therefore all data were natural log transformed for statistical analyses using a mixed model anova with error assigned to replicate within site year within site and site within phz the median values from non transformed data are included in all tables and figures sites phzs seasons and the interactions were considered statistically significant when p 0 10 overall statistical significance is shown in the tables pairwise comparisons among the interactions are provided in the supplemental materials data analyses graphing model fitting and statistical analyses were performed using the r statistical package within r studio version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 rstudio team 2016 2 5 1 nitrate n transport dynamics the relationship between weekly nitrate n load and drain flow was evaluated to assess the nitrate n transport dynamics this analysis identifies whether nitrate n concentration changes with variation in drain flow weeks with zero flow were not used in this analysis a linear regression was fit between the natural log of weekly nitrate n load l in kg n ha 1 and drain flow d mm as described in tomer et al 2003 1 ln l b ln d ln a in which a is a constant and b is the slope which is also known as an elasticity coefficient alexander et al 1996 when the slope of the linear regression is equal to one nitrate n concentration remains constant with varying flow depth when the slope is greater than one high flows coincide with higher nitrate n concentrations furthermore the slope is the percent increase in nitrate n load caused by a 1 increase in flow depth the durbin watson statistic showed the presence of serial correlation in the weekly data as a result we used a similar procedure as outlined by ghane et al 2016 to determine the slope of the regression while accounting for serial correlation the autoreg procedure of sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc was used to estimate the slope of the regression we constructed the 90 confidence interval to determine if the slope of the linear regression was significantly different from one 3 results 3 1 drain flow characteristics the fd treatment was evaluated across the 13 sites to identify the difference in magnitude of flow across the study region the median annual drain flow range 136 450 mm was significantly different across the sites p 0 007 fig 3 grouping by plant hardiness zone showed that the median annual drainage ranged from 294 mm for zone 5b to 422 mm for zone 5a relative to annual precipitation this annual drain flow ranged from 28 to 49 table 4 there was no statistically significant difference in annual drain flow across the phzs table 4 this lack of statistically significant differences is due in part to the wide variation in drain flow at most sites and the number of site years within each phz although there was little difference in annual drain flow by phz the seasonal variation in drain flow was substantial across phzs fig 4 table s1 zones 4b and 5a southern mn south eastern sd and northern ia had greater flow in the spring than other seasons in contrast the greatest drain flow was in the winter season in phzs 6a and 8a oh and nc based on this seasonal analysis regions to the north and west had a greater percentage of the total annual drainage occurring in the spring whereas winter was the dominant period for drainage to the east and south the magnitude of drain flow varied across wet normal and dry years from 205 to 414 mm table 5 and these differences are statistically significant between all three categories 3 2 nitrate n load patterns similar to drain flow there were no statistically significant differences in annual nitrate n load across phzs table 4 on an absolute basis the highest nitrate n loss was in phz 5a and the lowest nitrate n loss was in phz 8a across the region the nitrate n load from fd systems was similar for the conditions and years studied however when analyzed on a seasonal basis there were nitrate n loading differences by phz and season fig 4 table s1 similar to the drain flow phzs 4b and 5a had the greatest seasonal nitrate n load in the spring while in phzs 6a and 8a the winter season demonstrated the greatest nitrate n loading from the drainage systems when precipitation is compared across precipitation categories there was approximately a 20 increase or decrease in annual precipitation between the wet or dry category and normal table 5 compared to the normal values these differences resulted in a 27 increase in flow and a 28 increase in load in the wet category and a 37 decrease in flow and 49 decrease in load in the dry category the differences in annual nitrate n load were also statistically significant across all three precipitation categories 3 3 nitrate n concentration patterns annual and seasonal flow weighted mean fwm nitrate n concentrations were calculated as the seasonal or annual nitrate n load divided by the seasonal or annual drain flow overall on an annual basis the difference in nitrate n fwm concentration by phz was not statistically significant table 4 when the nitrate n concentration was evaluated across seasons and phzs there were differences in only 11 of 29 comparisons fig 5 table s1 therefore in general the nitrate n fwm concentrations in drain flow were fairly stable and did not reflect seasonal differences in nitrogen fertilizer application at most sites nitrogen fertilizer was applied for maize in the spring season table 3 3 4 impacts of controlled drainage on drain flow the change in drain flow when cd was implemented was calculated on an absolute basis as the difference between cd and fd and as a percent of fd negative values represent a reduction in drain flow due to cd which performed similarly across phzs with a change in median annual drain flow from 88 to 135 mm 28 to 49 table 6 the reduction in drain flow with cd differed by phz on a seasonal basis fig 6 table s2 the change in drain flow ranged from 0 to 85 mm depending on the phz and season the season with the greatest reduction in drain flow differed by zone with the greatest flow reduction in the spring for phzs 4b and 5a and in the winter period for 6a and 8a as might be expected the season of greatest flow reduction was also the season of greatest flow the change in drain flow with cd was also similar across precipitation categories table 5 the amount of precipitation did not affect the absolute change in annual drain flow although the change in percent drain flow was less in wetter years the analysis was also conducted on a seasonal basis which did not differ for phz and precipitation category data not shown overall during wet normal and dry years cd reduced drain flow by 107 116 mm across the study region resulting in a 28 reduction in flow in wet years and a 52 reduction in dry years 3 5 impacts of controlled drainage on nitrate n load the change in annual nitrate n load with cd ranged from 3 7 to 19 1 kg n ha 1 table 6 the change in nitrate n load with cd varied among phzs when analyzed on a seasonal basis fig 6 table s2 the change in nitrate n load ranged from 1 1 to 7 4 kg n ha 1 depending on the phz and season the greatest load reduction occurred in the spring for all phzs except 6a where in spring there was a load increase with cd given that 51 of the annual flow occurred within the winter season in zone 6a the large load reduction was likely due to water held back with cd during the winter being released during the spring period for phz 6a in the winter the median flow for free drainage was 173 mm and there was a median flow reduction with cd of 78 mm 3 6 impacts of drain flow and controlled drainage on nitrate n concentrations and load the relationship between nitrate n load and drain flow depth was not different between cd and fd systems fig 7 as the slopes of the linear regression models are not significantly different p value 0 293 this result indicates no significant difference in flow weighted nitrate n concentration between cd and fd the reason for not detecting changes in nitrate n concentration between cd and fd could be that when all the site years are combined in fig 7 there are other factors affecting cd rather than just cd affecting nitrate n concentartion factors that could have affected nitrate n concentration include differences in location weather drainage design depth and spacing soil and farm management the plot of the natural log of weekly nitrate n load and drain flow shows that most nitrate n concentrations varied from approximately 1 to 30 mg l 1 for each of the cd and fd datasets fig 8 results showed that nitrate n concentration was less than 10 mg l 1 the drinking water standard 39 and 41 of the weeks for cd and fd datasets respectively while nitrate n concentration varied from one site to another and from year to year the slope of the linear regressions slope 0 99 for cd and slope 1 02 for fd were not significantly different from one in each of the cd and fd datasets the lack of slope difference from one indicates that nitrate n concentration remained constant with variation in drain flow across all site years fig 8 in other words a 1 increase in drain flow coincided with an approximately 1 increase in nitrate n load this means that change in nitrate n load is proportional to the change in drain flow fig 8 the linear regression slope for each season was also not significantly different than one showing no change in nitrate n concentration with drain flow within each season fig s1 4 discussion drain flow and nitrate n load from subsurface drainage systems were similar across a large geographical region on an annual basis despite differences in annual precipitation soil types drainage design and site specific agronomic management however there were seasonal differences as we looked across the study region as we move east and south in our study region we see a greater percentage of drain flow and nitrate n loss occurring in the winter it is necessary to consider the effectiveness of the implemented conservation practices for winter drainage flow and load to reduce downstream nitrate n loading in these areas in the west and north areas of our study region more of the drain flow and nitrate n load occurred in the spring and conservation practice implementation should consider this result for example cover crops have been found to be quite effective for reducing nitrate n concentrations in spring in parts of this region especially if cover crops can be effectively established qi et al 2011 these areas with greater loading in the spring may be the most important targets for conservation practice implementation since spring loading to the gulf of mexico may have the greatest impact on the hypoxic zone us epa sab 2007 in our study cd reduced drainage volume by 28 33 and 52 for the wet normal and dry precipitation categories respectively this reduction is consistent with a recent meta analysis by wang et al 2020 which found that cd reduced subsurface drainage volume by approximately 30 for dry land crops cd was found to reduce annual drain flow and nitrate n load across the region but sites north and west had greater flow and load reduction in the spring since this period experienced the greatest flow and load in many locations the outlet of the cd system is not managed in the weeks leading up to planting to allow the soil to reach a more trafficable state controlled drainage outlet controls will need to be implemented as long as possible to consistently reduce flow and load from systems in the north and west active management of drainage outlets during the growing season may be most critical in these areas to get as much benefit as possible during that late spring season in the future automation may facilitate active management and possibly be paired with other items such as nitrate n sensors to inform management e g identifying and prioritizing periods of when to manage aggressively or passively a period to manage aggressively could be following a drought when nitrate n loss could be high in subsequent drainage events in addition understanding the timing of drain flow and ultimately nitrate n loss may have implications for the performance of other crop management practices such as cover crops and enhanced efficiency fertilizers also the timing of drain flow and nutrient loading could be critical for water quality in receiving water bodies us epa sab 2007 controlled drainage reduced flow and load a consistent absolute amount across wet normal and dry precipitation years so from the data collected we would not expect cd to be an effective strategy for providing a greater reduction in wet years i e cd would not absorb the extra loading in wet years this observation has implications when trying to meet water quality goals as multiple conservation practices would likely be required on one piece of land as expected cd did not decrease nitrate n concentration coming directly from the drainage systems despite reducing downstream nitrate n loading so if local water quality protection is most dependent on nitrate n concentration reductions directly coming from the drains other conservation and fertilizer management practices beyond cd should be considered to reduce nitrate n load synergistically while there were no significant differences in nitrate n concentration by phz there was a general trend for decreasing nitrate n concentrations as we moved from the northwest locations to the southeast this trend could result from various factors including climate controls on nutrient cycling nitrogen management cropping practices and soils for example the site in north carolina included wheat as part of a two year maize wheat soybean rotation this aspect is one that should be investigated further especially in studies where there are greater similarities in agronomic management the high coefficient of determination r square of 0 92 in fig 8 confirms that drain flow dictated nitrate n load in subsurface drainage from this subsurface drainage would be the dominant pathway of nitrate n loss also nitrate n concentration remained constant with variation in drain flow across all site years insignificant variation in nitrate n concentration with a change in flow at a specific site has been reported previously tomer et al 2003 in addition consistent with the discussion by skaggs et al 2012 we found that cd did not reduce nitrate n concentrations and the nitrate n load reductions were related to flow reductions overall subsurface drainage flow not surface runoff is well known to be the dominant pathway for nitrate n loss schilling et al 2020 craft et al 2018 therefore practices that reduce drainage discharge such as cd and shallow drains can reduce nitrate n load from subsurface drained fields the transforming drainage project brought together experimental data from 13 ongoing and historical cd experiments across the corn belt and in north carolina in a unique data set chighladze et al 2021 these sites varied in climate soil and agronomic practices as the cooperating farmers and projects under which data collection began had different goals data collection at each site followed a minimum set of protocols for inclusion in the database but many procedures differed across the sites although more questions could be answered if all experiments had been conducted with consistent protocols the dataset provides unprecedented opportunity for the comparison and synthesis across sites conducted here 5 conclusions we evaluated subsurface drainage flow nitrate n load and performance of controlled drainage cd systems across the corn belt and in north carolina across the data set and regions there was little difference in annual flow from free drainage fd conditions on a seasonal basis sites more north and west experience a greater percentage of the annual flow in the spring which may impact the choice of conservation practices and the relative influence on hypoxia in the gulf of mexico nitrate n loads followed similar trends as the drain flow for the fd conditions annual flow and nitrate n load reductions with cd drainage did not vary by plant hardiness zone phz across the region but the season with the greatest reduction did shift later in the north and west drain flow reductions with cd did not vary based on precipitation category such that there were similar absolute flow reductions regardless of precipitation category consequently the percent reduction was lower as the amount of precipitation category increased this result indicates we would expect similar absolute flow reductions in wet years and would not get a disproportionately positive impact from cd during wet years the analysis found that observed nitrate n load reduction was directly related to drain flow reduction i e no nitrate n concentration reduction with cd overall this analysis found cd to effectively reduce direct drain flow and nitrate n loading to downstream water bodies declaration of competing interest the authors

9836,conflict between limited water supply and the ever increasing water demand poses the challenge of synergetic management of agricultural water and land resources awlr sustainable development strategy and changing environment increase the multi dimensional characteristic and complexity of the management of awlr this paper establishes a model framework for the multi dimensional optimization of awlr in a changing environment the model framework is advantageous of 1 comprehensively allocating water and land resources on the basis of clarifying their interactions 2 balancing incompatible goals from multiple dimensions including resources society economy ecology and environment 3 proposing alternative allocation schemes of awlr that can response to the changing environment of both natural and socio economic changes allocation schemes of awlr based on the model framework are generated analyzed and evaluated the comprehensiveness equilibrium and security of multi dimensional targets help obtain the optimum adaptation allocation plans of awlr to cope with changing environment the real world case study in songhua river basin in northeast china verifies the feasibility and practicality of the model framework the study found that the model framework can manage awlr in a sustainable way and meanwhile provide decision makers alternatives plans of awlr for different natural and social changing environments which will further contribute to the alleviation of agricultural water scarcity and the promotion of agricultural sustainable development graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural water and land resources multiple dimensions collaborative optimization rcps ssps model sustainability water security 1 introduction water resources shortage has aggravated the contradictions and conflicts among natural resources economy ecology society and environment and is becoming a severe global challenge most sustainable development goals sdgs which are released in 2015 are directly or indirectly affected by water shortage vanham et al 2018 agricultural irrigation water accounts for 70 of global freshwater consumption dai and li 2013 li et al 2018 and agricultural water shortage will seriously restrict the sustained economic and social development agricultural water allocation has an impact on the allocation of crop cropping structures as water and land resources interact with each other the allocation of awlr is a prerequisite for food production and is related to food security economic development and environmental effects fan et al 2020 li et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 which in turn affect the agricultural production and sustainable development of the region this leads to the necessity to optimal allocate awlr simultaneously to realize sdgs many methods such as linear programming nonlinear programming dynamic programming multi objective programming genetic optimization algorithm game based theory and synergetic based theory have been used for optimal allocation of agricultural water and or land resources recently the comprehensive allocation of awlr on the basis of considering their relationship are reported for example xie et al 2018 developed an inexact stochastic fuzzy programming model for optimal allocation of land resources and irrigation water resources to achieve the goal of system economic benefit maximization linker 2020 proposed a model based optimization method for allocation of cropping areas and water which could be used to make the optimal irrigation plans for different crops in different regions tang et al 2020 developed a remote sensing based optimization approach to obtain sustainable management strategies of awlr at grid scale water shortage and the discordant development of social economy and ecological environment have exacerbated the need for sustainable management of awlr the sustainable allocation of awlr requires that the focus should not be solely on economic benefits the comprehensive effects of natural resources use social economy development and ecological environment protection are desired to consider simultaneously in response to requirements of sustainable development decision makers need to comprehensively consider the cooperative effect of natural resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions when managing awlr multi objective programming mop technique is an effective way to balance conflict goals and some studies have been reported to allocate agricultural water and or land resources using mop for example tang et al 2019 established a mop model for the agricultural water allocation based on the spatial and temporal variations of precipitation and evaporation with the goal of maximizing economic benefits and minimizing water shortage ren et al 2019 proposed an improved multi objective stochastic fuzzy programming method for the simultaneous optimization of irrigation water quantity and irrigation areas aiming at maximizing net income maximizing agricultural water productivity and minimizing irrigated area yang et al 2020 proposed a fuzzy multi objective linear fractional programming fmolfp algorithm based on superiority and inferiority measures method to optimize agricultural planting structure in order to achieve the goals of maximum economic benefit per unit irrigation water and maximum grain production efficiency however few studies simultaneously optimized both agricultural water and land resources with the trade off of multi dimensional goals of natural resources use economic development social stability ecological and environment protection in a model framework since the 20th century the increase in water demand has caused severe water shortages in many parts of the world schewe et al 2014 wada et al 2011 2013 crop water demand is a sensitive factor in the allocation of awlr gong et al 2020 climate change and socio economic development together affect crop water demand which further influence water shortages greve and seneviratne 2015 gudmundsson et al 2017 huang et al 2017 climate change affects crop water requirements by meteorological elements such as temperature duration of sunshine and wind speed while socio economic development that is driven by human activities leads to changes in hydrological elements which accordingly affects water demand through social water cycle processes and crop planting conditions therefore the in depth study of the joint effect of climate change and social and economic development on crop water demand and how does it drive the multi dimensional allocation of awlr is necessary and significant this will be conducive to improve the coping capacity of comprehensive use of agricultural water and land resources on complex changes in the environment nevertheless relevant studies are limited therefore this study establishes a comprehensive allocation model framework of awlr that simultaneously considers conflict goals from multiple dimensions of resource use efficiency economic benefits social equity ecological and environmental protection on the basis of quantifying dual changing environment modes of climate change and social economic development change the model framework is capable of 1 comprehensively allocating water surface water and groundwater and land resources for different kinds of crops in different regions to alleviate the imbalance of water supply demand considering the correlation between water and land resources within a model framework 2 optimally coordinating contradictories between natural resources use efficiency resources allocation equity economic benefit biological productivity air and water environmental effects corresponding resources social economic ecological and environmental dimensions respectively 3 obtaining a series of alternative allocation plans of awlr that response to dual change environment of both climate change and socio economic development change 4 gaining in sight into the system s comprehensiveness equilibrium security to select the optimal awlr allocation plans that contribute to promote to the sustainable use of awlr the model framework is applied to songhua river basin in heilongjiang province northeast china 2 modeling this section develops a model based framework for simultaneous allocation of awlr the framework is mainly composed of two parts the first part focuses on the construction of a multi dimensional multi objective optimization model including the quantification of multiple objective functions of resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions and the corresponding constraints and the model solution method the second part emphasizes the generation of combined changing environment patterns including both climate change and social economic development changes the framework is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 multi dimensional modeling for agricultural water and land allocation 2 1 1 notations this part develops a multi dimensional multi objective programming model for the simultaneous allocation of awlr the following is the list of notations to present the model clearly table 1 2 1 2 objective function 2 1 2 1 resource dimension agricultural production consumes a certain amount of water and land resources this paper selects two indicators i e irrigation water use efficiency iwue and water footprint to quantitatively characterize how to make full and effective use of limited water and land resources to produce grain maximum iwue this goal is to maximize the yield of food crops per unit of irrigation

blue water resources i e the total evapotranspiration of irrigation water during the growth period of the crop grey water footprint refers to the grey water demand i e the amount of polluted dilution water produced by pesticides and fertilizers during the growth period of crops the utilization efficiency of blue water green water and grey water is based on the virtual water theory which can be obtained by the method of hoekstra and hung 2002 2 v w c c w r y 10 d 1 l g p e t c y 3 e t c k c e t 0 the virtual water content vwc m3 kg refers to the ratio of the crop water requirements cwr m3 ha

day to the day of harvest lgp is the length of the growth cycle in days based on the concept of virtual water and water footprint the following three objective functions are used to reflect the utilization efficiency of awlr maximum green water utilization rate this objective is to maximize the consumption of green water resources and the purpose is to make full use of effective rainfall to meet crop water requirements 4 max g r e e n w a t e r i 1 i j 1 j y i j a i j v w g i j i 1 i j 1 j y i j a i j v w c i j 5 v w g c w r g r e e n y 10 e t g r e e n y 6 e t g r e e n m i n e t c p e

economic development this paper uses the maximum profit to quantify the objective function of economic dimension profit equals to the total revenue minus the total cost including planting costs and water supply costs this objective function can be expressed as follows 12 max p r o f i t t b t c 13 t b i 1 i j 1 j y i j p j 14 t c a i j c i j c h h i j c f f i j c m m i j c o o i j p s u r x i j

paper uses gini coefficient to describe the fairness of resources allocation among sub regions hu et al 2016 the value range of the gini coefficient is 0 1 and smaller value of gini coefficient indicates more balanced distribution of awlr therefore the objective function of the social dimension is to minimize gini coefficient and it can be expressed as follows 15 min g i n i 1 2 i i 1 i j 1

change ecological condition while consuming awlr this paper uses ecological pressure index epi to quantify the objective of ecological dimensions the epi can be expressed as the ratio of ecological footprint to ecological carrying capacity xiu juan and qin yu 2009 which reflects whether the consumption of awlr exceeds the carrying capacity of resources and reflects the supply demand relationship of awlr among them the ecological footprint of water resources reflects the consumption of water resources by planting and the ecological carrying capacity of water resources reflects the water resources that the water body can provide the smaller the epi the more abundant water resources can be provided which is more conducive to ecological protection therefore the objective function of the ecological dimension is to minimize the epi which can be expressed as follows 16 min e p i i 1 i j 1 j a i j x i j s u r x i j g r o p e i p w r i 1 i 0 4 r φ i q i p w 2 1 2 5 environmental dimension agricultural production generates considerable effect on the environment two aspects of environment effects were taken into account non point source pollution and greenhouse gas emissions minimum non

method there are various solution methods for the multi objective programming model constructed in this paper such as the minimum deviation method the affiliation function method the weight method the constraint method and the intelligent algorithm in this paper a compromise programming approach cp is used to solve the model zeleny 1973 in contrast to other decision making methods cp aims to minimize the distance between the optimal value and the standard value this distance concept can be used as a measure of human preference to define the ideal point and therefore cp is able to determine the solution that is closest to the ideal solution khodaei et al 2018 the main advantage of cp is its ability to determine the closest ideal solution without any interference from decision makers salman et al 2019 decision making is often difficult due to conflicting objectives the application of this method makes multivariate optimization feasible to form a reasonable system that can eliminate the conflict of multiple objectives while satisfying a given budget condition and is therefore widely used as a multi objective solution method de sousa xavier et al 2015 fattahi and fayyaz 2010 miao et al 2021 for a mop model containing n objective functions the following formula can be used to convert the mop model into a single objective programming model 38 min d x n 1 n w n k z n o p t z n x z n o p t z n inf k 1 k x is the vector of decision variables n is the subscript of the objective function w n k is the weight of the objective function of n this study uses the analytic hierarchy process to define the weight of the objective function srdjevic and medeiros 2008 z n x is the objective function value z n opt z n inf are respectively the maximum and minimum values of objective function n k is a measurement parameter with a value of 1 2 which reflects the significance of the maximum deviation from the ideal point 2 3 changing environment module 2 3 1 climate change climate change has aggravated the contradiction between water supply and demand it directly affects water cycle process of farmland and thus changes allocation patterns of awlr in 2014 the fifth assessment report ar5 issued by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc proposed a new emission scenario model rcps representative concentration pathways rcps integrate simple climate models atmospheric chemistry assessment models and global carbon cycle models and are divided into four emission scenarios according to the concentration of different greenhouse gases low forcing level rcp2 6 moderately stable scene rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and high baseline emission scenario rcp8 5 this study selects two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which are moderately stable and high baseline emission scenarios general circulation models gcms are considered to be the best available tool for simulating future climate and are widely used to predict future scenarios of regional water resources malik et al 2020 the combination of multiple models gives better predictions than one model alone pierce et al 2008 and the ability of each gcm to simulate different variables is different selection criteria based on the assessment of gcms performance in china and the relative independence and good performance of precipitation temperature simulations knutti et al 2013 yan et al 2015 this paper selects four gcms that are suitable for the study area and are among the more commonly used in asian climate change and hydrology studies for climate prediction as shown in table 2 based on meteorological forecast data temperature wind speed sunshine duration etc under different representative concentration pathways rcps from 2020 to 2050 crop water demand can be obtained using penmen monteith formula 2 3 2 social and economic development path human activities such as application of chemical fertilizer pesticide and agricultural films will produce large volumes of greenhouse gases which will affect global climate hansen et al 2010 trenberth et al 2015 in the meanwhile the path and direction of social and economic development will also increase the uncertainty of water resources supply and demand the shared socio economic path ssps are reliable tool for the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to describe future social development in the context of climate change fujimori et al 2014 it is proposed by ipcc with a comprehensive consideration of population economy technological progress resource utilization and other factors ssps are social economic development scenario related to greenhouse gas emissions which can organically combine social and economic development with climate change environmental change resource utilization change etc ssps include five shared social economic paths 1 sustainability path ssp1 sustainability that is green development path this path takes sustainable development as the goal independent of fossil fuels supply and has low resource intensity requirements 2 middle of the road ssp2 middle of the road which is facing challenges of moderate climate change this path maintains the current social and economic development trend and gradually reduces the dependence on fossil fuels by achieving factional developing goals 3 regional competition path ssp3 regional rivalry this path represents the condition of inconsistent development regional development there are big differences between regions and the development is depended heavily on fossil fuels 4 the unbalanced path ssp4 inequality which focuses on challenges and the development within and between regions or countries is highly uneven 5 development path that is dominated by fossil fuels ssp5 fossil fueled development this path emphasizes the heavy use of fossil energy attaches importance to the improvement of economic strength and faces high social challenges among them ssp1 can depict a sustainable future ssp2 is a development path that is more consistent with the development patterns observed in the past and ssp3 can provide a reference for the path of pursuing economic development paths of ssp4 and ssp5 attach great importance to economic development so that the social and economic development is extremely unbalanced which are extreme economic development modules excluding the more extremely unbalanced two economic development models the three development paths ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 can provide a qualitative description of the development of a rational globalization of socioeconomic conditions and are widely used in many studies fricko et al 2017 greve et al 2018 combining with representative concentration pathways kriegler et al 2012 this study selects three economic development models of ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 based on the three economic development models the population development environment analysis pde model is used to predict the population of the study area 2 3 3 coupled module climate change will affect meteorological elements such as temperature duration of sunshine and wind speed and further affect water demand of crops the path of socio economic development affects population gdp etc and hence affects regional water demand combining climate change with socio economic development paths and comprehensively considering and predicting the impact of meteorological elements and population on water demand so as to select the best awlr management policies that are suitable for regions have practical significant for the sustainable use of awlr in order to assess the uncertainty of water supply and demand in a changing environment this study used the popular tool general circulation model gcms to simulate future climate wang et al 2017a 2017b which are proposed in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the rcp scenarios are combined to predict future climate change organically integrate the climate scenario and the future economic development path of the society obtain the water and land resource planning plan under the changing environment model establish a decision making framework and obtain the optimal socio economic development policy suitable for the authorities therefore this study generates 12 scenarios of water supply and demand 4 general circulation models gcm and 3 changing environmental models considering the comprehensive effect of climate change and socio economic development paths the generation of the three changing environmental models is based on the combination of ssps and rcps including sustainable development plan ssp1 rcp4 5 middle path plan ssp2 rcp4 5 and regional competition plan ssp3 rcp8 5 as shown in fig 2 this part aims to make in depth analysis of future water shortage based on optimal allocation of awlr and thus provide decision making for sustainable awlr especially for vulnerable regions with resource shortage 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is selected in the coastal cities of the songhua river basin that flows through heilongjiang province the songhua river basin is one of the seven major river basins in china it is located in the central and southern heilongjiang province it has a continental monsoon climate with the annual average rainfall is approximately 500 mm it is a major food production base of rice corn and soybeans which were selected as the studied crops in this study there are 8 cities in the songhua river basin that flow through heilongjiang province namely harbin hegang shuangyashan yichun jiamusi qitaihe mudanjiang suihua the area is 235 300 km2 the main inflow of water in this area is concentrated in the period from june to september the study area experiences with a long frost period and faces water shortage problem therefore it is necessary to rationally allocate awrl in the area to alleviate water shortage and thus promote agricultural sustainability fig 3 describes the study area 3 2 data collection in order to predict future supply demand ratio of regional water resources population and water demand in 2020 2050 were firstly forecast population and gdp data come from the official ssp database water demand prediction was obtained based on crop evapotranspiration which can be calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et 0 with crop coefficient k c the acquisition of et 0 relied on meteorological data average minimum temperature average maximum temperature average precipitation average wind speed and sunshine hours which were from china meteorological data service center cmdc et 0 was calculated by the penman monteith formula recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allan et al 1998 and it was expressed as follows 39 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 e a e d t 273 δ γ

regional water supply data and regional planting areas were all derived from the heilongjiang province water resources bulletin 2000 2017 the heilongjiang statistical almanacks and field investigations table 3 shows relevant basic parameters of the model this study simulate runoff using selection method based on person ⅲ distribution gu et al 2008 according to the class iii standard in the chinese groundwater quality standard gb t 14848 93 the allowable maximum pollution concentration was set as c max 20 mg l the background concentration was set c nat 0 the leaching rate δ of nitrogen fertilizer was 10 et green is calculated by the cropwat model of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations sun et al 2013 the water balance factor r is equal to the global average ecological productivity of land for water divided by the global average ecological productivity of all types of ecologically productive land area taken as 5 19 the global average production capacity of water resources pw is taken as 3140 m3 ha the 0 4 in the denominator of the ecological dimension objective function is the maximum use factor of the regional water resources set for sustainable development effective rainfall pe was estimated based on fao cropwat model that was expressed as follows 40 p e p 4 17 0 02 p 4 17 p 83 41 7 0 1 p p 83 p is the amount of rainfall mm 3 3 results analysis 3 3 1 agricultural water resource allocation schemes according to the predicted water supply and demand in different regions the optimal water allocation under the three changing environmental modes were obtained as shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that as the development path was changed the changes of water allocation follows the law regional competition path intermediate development path sustainable development path this indicates that the demand for water for regional economic development increased thus the corresponding water allocation would increase from the results of use proportion of different sources of water resources surface water was given priority the total allocation amount of groundwater under sustainable intermediate path and regional competition modules were 2758 million m3 3565 million m3 and 3801 million m3 respectively it can be seen that in the path of sustainable development surface water supply could already meet most water requirements in different regions with the requirements of development the increase in water demand requires an increase in the distribution of groundwater 3 3 2 equilibrium analysis considering the interaction of multi objective of resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions the equilibrium and merits of allocation schemes of awlr under different changing environment modes were obtained as shown in fig 6 the area size of the graphs under each boundary reflected the equilibrium of the optimal allocation plans of awlr while the satisfaction degree of objectives in each dimension reflected the metrics of the allocation plans it can be seen from the figure that during 2020 2030 the equilibrium and merits of awlr allocation plans under the middle path were better than the other two paths from 2031 2040 the equilibrium and merits of awlr allocation plans under middle path mode and under regional competition mode were similar and the plans under sustainable development mode was better than the other modes from 2041 2050 the equilibrium of the sustainable development mode was better than that of the other two modes however in comparison awlr allocation plans under sustainable development mode corresponded to the smallest economic benefit while the economic benefit under regional competition path was the largest however the ecological and environmental effect under regional competition were too small to meet the goal of balanced development therefore awlr allocation plans under the middle path was more optimal plans that could be adopted 3 3 3 economic benefit ecological benefit was usually the most notable targets the value and changing trend of economic benefit were a key indicator to determine regional usage of awlr fig 7 shows the changing trends of economic benefit under changing environment mode of ipsl cm5a lr based on the figure it can be seen that in 2020 2030 and 2031 2040 the economic benefits in the period of 2020 2030 and 2031 2040 were the largest under the regional competition mode the economic benefit under the intermediate development mode during 2031 2040 was slightly larger than that under the regional competition mode the economic benefit under the sustainable development mode during 2020 2030 was greater than that under the middle path mode while the corresponding values under the remaining periods were all the smallest therefore from an overall point of view the economic target value experienced a changing trend law of regional competition path intermediate development path sustainable development path in fig 7 changing trends of economic benefit under ccsm4 the economic benefit during 2041 2050 had the following rules of intermediate development path regional competition path sustainable development path hence it can be found that the economic benefit might not achieve its optimum value for the sustainable use of awlr although economic benefit was prioritized from the perspective of sustainable development it was particularly important to ensure sustainable and comprehensive economic development when making strategic decisions on the use of awlr in addition the economic target values under the three changing environmental modes in the three periods did not reach the corresponding ideal value this attributed to the balance of the other four dimensions as shown in fig 8 the figure represents the correlation coefficients and provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the interactions between different dimensions the figure shows that the environmental resource social and ecological dimensions were negatively correlated with the economic dimension among them the environment resource and ecological dimensions had the largest negative correlation with the economic dimension which indicates that the guarantee of the effect of the other dimensions would constrain the economic development to some extent the other dimensions except the economic dimension were positively correlated with each other these show that environmental resource social and ecological dimensions had a mutually reinforcing and co fulfilling relationship this study took sustainability as the goal to make trade offs between different objectives in different dimensions to obtain the optimum allocation plans of awlr the economic benefit tended to be as large as possible at the premise of seeking the balance of other targets in the rest four dimensions 3 3 4 water security the optimal allocation plans of awlr should be based on regional water security the water supply demand ratio is an important indicator that can reflect water security which was adopted in this study to evaluate the adaptation and metrics of different allocation schemes of awlr as shown in fig 9 the shades of the colors in the picture indicate the security of the allocation schemes of awlr in the period 2020 2030 for some regions where the initial water supply demand ratio was poor such as hegang city and mudanjiang city the optimal water supply demand ratio under the sustainable development model was improved corresponding to the optimal water security condition some regions with good initial water supply demand ratios such as harbin shuangyashan yichun and jiamusi were recommended to choose awlr allocation plans under regional competition mode at the initial stage to attach importance on economic development in the middle period i e from 2031 to 2040 most regions performed well in water security under the middle path mode and regional competition mode and hegang city could still maintain a sustainable development mode during the period 2041 2050 most regions had the optimum water security condition under the middle path mode and water security in hegang city was the best take harbin the provincial capital of heilongjiang province as an example the changes of water supply demand ratio was shown in fig 10 from the initial state to 2031 harbin had the best water supply and demand situation under the scenario of regional competition but afterwards it shows a downward trend until the lowest under the three scenarios water supply and demand condition under sustainable scenario was always in a relatively stable state while the water supply and demand condition under the middle path presents a state of gradual ascent and then remaining stable therefore after 2031 the water security condition of harbin would present the best under the scenario mode of the middle path 3 4 results options this study used the analytic hierarchy process to determine the objective weights of the five dimensions of resources ecology society economy and environment under different changing environmental modes table 4 can inform decision makers on the determination of dimensional focus in a changing environment based on objective weights the optimal solutions of the multi dimensional model under different changing environment modes could be solved table 5 provides the awlr adaptation plans for each region at different future time periods based on the balance and comprehensiveness of each dimension and the combined consideration of water security table 6 shows the ratio of water supply to water demand at this stage in each region which gives an indication of the initial supply and demand situation in each region the table shows that the areas with good initial supply and demand are jiamusi city and yichun city in contrast hegang city and mudanjiang city had a poor initial supply to demand situation with the value of supply demand ratio both being less than 0 5 it can be seen from the table that based on the overall equilibrium metrics of economic benefits and water security allocation schemes of awlr of hegang and mudanjiang cities where the initial water supply demand situations were poor were recommended to adopt sustainable development mode in the initial time period for cities with good initial water supply demand conditions this study suggests the awlr allocation plans to adopt a competition competition intermediate mode within 2020 2050 during 2041 2050 water security in all the studied eight areas presented the optimum condition in the middle path scenario for qitaihe city and suihua city although their initial supply demand conditions were not poor there was still a certain gap between them and the optimum water supply demand situation therefore this study suggested qitaihe city and suihua city to adopt a middle competition middle management plan accordingly considering initial water supply demand conditions decision makers could choose the optimum awlr allocation plans based on the developed multi dimensional optimization model framework 4 conclusion this paper constructed a model framework for the comprehensive allocation of agricultural water and land resources in a changing environment the model framework includes 1 development of a multi dimensional optimization model for simultaneous allocation of agricultural water and land resources which contains objectives involving natural resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions and constrains corresponding to each dimension the compromised planning method was adopted to solve the multi objective programming model 2 quantification of changing environment modes combing climate change scenarios and socio economic path scenarios compared with previous studies that were focused on the management of agricultural water and land resources the main innovations and contributions of this study mainly reflected in 1 agricultural water and land resources can be optimized simultaneously considering their interactions in the meanwhile conflicts between different dimensions of resources economy society ecology and environment were balanced also for each dimension there were more than one objectives to reflect characteristics of each dimension more comprehensive therefore targets of irrigation water use efficiency water saving economic benefit resources allocation equity ecological stresses non point pollution and greenhouse gas emission were optimized synergistically which would contribute to the management of agricultural water and land resources from a holistic view 2 agricultural water and land allocation plans were generated under complex changing environment more specifically the effect of both natural changes and human activities on agricultural water and land use were considered natural changes were quantified by climate changes modes combination of different gcm and rcp scenarios and human activities were quantified by socio economic development paths this will help provide decision makers crisis response to changing environment when planning agricultural water and land resources the feasibility and applicability of the developed model framework was demonstrated by applying it in the songhua river basin in heilongjiang province northeast china agricultural water and land resources allocation schemes of different crops in different regions under different climate change and socio economic development path changes scenarios were obtained the corresponding changing trend of resources use efficiency economic benefit social stability ecological presses and pollution were in depth analyzed the optimum agricultural water and land resources allocation plans were also generated based on the comprehensive consideration of system s comprehensiveness equilibrium and security the model framework can be applied to other regions with water scarcity future work will focus on the dynamics of the model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

keywords agricultural water and land resources multiple dimensions collaborative optimization rcps ssps model sustainability water security 1 introduction water resources shortage has aggravated the contradictions and conflicts among natural resources economy ecology society and environment and is becoming a severe global challenge most sustainable development goals sdgs which are released in 2015 are directly or indirectly affected by water shortage vanham et al 2018 agricultural irrigation water accounts for 70 of global freshwater consumption dai and li 2013 li et al 2018 and agricultural water shortage will seriously restrict the sustained economic and social development agricultural water allocation has an impact on the allocation of crop cropping structures as water and land resources interact with each other the allocation of awlr is a prerequisite for food production and is related to food security economic development and environmental effects fan et al 2020 li et al 2020 zeng et al 2018 which in turn affect the agricultural production and sustainable development of the region this leads to the necessity to optimal allocate awlr simultaneously to realize sdgs many methods such as linear programming nonlinear programming dynamic programming multi objective programming genetic optimization algorithm game based theory and synergetic based theory have been used for optimal allocation of agricultural water and or land resources recently the comprehensive allocation of awlr on the basis of considering their relationship are reported for example xie et al 2018 developed an inexact stochastic fuzzy programming model for optimal allocation of land resources and irrigation water resources to achieve the goal of system economic benefit maximization linker 2020 proposed a model based optimization method for allocation of cropping areas and water which could be used to make the optimal irrigation plans for different crops in different regions tang et al 2020 developed a remote sensing based optimization approach to obtain sustainable management strategies of awlr at grid scale water shortage and the discordant development of social economy and ecological environment have exacerbated the need for sustainable management of awlr the sustainable allocation of awlr requires that the focus should not be solely on economic benefits the comprehensive effects of natural resources use social economy development and ecological environment protection are desired to consider simultaneously in response to requirements of sustainable development decision makers need to comprehensively consider the cooperative effect of natural resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions when managing awlr multi objective programming mop technique is an effective way to balance conflict goals and some studies have been reported to allocate agricultural water and or land resources using mop for example tang et al 2019 established a mop model for the agricultural water allocation based on the spatial and temporal variations of precipitation and evaporation with the goal of maximizing economic benefits and minimizing water shortage ren et al 2019 proposed an improved multi objective stochastic fuzzy programming method for the simultaneous optimization of irrigation water quantity and irrigation areas aiming at maximizing net income maximizing agricultural water productivity and minimizing irrigated area yang et al 2020 proposed a fuzzy multi objective linear fractional programming fmolfp algorithm based on superiority and inferiority measures method to optimize agricultural planting structure in order to achieve the goals of maximum economic benefit per unit irrigation water and maximum grain production efficiency however few studies simultaneously optimized both agricultural water and land resources with the trade off of multi dimensional goals of natural resources use economic development social stability ecological and environment protection in a model framework since the 20th century the increase in water demand has caused severe water shortages in many parts of the world schewe et al 2014 wada et al 2011 2013 crop water demand is a sensitive factor in the allocation of awlr gong et al 2020 climate change and socio economic development together affect crop water demand which further influence water shortages greve and seneviratne 2015 gudmundsson et al 2017 huang et al 2017 climate change affects crop water requirements by meteorological elements such as temperature duration of sunshine and wind speed while socio economic development that is driven by human activities leads to changes in hydrological elements which accordingly affects water demand through social water cycle processes and crop planting conditions therefore the in depth study of the joint effect of climate change and social and economic development on crop water demand and how does it drive the multi dimensional allocation of awlr is necessary and significant this will be conducive to improve the coping capacity of comprehensive use of agricultural water and land resources on complex changes in the environment nevertheless relevant studies are limited therefore this study establishes a comprehensive allocation model framework of awlr that simultaneously considers conflict goals from multiple dimensions of resource use efficiency economic benefits social equity ecological and environmental protection on the basis of quantifying dual changing environment modes of climate change and social economic development change the model framework is capable of 1 comprehensively allocating water surface water and groundwater and land resources for different kinds of crops in different regions to alleviate the imbalance of water supply demand considering the correlation between water and land resources within a model framework 2 optimally coordinating contradictories between natural resources use efficiency resources allocation equity economic benefit biological productivity air and water environmental effects corresponding resources social economic ecological and environmental dimensions respectively 3 obtaining a series of alternative allocation plans of awlr that response to dual change environment of both climate change and socio economic development change 4 gaining in sight into the system s comprehensiveness equilibrium security to select the optimal awlr allocation plans that contribute to promote to the sustainable use of awlr the model framework is applied to songhua river basin in heilongjiang province northeast china 2 modeling this section develops a model based framework for simultaneous allocation of awlr the framework is mainly composed of two parts the first part focuses on the construction of a multi dimensional multi objective optimization model including the quantification of multiple objective functions of resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions and the corresponding constraints and the model solution method the second part emphasizes the generation of combined changing environment patterns including both climate change and social economic development changes the framework is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 multi dimensional modeling for agricultural water and land allocation 2 1 1 notations this part develops a multi dimensional multi objective programming model for the simultaneous allocation of awlr the following is the list of notations to present the model clearly table 1 2 1 2 objective function 2 1 2 1 resource dimension agricultural production consumes a certain amount of water and land resources this paper selects two indicators i e irrigation water use efficiency iwue and water footprint to quantitatively characterize how to make full and effective use of limited water and land resources to produce grain maximum iwue this goal is to maximize the yield of food crops per unit of irrigation water it takes into account the relationship between crop yield and water consumption and it can be expressed as follows 1 max i w u e i 1 i j 1 j y i j a i j i 1 i j 1 j a i j x i j s u r x i j g r o p e i the concept of water footprint can help reflect the utilization efficiency of different forms of water resources throughout the growth period of crops including green blue and grey water footprint green water footprint refers to the green water consumption i e the total evapotranspiration of rainwater during the growth period of crops blue water footprint refers to the consumption of blue water resources i e the total evapotranspiration of irrigation water during the growth period of the crop grey water footprint refers to the grey water demand i e the amount of polluted dilution water produced by pesticides and fertilizers during the growth period of crops the utilization efficiency of blue water green water and grey water is based on the virtual water theory which can be obtained by the method of hoekstra and hung 2002 2 v w c c w r y 10 d 1 l g p e t c y 3 e t c k c e t 0 the virtual water content vwc m3 kg refers to the ratio of the crop water requirements cwr m3 ha

day to the day of harvest lgp is the length of the growth cycle in days based on the concept of virtual water and water footprint the following three objective functions are used to reflect the utilization efficiency of awlr maximum green water utilization rate this objective is to maximize the consumption of green water resources and the purpose is to make full use of effective rainfall to meet crop water requirements 4 max g r e e n w a t e r i 1 i j 1 j y i j a i j v w g i j i 1 i j 1 j y i j a i j v w c i j 5 v w g c w r g r e e n y 10 e t g r e e n y 6 e t g r e e n m i n e t c p e

economic development this paper uses the maximum profit to quantify the objective function of economic dimension profit equals to the total revenue minus the total cost including planting costs and water supply costs this objective function can be expressed as follows 12 max p r o f i t t b t c 13 t b i 1 i j 1 j y i j p j 14 t c a i j c i j c h h i j c f f i j c m m i j c o o i j p s u r x i j

paper uses gini coefficient to describe the fairness of resources allocation among sub regions hu et al 2016 the value range of the gini coefficient is 0 1 and smaller value of gini coefficient indicates more balanced distribution of awlr therefore the objective function of the social dimension is to minimize gini coefficient and it can be expressed as follows 15 min g i n i 1 2 i i 1 i j 1

change ecological condition while consuming awlr this paper uses ecological pressure index epi to quantify the objective of ecological dimensions the epi can be expressed as the ratio of ecological footprint to ecological carrying capacity xiu juan and qin yu 2009 which reflects whether the consumption of awlr exceeds the carrying capacity of resources and reflects the supply demand relationship of awlr among them the ecological footprint of water resources reflects the consumption of water resources by planting and the ecological carrying capacity of water resources reflects the water resources that the water body can provide the smaller the epi the more abundant water resources can be provided which is more conducive to ecological protection therefore the objective function of the ecological dimension is to minimize the epi which can be expressed as follows 16 min e p i i 1 i j 1 j a i j x i j s u r x i j g r o p e i p w r i 1 i 0 4 r φ i q i p w 2 1 2 5 environmental dimension agricultural production generates considerable effect on the environment two aspects of environment effects were taken into account non point source pollution and greenhouse gas emissions minimum non point source pollution the control of non point source pollution npsp is embodied in the application amount control of total nitrogen and total phosphorus emissions this goal is to minimize the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus flowing into the soil and rivers and thus reduce pollution load and non point source pollution in farmland this objective function can be expressed as follows 17 min n p s p

minimum carbon footprint this goal is to minimize the net greenhouse gas emission by subtracting carbon fixation amount from the total greenhouse gas emissions during the entire growth period of crops zhang et al 2017 this objective function can be expressed as follows 21 min c a r b o n f o o t p r i n t e c o 2 298 e n 2 o 25 e c h 4 c s 22 e c o 2 i 1 i j 1 j a i j h i j q h f i j q f o i j q o

dimensions is subject to the following conditions 2 1 3 1 resource dimension water constraints the amount of surface water and groundwater used should be less than the corresponding amount of water availability this constraint can be expressed as follows 26 j 1 j a i j i j x i j s u r s w i e t a i s u r i 27 j 1 j a i j i j x i j g r o g w i e t a i g r o i land constraints the total planting area should be less than the maximum arable area the planting area of each crop in each region should be larger than the minimum planting area to guarantee food production and smaller than the maximum

method there are various solution methods for the multi objective programming model constructed in this paper such as the minimum deviation method the affiliation function method the weight method the constraint method and the intelligent algorithm in this paper a compromise programming approach cp is used to solve the model zeleny 1973 in contrast to other decision making methods cp aims to minimize the distance between the optimal value and the standard value this distance concept can be used as a measure of human preference to define the ideal point and therefore cp is able to determine the solution that is closest to the ideal solution khodaei et al 2018 the main advantage of cp is its ability to determine the closest ideal solution without any interference from decision makers salman et al 2019 decision making is often difficult due to conflicting objectives the application of this method makes multivariate optimization feasible to form a reasonable system that can eliminate the conflict of multiple objectives while satisfying a given budget condition and is therefore widely used as a multi objective solution method de sousa xavier et al 2015 fattahi and fayyaz 2010 miao et al 2021 for a mop model containing n objective functions the following formula can be used to convert the mop model into a single objective programming model 38 min d x n 1 n w n k z n o p t z n x z n o p t z n inf k 1 k x is the vector of decision variables n is the subscript of the objective function w n k is the weight of the objective function of n this study uses the analytic hierarchy process to define the weight of the objective function srdjevic and medeiros 2008 z n x is the objective function value z n opt z n inf are respectively the maximum and minimum values of objective function n k is a measurement parameter with a value of 1 2 which reflects the significance of the maximum deviation from the ideal point 2 3 changing environment module 2 3 1 climate change climate change has aggravated the contradiction between water supply and demand it directly affects water cycle process of farmland and thus changes allocation patterns of awlr in 2014 the fifth assessment report ar5 issued by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc proposed a new emission scenario model rcps representative concentration pathways rcps integrate simple climate models atmospheric chemistry assessment models and global carbon cycle models and are divided into four emission scenarios according to the concentration of different greenhouse gases low forcing level rcp2 6 moderately stable scene rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 and high baseline emission scenario rcp8 5 this study selects two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 which are moderately stable and high baseline emission scenarios general circulation models gcms are considered to be the best available tool for simulating future climate and are widely used to predict future scenarios of regional water resources malik et al 2020 the combination of multiple models gives better predictions than one model alone pierce et al 2008 and the ability of each gcm to simulate different variables is different selection criteria based on the assessment of gcms performance in china and the relative independence and good performance of precipitation temperature simulations knutti et al 2013 yan et al 2015 this paper selects four gcms that are suitable for the study area and are among the more commonly used in asian climate change and hydrology studies for climate prediction as shown in table 2 based on meteorological forecast data temperature wind speed sunshine duration etc under different representative concentration pathways rcps from 2020 to 2050 crop water demand can be obtained using penmen monteith formula 2 3 2 social and economic development path human activities such as application of chemical fertilizer pesticide and agricultural films will produce large volumes of greenhouse gases which will affect global climate hansen et al 2010 trenberth et al 2015 in the meanwhile the path and direction of social and economic development will also increase the uncertainty of water resources supply and demand the shared socio economic path ssps are reliable tool for the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to describe future social development in the context of climate change fujimori et al 2014 it is proposed by ipcc with a comprehensive consideration of population economy technological progress resource utilization and other factors ssps are social economic development scenario related to greenhouse gas emissions which can organically combine social and economic development with climate change environmental change resource utilization change etc ssps include five shared social economic paths 1 sustainability path ssp1 sustainability that is green development path this path takes sustainable development as the goal independent of fossil fuels supply and has low resource intensity requirements 2 middle of the road ssp2 middle of the road which is facing challenges of moderate climate change this path maintains the current social and economic development trend and gradually reduces the dependence on fossil fuels by achieving factional developing goals 3 regional competition path ssp3 regional rivalry this path represents the condition of inconsistent development regional development there are big differences between regions and the development is depended heavily on fossil fuels 4 the unbalanced path ssp4 inequality which focuses on challenges and the development within and between regions or countries is highly uneven 5 development path that is dominated by fossil fuels ssp5 fossil fueled development this path emphasizes the heavy use of fossil energy attaches importance to the improvement of economic strength and faces high social challenges among them ssp1 can depict a sustainable future ssp2 is a development path that is more consistent with the development patterns observed in the past and ssp3 can provide a reference for the path of pursuing economic development paths of ssp4 and ssp5 attach great importance to economic development so that the social and economic development is extremely unbalanced which are extreme economic development modules excluding the more extremely unbalanced two economic development models the three development paths ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 can provide a qualitative description of the development of a rational globalization of socioeconomic conditions and are widely used in many studies fricko et al 2017 greve et al 2018 combining with representative concentration pathways kriegler et al 2012 this study selects three economic development models of ssp1 ssp2 and ssp3 based on the three economic development models the population development environment analysis pde model is used to predict the population of the study area 2 3 3 coupled module climate change will affect meteorological elements such as temperature duration of sunshine and wind speed and further affect water demand of crops the path of socio economic development affects population gdp etc and hence affects regional water demand combining climate change with socio economic development paths and comprehensively considering and predicting the impact of meteorological elements and population on water demand so as to select the best awlr management policies that are suitable for regions have practical significant for the sustainable use of awlr in order to assess the uncertainty of water supply and demand in a changing environment this study used the popular tool general circulation model gcms to simulate future climate wang et al 2017a 2017b which are proposed in the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar5 the rcp scenarios are combined to predict future climate change organically integrate the climate scenario and the future economic development path of the society obtain the water and land resource planning plan under the changing environment model establish a decision making framework and obtain the optimal socio economic development policy suitable for the authorities therefore this study generates 12 scenarios of water supply and demand 4 general circulation models gcm and 3 changing environmental models considering the comprehensive effect of climate change and socio economic development paths the generation of the three changing environmental models is based on the combination of ssps and rcps including sustainable development plan ssp1 rcp4 5 middle path plan ssp2 rcp4 5 and regional competition plan ssp3 rcp8 5 as shown in fig 2 this part aims to make in depth analysis of future water shortage based on optimal allocation of awlr and thus provide decision making for sustainable awlr especially for vulnerable regions with resource shortage 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is selected in the coastal cities of the songhua river basin that flows through heilongjiang province the songhua river basin is one of the seven major river basins in china it is located in the central and southern heilongjiang province it has a continental monsoon climate with the annual average rainfall is approximately 500 mm it is a major food production base of rice corn and soybeans which were selected as the studied crops in this study there are 8 cities in the songhua river basin that flow through heilongjiang province namely harbin hegang shuangyashan yichun jiamusi qitaihe mudanjiang suihua the area is 235 300 km2 the main inflow of water in this area is concentrated in the period from june to september the study area experiences with a long frost period and faces water shortage problem therefore it is necessary to rationally allocate awrl in the area to alleviate water shortage and thus promote agricultural sustainability fig 3 describes the study area 3 2 data collection in order to predict future supply demand ratio of regional water resources population and water demand in 2020 2050 were firstly forecast population and gdp data come from the official ssp database water demand prediction was obtained based on crop evapotranspiration which can be calculated by multiplying reference evapotranspiration et 0 with crop coefficient k c the acquisition of et 0 relied on meteorological data average minimum temperature average maximum temperature average precipitation average wind speed and sunshine hours which were from china meteorological data service center cmdc et 0 was calculated by the penman monteith formula recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao allan et al 1998 and it was expressed as follows 39 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 e a e d t 273 δ γ

regional water supply data and regional planting areas were all derived from the heilongjiang province water resources bulletin 2000 2017 the heilongjiang statistical almanacks and field investigations table 3 shows relevant basic parameters of the model this study simulate runoff using selection method based on person ⅲ distribution gu et al 2008 according to the class iii standard in the chinese groundwater quality standard gb t 14848 93 the allowable maximum pollution concentration was set as c max 20 mg l the background concentration was set c nat 0 the leaching rate δ of nitrogen fertilizer was 10 et green is calculated by the cropwat model of the food and agriculture organization of the united nations sun et al 2013 the water balance factor r is equal to the global average ecological productivity of land for water divided by the global average ecological productivity of all types of ecologically productive land area taken as 5 19 the global average production capacity of water resources pw is taken as 3140 m3 ha the 0 4 in the denominator of the ecological dimension objective function is the maximum use factor of the regional water resources set for sustainable development effective rainfall pe was estimated based on fao cropwat model that was expressed as follows 40 p e p 4 17 0 02 p 4 17 p 83 41 7 0 1 p p 83 p is the amount of rainfall mm 3 3 results analysis 3 3 1 agricultural water resource allocation schemes according to the predicted water supply and demand in different regions the optimal water allocation under the three changing environmental modes were obtained as shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that as the development path was changed the changes of water allocation follows the law regional competition path intermediate development path sustainable development path this indicates that the demand for water for regional economic development increased thus the corresponding water allocation would increase from the results of use proportion of different sources of water resources surface water was given priority the total allocation amount of groundwater under sustainable intermediate path and regional competition modules were 2758 million m3 3565 million m3 and 3801 million m3 respectively it can be seen that in the path of sustainable development surface water supply could already meet most water requirements in different regions with the requirements of development the increase in water demand requires an increase in the distribution of groundwater 3 3 2 equilibrium analysis considering the interaction of multi objective of resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions the equilibrium and merits of allocation schemes of awlr under different changing environment modes were obtained as shown in fig 6 the area size of the graphs under each boundary reflected the equilibrium of the optimal allocation plans of awlr while the satisfaction degree of objectives in each dimension reflected the metrics of the allocation plans it can be seen from the figure that during 2020 2030 the equilibrium and merits of awlr allocation plans under the middle path were better than the other two paths from 2031 2040 the equilibrium and merits of awlr allocation plans under middle path mode and under regional competition mode were similar and the plans under sustainable development mode was better than the other modes from 2041 2050 the equilibrium of the sustainable development mode was better than that of the other two modes however in comparison awlr allocation plans under sustainable development mode corresponded to the smallest economic benefit while the economic benefit under regional competition path was the largest however the ecological and environmental effect under regional competition were too small to meet the goal of balanced development therefore awlr allocation plans under the middle path was more optimal plans that could be adopted 3 3 3 economic benefit ecological benefit was usually the most notable targets the value and changing trend of economic benefit were a key indicator to determine regional usage of awlr fig 7 shows the changing trends of economic benefit under changing environment mode of ipsl cm5a lr based on the figure it can be seen that in 2020 2030 and 2031 2040 the economic benefits in the period of 2020 2030 and 2031 2040 were the largest under the regional competition mode the economic benefit under the intermediate development mode during 2031 2040 was slightly larger than that under the regional competition mode the economic benefit under the sustainable development mode during 2020 2030 was greater than that under the middle path mode while the corresponding values under the remaining periods were all the smallest therefore from an overall point of view the economic target value experienced a changing trend law of regional competition path intermediate development path sustainable development path in fig 7 changing trends of economic benefit under ccsm4 the economic benefit during 2041 2050 had the following rules of intermediate development path regional competition path sustainable development path hence it can be found that the economic benefit might not achieve its optimum value for the sustainable use of awlr although economic benefit was prioritized from the perspective of sustainable development it was particularly important to ensure sustainable and comprehensive economic development when making strategic decisions on the use of awlr in addition the economic target values under the three changing environmental modes in the three periods did not reach the corresponding ideal value this attributed to the balance of the other four dimensions as shown in fig 8 the figure represents the correlation coefficients and provides a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the interactions between different dimensions the figure shows that the environmental resource social and ecological dimensions were negatively correlated with the economic dimension among them the environment resource and ecological dimensions had the largest negative correlation with the economic dimension which indicates that the guarantee of the effect of the other dimensions would constrain the economic development to some extent the other dimensions except the economic dimension were positively correlated with each other these show that environmental resource social and ecological dimensions had a mutually reinforcing and co fulfilling relationship this study took sustainability as the goal to make trade offs between different objectives in different dimensions to obtain the optimum allocation plans of awlr the economic benefit tended to be as large as possible at the premise of seeking the balance of other targets in the rest four dimensions 3 3 4 water security the optimal allocation plans of awlr should be based on regional water security the water supply demand ratio is an important indicator that can reflect water security which was adopted in this study to evaluate the adaptation and metrics of different allocation schemes of awlr as shown in fig 9 the shades of the colors in the picture indicate the security of the allocation schemes of awlr in the period 2020 2030 for some regions where the initial water supply demand ratio was poor such as hegang city and mudanjiang city the optimal water supply demand ratio under the sustainable development model was improved corresponding to the optimal water security condition some regions with good initial water supply demand ratios such as harbin shuangyashan yichun and jiamusi were recommended to choose awlr allocation plans under regional competition mode at the initial stage to attach importance on economic development in the middle period i e from 2031 to 2040 most regions performed well in water security under the middle path mode and regional competition mode and hegang city could still maintain a sustainable development mode during the period 2041 2050 most regions had the optimum water security condition under the middle path mode and water security in hegang city was the best take harbin the provincial capital of heilongjiang province as an example the changes of water supply demand ratio was shown in fig 10 from the initial state to 2031 harbin had the best water supply and demand situation under the scenario of regional competition but afterwards it shows a downward trend until the lowest under the three scenarios water supply and demand condition under sustainable scenario was always in a relatively stable state while the water supply and demand condition under the middle path presents a state of gradual ascent and then remaining stable therefore after 2031 the water security condition of harbin would present the best under the scenario mode of the middle path 3 4 results options this study used the analytic hierarchy process to determine the objective weights of the five dimensions of resources ecology society economy and environment under different changing environmental modes table 4 can inform decision makers on the determination of dimensional focus in a changing environment based on objective weights the optimal solutions of the multi dimensional model under different changing environment modes could be solved table 5 provides the awlr adaptation plans for each region at different future time periods based on the balance and comprehensiveness of each dimension and the combined consideration of water security table 6 shows the ratio of water supply to water demand at this stage in each region which gives an indication of the initial supply and demand situation in each region the table shows that the areas with good initial supply and demand are jiamusi city and yichun city in contrast hegang city and mudanjiang city had a poor initial supply to demand situation with the value of supply demand ratio both being less than 0 5 it can be seen from the table that based on the overall equilibrium metrics of economic benefits and water security allocation schemes of awlr of hegang and mudanjiang cities where the initial water supply demand situations were poor were recommended to adopt sustainable development mode in the initial time period for cities with good initial water supply demand conditions this study suggests the awlr allocation plans to adopt a competition competition intermediate mode within 2020 2050 during 2041 2050 water security in all the studied eight areas presented the optimum condition in the middle path scenario for qitaihe city and suihua city although their initial supply demand conditions were not poor there was still a certain gap between them and the optimum water supply demand situation therefore this study suggested qitaihe city and suihua city to adopt a middle competition middle management plan accordingly considering initial water supply demand conditions decision makers could choose the optimum awlr allocation plans based on the developed multi dimensional optimization model framework 4 conclusion this paper constructed a model framework for the comprehensive allocation of agricultural water and land resources in a changing environment the model framework includes 1 development of a multi dimensional optimization model for simultaneous allocation of agricultural water and land resources which contains objectives involving natural resources economic social ecological and environmental dimensions and constrains corresponding to each dimension the compromised planning method was adopted to solve the multi objective programming model 2 quantification of changing environment modes combing climate change scenarios and socio economic path scenarios compared with previous studies that were focused on the management of agricultural water and land resources the main innovations and contributions of this study mainly reflected in 1 agricultural water and land resources can be optimized simultaneously considering their interactions in the meanwhile conflicts between different dimensions of resources economy society ecology and environment were balanced also for each dimension there were more than one objectives to reflect characteristics of each dimension more comprehensive therefore targets of irrigation water use efficiency water saving economic benefit resources allocation equity ecological stresses non point pollution and greenhouse gas emission were optimized synergistically which would contribute to the management of agricultural water and land resources from a holistic view 2 agricultural water and land allocation plans were generated under complex changing environment more specifically the effect of both natural changes and human activities on agricultural water and land use were considered natural changes were quantified by climate changes modes combination of different gcm and rcp scenarios and human activities were quantified by socio economic development paths this will help provide decision makers crisis response to changing environment when planning agricultural water and land resources the feasibility and applicability of the developed model framework was demonstrated by applying it in the songhua river basin in heilongjiang province northeast

9837,lifting water is crucial to irrigate agricultural terraces in the mediterranean region but the energy demand and emissions of modern forms of water pumping have increased while many traditional water wheels which lift water at zero direct emissions have been abandoned we explored the state of preservation and the potential for the deployment of traditional water wheels known as norias in the ricote valley of southeast spain where some are still in function while also investigating the reasons for their widespread abandonment a mixed method approach is used here to combine gis based methods an expert survey and a technological and socio economic assessment of noria renovation our findings show that norias in the ricote valley have mostly been replaced by thermal engine water lifting technologies the reactivation of traditional irrigation technologies many of them lying dormant but still standing could contribute to reducing the high energy demand and the resulting emissions of irrigation systems in the mediterranean region and beyond it was estimated by data extrapolation that 16 renovated norias included in our analysis can irrigate 140 3 ha in the ricote valley for a total achievable power of 23 8 kw to irrigate a similar surface applying diesel motor pumps would produce up to 148 tons of emissions year and cost up to approx 70 000 year based on a price of 1 25 l diesel for a maximum of 8760 working hours year in the case of electric pumps we estimate that up to 55 tons of emissions year and costs up to approx 48 000 year can be saved therefore we argue that rediscovering traditional technologies has potential to contribute to achieving climate actions that reduce ghg emissions sustainable development goal 13 moreover these technologies provide multiple functions and services for a sustainable life on land sustainable development goal 15 which needs to be considered within a holistic approach graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigated

past ten centuries or more balbo et al 2016 blondel 2006 lasanta et al 2017b the agricultural terraces of the ricote valley are part of a gravity based irrigation system which was introduced more than 1000 years ago puy and balbo 2013 water wheels that lift irrigation water to higher agricultural terraced land known as norias have played a key role in the long term sustainability of these irrigated landscapes allowing the exponential extension of irrigated land based on a zero emission technology the rural development policy within the second pillar of the common agricultural policy cap of the eu aims to combine ecological and social needs with economic targets unfortunately the cap has also perhaps unwillingly contributed to the homogenization of rural landscapes and to the deterioration of small scale agriculture during the last decades chemnitz 2019 heider et al 2021 lefebvre et al 2015 a minimum area of 0 2 ha is needed to obtain subsidies in spain this combined with the gradual withdrawal of small amounts of public aids has further intensified these trends boe 2014 accelerating the abandonment of traditional technologies often used and maintained by smallholders while ubiquitous in large human agglomerations knowledge and innovations are fast eroding in rural areas also due to rural urban migration of the young population balbo et al 2020 tacoli and mabala 2010 the resulting lack of access to existing knowledge is another major limitation for smart and sustainable development in rural areas copus et al 2011 where traditional knowledge is a key dimension of

stillwater and awad 1991 indeed water wheel sites both mills and pumping sites can be considered among the main drivers of economic industrial and social development of rural agricultural spaces before the industrial revolution hassan 2011 quaranta and wolter 2021 it is estimated that over 350 000 of such hydro sites may have existed in europe at one time or another in japan water wheels comprised 56 of total power generation until 1886 punys et al 2019 quaranta and wolter 2021 the abandonment of most norias in spain started with the generalized introduction of motor pumps over the past decades bravo sánchez 2018 closas 2014 the following increase of intensive groundwater extraction technologies promoted over extraction in spain closas 2014 indeed most water wheels have been replaced by motors or hydro plants all over europe quaranta et al 2021 from a current perspective norias are valued for promoting landscape aesthetics as well as the multifunctionality of rural areas by fostering recreation and rural tourism gil meseguer 2014 furthermore water wheels are increasingly valued for renewable power production at low head sites and at old mill weirs this opens up possibilities for the re use of traditional water wheels installed power typically below 50 kw which have been abandoned during the past decades müller and kaupert 2004 quaranta and revelli 2018 quaranta 2018 quaranta et al 2021 this study analyses the state of norias in the ricote valley while also exploring the reasons for their deterioration furthermore we investigate the potential for their renovation and their potential contribution to the multifunctionality of agriculture this leads to the following research questions 1 what is the current state of preservation of norias in the ricote valley 2 what are the reasons for the observed abandonment of norias during the past decades 3 what is the potential of noria renovation for a sustainable agricultural system to address these questions we used a mixed method approach combining gis based methods an expert survey and an assessment of the potentials of noria renovation first we collected available geo data to explore the state of preservation and location of norias in the ricote valley second we combined participant observation with the inquiry of experts to identify the reasons for the deterioration of norias finally we investigated the norias under a hydraulic and geometric perspective with the aim of calculating their irrigation potential i e the pumped flow rate irrigated area as well as emission mitigation and saved costs compared to electric and diesel pumps we also elaborated their geometric dimensions in order to find easy and expeditious tools that can be used in future research to re construct and estimate unknown dimensions and performance of norias the estimation of such dimensions is important to better understand their historical deployment for irrigation in the past but also their potential as an integral component of future pathways for sustainable agricultural systems the results will be then discussed with focus on the ricote valley and could be extrapolated to other traditional agricultural landscapes in the mediterranean region 2 study area the study area is the ricote valley in the region of murcia southeast spain fig 1 the climate in the study area is semi arid with strong seasonality we include in our analysis seven villages which stretch alongside the segura river abarán blanca ricote ojos ulea villanueva and archena with a population of 44 742 in 2020 instituto nacional de estadística 2021 part of the villages are the traditional orchards fig 2 lemon is the current primary crop cultivated in the valley followed by olive almond multiple fruits and vegetables many farmers cultivate their primary products for export which leads to challenges due to price volatility and competition with modern industrial agriculture in the neighboring regions heider et al 2021 furthermore the agricultural properties are highly fragmented due to the traditional heritage system in the study area most of the agricultural properties are smaller than 1 hectare heider et al 2018 thus smallholder farming dominates agriculture in the study area until today the traditional orchards contain multiple levels of agricultural terraces in different sizes and shapes divided by stonewalls and crossed by small irrigation canals these terraces are part of a hydraulic system which was introduced by amazigh berber populations over 1000 years ago for flood irrigation puy and balbo 2013 norias were added at a later stage of expansion of these agricultural systems lifting water and expanding agricultural land to ever higher grounds they are distributed along irrigation canals outbranched from the segura river which is characterized by strong seasonal differences and high flood risk ministerio para la transición ecológica y el reto demográfico 2021 technically the norias in the ricote valley originate from the egyptian water wheel with buckets attached and powered by the water flow it was originally invented by the romans approx between 600 and 700 bce yannopoulos et al 2015 during the middle ages the expansion of arab civilizations contributed to the broad diffusion and progressive modification of norias across the islamic world martínez soler and banegas ortiz 1994 in the ricote valley they probably existed prior to the 16th century as they were well known and widespread in al andalus however their installation in the valley coincided with a population increase and therefore the need to increase irrigated cropland from the 16th century onwards garcía avilés 2000 puy 2012 with an increasing production the transport of locally produced crops became also important with large numbers of muleteers in the valley deployed to export cash crops garcía avilés 2007 the current norias are a result of the adaptation to the cultivation of new crops rising production and rising irrigation needs for an increasing agricultural area therefore they increased in size with the increasing needs for water uplift garcía avilés 2007 pérez picazo and lemeunier 1990 the traditional irrigation system made of historic elements such as norias irrigation canals and agricultural terraces shapes a cultural and multifunctional landscape which represents the local water culture of the region garcía avilés 2014 2000 gil meseguer 2010 at the same time it illustrates pre industrial ingenuity and creativity for water use prior to the introduction of thermal engine machines therefore such systems do not represent only tangible heritage but also the intangible heritage and technological knowledge needed for their design and maintenance this knowledge has been transmitted over centuries today a touristic route with information panels follows the segura river along the norias of abarán which have been declared of cultural interest spn bien de interés cultural bic ayuntamiento de abarán 2021 garcía avilés 2014 2000 gil meseguer 2010 2014 on the other hand the irrigation system has been modernized and drip irrigation has largely substituted traditional irrigation techniques to minimize water consumption and to improve farmers working conditions puy et al 2016 3 data and methods to answer our research questions we implemented a mixed method approach that integrates two strands of analysis fig 3 in the first strand we a explored the state and location of norias in the ricote valley using gis technologies including in situ correction b identified reasons for the deterioration of norias using participant observation supported by a literature review and c conducted an expert survey to identify additional reasons for deterioration and quantify the importance of each reason in the second strand we a calculated the irrigation potential of the norias in the ricote valley estimated the unknown geometric dimensions b their potential to mitigate emissions and c their potential to produce power fig 3 shows the mixed method research design with two strands the first strand combines an explanatory design phase 1 and 2a to deepen the findings of the quantitative geo data analysis about the current state and location of norias with an exploratory design phase 2a and 3 to identify reasons for the deterioration and quantify them in the third phase we integrated quantitative and qualitative data using the reasons identified during participant observation in the expert survey in phase 2b in the second strand we explored the future potential of the traditional technologies integrating our collected geo data phase 1 and focusing on traditional and innovative usages we integrated both strands in the discussion phase 2b and phase 3 the priority is given to quantitative research methods kuckartz 2014 3 1 data and data collection to identify the location of the norias in the ricote valley we used an official list provided by rhe region of murcia i e consejería de turismo cultura y medio ambiente based on this list we created a geo database of norias in this database we collected available data about the characteristics of the norias i e diameter width number of paddles irrigated area lifted water volume combining information from research bravo sánchez 2018 local working groups martínez soler and banegas ortiz 1994 and on site information from the region of murcia i e information panels we validated each location in situ in the orchards of the ricote valley in summer 2019 for the validation we uploaded our database to arcgis online and used the arcgis collector app to validate and edit data during this process we aggregated the condition of each noria and created four categories to describe it the category in use describes a noria that is still working and lifts irrigation water to an irrigation canal on a higher elevation conserved describes a site where the base and the wheel of the noria are still existing destroyed describes a site where the wheel of the noria is non existent but the base is still present disappeared describes a site where wheel and base are non existent data visualization was conducted in saga gis conrad et al 2015 3 2 exploring reasons for the deterioration of norias in the next step we explored the reasons for the deterioration of the norias in the ricote valley to integrate local perspectives we used participant observation and a survey of eleven experts during participant observation in the study area we communicated regularly with local stakeholders and participated in agricultural activities thomas 2019 we combined insights from participant observation with a literature review based on this we selected possible reasons for the deterioration of norias which were included in the expert survey experts were selected based on their expertise on the topic location and their availability eleven experts with administrative scientific legal and economic backgrounds participated in the survey see table 1 in june 2019 we requested the experts to evaluate the importance of preselected reasons for the deterioration of norias in the ricote valley on a scale from 0 not important to 4 very important and they could also add other reasons for the evaluation we a created new categories that combined the preselected and added reasons b calculated the weighted arithmetic mean of the new categories considering the number of persons mentioning each added reason and c included only reasons with a value higher than 2 moderate importance 3 3 exploring the potentials of noria renovation in the ricote valley in this section the procedure to estimate the power developed by a noria its lifted flow rate and the saved emissions compared to an electric or diesel pump is explained these quantities are a function of the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the norias so they have to be known or estimated fig 4 the first step consisted of finding the mathematical relation between diameter and number of blades also called paddles the number of paddles is known for 11 norias by plotting the number of paddles versus the diameter fig 5 the following equation was found 1 n 3 42 d 24 87 where n is the number of paddles and d is the diameter m eq 1 exhibits a coefficient of determination r2 0 76 by eq 1 the number of paddles can be estimated as a function of the wheel diameter and then choosing a multiple of 4 common practice both for norias and also for water wheels by knowing diameter and number of paddles the circumferential distance between two adjacent paddles can be calculated eq 1 is an expeditious equation that can be generalized and used to estimate the number of blades of any noria eq 1 is in line with some equations to estimate the number of paddles as a function of diameter commonly used for water wheels designed to power mills or generate electricity quaranta and revelli 2018 the slope of eq 1 slope 3 42 that expresses a change in the number of blades with the diameter is smaller than the analogous equations for water wheels because the diameter of norias is generally much larger than that of the other water wheel types examining the equations summarized in quaranta and revelli 2018 the paddle number that is closest to eq 1 is that proposed by weisbach and johnson 1849 the second design dimension that was analysed is the immersed length l of the paddle based on the noria de la hoya fig 4 where pictures and videos are available l d 8 was estimated this dimension was considered valid for all the other norias this value is in line with the commonly suggested dimension of l d 5 for floating water wheels quaranta 2018 for the norias the length is smaller d 8 instead of d 5 because of the very large diameters 5 m the rotational speed was instead estimated by considering the known diameter and speed of the noria de la hoya and the equation proposed in quaranta and revelli 2015 for overshot water wheels 2 n c d with n the rotational speed revolution per minute rpm and c a coefficient that is 30 m1 2 for overshot water wheels see quaranta and revelli 2018 in our case the coefficient c for the noria de la hoya was estimated to be c 4 3 m1 2 min 1 by eq 2 the rotational speed n of each noria can be estimated from the diameter eq 2 practically expresses the froude hydraulic similarity concept where velocities scale as the square root of linear dimensions with such estimated n the tangential speeds range between 0 5 and 0 7 m s which is consistent with the fact that in general the optimal tangential speed of stream water wheels i e water wheels driven by the kinetic energy of flowing streams is one half of the river velocity in our case this would correspond to 1 1 4 m s a common flow velocity in rivers and canals quaranta 2018 the other analysed dimension was the container dimension for the noria de la hoya the container equals the distance between two paddles which is intuitive width and depth of the container are one quarter of the wheel width these proportions can be applied to all the norias whose container dimensions are not known by knowing the container dimensions and the rotational speed the lifted flow rate q could be estimated considering that it is known for two norias noria de la hoya and noria grande the estimation of the lifted flow allows to calculate the power developed by the wheel eq 3 3 p ρ gqh where p w is the power g is the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s2 ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water q is the lifted flow rate m3 s and h m is the pumping head in the case of norias h d from eq 3 it can be seen that for a certain power the higher the pumped head h is the lower must be the lifted flow q therefore q is inversely proportional to the head h i e the diameter furthermore the lifted flow q is proportional to the cross section area a m2 of the container that catches the water from the river below the noria therefore it is possible to define the coefficient q expressed in eq 4 4 q q a h from eq 4 q 5 83 m2 s for the noria de la hoya and q 5 02 m2 s for the noria grande so that an average value of q 5 4 m2 s can be taken as reference the fact that the values of q for the two norias are similar confirms the method is reasonably generalizable therefore the value of q for the other norias was estimated as q 5 4 a h and implemented in eq 3 to estimate the power developed by the norias 4 results 4 1 current state and location of norias in the ricote valley we identified the location of 24 norias in the ricote valley as well as their current condition phase 1 the condition and location of each noria in the ricote valley is shown in fig 6 three norias 12 are still in use to lift irrigation water all of them are located in abarán green 13 norias 54 classified as conserved are distributed across the valley four norias are destroyed 17 and four have disappeared 17 examples for each category are given in fig 6 4 2 reasons for the observed deterioration of norias during the past decades as expected most of the norias 88 in the ricote valley are no longer in use the eleven consulted experts identified multiple reasons for their deterioration in the ricote valley the most important reasons are 1 use of new technologies 2 lack of valorization of traditional technologies 3 high maintenance costs 4 expansion of infrastructures and urbanization most norias have been replaced by motor pumps during the past decades contributing to the high energy demand and related emissions of spanish irrigation systems according to experts the lack of valorization of traditional technologies plays an important role and can be explained by an increasing loss of the relationship between local populations and agriculture in particular the young generation is less interested in continuing the agricultural activities this leads to a lack of transmission of traditional knowledge between generations and loss of interest in heritage conservation the noria as an instrument of production and a material heritage which is passed down from parents to children along with the land suffers the same neglect as the land it irrigates in the words of a local farmer today s traditional agriculture in the valley survives because of small technical improvements and sentimental value but the generation after mine no longer understands this sentimentality furthermore the high maintenance costs had a large effect on the deterioration of the norias many norias have been financed by their users often users are organized in local users communities i e irrigators communities these communities are responsible for the maintenance of norias and reparation costs are usually distributed between users but the local irrigators communities are facing increasing economic challenges most users have a low income from agricultural activities without price premiums or subsidies for example the common agricultural policy cap does not grant aid to owners of small plots a minimum area is required to qualify for subsidies and in the ricote valley only a few farmers fulfill this requirement additionally the number of users decreases due to land abandonment as a local farmer describes small farms with traditional agricultural or livestock production systems are disappearing absorbed by agribusiness they have been preserved where their products are valued and the farmers can earn an appropriate income with their production finally the expansion of infrastructure and urbanization led to the displacement of agricultural activities while norias in the ricote valley were originally constructed within the traditional orchards several of them are now located next to main roads or within urban areas this is the case for the noria grande de abarán and the noria la tía vicenta surrounded by sealed surfaces in small urban recreational areas all consulted experts considered the preservation of norias important arguing for their high historical cultural touristic and technological value and they agreed that the conservation of norias should not be sustained by the users alone eight out of eleven experts think that renovation and maintenance should be co financed between users local and regional authorities based on our findings we have identified three main management patterns for norias in the ricote valley in the first pattern norias are still in use and irrigate the surrounding agricultural area however due to land abandonment or urbanization the agricultural area has been reduced and the irrigators community is confronted with higher costs per farmer for maintenance in the case of the noria de la hoya in abarán fig 4 and to solve the difficulties in the irrigators community a single landowner who owns much of the land irrigated by the noria agreed to maintaining it furthermore noria de la hoya has been declared of cultural interest bic and benefits from support by the regional administration in the second pattern norias are no longer used for irrigation but are maintained for reasons of heritage conservation this is the case of noria grande de abarán maintained in function although the irrigated land is lost to urbanization it has been declared as asset of cultural interest bic and the regional administration became responsible for maintenance however the change of responsibilities can represent an additional challenge hampering the transmission of local traditional knowledge necessary for cost effective maintenance asociación cultural la carraila 2019 in the third pattern the noria is surrounded mostly by abandoned land or has been substituted by motor pumps and is neither used nor renovated or maintained in these cases responsibilities for maintenance and preservation are weakly defined in the following section we will describe our results about the potential of noria renovation also exploring whether power production might be a sustainable fourth usage pattern of norias in the ricote valley 4 3 assessment of the potentials of noria renovation for a sustainable agricultural system by means of the procedure explained in the method section it was possible to re construct the geometric dimensions and the pumping characteristics of norias number of blades container dimensions speed pumped flow and developed power the noria de la hoya and the noria grande de abarán were the reference ones because most of their dimensions are known the proposed methodology can be used in general to estimate preliminary dimensions of any noria as long as diameter and width are known this is the case for 15 norias see table 2 in our calculations if width and diameter of a given noria were not known the noria was not considered therefore the following dimensions can be estimated in general knowing diameter and width number of paddles immersed length of the paddles m rotational speed revolutions per minute rpm dimensions of the container width depth length assuming to be a cylinder with square cross section pumped flow rate liters per second developed power w 4 3 1 potential power production emission mitigation irrigated area and economic savings for noria renovation in this section we describe the procedures to estimate the power production potential emission mitigation economic saving and irrigated area power production table 2 shows that the power developed by the norias is generally limited below 3 kw with an average power of 1 5 kw in table 2 the power is expressed in w instead of kw the energy is expressed in wh product of watt and hours or kwh dividing by 1000 based on this calculation we estimate that 23 8 kw could be produced with 16 renovated norias knowing the number of operating hours in one year the annual energy developed by the norias was estimated by multiplying the power by the number of hours we propose four scenarios to estimate the potential of norias the assumed maximum potential is 8760 h year representing 24 working hours per day 100 but as more realistic numbers we propose 6570 h year 75 4380 h year 50 2190 h year 25 emission mitigation we estimated emissions potentially avoided by using norias instead of diesel or electric pumps a pump driven by a diesel engine consumes 0 27 l for each developed kwh and emits 2635 g of polluting substances co co2 and pm2 5 per liter adhikari et al 2019 in fig 7 the tons of the above mentioned polluting emissions saved each year were expressed as a function of the pumped flow rate considering the saved emissions of 16 norias the annual saved emissions were estimated between 37 and 148 tons depending on the working hours see table 3 in case of different numbers of working hours the obtained results from fig 7 scale proportionally it must be noted that the mitigated pollution estimated here must be interpreted considering the additional benefits that the use of a renovated noria can generate rather than a motivation to build a noria instead of using a motor pump since the choice of technology should also consider the practical aspects of flexibility maintenance installation and fabrication if electric pumps would be considered the saved emissions would be between 14 and 55 tons year table 3 assuming that the electric pump emissions are 265 5 gco2 kwh european environment agency 2018 the saved emissions of noria acebuche could not be estimated with the methodology proposed in the method section due to its unknown width indeed the width of the noria is used to estimate the container dimensions as well as the pumped flow and it has to be known therefore in case of unknown width the pumped flow can be estimated by inverting the equation proposed in fig 8 as a function of the irrigated area for each noria the irrigated area was known from official data so that fig 8 shows the irrigated area versus the pumped flow the higher the pumped flow the higher is the area that can be irrigated we calculated that 16 renovated norias could irrigate 140 3 ha saving between 14 and 148 tons of co2 per year compared to the usage of motor pumps covering the same surface see table 3 the 140 3 ha represent 6 21 of the agricultural terraced land in the ricote valley 2259 72 ha based on an estimation from a previous study heider et al 2021 it has to be considered that approx 40 of agricultural terraced land was abandoned in 2019 economic savings and benefits the use of norias would offset the cost of diesel by between 17 606 and 70 424 year for the production of 23 8 kw 16 norias of power for between 2190 and 8760 working hours year based on the estimated need of 0 27 l of diesel per kwh and on an estimated cost for diesel of 1 25 l in the case of electric pumps the use of norias would offset the cost of electricity by between 11 998 and 47 993 year for the same production and working hours mentioned above based on an estimated electricity cost of 0 23 kwh eurostat 2021 alternatively if the norias would be deployed for power production instead of water pumping and the produced electricity would be sold we estimate a benefit of between 2608 and 10 433 year this was calculated by multiplying the total power of 16 norias by working hours by the energy price the result is based on an estimated price of 0 05 kwh paid by spanish electricity companies to private producers guijarro ruiz 2021 such savings should be factored in towards the maintenance of norias however an initial investment is needed to obtain these services after this investment a noria is likely able to sustain more than half of its maintenance costs only considering economic savings from diesel consumption compared to engine based technologies maintenance costs of a noria add up to c 5000 year considering the average diesel savings of 2750 year a noria could offset 55 of these costs if a noria is alternatively used to produce electricity instead of water pumping gains from selling energy could offset approx 8 of its maintenance costs we estimate that these calculations will change in favor of norias in the near future with increasing co2 prices renovation costs depend on the individual preservation state of each noria and have to be assessed by an expert individually therefore we discuss construction costs the construction cost of a noria without irrigation canals lies between 8000 and 15 000 per meter of diameter according to this a noria with a height of 8 m costs between 64 000 and 120 000 depending on the materials used the described construction and maintenance costs are based on personal communications with miguel ángel molina espinosa technical engineer specialized in hydraulic machines and norias 4 4 renovated norias as drivers of the multifunctionality of agriculture above we have shown the potential of noria renovation renovating norias can promote sustainable rural development and the multifunctionality of agriculture cairol et al 2009 iaastd 2009 renting et al 2009 fig 9 an increasing renovation of traditional irrigation technologies like norias would contribute to lower the high energy demand for pumping and mitigate emissions helping to further approach the eu emission targets however the potential of the norias in the ricote valley for electricity production is limited due to their high diameter and low rotational speed compared to modern water wheels used for electricity generation nevertheless we stress the multifunctional character of the norias and the multiple positive services they can provide if maintained the norias in the ricote valley have been used to lift irrigation water on the multiple levels of agricultural terraces contributing to food security some of them are still in use while also being part of a popular touristic route ayuntamiento de abarán 2021 thus norias contribute to recreation and tourism to the aesthetics of a cultural landscape and represent a part of the local water culture they help to preserve traditional knowledge and create local employment moreover norias contribute to biodiversity by creating micro habitats for flora and fauna e g water pools attracting birds insects and promoting plant growth freshwater habitats trust 2021b 5 discussion our analysis has shown that 88 of the norias in the ricote valley are currently not used and one of the most important reasons for the deterioration mentioned by the experts was the introduction of new technologies especially motor pumps generally motor pumps diesel or electric pumps can be easily bought are cheaper handier of easy transport and easy adaptation on different sites while high diameter water wheels are more complex in requirements construction and maintenance nevertheless the renovation of norias provides important social ecological and economic services like irrigation without using fuel or electricity emission mitigation valorization of cultural heritage and social attractiveness in the ricote valley mainly surface water segura river el molino spring etc is used for irrigation representing relatively low energy consumption for water acquisition compared to groundwater extraction external water transfer or desalination soto garcía et al 2013 however energy is needed for water elevation on the different levels of the agricultural sectors within the valley since the 1970s boreholes substituted traditional norias using mostly diesel pumps closas 2014 until today diesel pumps and electric engines are mainly used for the provision of irrigation water including extraction and transport on different elevations espinosa tasón et al 2020 a similar trajectory of abandonment to that described for the norias in the ricote valley has been observed for water mills across europe and beyond this trend is alarming considering the high cultural and historical value of norias and water mills exploring their history and potential seems fundamental not only for better understanding the past but also in defining innovative sustainable strategies for the future of agriculture tourism and rural communities worldwide the trend seems set but needs to be consolidated as many water wheel sites are experiencing a revival both for electricity generation and thanks to a deeper understanding of their cultural value quaranta and revelli 2018 the expert survey has shown that all experts considered the preservation of norias in the ricote valley important including experts from the local irrigators communities furthermore local associations like the cultural association la carraila are active in the protection and recuperation of the cultural heritage in the ricote valley i e norias however the maintenance of several norias poses some challenge due for example to different ownership regimes some of them are owned by irrigators communities others by a group of private individuals and others by a single owner therefore flexible coordination cooperation and financial support is needed based on our assessment we estimate that 16 renovated norias included in our analysis can irrigate 140 3 ha in the ricote valley to irrigate a similar surface applying diesel motor pumps would cost between 17 606 and 70 424 year for the consumption of between 14 085 and 56 339 l diesel year and produce between 37 and 148 tons of emissions year depending on the working hours in the case of electric pumps we estimate that between 11 998 and 47 993 year of electricity costs can be saved as well as between 14 and 55 tons of emissions year therefore renovation and re use of traditional irrigation technologies could help to reduce the high energy demand and the resulting emissions of irrigation systems in the mediterranean region and beyond moreover our results show that 16 renovated norias in the ricote valley could produce 23 8 kw modern water wheels used in the same context could be more efficient and less expensive it must be noted that the achievable power in flowing river contexts i e by exploiting the river kinetic energy is generally limited quaranta 2018 while low head sites are more attractive indeed water wheels can be considered optimal machines to generate electricity typicall in head sites below 6 m and river flows below 1 mc s per metre width quaranta 2020 they generally work with 70 efficiency but only if adequately designed to operate in that context based on our analysis the re use of a noria to generate electricity in the context of this study is feasible but comes along with several disadvantages 1 the power developed by a noria in the ricote valley is below 3 kw and 1 5 kw on average 2 they are designed to lift water not to generate electricity thus their efficiency is lower when used for electricity generation 3 their rotational speed is very low due to the large diameter 2 rpm thus a large gearbox would be needed including additional power losses and costs with an efficiency decrease therefore the average power value may further reduce however if modern stream water wheels quaranta 2018 were used for electricity generation replacing the norias it is expected that the developed power would be higher than that estimated for the norias in this study an additional study would be needed to better investigate this option since the site characteristics have to be explored in detail therefore we understand the usage of norias for power production as an additional opportunity adding up to its multifunctionality as we have shown power production may not be viable as a stand alone solution for the norias in the ricote valley but their role as drivers for a multifunctional agriculture becomes clear by considering all the quantitative advantages of using water wheels compared to engines shown in this study 1 lower emissions 2 land irrigated 3 diesel and electricity savings 4 energy production their deployment would reduce the high energy demand and emissions in the spanish irrigation system while also enabling economic savings and benefits on top of that are all the qualitative advantages like 5 shaping the local cultural landscape while also 6 providing areas for recreation and 7 preserving the local water culture gil meseguer 2014 8 creating water rich micro habitats that support biodiversity in agriculture as well as 9 attracting an increasing number of external visitors and 10 public support for heritage protection this includes the two most valued agroecosystem services in the region of murcia biodiversity and recreation opportunities zabala et al 2021 nevertheless we must consider that overall construction installation and operational costs would be higher than for diesel or electric pumps finally we want to stress that global agriculture must transform in order to address major challenges like reducing emissions reversing biodiversity loss adapting to and mitigating climate change and accommodating population growth and migrant communities foley et al 2011 suggest four global strategies addressing these challenges 1 stopping the expansion of agriculture 2 closing yield gaps 3 increasing resource efficiency 4 changing to a plant based diet and stopping food waste foley et al 2011 increasing resource efficiency includes an increasing irrigation efficiency especially in water scare regions like the study area good water and land management practices can increase irrigation efficiency agroecology provides principles and practices for a sustainable management of agroecosystems altieri and nicholls 2012 bernard and lux 2017 de leijster et al 2019 pretty 2018 for example reducing water losses through mulching cover crops and reduced tillage will increase irrigation efficiency beyond that adapting to local climate conditions or climate warming by cultivating locally adapted crops would reduce irrigation needs even more martin gorriz et al 2021 the dominant crop in the ricote valley is lemon the cultivation of lemon trees sequesters more carbon than other woody crops or vegetables martin gorriz et al 2021 and is less exigent in irrigation than the cultivation of vegetables because it is better adapted to water stress due to irregularities in water supply confederación hidrográfica del segura 2013 nevertheless the cultivation of better adapted crops like olive and almond trees could reduce irrigation even further furthermore we stress the importance of crop diversification due to its multiple benefits for biodiversity water filtration water retention and resilience however the selection of crops is highly influenced by the market price and farmers have to earn their livelihood prices for locally adapted crops like almond and olive are low compared to more water demanding crops like lemon 6 conclusion in this study we investigated the location and preservation state of norias in the ricote valley explored the reasons for their deterioration during the past decades and assessed the potential of their renovation we observed high rates of noria abandonment and deterioration in the ricote valley only 12 of the norias are still used to lift irrigation water 54 are conserved 17 are destroyed and another 17 have disappeared the most important reasons for the deterioration of norias in the ricote valley are 1 the use of new technologies in particular motor pumps have replaced norias during the last decades 2 the lack of valorization for traditional technologies which combined with 3 high maintenance costs for noria preservation has further contributed to their deterioration and 4 urbanization and the expansion of infrastructures that led to the displacement of agricultural activities such that norias located on what used to be agricultural terraces are now disconnected from their original context based on our results we argue that rediscovering traditional technologies helps to achieve affordable and clean energy sdg 7 as well as climate action to reduce ghg emissions sdg 13 moreover these technologies provide multiple functions and services for a sustainable life on land sdg 15 which needs to be considered within a holistic approach instead of only concentrating on new technologies to assess the potential of noria renovation we proposed four scenarios which represent different working regimes due to seasonal variabilities a full year with 8760 h year 100 6570 h year 75 i e 9 months 4380 h year 50 6 months and 2190 h year 25 3 months based on these scenarios 16 norias would produce the following benefits if they would replace diesel motor pumps 16 norias could mitigate between 37 and 148 tons of emissions year as well as between 18 000 and 70 000 year spent on 14 000 56 000 l diesel if they would replace electric motor pumps 16 norias would produce the following benefits 16 norias could save between 14 and 55 tons of emissions year and between 12 000 and 48 000 year spent on electricity both types of engine are currently used to lift irrigation water on the elevated agricultural terraces such savings should be factored in towards the maintenance of norias finally we estimated that 16 renovated norias could produce 23 8 kw and 1 5 kw on average the main reasons for the limited power production potential are the large diameter resulting in very low rotational speed 2 rpm as well as their design optimized to lift water which results in a lower efficiency when used for electricity generation however we estimated that norias deployed for power production could produce benefits of between 2600 and 10 400 year if the generated electricity were sold our study is limited by the availability of data we integrated four scenarios to cover variabilities in the working hours of norias furthermore cost offsets are based on current fuel and electricity prices rather than subsidized prices we estimate that these costs will change in favor of norias in the near future with increasing co2 prices we recommend renovation but renovation costs depend on the individual preservation state of each noria and have to be assessed case by case by an expert therefore at this stage we approached these numbers by estimated construction costs finally we recommend the integrated preservation of norias in the ricote valley and beyond stressing their role as drivers for a multifunctional agriculture we argue that norias are much more than water lifting devices noria renovation in agricultural landscapes could produce highly valued social ecological and economic services compared to engine based solutions as we have shown for the ricote valley apart from their potential to mitigate emissions norias create freshwater micro habitats for flora and fauna contributing to increase biodiversity in agriculture furthermore they shape the cultural landscape and preserve the local water culture while providing recreation opportunities for locals and tourists further research is needed to quantify these services and we will continue our research on multifunctional agriculture exploring the potential of agroecological practices in spain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9837,lifting water is crucial to irrigate agricultural terraces in the mediterranean region but the energy demand and emissions of modern forms of water pumping have increased while many traditional water wheels which lift water at zero direct emissions have been abandoned we explored the state of preservation and the potential for the deployment of traditional water wheels known as norias in the ricote valley of southeast spain where some are still in function while also investigating the reasons for their widespread abandonment a mixed method approach is used here to combine gis based methods an expert survey and a technological and socio economic assessment of noria renovation our findings show that norias in the ricote valley have mostly been replaced by thermal engine water lifting technologies the reactivation of traditional irrigation technologies many of them lying dormant but still standing could contribute to reducing the high energy demand and the resulting emissions of irrigation systems in the mediterranean region and beyond it was estimated by data extrapolation that 16 renovated norias included in our analysis can irrigate 140 3 ha in the ricote valley for a total achievable power of 23 8 kw to irrigate a similar surface applying diesel motor pumps would produce up to 148 tons of emissions year and cost up to approx 70 000 year based on a price of 1 25 l diesel for a maximum of 8760 working hours year in the case of electric pumps we estimate that up to 55 tons of emissions year and costs up to approx 48 000 year can be saved therefore we argue that rediscovering traditional technologies has potential to contribute to achieving climate actions that reduce ghg emissions sustainable development goal 13 moreover these technologies provide multiple functions and services for a sustainable life on land sustainable development goal 15 which needs to be considered within a holistic approach graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigated

agriculture is intensifying with increased irrigation and energetic use and consequently with undesirable effects on water resources biodiversity climate and landscape functioning cramer et al 2018 martin gorriz et al 2021 in spain ongoing transformations in the irrigation systems can potentially reduce water consumption per hectare but energy demand has increased by 657 between 1950 and 2008

the eu s emission targets european commission 2020 martin gorriz et al 2021 sustainable alternatives for intensive irrigation systems are urgently needed the revival of pre industrial technologies and traditional ecological knowledge may help finding new sustainable solutions e g improved water efficiency based on agroecological practices like cover crops contour farming the use of agricultural

et al 2019 pretty 2018 traditional terraced smallholder agriculture is an important component of rural mediterranean landscapes and remains a predominant farming model in the ricote valley heider et al 2021 it represents the outcome of the long term convergence of human and environmental trajectories resulting in a social ecological system that has proven its stability and resilience over the past ten centuries or more balbo et al 2016 blondel 2006 lasanta et al 2017b the agricultural terraces of the ricote valley are part of a gravity based irrigation system which was introduced more than 1000 years ago puy and balbo 2013 water wheels that lift irrigation water to higher agricultural terraced land known as norias have played a key role in the long term sustainability of these irrigated landscapes allowing the exponential extension of irrigated land based on a zero emission technology the rural development policy within the second pillar of the common agricultural policy cap of the eu aims to combine ecological and social needs with economic targets unfortunately the cap has also perhaps unwillingly contributed to the homogenization of rural landscapes and to the deterioration of small scale agriculture during the last decades chemnitz 2019 heider et al 2021 lefebvre et al 2015 a minimum area of 0 2 ha is needed to obtain subsidies in spain this combined with the gradual withdrawal of small amounts of public aids has further intensified these trends boe 2014 accelerating the abandonment of traditional technologies often used and maintained by smallholders while ubiquitous in large human agglomerations knowledge and innovations are fast eroding in rural areas also due to rural urban migration of the young population balbo et al 2020 tacoli and mabala 2010 the resulting lack of access to existing knowledge is another major limitation for smart and sustainable development in rural areas copus et al 2011 where traditional knowledge is a key dimension of sustainability by focusing on the appreciation of regional endowments such as biophysical economic cultural social historic and technological strengths our paper explores smart and green specialization strategies in rural areas asheim et al 2011 thissen et al 2013 in the literature norias are mostly investigated from a historic perspective glick 1977 headworth 2004 stressing their cultural heritage values bravo sánchez 2018 gil meseguer 2014 technological values banegas ortiz and gómez espín 1992 gómez espín 2014 yannopoulos et al 2015 as well as evaluating their performance stillwater and awad 1991 indeed water wheel sites both mills and pumping sites can be considered among the main drivers of economic industrial and social development of rural agricultural spaces before the industrial revolution hassan 2011 quaranta and wolter 2021 it is estimated that over 350 000 of such hydro sites may have existed in europe at one time or another in japan water wheels comprised 56 of total power generation until 1886 punys et al 2019 quaranta and wolter 2021 the abandonment of most norias in spain started with the generalized introduction of motor pumps over the past decades bravo sánchez 2018 closas 2014 the following increase of intensive groundwater extraction technologies promoted over extraction in spain closas 2014 indeed most water wheels have been replaced by motors or hydro plants all over europe quaranta et al 2021 from a current perspective norias are valued for promoting landscape aesthetics as well as the multifunctionality of rural areas by fostering recreation and rural tourism gil meseguer 2014 furthermore water wheels are increasingly valued for renewable power production at low head sites and at old mill weirs this opens up possibilities for the re use of traditional water wheels installed power typically below 50 kw which have been abandoned during the past decades müller and kaupert 2004 quaranta and revelli 2018 quaranta 2018 quaranta et al 2021 this study analyses the state of norias in the ricote valley while also exploring the reasons for their deterioration furthermore we investigate the potential for their renovation and their potential contribution to the multifunctionality of agriculture this leads to the following research questions 1 what is the current state of preservation of norias in the ricote valley 2 what are the reasons for the observed abandonment of norias during the past decades 3 what is the potential of noria renovation for a sustainable agricultural system to address these questions we used a mixed method approach combining gis based methods an expert survey and an assessment of the potentials of noria renovation first we collected available geo data to explore the state of preservation and location of norias in the ricote valley second we combined participant observation with the inquiry of experts to identify the reasons for the deterioration of norias finally we investigated the norias under a hydraulic and geometric perspective with the aim of calculating their irrigation potential i e the pumped flow rate irrigated area as well as emission mitigation and saved costs compared to electric and diesel pumps we also elaborated their geometric dimensions in order to find easy and expeditious tools that can be used in future research to re construct and estimate unknown dimensions and performance of norias the estimation of such dimensions is important to better understand their historical deployment for irrigation in the past but also their potential as an integral component of future pathways for sustainable agricultural systems the results will be then discussed with focus on the ricote valley and could be extrapolated to other traditional agricultural landscapes in the mediterranean region 2 study area the study area is the ricote valley in the region of murcia southeast spain fig 1 the climate in the study area is semi arid with strong seasonality we include in our analysis seven villages which stretch alongside the segura river abarán blanca ricote ojos ulea villanueva and archena with a population of 44 742 in 2020 instituto nacional de estadística 2021 part of the villages are the traditional orchards fig 2 lemon is the current primary crop cultivated in the valley followed by olive almond multiple fruits and vegetables many farmers cultivate their primary products for export which leads to challenges due to price volatility and competition with modern industrial agriculture in the neighboring regions heider et al 2021 furthermore the agricultural properties are highly fragmented due to the traditional heritage system in the study area most of the agricultural properties are smaller than 1 hectare heider et al 2018 thus smallholder farming dominates agriculture in the study area until today the traditional orchards contain multiple levels of agricultural terraces in different sizes and shapes divided by stonewalls and crossed by small irrigation canals these terraces are part of a hydraulic system which was introduced by amazigh berber populations over 1000 years ago for flood irrigation puy and balbo 2013 norias were added at a later stage of expansion of these agricultural systems lifting water and expanding agricultural land to ever higher grounds they are distributed along irrigation canals outbranched from the segura river which is characterized by strong seasonal differences and high flood risk ministerio para la transición ecológica y el reto demográfico 2021 technically the norias in the ricote valley originate from the egyptian water wheel with buckets attached and powered by the water flow it was originally invented by the romans approx between 600 and 700 bce yannopoulos et al 2015 during the middle ages the expansion of arab civilizations contributed to the broad diffusion and progressive modification of norias across the islamic world martínez soler and banegas ortiz 1994 in the ricote valley they probably existed prior to the 16th century as they were well known and widespread in al andalus however their installation in the valley coincided with a population increase and therefore the need to increase irrigated cropland from the 16th century onwards garcía avilés 2000 puy 2012 with an increasing production the transport of locally produced crops became also important with large numbers of muleteers in the valley deployed to export cash crops garcía avilés 2007 the current norias are a result of the adaptation to the cultivation of new crops rising production and rising irrigation needs for an increasing agricultural area therefore they increased in size with the increasing needs for water uplift garcía avilés 2007 pérez picazo and lemeunier 1990 the traditional irrigation system made of historic elements such as norias irrigation canals and agricultural terraces shapes a cultural and multifunctional landscape which represents the local water culture of the region garcía avilés 2014 2000 gil meseguer 2010 at the same time it illustrates pre industrial ingenuity and creativity for water use prior to the introduction of thermal engine machines therefore such systems do not represent only tangible heritage but also the intangible heritage and technological knowledge needed for their design and maintenance this knowledge has been transmitted over centuries today a touristic route with information panels follows the segura river along the norias of abarán which have been declared of cultural interest spn bien de interés cultural bic ayuntamiento de abarán 2021 garcía avilés 2014 2000 gil meseguer 2010 2014 on the other hand the irrigation system has been modernized and drip irrigation has largely substituted traditional irrigation techniques to minimize water consumption and to improve farmers working conditions puy et al 2016 3 data and methods to answer our research questions we implemented a mixed method approach that integrates two strands of analysis fig 3 in the first strand we a explored the state and location of norias in the ricote valley using gis technologies including in situ correction b identified reasons for the deterioration of norias using participant observation supported by a literature review and c conducted an expert survey to identify additional reasons for deterioration and quantify the importance of each reason in the second strand we a calculated the irrigation potential of the norias in the ricote valley estimated the unknown geometric dimensions b their potential to mitigate emissions and c their potential to produce power fig 3 shows the mixed method research design with two strands the first strand combines an explanatory design phase 1 and 2a to deepen the findings of the quantitative geo data analysis about the current state and location of norias with an exploratory design phase 2a and 3 to identify reasons for the deterioration and quantify them in the third phase we integrated quantitative and qualitative data using the reasons identified during participant observation in the expert survey in phase 2b in the second strand we explored the future potential of the traditional technologies integrating our collected geo data phase 1 and focusing on traditional and innovative usages we integrated both strands in the discussion phase 2b and phase 3 the priority is given to quantitative research methods kuckartz 2014 3 1 data and data collection to identify the location of the norias in the ricote valley we used an official list provided by rhe region of murcia i e consejería de turismo cultura y medio ambiente based on this list we created a geo database of norias in this database we collected available data about the characteristics of the norias i e diameter width number of paddles irrigated area lifted water volume combining information from research bravo sánchez 2018 local working groups martínez soler and banegas ortiz 1994 and on site information from the region of murcia i e information panels we validated each location in situ in the orchards of the ricote valley in summer 2019 for the validation we uploaded our database to arcgis online and used the arcgis collector app to validate and edit data during this process we aggregated the condition of each noria and created four categories to describe it the category in use describes a noria that is still working and lifts irrigation water to an irrigation canal on a higher elevation conserved describes a site where the base and the wheel of the noria are still existing destroyed describes a site where the wheel of the noria is non existent but the base is still present disappeared describes a site where wheel and base are non existent data visualization was conducted in saga gis conrad et al 2015 3 2 exploring reasons for the deterioration of norias in the next step we explored the reasons for the deterioration of the norias in the ricote valley to integrate local perspectives we used participant observation and a survey of eleven experts during participant observation in the study area we communicated regularly with local stakeholders and participated in agricultural activities thomas 2019 we combined insights from participant observation with a literature review based on this we selected possible reasons for the deterioration of norias which were included in the expert survey experts were selected based on their expertise on the topic location and their availability eleven experts with administrative scientific legal and economic backgrounds participated in the survey see table 1 in june 2019 we requested the experts to evaluate the importance of preselected reasons for the deterioration of norias in the ricote valley on a scale from 0 not important to 4 very important and they could also add other reasons for the evaluation we a created new categories that combined the preselected and added reasons b calculated the weighted arithmetic mean of the new categories considering the number of persons mentioning each added reason and c included only reasons with a value higher than 2 moderate importance 3 3 exploring the potentials of noria renovation in the ricote valley in this section the procedure to estimate the power developed by a noria its lifted flow rate and the saved emissions compared to an electric or diesel pump is explained these quantities are a function of the geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the norias so they have to be known or estimated fig 4 the first step consisted of finding the mathematical relation between diameter and number of blades also called paddles the number of paddles is known for 11 norias by plotting the number of paddles versus the diameter fig 5 the following equation was found 1 n 3 42 d 24 87 where n is the number of paddles and d is the diameter m eq 1 exhibits a coefficient of determination r2 0 76 by eq 1 the number of paddles can be estimated as a function of the wheel diameter and then choosing a multiple of 4 common practice both for norias and also for water wheels by knowing diameter and number of paddles the circumferential distance between two adjacent paddles can be calculated eq 1 is an expeditious equation that can be generalized and used to estimate the number of blades of any noria eq 1 is in line with some equations to estimate the number of paddles as a function of diameter commonly used for water wheels designed to power mills or generate electricity quaranta and revelli 2018 the slope of eq 1 slope 3 42 that expresses a change in the number of blades with the diameter is smaller than the analogous equations for water wheels because the diameter of norias is generally much larger than that of the other water wheel types examining the equations summarized in quaranta and revelli 2018 the paddle number that is closest to eq 1 is that proposed by weisbach and johnson 1849 the second design dimension that was analysed is the immersed length l of the paddle based on the noria de la hoya fig 4 where pictures and videos are available l d 8 was estimated this dimension was considered valid for all the other norias this value is in line with the commonly suggested dimension of l d 5 for floating water wheels quaranta 2018 for the norias the length is smaller d 8 instead of d 5 because of the very large diameters 5 m the rotational speed was instead estimated by considering the known diameter and speed of the noria de la hoya and the equation proposed in quaranta and revelli 2015 for overshot water wheels 2 n c d with n the rotational speed revolution per minute rpm and c a coefficient that is 30 m1 2 for overshot water wheels see quaranta and revelli 2018 in our case the coefficient c for the noria de la hoya was estimated to be c 4 3 m1 2 min 1 by eq 2 the rotational speed n of each noria can be estimated from the diameter eq 2 practically expresses the froude hydraulic similarity concept where velocities scale as the square root of linear dimensions with such estimated n the tangential speeds range between 0 5 and 0 7 m s which is consistent with the fact that in general the optimal tangential speed of stream water wheels i e water wheels driven by the kinetic energy of flowing streams is one half of the river velocity in our case this would correspond to 1 1 4 m s a common flow velocity in rivers and canals quaranta 2018 the other analysed dimension was the container dimension for the noria de la hoya the container equals the distance between two paddles which is intuitive width and depth of the container are one quarter of the wheel width these proportions can be applied to all the norias whose container dimensions are not known by knowing the container dimensions and the rotational speed the lifted flow rate q could be estimated considering that it is known for two norias noria de la hoya and noria grande the estimation of the lifted flow allows to calculate the power developed by the wheel eq 3 3 p ρ gqh where p w is the power g is the gravity acceleration 9 81 m s2 ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water q is the lifted flow rate m3 s and h m is the pumping head in the case of norias h d from eq 3 it can be seen that for a certain power the higher the pumped head h is the lower must be the lifted flow q therefore q is inversely proportional to the head h i e the diameter furthermore the lifted flow q is proportional to the cross section area a m2 of the container that catches the water from the river below the noria therefore it is possible to define the coefficient q expressed in eq 4 4 q q a h from eq 4 q 5 83 m2 s for the noria de la hoya and q 5 02 m2 s for the noria grande so that an average value of q 5 4 m2 s can be taken as reference the fact that the values of q for the two norias are similar confirms the method is reasonably generalizable therefore the value of q for the other norias was estimated as q 5 4 a h and implemented in eq 3 to estimate the power developed by the norias 4 results 4 1 current state and location of norias in the ricote valley we identified the location of 24 norias in the ricote valley as well as their current condition phase 1 the condition and location of each noria in the ricote valley is shown in fig 6 three norias 12 are still in use to lift irrigation water all of them are located in abarán green 13 norias 54 classified as conserved are distributed across the valley four norias are destroyed 17 and four have disappeared 17 examples for each category are given in fig 6 4 2 reasons for the observed deterioration of norias during the past decades as expected most of the norias 88 in the ricote valley are no longer in use the eleven consulted experts identified multiple reasons for their deterioration in the ricote valley the most important reasons are 1 use of new technologies 2 lack of valorization of traditional technologies 3 high maintenance costs 4 expansion of infrastructures and urbanization most norias have been replaced by motor pumps during the past decades contributing to the high energy demand and related emissions of spanish irrigation systems according to experts the lack of valorization of traditional technologies plays an important role and can be explained by an increasing loss of the relationship between local populations and agriculture in particular the young generation is less interested in continuing the agricultural activities this leads to a lack of transmission of traditional knowledge between generations and loss of interest in heritage conservation the noria as an instrument of production and a material heritage which is passed down from parents to children along with the land suffers the same neglect as the land it irrigates in the words of a local farmer today s traditional agriculture in the valley survives because of small technical improvements and sentimental value but the generation after mine no longer understands this sentimentality furthermore the high maintenance costs had a large effect on the deterioration of the norias many norias have been financed by their users often users are organized in local users communities i e irrigators communities these communities are responsible for the maintenance of norias and reparation costs are usually distributed between users but the local irrigators communities are facing increasing economic challenges most users have a low income from agricultural activities without price premiums or subsidies for example the common agricultural policy cap does not grant aid to owners of small plots a minimum area is required to qualify for subsidies and in the ricote valley only a few farmers fulfill this requirement additionally the number of users decreases due to land abandonment as a local farmer describes small farms with traditional agricultural or livestock production systems are disappearing absorbed by agribusiness they have been preserved where their products are valued and the farmers can earn an appropriate income with their production finally the expansion of infrastructure and urbanization led to the displacement of agricultural activities while norias in the ricote valley were originally constructed within the traditional orchards several of them are now located next to main roads or within urban areas this is the case for the noria grande de abarán and the noria la tía vicenta surrounded by sealed surfaces in small urban recreational areas all consulted experts considered the preservation of norias important arguing for their high historical cultural touristic and technological value and they agreed that the conservation of norias should not be sustained by the users alone eight out of eleven experts think that renovation and maintenance should be co financed between users local and regional authorities based on our findings we have identified three main management patterns for norias in the ricote valley in the first pattern norias are still in use and irrigate the surrounding agricultural area however due to land abandonment or urbanization the agricultural area has been reduced and the irrigators community is confronted with higher costs per farmer for maintenance in the case of the noria de la hoya in abarán fig 4 and to solve the difficulties in the irrigators community a single landowner who owns much of the land irrigated by the noria agreed to maintaining it furthermore noria de la hoya has been declared of cultural interest bic and benefits from support by the regional administration in the second pattern norias are no longer used for irrigation but are maintained for reasons of heritage conservation this is the case of noria grande de abarán maintained in function although the irrigated land is lost to urbanization it has been declared as asset of cultural interest bic and the regional administration became responsible for maintenance however the change of responsibilities can represent an additional challenge hampering the transmission of local traditional knowledge necessary for cost effective maintenance asociación cultural la carraila 2019 in the third pattern the noria is surrounded mostly by abandoned land or has been substituted by motor pumps and is neither used nor renovated or maintained in these cases responsibilities for maintenance and preservation are weakly defined in the following section we will describe our results about the potential of noria renovation also exploring whether power production might be a sustainable fourth usage pattern of norias in the ricote valley 4 3 assessment of the potentials of noria renovation for a sustainable agricultural system by means of the procedure explained in the method section it was possible to re construct the geometric dimensions and the pumping characteristics of norias number of blades container dimensions speed pumped flow and developed power the noria de la hoya and the noria grande de abarán were the reference ones because most of their dimensions are known the proposed methodology can be used in general to estimate preliminary dimensions of any noria as long as diameter and width are known this is the case for 15 norias see table 2 in our calculations if width and diameter of a given noria were not known the noria was not considered therefore the following dimensions can be estimated in general knowing diameter and width number of paddles immersed length of the paddles m rotational speed revolutions per minute rpm dimensions of the container width depth length assuming to be a cylinder with square cross section pumped flow rate liters per second developed power w 4 3 1 potential power production emission mitigation irrigated area and economic savings for noria renovation in this section we describe the procedures to estimate the power production potential emission mitigation economic saving and irrigated area power production table 2 shows that the power developed by the norias is generally limited below 3 kw with an average power of 1 5 kw in table 2 the power is expressed in w instead of kw the energy is expressed in wh product of watt and hours or kwh dividing by 1000 based on this calculation we estimate that 23 8 kw could be produced with 16 renovated norias knowing the number of operating hours in one year the annual energy developed by the norias was estimated by multiplying the power by the number of hours we propose four scenarios to estimate the potential of norias the assumed maximum potential is 8760 h year representing 24 working hours per day 100 but as more realistic numbers we propose 6570 h year 75 4380 h year 50 2190 h year 25 emission mitigation we estimated emissions potentially avoided by using norias instead of diesel or electric pumps a pump driven by a diesel engine consumes 0 27 l for each developed kwh and emits 2635 g of polluting substances co co2 and pm2 5 per liter adhikari et al 2019 in fig 7 the tons of the above mentioned polluting emissions saved each year were expressed as a function of the pumped flow rate considering the saved emissions of 16 norias the annual saved emissions were estimated between 37 and 148 tons depending on the working hours see table 3 in case of different numbers of working hours the obtained results from fig 7 scale proportionally it must be noted that the mitigated pollution estimated here must be interpreted considering the additional benefits that the use of a renovated noria can generate rather than a motivation to build a noria instead of using a motor pump since the choice of technology should also consider the practical aspects of flexibility maintenance installation and fabrication if electric pumps would be considered the saved emissions would be between 14 and 55 tons year table 3 assuming that the electric pump emissions are 265 5 gco2 kwh european environment agency 2018 the saved emissions of noria acebuche could not be estimated with the methodology proposed in the method section due to its unknown width indeed the width of the noria is used to estimate the container dimensions as well as the pumped flow and it has to be known therefore in case of unknown width the pumped flow can be estimated by inverting the equation proposed in fig 8 as a function of the irrigated area for each noria the irrigated area was known from official data so that fig 8 shows the irrigated area versus the pumped flow the higher the pumped flow the higher is the area that can be irrigated we calculated that 16 renovated norias could irrigate 140 3 ha saving between 14 and 148 tons of co2 per year compared to the usage of motor pumps covering the same surface see table 3 the 140 3 ha represent 6 21 of the agricultural terraced land in the ricote valley 2259 72 ha based on an estimation from a previous study heider et al 2021 it has to be considered that approx 40 of agricultural terraced land was abandoned in 2019 economic savings and benefits the use of norias would offset the cost of diesel by between 17 606 and 70 424 year for the production of 23 8 kw 16 norias of power for between 2190 and 8760 working hours year based on the estimated need of 0 27 l of diesel per kwh and on an estimated cost for diesel of 1 25 l in the case of electric pumps the use of norias would offset the cost of electricity by between 11 998 and 47 993 year for the same production and working hours mentioned above based on an estimated electricity cost of 0 23 kwh eurostat 2021 alternatively if the norias would be deployed for power production instead of water pumping and the produced electricity would be sold we estimate a benefit of between 2608 and 10 433 year this was calculated by multiplying the total power of 16 norias by working hours by the energy price the result is based on an estimated price of 0 05 kwh paid by spanish electricity companies to private producers guijarro ruiz 2021 such savings should be factored in towards the maintenance of norias however an initial investment is needed to obtain these services after this investment a noria is likely able to sustain more than half of its maintenance costs only considering economic savings from diesel consumption compared to engine based technologies maintenance costs of a noria add up to c 5000 year considering the average diesel savings of 2750 year a noria could offset 55 of these costs if a noria is alternatively used to produce electricity instead of water pumping gains from selling energy could offset approx 8 of its maintenance costs we estimate that these calculations will change in favor of norias in the near future with increasing co2 prices renovation costs depend on the individual preservation state of each noria and have to be assessed by an expert individually therefore we discuss construction costs the construction cost of a noria without irrigation canals lies between 8000 and 15 000 per meter of diameter according to this a noria with a height of 8 m costs between 64 000 and 120 000 depending on the materials used the described construction and maintenance costs are based on personal communications with miguel ángel molina espinosa technical engineer specialized in hydraulic machines and norias 4 4 renovated norias as drivers of the multifunctionality of agriculture above we have shown the potential of noria renovation renovating norias can promote sustainable rural development and the multifunctionality of agriculture cairol et al 2009 iaastd 2009 renting et al 2009 fig 9 an increasing renovation of traditional irrigation technologies like norias would contribute to lower the high energy demand for pumping and mitigate emissions helping to further approach the eu emission targets however the potential of the norias in the ricote valley for electricity production is limited due to their high diameter and low rotational speed compared to modern water wheels used for electricity generation nevertheless we stress the multifunctional character of the norias and the multiple positive services they can provide if maintained the norias in the ricote valley have been used to lift irrigation water on the multiple levels of agricultural terraces contributing to food security some of them are still in use while also being part of a popular touristic route ayuntamiento de abarán 2021 thus norias contribute to recreation and tourism to the aesthetics of a cultural landscape and represent a part of the local water culture they help to preserve traditional knowledge and create local employment moreover norias contribute to biodiversity by creating micro habitats for flora and fauna e g water pools attracting birds insects and promoting plant growth freshwater habitats trust 2021b 5 discussion our analysis has shown that 88 of the norias in the ricote valley are currently not used and one of the most important reasons for the deterioration mentioned by the experts was the introduction of new technologies especially motor pumps generally motor pumps diesel or electric pumps can be easily bought are cheaper handier of easy transport and easy adaptation on different sites while high diameter water wheels are more complex in requirements construction and maintenance nevertheless the renovation of norias provides important social ecological and economic services like irrigation without using fuel or electricity emission mitigation valorization of cultural heritage and social attractiveness in the ricote valley mainly surface water segura river el molino spring etc is used for irrigation representing relatively low energy consumption for water acquisition compared to groundwater extraction external water transfer or desalination soto garcía et al 2013 however energy is needed for water elevation on the different levels of the agricultural sectors within the valley since the 1970s boreholes substituted traditional norias using mostly diesel pumps closas 2014 until today diesel pumps and electric engines are mainly used for the provision of irrigation water including extraction and transport on different elevations espinosa tasón et al 2020 a similar trajectory of abandonment to that described for the norias in the ricote valley has been observed for water mills across europe and beyond this trend is alarming considering the high cultural and historical value of norias and water mills exploring their history and potential seems fundamental not only for better understanding the past but also in defining innovative sustainable strategies for the future of agriculture tourism and rural communities worldwide the trend seems set but needs to be consolidated as many water wheel sites are experiencing a revival both for electricity generation and thanks to a deeper understanding of their cultural value quaranta and revelli 2018 the expert survey has shown that all experts considered the preservation of norias in the ricote valley important including experts from the local irrigators communities furthermore local associations like the cultural association la carraila are active in the protection and recuperation of the cultural heritage in the ricote valley i e norias however the maintenance of several norias poses some challenge due for example to different ownership regimes some of them are owned by irrigators communities others by a group of private individuals and others by a single owner therefore flexible coordination cooperation and financial support is needed based on our assessment we estimate that 16 renovated norias included in our analysis can irrigate 140 3 ha in the ricote valley to irrigate a similar surface applying diesel motor pumps would cost between 17 606 and 70 424 year for the consumption of between 14 085 and 56 339 l diesel year and produce between 37 and 148 tons of emissions year depending on the working hours in the case of electric pumps we estimate that between 11 998 and 47 993 year of electricity costs can be saved as well as between 14 and 55 tons of emissions year therefore renovation and re use of traditional irrigation technologies could help to reduce the high energy demand and the resulting emissions of irrigation systems in the mediterranean region and beyond moreover our results show that 16 renovated norias in the ricote valley could produce 23 8 kw modern water wheels used in the same context could be more efficient and less expensive it must be noted that the achievable power in flowing river contexts i e by exploiting the river kinetic energy is generally limited quaranta 2018 while low head sites are more attractive indeed water wheels can be considered optimal machines to generate electricity typicall in head sites below 6 m and river flows below 1 mc s per metre width quaranta 2020 they generally work with 70 efficiency but only if adequately designed to operate in that context based on our analysis the re use of a noria to generate electricity in the context of this study is feasible but comes along with several disadvantages 1 the power developed by a noria in the ricote valley is below 3 kw and 1 5 kw on average 2 they are designed to lift water not to generate electricity thus their efficiency is lower when used for electricity generation 3 their rotational speed is very low due to the large diameter 2 rpm thus a large gearbox would be needed including additional power losses and costs with an efficiency decrease therefore the average power value may further reduce however if modern stream water wheels quaranta 2018 were used for electricity generation replacing the norias it is expected that the developed power would be higher than that estimated for the norias in this study an additional study would be needed to better investigate this option since the site characteristics have to be explored in detail therefore we understand the usage of norias for power production as an additional opportunity adding up to its multifunctionality as we have shown power production may not be viable as a stand alone solution for the norias in the ricote valley but their role as drivers for a multifunctional agriculture becomes clear by considering all the quantitative advantages of using water wheels compared to engines shown in this study 1 lower emissions 2 land irrigated 3 diesel and electricity savings 4 energy production their deployment would reduce the high energy demand and emissions in the spanish irrigation system while also enabling economic savings and benefits on top of that are all the qualitative advantages like 5 shaping the local cultural landscape while also 6 providing areas for recreation and 7 preserving the local water culture gil meseguer 2014 8 creating water rich micro habitats that support biodiversity in agriculture as well as 9 attracting an increasing number of external visitors and 10 public support for heritage protection this includes the two most valued agroecosystem services in the region of murcia biodiversity and recreation opportunities zabala et al 2021 nevertheless we must consider that overall construction installation and operational costs would be higher than for diesel or electric pumps finally we want to stress that global agriculture must transform in order to address major challenges like reducing emissions reversing biodiversity loss adapting to and mitigating climate change and accommodating population growth and migrant communities foley et al 2011 suggest four global strategies addressing these challenges 1 stopping the expansion of agriculture 2 closing yield gaps 3 increasing resource efficiency 4 changing to a plant based diet and stopping food waste foley et al 2011 increasing resource efficiency includes an increasing irrigation efficiency especially in water scare regions like the study area good water and land management practices can increase irrigation efficiency agroecology provides principles and practices for a sustainable management of agroecosystems altieri and nicholls 2012 bernard and lux 2017 de leijster et al 2019 pretty 2018 for example reducing water losses through mulching cover crops and reduced tillage will increase irrigation efficiency beyond that adapting to local climate conditions or climate warming by cultivating locally adapted crops would reduce irrigation needs even more martin gorriz et al 2021 the dominant crop in the ricote valley is lemon the cultivation of lemon trees sequesters more carbon than other woody crops or vegetables martin gorriz et al 2021 and is less exigent in irrigation than the cultivation of vegetables because it is better adapted to water stress due to irregularities in water supply confederación hidrográfica del segura 2013 nevertheless the cultivation of better adapted crops like olive and almond trees could reduce irrigation even further furthermore we stress the importance of crop diversification due to its multiple benefits for biodiversity water filtration water retention and resilience however the selection of crops is highly influenced by the market price and farmers have to earn their livelihood prices for locally adapted crops like almond and olive are low compared to more water demanding crops like lemon 6 conclusion in this study we investigated the location and preservation state of norias in the ricote valley explored the reasons for their deterioration during the past decades and assessed the potential of their renovation we observed high rates of noria abandonment and deterioration in the ricote valley only 12 of the norias are still used to lift irrigation water 54 are conserved 17 are destroyed and another 17 have disappeared the most important reasons for the deterioration of norias in the ricote valley are 1 the use of new technologies in particular motor pumps have replaced norias during the last decades 2 the lack of valorization for traditional technologies which combined with 3 high maintenance costs for noria preservation has further contributed to their deterioration and 4 urbanization and the expansion of infrastructures that led to the displacement of agricultural activities such that norias located on what used to be agricultural terraces are now disconnected from their original context based on our results we argue that rediscovering traditional technologies helps to achieve affordable and clean energy sdg 7 as well as climate action to reduce ghg emissions sdg 13 moreover these technologies provide multiple functions and services for a sustainable life on land sdg 15 which needs to be considered within a holistic approach instead of only concentrating on new technologies to assess the potential of noria renovation we proposed four scenarios which represent different working regimes due to seasonal variabilities a full year with 8760 h year 100 6570 h year 75 i e 9 months 4380 h year 50 6 months and 2190 h year 25 3 months based on these scenarios 16 norias would produce the following benefits if they would replace diesel motor pumps 16 norias could mitigate between 37 and 148 tons of emissions year as well as between 18 000 and 70 000 year spent on 14 000 56 000 l diesel if they would replace electric motor pumps 16 norias would produce the following benefits 16 norias could save between 14 and 55 tons of emissions year and between 12 000 and 48 000 year spent on electricity both types of engine are currently used to lift irrigation water on the elevated agricultural terraces such savings should be factored in towards the maintenance of norias finally we estimated that 16 renovated norias could produce 23 8 kw and 1 5 kw on average the main reasons for the limited power production potential are the large diameter resulting in very low rotational speed 2 rpm as well as their design optimized to lift water which results in a lower efficiency when used for electricity generation however we estimated that norias deployed for power production could produce benefits of between 2600 and 10 400 year if the generated electricity were sold our study is limited by the availability of data we integrated four scenarios to cover variabilities in the working hours of norias furthermore cost offsets are based on current fuel and electricity prices rather than subsidized prices we estimate that these costs will change in favor of norias in the near future with increasing co2 prices we recommend renovation but renovation costs depend on the individual preservation state of each noria and have to be assessed case by case by an expert therefore at this stage we approached these numbers by estimated construction costs finally we recommend the integrated preservation of norias in the ricote valley and beyond stressing their role as drivers for a multifunctional agriculture we argue that norias are much more than water lifting devices noria renovation in agricultural landscapes could produce highly valued social ecological and economic services compared to engine based solutions as we have shown for the ricote valley apart from their potential to mitigate emissions norias create freshwater micro habitats for flora and fauna contributing to increase biodiversity in agriculture furthermore they shape the cultural landscape and preserve the local water culture while providing recreation opportunities for locals and tourists further research is needed to quantify these services and we will continue our research on multifunctional agriculture exploring the potential of agroecological practices in spain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

9838,agricultural economics water programming models wpm has found that irrigators in water scarce areas have a rather inelastic response to water prices making water pricing cost ineffective towards water saving we hypothesize that the predicted water saving performance of pricing is significantly underestimated by issues of model structure due to the exclusion of deficit irrigation from the set of decision variables available to agents in conventional wpm to test our hypothesis we develop a model that integrates a continuous crop water production function into a positive multi attribute wpm which allows us to assess agents adaptive responses to pricing through deficit irrigation the model is illustrated with an application to the el salobral los llanos irrigated area in spain our results show that incorporating deficit irrigation as an adaptation option makes the water demand curve significantly more elastic as compared to an alternative model setting where deficit irrigation is precluded we conclude that ignoring deficit irrigation can lead to a significant underestimation of the cost effectiveness of water pricing towards water saving keywords mathematical programming models water pricing deficit irrigation water policy 1 introduction 1 1 rationale reconciling growing freshwater demand with finite supply is one of the great policy challenges of our time wef 2020c given that agriculture represents 70 of global water withdrawals which contribute to 6 4 of the world s gross domestic product fao 2021a world bank 2020d governments are increasingly constrained to adopt agricultural water saving policies to reallocate irrigation water towards higher value added economic uses households and the environment one such policy are water charges often referred to as pricing which are defined as an administrative levy imposed on irrigators to recover the costs of water use 1 1 from an economic standpoint charges are levies introduced administratively while prices refer to the exchange value of any good arising from an interaction between supply and demand in a market environment in the policy arena though many discussions on introducing charging mechanisms for natural resources use the term price or pricing as is the case in the water framework directive oj 2000 this use of the term prices as a synonym of charges is also common in the scientific literature see e g dinar et al 2015a olmstead and stavins 2007 for the sake of simplicity in this paper we use both terms interchangeably throughout theoretical and conceptual research has long argued that putting the right price tag on water can efficiently reallocate irrigation water towards other uses dinar and subramanian 1997 tsur and dinar 1997 echoing these results several governments worldwide have integrated innovative water pricing instruments into their legal bodies to save water dinar et al 2015a for example article 9 of the eu water framework directive states water pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently and thereby contribute to the environmental objectives of this directive oj 2000 however the claim that agricultural water pricing can save water for other uses including the environment is not substantiated by empirical evidence virtually no water scarce area uses pricing as a water conservation reallocation tool the objective being mostly financial through partial cost recovery of capital investments which means that field data on the water saving performance of pricing is limited and inconclusive dinar et al 2015a rey et al 2018 moreover applied research through agricultural economics water programming models wpm which we define here as a system of equations including an objective function and a set of constraints including resource constraints as a minimum that is used to represent the behavior of individual economic agents such as irrigators graveline 2016 has found that water pricing can only achieve relevant savings in water scarce areas at disproportionate costs due to the inelastic response of irrigators to higher prices including in the initial stretches of the demand function see e g berbel et al 2007 cornish et al 2004 dinar and subramanian 1997 molden et al 2010 montilla lópez et al 2017 pérez blanco et al 2015 steenbergen et al 2007 this has led some to conclude that water pricing is cost ineffective and even irrelevant as a water saving instrument berbel et al 2007 our research hypothesis is that the predicted water saving performance of agricultural water pricing policies is significantly underestimated by issues of model structure and specifically by the exclusion of deficit irrigation from the set of decision variables available to agents irrigators in conventional wpm applied to pricing in real life irrigators decide on the crop portfolio timing investments e g irrigation system and water application so to maximize their expected utility derived from one or a set of utility relevant attributes e g profit provisioned through the production of agricultural goods subject to a series of policy and resource constraints i e feasible region conventional wpm reduce this complex choice to a decision on the crop portfolio where each feasible choice represents a unique combination of crop timing investments and water application note that this approach does not include an explicit crop water production function instead water input is applied in fixed proportions to land arata et al 2017 gómez limón et al 2016 graveline et al 2014 while this simplification allows for simulating adaptive responses to water conservation policies at the extensive margin land reallocations towards less water intensive crops and super extensive margin land reallocations from irrigated to rainfed agriculture it does not allow for simulating intensive margin adjustments through deficit irrigation a relevant management option in water stressed areas koundouri 2004 without water stress it is reasonable to assume that economic agents will always apply water to the point where the marginal utility equates the marginal cost of water and thus maximize utility i e no intensive margin adjustment will ever take place only super extensive and extensive margin adjustments however under scarcity conditions where water is a binding constraint intensive margin adjustments are likely to be observed as agents now aim to determine the point at which each additional unit of water is providing the maximum attainable utility from its application which needs not match the point at which marginal utility and costs are equated which may be unfeasible under the new constraint accordingly ignoring intensive margin adjustments can lead to biased estimates of human responses biased estimates of the water saving potential and the economic impacts of pricing and misleading policy recommendations frisvold and konyar 2012 this calls for the integration of crop water production functions that reflect the biological processes occurring in the agricultural system into economic models assessing the impacts of pricing 1 2 literature review of agricultural economics wpm that integrate crop water prediction functions an expanding literature explores the integration of crop water production functions in wpm to allow for intensive margin adjustments table 1 presents the wpm that incorporate a crop water production function classified in accordance with i the calibration of the wpm ii the type of crop water production function functional form and development and iii the relevant policy issues addressed by these models among non calibrated wpm reca et al 2001 develop an expected utility model composed of three sub models the first optimizes the water application for every crop through a continuous crop specific water production function inspired in fao s cropwat fao 1992 the second approximates the crop water production function to a discrete function considering a series of interval of irrigation depths reca et al 2001 and maximizes profit over the irrigated area subject to existing constraints i e optimizing a linear objective function defined as crop specific prices times yield minus per ha costs multiplied by the crop s area while the third optimizes water allocation over the entire water system taking into account water availability and maximum and minimum flows a similar approach is followed by the mopeco model ortega álvarez et al 2004 which integrates fao s production function into an economic optimization model to determine the seasonal net irrigation depths simulate water distribution and maximize the total profit at farm level finger and schmid 2008 use regression methods to estimate the parameters of a continuous crop water production function for swiss corn and wheat under different water availability scenarios crop production functions are subsequently integrated into the objective function of a linear economic model that maximizes profit and the optimization problem is solved under alternative climate and water availability scenarios authors use this information to estimate the certainty equivalent for each climate and water availability scenario considered and reveal the minimum payoff agents would be willing to make to avoid climate change and related water availability uncertainty kampas et al 2012 build a quadratic and continuous crop production function where yield depends on water and nitrates application the crop water production function is calibrated for key crops in a case study area in thessaly greece namely corn and cotton while water is used in fixed proportions to land for the remaining crops this results in a model that combines non linear corn and cotton with linear optimization other crops garcía vila and fereres 2012 develop a non linear programming model that uses fao s aquacrop model to simulate yield responses to water application for the four most relevant crops in santaella spain namely cotton corn potato and sunflower and optimizes farmer profit under alternative price and climate change scenarios peña haro et al 2014 2010 develop an integrated economic agronomic model featuring a non linear quadratic production function where yield is a function of water and nitrogen application which is integrated in a normative economic model that maximizes irrigators profit subject to groundwater quality constraints maximum nitrate concentration loch et al 2020b integrate a piecewise crop water production function into a wpm that aims to optimally reallocate water so to maximize a linear function of profit at a catchment level under alternative states of nature that represent hypothetical water availability conditions for permanent crops the model divides the crop water production function into two components the minimum amount of input necessary to guarantee crop survival and productive watering that returns effective crop yield among calibrated wpm graveline et al 2012 integrate a piecewise crop water production function into a linear programming lp model to simulate stepwise changes in utility through the incremental decremental provision of the two utility relevant attributes considered namely profit and risk aversion connor et al 2009 develop a model for profit maximization with a quadratic crop water production function that distinguishes between annual and perennial crops so to account for future penalization if the trees die or are damaged the yield function is calibrated with observed values of water application and yield in the murray darling basin in australia cortignani and severini 2009 integrate a piecewise crop water production function into the objective function of a positive mathematical programming pmp model yield responses to water application are obtained from fao s cropwat connor et al 2012 introduce a piecewise quadratic crop water production function in a pmp model to evaluate the impact of salinity and climate change in the agricultural sector the model is calibrated following the method proposed by röhm and dabbert 2003 which follows the classical pmp approach of adding quadratic components in the cost function from dual values constraints while allowing for higher elasticity of substitution between groups of similar crops the objective function distinguishes between annual and perennial crops to account for a future penalization in case of not reaching the minimum water supply that guarantees perennial crop survival frisvold and konyar 2012 and medellín azuara et al 2012 2010 integrate a continuous ces production function that assess crop yield responses to different inputs including water in a classical pmp and in the usarm 2 2 a pmp based model developed to simulate market and policy shocks in the us agricultural sector it considers effects in land reallocation water use yield and production labor and net farm income models so to account for the elasticity of substitution between inputs frisvold and konyar 2012 nest the crop production function in two steps in the first they include land and water and in the second chemicals fertilizers labor capital and energy input medellín azuara et al 2010 consider five inputs land applied water supplies a water capital bundle and a composite input called effective water and calibrate the parameters of a ces objective function for land supplies and effective water medellín azuara et al 2012 add a new step to the calibration procedure of the ces production function above to consider the substitution relationship between water and capital irrigation investment in the swap model howitt et al 2009 use a pmp model that adopts a ces objective function to maximize profit along 4 inputs land water labor and supplies the model has a multistage calibration process to specify the ces and exponential cost function parameters finally graveline and mérel 2014 build on previous works by mérel et al 2014 2011 to shift the non linear components of the pmp objective function away from the cost function and into the production function while conventional pmp models add a quadratic component to the cost function so to introduce a non linear component in the objective function that bounds the solution of the utility maximizing problem to observed decisions graveline and mérel 2014 calibrate non linear ces crop water production functions to explicitly specify the elasticities of substitution between land and water and calibrate them to replicate a set of exogenous agronomic crop yield responses to water application following this approach the non linearity in the objective function now comes from decreasing return to scale at the crop level rather than increasing marginal cost graveline and mérel 2014 applying this approach authors identify the shadow value of water while the shadow value of land is set exogenously from the observed agricultural land value three key commonalities emerge from our literature review of agricultural economics wpm that integrate a crop water production function the first commonality is that there are no applications of integrated wpm and crop water production functions that assess the impacts of water pricing most applications research the impacts of water availability constraints and optimal basin wade reallocations the second commonality is that although most applications of agricultural economics wpm that integrate crop water production functions rely on calibrated models graveline 2016 non calibrated models account for almost half of the papers in our review on integrated wpm and crop water production functions the third commonality is that all the crop water production functions in our literature review on agricultural economics wpm that integrate crop water production functions study the relationship between crop yield and water applied instead of the more stable relationship between crop yield and crop evapotranspiration that is typically reported in agronomic models steduto et al 2007 this is because while irrigators can control water application they cannot control crop evapotranspiration which is a function of water applied and technology but also of variables out of control of the irrigator such as wind or solar radiation thus agricultural economics models that explore intensive margin adjustments use water applied as the argument of the objective function together with land allocation graveline 2016 crop water production functions relating water applied to yield are site specific and depend on several local factors soil type topography irrigation method farm management practices precipitation regime percentage of crop water requirements satisfied by rainfall fereres and soriano 2007 and trout and dejonge 2017 show how small amounts of applied water increase yield linearly until a threshold is reached from which the relationship becomes curvilinear because part of the water applied does not contribute to crop evapotranspiration due to increased deep percolation runoff or evaporation and less effective use of precipitation that reduces the efficiency of water application thus when studying the relationship between crop yield and water applied the use of a nonlinear concave crop water production function is more realistic in our literature review the relationship between crop yield and water applied is approximated using either piecewise functions obtained from process based crop simulation models or continuous functions parameterized using statistical methods typically quadratic independently of the form used piecewise or continuous all crop water production functions in the review are deterministic use of deterministic crop water production functions is instrumental to integrate agronomic modeling and data into the structure of wpm where all variables in the objective function including yields but also e g revenues and costs are defined as a deterministic function of the decision variables crop portfolio water application 1 3 contribution of this research the contribution of this paper to the scientific literature is twofold first we integrate a continuous crop water production function into a positive wpm with a multi attribute utility function as objective of the optimization process known as positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a crop water production function is integrated into a multi attribute wpm adding new modeling approaches to the literature on integrated wpm and crop water production functions can improve our understanding of irrigators adaptive responses and is instrumental towards the development of ensemble experiments that sample parameter and structural uncertainties arising from model choice ensemble experiments can be used to compare simulation results of the proposed integrated model against those of other integrated models in table 1 under alternative model settings i e exploring alternative functional forms and parameterization of the crop water production functions and utility functions and scenarios the result is a large database of simulations in which each simulation represents the performance under one plausible future this information can be used to identify futures where proposed policies meet or miss their objectives explore potential tipping points and inform the development of robust policies that show a satisfactory performance under most conceivable futures saltelli and funtowicz 2014 sapino et al 2020 second we use our newly developed model to assess the water saving and economic performance of water pricing considering all three possible adaptive responses extensive super extensive and intensive margin adjustments the net effect of considering the option to adapt through the intensive margin is revealed through a comparison with a classic pmaup model where the continuous agronomic production function is substituted by point values that represent expected yield under irrigated and or rainfed agriculture thus allowing only for extensive and super extensive margin adjustments methods are illustrated with an application to the agricultural area of el salobral los llanos domain sld located on the overallocated mancha oriental system mos a major aquifer within the júcar river basin southeastern spain 2 background to the case study el salobral los llanos domain in the mancha oriental aquifer spain 2 1 water use and pressures the sld comprises part or the totality of the municipalities of albacete balazote la herrera peña de san pedro and pozuelo fig 1 the sld has an extension of 420 km2 of which 337 km2 are devoted to agriculture 80 and 100 km2 are irrigated most relevant irrigated crops in the area include wheat barley corn onion garlic and almond which have an average water allotment available of 1500 m3 ha about 90 of water withdrawals in the sld come from irrigated agriculture most of which are met through groundwater extractions from the mos on top of agricultural water demand water bodies within the sld supply water to a population of circa 5000 inhabitants about 10 of the total demand peña haro et al 2014 the mos in the júcar river basin is one of the largest groundwater bodies in spain 7260 km2 encompassing parts of the provinces nuts3 3 3 the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics in french nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques or nuts is a geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes used by the eu eurostat 2020a nuts3 is equivalent in spain to provinces of albacete cuenca and valencia in the last three decades a significant increase in agricultural water demand and withdrawals has been observed in the mos through the development of an intensive irrigated agriculture that represents a significant share of the employment and value added of the region at present over 80 000 ha of land equipped with modern technologies are irrigated in the mos mostly with groundwater because of irrigation expansion the aquifer has been subject to an intensive groundwater overexploitation since the 1980 s which has resulted in a continued reduction in the piezometric levels especially in the southern area where the sld is located stream aquifer interaction with the júcar river has been substantially affected as a result of aquifer overdraft previously the mos discharged water into the júcar river and enhanced its streamflow while today these dynamics have been reversed and the júcar river recharges the mos sanz et al 2011 groundwater overdraft has led to a significant streamflow reduction in the júcar river with non trivial environmental consequences such as the drying of a significant reach of the júcar river in the summers of 1994 and 1995 which in turn has caused significant conflicts with downstream uses apperl et al 2015 this situation is expected to be exacerbated by future climate and land use change scenarios pulido velazquez et al 2015 some measures have been recently proposed to reduce agricultural water use and restore the balance in the overexploited mos aquifer notably water pricing peña haro et al 2014 2 2 water pricing in spain irrigators relying on surface water bodies pay river basin authorities a water use fee in spanish tarifa de utilización del agua and a regulation fee canon de regulación designed to recover the investment and maintenance costs of conveyance and water storage infrastructure operated by the public administration e g reservoirs large canals water transfers for which cost recovery levels range from low to moderate eea 2013 water use associations wua can also price water through an additional fee to recover the investment and maintenance costs of storage and distribution infrastructures operated by the wua e g canals within the wua most irrigators across the mos rely on groundwater bodies and do not use water storage and distribution infrastructure and typically do not belong to any wua which makes them exempt from the payment of all the above mentioned fees water use regulation and wua fees on the other hand the falling piezometric levels of aquifers are increasing the energy costs of groundwater pumping which now are 0 1 eur m3 in average up to 0 2 eur m3 for the deepest extractions in the sld and other irrigated areas in the mos itap 2020 jcrmo 2009 jrba 2016 aside from the fees to recover the investments in water storage and distribution infrastructures and the variable costs of pumping groundwater and operating irrigation systems no additional levies on agricultural water use exist in the irrigated areas of the mos this fails to comply with article 9 of the eu water framework directive which calls for the implementation of pricing policies with a double role cost recovery financial instrument and demand management economic instrument to favor economic efficiency in water use those water prices should recover the environmental and resource costs of the resource on top of the financial costs from the construction and operation of irrigation system oj 2000 environmental costs are defined as the damage that water uses impose on ecosystems which can be measured e g as the welfare loss experienced by those who enjoy those ecosystems 4 4 an alternative way of setting water charges is to define safe minimum standards for the quantitative status of water bodies and then impose a set of prices sufficient to achieve these standards while not pareto efficient such approach can achieve safe minimum standards at a minimum cost for the economy baumol and oates 1971 while resource costs are defined as the opportunity cost foregone economic benefits of water allocation over space and time heinz et al 2007 pulido velazquez et al 2008 wateco 2003 both of these costs are present and significant in the overallocated and overexploited mos but are not recovered peña haro et al 2014 as a result the water charge applied is significantly lower than the theoretical water charge that would allow for full cost recovery and insufficient to effectively curb down demand olmstead and stavins 2007 pulido velazquez et al 2013 in our application of the model to our case study area we simulate a pricing instrument that applies incremental water charges to recover the resource and environmental costs of water use 3 methods and data 3 1 pmaup model setting this paper integrates for the first time to the best of our knowledge a continuous crop water agronomic production function into a pmaup model pmaup modeling builds on the theory of planned behavior ajzen 1991 which argues that agent s responses stem from a summary of psychological evaluations based on farmers beliefs on the goodness or badness of an object which can be associated to multiple attributes that are often conflicting e g expected profit v risk gómez limón et al 2016 accordingly pmaup models feature a characteristic multi attribute utility function that typically includes measures of profit risk and management complexity albeit other attributes can be explored bartolini et al 2007 gómez limón et al 2016 pérez blanco and standardi 2019 rausser and yassour 1981 agents in our pmaup model decide on the allocation of land and water i e the decision variables so to maximize utility through the provision of the above mentioned utility relevant attributes within a feasible region conformed by a series of constraints e g water availability land availability 1 max x w u u z x w p 1 m z p a p x w s t 2 i 1 n x i 1 0 x i 1 3 i 1 n w i x i wa 4 x w f r n 5 z x w r m where u is the utility or objective function which in our case adopts a cobb douglas specification as it is common practice in the pmaup literature 5 5 multiplicative functions such as the cobb douglas are regarded as a superior alternative to additive forms in multi attribute modeling sampson 1999 cobb douglas functions comply with the inada 1963 conditions and guarantee the existence of a global optimum provided the efficiency frontier is convex since attributes parameters a j are all lower than one cobb douglas functions are also consistent with the neoclassical postulate of decreasing marginal utility attributes parameters can be also interpreted as a weight or indicator of the relative importance of each attribute in driving agents behavior for an early discussion on this see e g bronfenbrenner 1944 brown 1957 see e g sapino et al 2020 x is the crop portfolio vector which contains information on the fraction of land allocated to each crop i x i w is the water application vector which contains information on the water applied to each crop per hectare w i wa represents the average water availability per hectare z x w is the vector of attributes a

following constraints land availability see eq 2 above available agricultural land is assumed constant in all simulations considered water availability see eq 3 in all simulations water application has a maximum bound to the observed water allotment per hectare in the case study area climate soil know how due to the specific climatic and soil characteristics and irrigator s know how the crop portfolio is restricted to those crops that are already present in the area and observable in the database which are also the only crops for which historical data is available and ad hoc continuous crop water production function can be calibrated essenfelder et al 2018 6 i 1 n y i x i 0 y i 0 1 where y i 0 means the crop is observable and y i 1 means the crop is not observable in the area crop specific constraints some crops in the portfolio have an upper and or lower area bound in our application to the sld this restriction is used to set a minimum maximum threshold for almond trees of 5 although the pricing policy instrument is designed to work in the long run and it could result in more than 5 crop portfolio changes this may lead to significant dis investments with impacts not accounted for in our models which rely on yearly market variables notably profit essenfelder et al 2018 for example perennials add value outside the agricultural business itself through carbon sequestration and amenities e g landscape value that would be lost if perennials are substituted by annuals on the other hand perennials involve non trivial investment costs that are not captured by yearly market variables such as profit and would not be recovered and remain as sunk costs if the perennial is replaced by an annual crop loch et al 2020a 6 6 note that in spanish drought management plans perennials are allotted a high priority perennials are guaranteed the minimum amount of water needed for their survival not the amount of water towards achieving a positive yield though and only after this amount of water is satisfied annuals can receive any water accurately representing long run changes in the surface of permanent crops would demand the inclusion of other relevant variables e g carbon prices payment for ecosystem services and is beyond the scope of this paper alternatively a minimum maximum bound for ligneous trees is common practice in the literature e g gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 parrado et al 2019 note that the optimization problem above is resolved for a representative hectare and all output variables are expressed in units per hectare 3 2 pmaup model calibration in order to elicit the parameters of the utility function α we adapt the pmaup calibration method originally developed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 for the case of a single decision variable x to the case of a pmaup with a crop water production function and two decision variables x w following standard economic theory the parameters of the objective function are elicited by means of equalizing the opportunity cost of trading one unit of attribute z k off for one unit of attribute z p i e the slope of the efficient frontier or marginal rate of transformation mrt kp to the willingness to give up one unit of attribute z k in exchange for a unit of attribute z p i e the slope of the indifference curve of the utility function or marginal rate of substitution mrs kp repeating this process for every possible combination of two individual attributes z k z p within the finite set of attributes in the vector z yields a system of equations that after being solved provides the parameter values the mrs kp is conditional on the specification used for the objective function under a cobb douglas specification as the one used in this paper the m r s k p can be obtained as follows 7 m r s k p u z p u z k α p α k z k z p the main challenge in the calibration of pmaup models concerns the elicitation of the efficient frontier to calculate the mrt kp the efficient frontier is defined as the maximum value of attribute z p that can be achieved for a given value of attribute z k given a series of restrictions and vice versa marginal displacements along the efficient frontier give information on the opportunity cost between attributes i e the cost of increasing the provision of attribute z k in terms of attribute z p also known as the m r t k p note that the term opportunity cost implies convexity if an efficient frontier is not found to be convex there is no tradeoff between attributes and one of them should be removed from the attribute set since efficient frontiers cannot be analytically defined using a closed function gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 numerical methods are typically used to estimate them pmaup literature reports several alternative methods to approximate the efficient frontier among which the projection method developed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 is the most commonly used see e g essenfelder et al 2018 gutiérrez martín et al 2014 parrado et al 2019 in fact it is not necessary to know every point of the efficient frontier but only those landing points between the efficient frontier and the utility function where the m r t k p will be equaled to the m r s k p as well as the slope of the efficient frontier m r t k p in these points the projection method starts by resolving two optimization problems in the two dimensional space k p that calculate the maximum value that attribute z k can achieve when z p equals its observed value i e z p o and vice versa for every p k 8 m a x z p x w x w s t 9 z k x w z k o x w k p and 10 m a x z k x w x w s t 11 z p x w z p o x w p k by solving the two optimization problems above we project the observed attribute values to the efficient frontier thus obtaining two points τ within the efficient set τ z k z p o and τ z k o z p see fig 2 these two points are subsequently connected through a hyperplane to approximate the m r t k p through the slope β k p τ as follows 12 m r t k p β k p τ z p z p o z k z k o next the m r s k p and the approximated m r t k p are equalized for every combination of two attributes z k and z p to elicit the parameters of the objective function as follows 13 m r s k p u z p u z k α p α k z k z p β k p τ m r t k p p k 14 p 1 m α p 1 the system of equations above is resolved for every possible attribute set i e for alternative vectors z considered to elicit the corresponding objective function parameters next for each set of attributes considered and related objective function parameters we resolve the optimization problem in eqs 1 5 and obtain the simulated land x and water application w vectors and the corresponding provision of attributes z p p 1 m we next assess the performance of each set of attributes considered to represent observed behavior using three calibration residual metrics i e x the distance between the observed x o and simulated land allocation x ii e w the distance between the observed w o and simulated water application w and iii e τ the distance between the observed z p o and simulated attributes provision z p which are then aggregated to calculate the average

their related set of parameters and objective functions the relevant attribute set and objective function that is used in the simulation exercises is the one that minimizes the average calibration residual e m 3 3 pmaup model attributes the attributes explored are selected based on a literature review on the multi attribute utility theory bartolini et al 2007 gómez limón et al 2016 pérez blanco and standardi 2019 rausser and yassour 1981 and include expected profit risk avoidance and hired labor avoidance a proxy of management complexity expected profit is the only attribute considered in single attribute wpm and critical towards explaining agents choices risk avoidance reflects on the fact that agents are willing to sacrifice a fraction of expected profit so to reduce its variability finally hired labor avoidance is a proxy of management complexity avoidance which reflects on the fact that economic agents are willing to sacrifice a fraction of expected profit so to reduce the management complexity involved in their choices the relevance of risk avoidance and management complexity avoidance attributes is visible in agents choices who rarely select a single profit maximizing crop but rather a crop portfolio that balances the provision of utility relevant attributes all attributes are defined so that more is better i e all else equal increasing the provision of a given attribute yields a utility gain below we formally describe each of the attributes explored expected profit z 1 is obtained as the summation of the expected per hectare gross margin π i of each crop i times the fraction of land allocated to that crop x i the expected gross margin per hectare π i is obtained as price p i in eur kg times yield y i in kg ha plus coupled farm subsidies s i minus variable costs c i in eur ha in the classical pmaup model p i y i s i and c i are obtained as the average values of longitudinal data on prices yields subsidies and variable costs respectively the innovation presented in this work is the integration of continuous crop water production functions into the pmaup model transforming the expected profit attribute as follows 19 z 1 x w i x i π i w i i x i p i y i w i s i c i y i w i where x represents the crop portfolio vector the first choice variable in the model that allows for extensive and super extensive margin adjustments w is the water application vector the second choice variable in the model that allows for intensive margin adjustments and y i w i and c i y i w i are the crop water production function and the variable costs function respectively which now are variable and depend on the decision of how much water to apply consistent with the majority of papers in our review we approximate the crop water production function through a quadratic function that adopts the following form 20 y i w i a i w i 2 b i w i d i where y i w i is the yield in kg per hectare and a i b i and d i are the parameters of a quadratic function determining yield responses to alternative water application levels w i in m3 ha for a given crop i if the crop can be cultivated under rainfed agriculture d i is positive and equals expected yield under rainfed agriculture otherwise it is zero or negative peña haro et al 2014 for our case study in the sld a i b i and d i were elicited using data from field experiments combined with simulation outputs from a process based agronomic model peña haro et al 2014 the rationale for the use of simulations on top of field experiments in the calibration of the crop water production function comes from the need to account for the complex impact and variability of different factors governing crop growth and yield other than water if a researcher calibrates a production function using only a field experiment on water yield relationship she would be ignoring other factors that are responsible for the variation in crop yields from year to year temporal variability and across space spatial variability in fact the same plot cultivated year after year in an identical way without a priori limitations of any element nutrients water other has a temporal variability in yields due to climatic conditions soil etc similarly there is also spatial variability across plots to account for this variability the literature on crop water production functions complements field experiments with simulation models by combining field experiments with process based crop growth models it is possible to capture the interacting effects of farmers intra seasonal irrigation decision making stochastic weather conditions and physical and socio economic water supply constraints on seasonal crop yield response to water a recent review and application through aquacrop os on how to simulate crop water production functions using field experiments and process based agronomic models is available in foster and brozović 2018 we adopt a similar approach in our model where we use the process based gis based environmental policy integrated climate gepic model liu et al 2007 to account for temporal and spatial variability gepic is the distributed gis version of epic the calibration results for the crop water production functions of irrigated crops in the sld are available in section 4 1 1 note that the production functions adopted in our paper are local and only have validity in the context of the area where they have been developed the variable costs function c i y i w i adopts a linear form with respect of yield in kg ha as follows 21 c i y i w i e i y i w i f i variable costs include plants and seeds fertilizers phytosanitary products spare parts and repair services subcontracting hired labor and other supplies although national statistics only report two measures of variable costs per year and crop under rainfed and irrigated agriculture variable costs will typically be higher lower the higher lower the yield e g more labor during harvest we adjust the crop water production function to account for this by making the variable costs of crop i a linear function of yield with a fixed f i a parameter representing the minimum threshold for variable costs and a variable e i component calculated as follows 22 e i c i i r r i g a t e d c i r a i n f e d max y i w i m i n y i w i 23 f i c i r a i n f e d where c i i r r i g a t e d are the average values of longitudinal data on variable costs for crop i under irrigated agriculture c i r a i n f e d are the average values of longitudinal data on variable costs for crop i under rainfed agriculture max y i w i is the maximum yield attainable in the crop water production function for crop i and min y i w i represents rainfed yield for crop i if no rainfed alternative is available for crop i min y i w i and c i r a i n f e d equal 0 risk avoidance z 2 is obtained as the profit variability measured through the variance and covariance matrix attached to the profit maximizing combination of land x and water inputs w minus the profit variability attached to the land x and water input w allocation chosen by the agent recall attributes are defined so that more is better gómez limón et al 2016 24 z 2 x w x t v c v π w x x t v c v π w x where v c v π w is the variance and covariance matrix of the gross variable margin and π is a vector that contains the per hectare gross margin of each crop π i note that information on yields under deficit irrigation for the crops in the sld is available for a maximum of two years while this makes possible to calibrate a crop water production function y i w i using a combination of field data and agronomic model simulations peña haro et al 2014 see section 4 1 insufficient longitudinal data on crop yield for alternative water application levels precludes the calculation of a variance and covariance matrix that differentiates between crop and water application levels alternatively we can obtain the variance and covariance matrix using observed longitudinal data on yield per crop available in official statistics which is obtained as total irrigated rainfed if observed crop production at an agricultural district level divided by the surface of that irrigated rainfed crop in that agricultural district i e without distinguishing water application levels this means we have only one two if the series is available for both rainfed and irrigated technique longitudinal series per crop instead of one longitudinal series per crop and water application level thus risk avoidance is assumed to be the same for different levels of water applied for the same crop this is a limitation of the model that can only be addressed with additional longitudinal data that is currently unavailable hired labor avoidance z 3 is measured as the difference between the labor requirements of the profit maximizing combination of land x and water inputs w minus the labor requirements of the alternative simulated land x and water input w combination recall attributes are defined so that more is better 25 z 3 x w i x i n i y i w i i x i n i y i w i where 26 n i y i w i g i y i h i 27 g i n i i r r i g a t e d n i r a i n f e d max y i

calibration of the crop water production functions crop water production functions for annual crops in the sld namely wheat barley corn onion garlic were generated combining field data and agronomic simulations using the gepic model liu et al 2007 building on previous work by peña haro et al 2014 in the sld gepic is a distributed version of the epic model williams et al 1983 through a loose coupling between arcgis and the epic model in our application to the sld gepic was calibrated using the outcomes of field experiments that assessed the effect of water applied on the yield of annual crops field experiments were conducted in 2000 and 2009 growing seasons at the experimental station las tiesas in the sld fabeiro cortés et al 2003 itap 2005 paired values of crop yield per level of applied water in the field experiments v modelled yield were compared using regression analysis in order to calibrate the production functions crop responses to different water application values in the different type of soils and climatic areas were simulated in order to generate enough variability to fit the coefficients of the crop water production functions note that since the production of corn and onion is considered unfeasible under rainfed agriculture in the sld the d parameter adopts a negative value for these crops since there are no process based agronomic models that simulate ligneous crops crop water production functions for ligneous crops in the sld almond were directly calibrated from observed data using the results of deficit irrigation field experiments developed by the itap near the sld area jiménez et al 2004 accordingly crop water production functions for almond trees do not account for the complex impact and variability of different factors governing crop growth and yield other than water we consider nonetheless that having a production function with limitations is preferrable to ignoring a relevant crop in the case study area and therefore have chosen to include this production function in the model calibration results for the crop water production functions in the sld are reported in the table 3 the table also reports the correlation between the values estimated with the agronomic model and the ones simulated with the quadratic function the values range from 0 worst performance of the quadratic function to 1 best performance peña haro et al 2010 the reader is referred to peña haro et al 2014 for a more detailed discussion of the results methods and a discussion on the precision of the calibrated model 4 1 2 pmuap model calibration pmaup model calibration results and residuals for the sld are shown in table 4 the columns α 1 α 2 and α 3 display the parameter values of the cobb douglas utility function for the attributes profit z 1 risk avoidance z 2 and hired labor avoidance z 3 while e m is the average calibration residual calibration results show that the most relevant attribute driving agents decisions is profit risk avoidance has also a relevant role in explaining the behavior of irrigators in the sld the attribute measuring management complexity avoidance z 3 is marginally relevant caution must be exercised in interpreting the results for example it cannot be inferred that a high risk avoidance parameter will yield a low profit variability since choices are ultimately constrained by the feasible region nonetheless attribute parameters offer valuable insights on agent s preferences and can serve to project behavior provided calibration errors are low in the case of the sld metrics for performance evaluation are satisfactory with a very low average calibration residual pérez blanco et al 2015 4 2 simulation results we simulate a progressive increase of water prices in the sld from 0 to 1 eur m3 at 0 01 eur m3 intervals for each simulation run we obtain the crop portfolio and water application responses by irrigators and calculate the compensating variation i e monetized foregone utility foregone income and water saved simulations are run using the model setting described in section 3 which integrates the crop water production function of irrigated crops into the objective function and allows for adjustments at the intensive extensive and super extensive margin w pmaup the results thus obtained are subsequently compared with those from an alternative classic pmaup model setting c pmaup where the continuous agronomic production functions are substituted by point values that represent average expected production under irrigated and or rainfed agriculture for each crop i e a maximum of two points per crop thus allowing only for extensive and super extensive margin adjustments pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 the difference between the modeling outcomes from these two model settings reveals the net effect of intensive margin adjustments on the expected economic and environmental performance of water pricing note that only the w pmaup model is calibrated the c pmaup model uses the same parameters obtained for the w pmaup with different crop water production functions point values representing crop yield under rainfed and irrigated agriculture instead of continuous crop water production function if we calibrated both models separately considering a continuous production function for the w pmaup and point values for the c pmaup calibration results would differ both because of the alternative model settings and because of the different data inputs in reality though intensive margin adjustments are a feasible option which is indeed frequently adopted by farmers in the sld and elsewhere meaning that any model calibrated on a database that excludes this option would incur in data measurement errors therefore we use a single database the one closer to observed irrigators decisions which includes continuous agronomic crop water production functions and once the model is calibrated w pmaup we replace the continuous agronomic production functions by point values c pmaup to compare simulation outcomes with both settings and thus reveal the net effect of intensive margin adjustments fig 3 and fig 4 represent agents responses to incremental water pricing under the w pmaup and c pmaup model settings in terms of land allocation to alternative crops extensive and super extensive margin adjustments both model settings show similar responses in every simulation run see fig 3 albeit dissimilarities arise regarding water application to crops intensive water adjustment fig 4 under the w pmaup model setting agents can respond to higher prices by progressively decreasing the amount of water applied to irrigated crops deficit irrigation deficit irrigation is observed in the w pmaup model for all crops with the exception of garlic the most profitable crop in the case study area which is fully irrigated in all simulations and water intensive corn for which irrigation abruptly stops in both models after a charge increase of 0 13 eur m3 on the other hand in the c pmaup model agents are constrained to apply water in fixed proportions to land meaning that intensive margin adjustments are not possible and crops receive a constant amount of water inputs until abruptly interrupting irrigation and shifting to rainfed agriculture according to graveline and mérel 2014 there are three critical factors conditioning intensive margin adjustments i water intensity water intensive crops are those that can contribute more significantly towards water saving ii yield elasticity to water use the higher yield elasticity to water use the lower deficit irrigation is observed and iii profitability crops with higher profit will be less affected by deficit irrigation it can be observed that these three factors explain water application responses to pricing in the w pmaup model setting garlic the most profitable crop can afford a price increase of up to 1 eur m3 without applying deficit irrigation i e a 600 1000 increase in the volumetric cost of water as compared to the observed groundwater pumping costs of 0 1 0 20 eur m3 while in the case of onion the second most profitable crop water applied per hectare remains constant until a charge increase of 0 78 eur m3 a 490 780 water cost increase at which point onion is replaced by other crops with deficit irrigation briefly applied in the interim barley and wheat are the crops with the lowest yield elasticity to water use accordingly deficit irrigation is observed from the initial water price increases until both crops eventually shift to rainfed agriculture which happens at a water charge increase of 0 19 barley and 0 44 eur m3 wheat almond starts deficit irrigation in the initial simulation runs with a slight rebound at a 0 12 eur m3 price increase due to a substitution effect with corn in the case of corn the high yield elasticity to water application overtakes all the other effects meaning that irrigated corn is abruptly substituted by less water intensive crops without intermediary deficit irrigation at a charge increase of 0 12 eur m3 the possibility to adapt at the intensive margin in the w pmaup setting means crop yield per hectare is not constant anymore across the alternative price simulations as happens in models where water input is applied in fixed proportions to land c pmaup setting fig 5 shows how different water application choices affect yield in kg ha for each crop under the w pmaup model setting for those crops that can be cultivated under rainfed agriculture wheat barley and almond irrigation water is progressively diminished and yield reduces until irrigation stops altogether and yield equates that under rainfed agriculture fig 6 shows the water demand curve representing the relationship between water prices and water application for both the w pmaup and c pmaup model settings simulation results using the c pmaup model setting displays a jumpy behavior with quasi inelastic responses in the initial and final stretches of the demand function this outcome is consistent with those coming from the literature on agricultural water pricing under scarcity where the model structures adopted also ignore deficit irrigation intensive margin adjustments on the other hand the w pmaup model setting that allows for deficit irrigation displays a gradual reduction in water use along with higher prices in the initial and middle stretches of the demand function and a quasi inelastic response for a price increase of 0 43 eur m3 or higher this result suggests that having or not quasi inelastic responses in the initial and middle stretches of the demand function is conditional on the model structure settings choice the upshot is that where intensive margin adaptation responses are possible in the model water pricing is cost effective towards water saving in the initial stretches of the demand function which thus far have been often assumed to be inelastic for example a price increase of 0 09 eur m3 which represents a non trivial price increase of 45 90 in the sld is ineffective towards water saving in the c pmaup but can save up to 390 m3 ha 11 of the average water application of 3606 m3 ha in the w pmaup model setting in addition quasi inelastic responses in the final stretches of the demand function while appearing in both model settings emerge at higher prices in the w pmaup from 0 43 eur m3 as compared to the c pmaup model setting from 0 25 eur m3 fig 7 reports the economic impact of higher prices in terms of foregone profit a and the monetized utility loss or compensating variation b i e the amount of money the irrigator would need to achieve his initial utility following price increases the compensating variation is consistently higher for the c pmaup model setting in all simulations indicating a larger utility loss as compared to the w pmaup model setting which is particularly visible in the charge increase interval between 0 1 eur m3 and 0 4 eur m3 between 1 and 8 higher compensating variation in the c pmaup than in the w pmaup model setting a similar outcome is observed for the foregone profit which again is higher in the c pmaup model setting up to 0 4 eur m3 increase with a marked gap in the 0 1 eur m3 0 4 eur m3 interval between 0 7 and 8 3 higher foregone income in the c pmaup than in the w pmaup model setting the superior economic performance under the w pmaup setting is attributable to the increased number of adaptive responses available in the w pmaup as compared to the c pmaup and reveals the net effect of intensive margin adjustments on economic outputs 5 conclusion this paper integrates a continuous crop water production function into a pmaup model to assess the influence of intensive margin adjustments on the expected water saving and economic performance of water pricing the model is calibrated for an agricultural area in a water scarce agricultural area in southeastern spain el salobral los llanos in the júcar river basin so to factor in climatic soil and other local factors conditioning the crop yield water input relationship results reveal non trivial dissimilarities in the economic and water saving performance of the w pmaup intensive extensive and super extensive margin adjustments and c pmaup only extensive and super extensive margin adjustments model settings the quasi inelastic responses in the initial and middle stretches of the c pmaup demand function which are consistent with findings in the literature on water charges in water scarce areas are transformed into elastic responses in the w pmaup suggesting a more cost effective contribution of water pricing towards water saving ignoring intensive margin adjustments also tends to overestimate the economic impact of water pricing with a higher foregone profit and compensating variation obtained in the c pmaup model setting as compared to the w pmaup model setting in all simulation runs the compensating variation foregone profit is up to 1 8 0 7 8 3 higher in the c pmaup than in the w pmaup model setting for the water price increase range 80 200 given that deficit irrigation is a commonly used adaptation response in the sld we argue that ignoring it may not accurately reflect the actual adaptation options available to irrigators and recommend the use of wpm that integrate crop water production functions the model proposed in this paper can be improved in several ways future efforts should aim at gathering longitudinal data on yields for alternative water application levels with high granularity through remote sensing surveys field experiments or other means so to build increasingly accurate site specific crop water production functions and more detailed utility relevant attributes e g through the development of a variance and covariance matrix that differentiates between crop types and water application in the risk avoidance attribute this will facilitate the application of the model and replication of the experiments elsewhere a prerequisite to validate the preliminary findings obtained for our case study area in the sld note that although calibration residuals are low in the case study area performance may be less satisfactory elsewhere which calls for exploring alternative additional attributes e g alternative definitions of the management complexity avoidance attribute and more comprehensive and spatially detailed data such as water use data to better define the feasible region e g leveraging on earth observation and in situ monitoring digital data acquisition and management and predictive analytics furthermore other input e g fertilizer could be introduced in the production function to consider other aspects of the complex mechanism that govern crop growth and yield even though this goes beyond the object of this paper which is to test the performance of a crop water production function in saving water through pricing building multi model ensemble experiments combining multiple wpm that allow for intensive margin adjustments can help us sample modeling uncertainty and establish confidence intervals for the environmental and economic performance of alternative water conservation policies sapino et al 2020 beyond multi model ensembles decision making should be also informed by multiple scenarios that complement the pricing simulations in our model which may in turn reveal far reaching and under recognized implications for our policy pannell 2006 for example our findings rely on the assumption that both water charges and water allocations are effectively enforced however where agents can resort to alternative sources of water e g through illegal aquifer withdrawals higher charges may lead to an increase in the use of alternative sources which calls for complementary policies such as use of remote sensing and penalties in the case of water theft loch et al 2020b coupling the proposed pmaup model with a hydrologic model and a river basin management model is also necessary to assess the environmental impacts of water conservation across space thus supporting the identification of potential distributive issues e g upstream v downstream water conservation finally accurate estimates on the environmental and resource costs of water are needed to design realistic water pricing scenarios that substitute the hypothesized scenarios adopted in our simulations albeit these costs are at present difficult to obtain given that there are few standardized methods to measure the economic value of water and there are often large differences between values obtained through different methods un 2021b declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9838,agricultural economics water programming models wpm has found that irrigators in water scarce areas have a rather inelastic response to water prices making water pricing cost ineffective towards water saving we hypothesize that the predicted water saving performance of pricing is significantly underestimated by issues of model structure due to the exclusion of deficit irrigation from the set of decision variables available to agents in conventional wpm to test our hypothesis we develop a model that integrates a continuous crop water production function into a positive multi attribute wpm which allows us to assess agents adaptive responses to pricing through deficit irrigation the model is illustrated with an application to the el salobral los llanos irrigated area in spain our results show that incorporating deficit irrigation as an adaptation option makes the water demand curve significantly more elastic as compared to an alternative model setting where deficit irrigation is precluded we conclude that ignoring deficit irrigation can lead to a significant underestimation of the cost effectiveness of water pricing towards water saving keywords mathematical programming models water pricing deficit irrigation water policy 1 introduction 1 1 rationale reconciling growing freshwater demand with finite supply is one of the great policy challenges of our time wef 2020c given that agriculture represents 70 of global water withdrawals which contribute to 6 4 of the world s gross domestic product fao 2021a world bank 2020d governments are increasingly constrained to adopt agricultural water saving policies to reallocate irrigation water towards higher value added economic uses households and the environment one such policy are water charges often referred to as pricing which are defined as an administrative levy imposed on irrigators to recover the costs of water use 1 1 from an economic standpoint charges are levies introduced administratively while prices refer to the exchange value of any good arising from an interaction between supply and demand in a market environment in the policy arena though many discussions on introducing charging mechanisms for natural resources use the term price or pricing as is the case in the water framework directive oj 2000 this use of the term prices as a synonym of charges is also common in the scientific literature see e g dinar et al 2015a olmstead and stavins 2007 for the sake of simplicity in this paper we use both terms interchangeably throughout theoretical and conceptual research has long argued that putting the right price tag on water can efficiently reallocate irrigation water towards other uses dinar and subramanian 1997 tsur and dinar 1997 echoing these results several governments worldwide have integrated innovative water pricing instruments into their legal bodies to save water dinar et al 2015a for example article 9 of the eu water framework directive states water pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently and thereby contribute to the environmental objectives of this directive oj 2000 however the claim that agricultural water pricing can save water for other uses including the environment is not substantiated by empirical evidence virtually no water scarce area uses pricing as a water conservation reallocation tool the objective being mostly financial through partial cost recovery of capital investments which means that field data on the water saving performance of pricing is limited and inconclusive dinar et al 2015a rey et al 2018 moreover applied research through agricultural economics water programming models wpm which we define here as a system of equations including an objective function and a set of constraints including resource constraints as a minimum that is used to represent the behavior of individual economic agents such as irrigators graveline 2016 has found that water pricing can only achieve relevant savings in water scarce areas at disproportionate costs due to the inelastic response of irrigators to higher prices including in the initial stretches of the demand function see e g berbel et al 2007 cornish et al 2004 dinar and subramanian 1997 molden et al 2010 montilla lópez et al 2017 pérez blanco et al 2015 steenbergen et al 2007 this has led some to conclude that water pricing is cost ineffective and even irrelevant as a water saving instrument berbel et al 2007 our research hypothesis is that the predicted water saving performance of agricultural water pricing policies is significantly underestimated by issues of model structure and specifically by the exclusion of deficit irrigation from the set of decision variables available to agents irrigators in conventional wpm applied to pricing in real life irrigators decide on the crop portfolio timing investments e g irrigation system and water application so to maximize their expected utility derived from one or a set of utility relevant attributes e g profit provisioned through the production of agricultural goods subject to a series of policy and resource constraints i e feasible region conventional wpm reduce this complex choice to a decision on the crop portfolio where each feasible choice represents a unique combination of crop timing investments and water application note that this approach does not include an explicit crop water production function instead water input is applied in fixed proportions to land arata et al 2017 gómez limón et al 2016 graveline et al 2014 while this simplification allows for simulating adaptive responses to water conservation policies at the extensive margin land reallocations towards less water intensive crops and super extensive margin land reallocations from irrigated to rainfed agriculture it does not allow for simulating intensive margin adjustments through deficit irrigation a relevant management option in water stressed areas koundouri 2004 without water stress it is reasonable to assume that economic agents will always apply water to the point where the marginal utility equates the marginal cost of water and thus maximize utility i e no intensive margin adjustment will ever take place only super extensive and extensive margin adjustments however under scarcity conditions where water is a binding constraint intensive margin adjustments are likely to be observed as agents now aim to determine the point at which each additional unit of water is providing the maximum attainable utility from its application which needs not match the point at which marginal utility and costs are equated which may be unfeasible under the new constraint accordingly ignoring intensive margin adjustments can lead to biased estimates of human responses biased estimates of the water saving potential and the economic impacts of pricing and misleading policy recommendations frisvold and konyar 2012 this calls for the integration of crop water production functions that reflect the biological processes occurring in the agricultural system into economic models assessing the impacts of pricing 1 2 literature review of agricultural economics wpm that integrate crop water prediction functions an expanding literature explores the integration of crop water production functions in wpm to allow for intensive margin adjustments table 1 presents the wpm that incorporate a crop water production function classified in accordance with i the calibration of the wpm ii the type of crop water production function functional form and development and iii the relevant policy issues addressed by these models among non calibrated wpm reca et al 2001 develop an expected utility model composed of three sub models the first optimizes the water application for every crop through a continuous crop specific water production function inspired in fao s cropwat fao 1992 the second approximates the crop water production function to a discrete function considering a series of interval of irrigation depths reca et al 2001 and maximizes profit over the irrigated area subject to existing constraints i e optimizing a linear objective function defined as crop specific prices times yield minus per ha costs multiplied by the crop s area while the third optimizes water allocation over the entire water system taking into account water availability and maximum and minimum flows a similar approach is followed by the mopeco model ortega álvarez et al 2004 which integrates fao s production function into an economic optimization model to determine the seasonal net irrigation depths simulate water distribution and maximize the total profit at farm level finger and schmid 2008 use regression methods to estimate the parameters of a continuous crop water production function for swiss corn and wheat under different water availability scenarios crop production functions are subsequently integrated into the objective function of a linear economic model that maximizes profit and the optimization problem is solved under alternative climate and water availability scenarios authors use this information to estimate the certainty equivalent for each climate and water availability scenario considered and reveal the minimum payoff agents would be willing to make to avoid climate change and related water availability uncertainty kampas et al 2012 build a quadratic and continuous crop production function where yield depends on water and nitrates application the crop water production function is calibrated for key crops in a case study area in thessaly greece namely corn and cotton while water is used in fixed proportions to land for the remaining crops this results in a model that combines non linear corn and cotton with linear optimization other crops garcía vila and fereres 2012 develop a non linear programming model that uses fao s aquacrop model to simulate yield responses to water application for the four most relevant crops in santaella spain namely cotton corn potato and sunflower and optimizes farmer profit under alternative price and climate change scenarios peña haro et al 2014 2010 develop an integrated economic agronomic model featuring a non linear quadratic production function where yield is a function of water and nitrogen application which is integrated in a normative economic model that maximizes irrigators profit subject to groundwater quality constraints maximum nitrate concentration loch et al 2020b integrate a piecewise crop water production function into a wpm that aims to optimally reallocate water so to maximize a linear function of profit at a catchment level under alternative states of nature that represent hypothetical water availability conditions for permanent crops the model divides the crop water production function into two components the minimum amount of input necessary to guarantee crop survival and productive watering that returns effective crop yield among calibrated wpm graveline et al 2012 integrate a piecewise crop water production function into a linear programming lp model to simulate stepwise changes in utility through the incremental decremental provision of the two utility relevant attributes considered namely profit and risk aversion connor et al 2009 develop a model for profit maximization with a quadratic crop water production function that distinguishes between annual and perennial crops so to account for future penalization if the trees die or are damaged the yield function is calibrated with observed values of water application and yield in the murray darling basin in australia cortignani and severini 2009 integrate a piecewise crop water production function into the objective function of a positive mathematical programming pmp model yield responses to water application are obtained from fao s cropwat connor et al 2012 introduce a piecewise quadratic crop water production function in a pmp model to evaluate the impact of salinity and climate change in the agricultural sector the model is calibrated following the method proposed by röhm and dabbert 2003 which follows the classical pmp approach of adding quadratic components in the cost function from dual values constraints while allowing for higher elasticity of substitution between groups of similar crops the objective function distinguishes between annual and perennial crops to account for a future penalization in case of not reaching the minimum water supply that guarantees perennial crop survival frisvold and konyar 2012 and medellín azuara et al 2012 2010 integrate a continuous ces production function that assess crop yield responses to different inputs including water in a classical pmp and in the usarm 2 2 a pmp based model developed to simulate market and policy shocks in the us agricultural sector it considers effects in land reallocation water use yield and production labor and net farm income models so to account for the elasticity of substitution between inputs frisvold and konyar 2012 nest the crop production function in two steps in the first they include land and water and in the second chemicals fertilizers labor capital and energy input medellín azuara et al 2010 consider five inputs land applied water supplies a water capital bundle and a composite input called effective water and calibrate the parameters of a ces objective function for land supplies and effective water medellín azuara et al 2012 add a new step to the calibration procedure of the ces production function above to consider the substitution relationship between water and capital irrigation investment in the swap model howitt et al 2009 use a pmp model that adopts a ces objective function to maximize profit along 4 inputs land water labor and supplies the model has a multistage calibration process to specify the ces and exponential cost function parameters finally graveline and mérel 2014 build on previous works by mérel et al 2014 2011 to shift the non linear components of the pmp objective function away from the cost function and into the production function while conventional pmp models add a quadratic component to the cost function so to introduce a non linear component in the objective function that bounds the solution of the utility maximizing problem to observed decisions graveline and mérel 2014 calibrate non linear ces crop water production functions to explicitly specify the elasticities of substitution between land and water and calibrate them to replicate a set of exogenous agronomic crop yield responses to water application following this approach the non linearity in the objective function now comes from decreasing return to scale at the crop level rather than increasing marginal cost graveline and mérel 2014 applying this approach authors identify the shadow value of water while the shadow value of land is set exogenously from the observed agricultural land value three key commonalities emerge from our literature review of agricultural economics wpm that integrate a crop water production function the first commonality is that there are no applications of integrated wpm and crop water production functions that assess the impacts of water pricing most applications research the impacts of water availability constraints and optimal basin wade reallocations the second commonality is that although most applications of agricultural economics wpm that integrate crop water production functions rely on calibrated models graveline 2016 non calibrated models account for almost half of the papers in our review on integrated wpm and crop water production functions the third commonality is that all the crop water production functions in our literature review on agricultural economics wpm that integrate crop water production functions study the relationship between crop yield and water applied instead of the more stable relationship between crop yield and crop evapotranspiration that is typically reported in agronomic models steduto et al 2007 this is because while irrigators can control water application they cannot control crop evapotranspiration which is a function of water applied and technology but also of variables out of control of the irrigator such as wind or solar radiation thus agricultural economics models that explore intensive margin adjustments use water applied as the argument of the objective function together with land allocation graveline 2016 crop water production functions relating water applied to yield are site specific and depend on several local factors soil type topography irrigation method farm management practices precipitation regime percentage of crop water requirements satisfied by rainfall fereres and soriano 2007 and trout and dejonge 2017 show how small amounts of applied water increase yield linearly until a threshold is reached from which the relationship becomes curvilinear because part of the water applied does not contribute to crop evapotranspiration due to increased deep percolation runoff or evaporation and less effective use of precipitation that reduces the efficiency of water application thus when studying the relationship between crop yield and water applied the use of a nonlinear concave crop water production function is more realistic in our literature review the relationship between crop yield and water applied is approximated using either piecewise functions obtained from process based crop simulation models or continuous functions parameterized using statistical methods typically quadratic independently of the form used piecewise or continuous all crop water production functions in the review are deterministic use of deterministic crop water production functions is instrumental to integrate agronomic modeling and data into the structure of wpm where all variables in the objective function including yields but also e g revenues and costs are defined as a deterministic function of the decision variables crop portfolio water application 1 3 contribution of this research the contribution of this paper to the scientific literature is twofold first we integrate a continuous crop water production function into a positive wpm with a multi attribute utility function as objective of the optimization process known as positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a crop water production function is integrated into a multi attribute wpm adding new modeling approaches to the literature on integrated wpm and crop water production functions can improve our understanding of irrigators adaptive responses and is instrumental towards the development of ensemble experiments that sample parameter and structural uncertainties arising from model choice ensemble experiments can be used to compare simulation results of the proposed integrated model against those of other integrated models in table 1 under alternative model settings i e exploring alternative functional forms and parameterization of the crop water production functions and utility functions and scenarios the result is a large database of simulations in which each simulation represents the performance under one plausible future this information can be used to identify futures where proposed policies meet or miss their objectives explore potential tipping points and inform the development of robust policies that show a satisfactory performance under most conceivable futures saltelli and funtowicz 2014 sapino et al 2020 second we use our newly developed model to assess the water saving and economic performance of water pricing considering all three possible adaptive responses extensive super extensive and intensive margin adjustments the net effect of considering the option to adapt through the intensive margin is revealed through a comparison with a classic pmaup model where the continuous agronomic production function is substituted by point values that represent expected yield under irrigated and or rainfed agriculture thus allowing only for extensive and super extensive margin adjustments methods are illustrated with an application to the agricultural area of el salobral los llanos domain sld located on the overallocated mancha oriental system mos a major aquifer within the júcar river basin southeastern spain 2 background to the case study el salobral los llanos domain in the mancha oriental aquifer spain 2 1 water use and pressures the sld comprises part or the totality of the municipalities of albacete balazote la herrera peña de san pedro and pozuelo fig 1 the sld has an extension of 420 km2 of which 337 km2 are devoted to agriculture 80 and 100 km2 are irrigated most relevant irrigated crops in the area include wheat barley corn onion garlic and almond which have an average water allotment available of 1500 m3 ha about 90 of water withdrawals in the sld come from irrigated agriculture most of which are met through groundwater extractions from the mos on top of agricultural water demand water bodies within the sld supply water to a population of circa 5000 inhabitants about 10 of the total demand peña haro et al 2014 the mos in the júcar river basin is one of the largest groundwater bodies in spain 7260 km2 encompassing parts of the provinces nuts3 3 3 the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics in french nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques or nuts is a geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes used by the eu eurostat 2020a nuts3 is equivalent in spain to provinces of albacete cuenca and valencia in the last three decades a significant increase in agricultural water demand and withdrawals has been observed in the mos through the development of an intensive irrigated agriculture that represents a significant share of the employment and value added of the region at present over 80 000 ha of land equipped with modern technologies are irrigated in the mos mostly with groundwater because of irrigation expansion the aquifer has been subject to an intensive groundwater overexploitation since the 1980 s which has resulted in a continued reduction in the piezometric levels especially in the southern area where the sld is located stream aquifer interaction with the júcar river has been substantially affected as a result of aquifer overdraft previously the mos discharged water into the júcar river and enhanced its streamflow while today these dynamics have been reversed and the júcar river recharges the mos sanz et al 2011 groundwater overdraft has led to a significant streamflow reduction in the júcar river with non trivial environmental consequences such as the drying of a significant reach of the júcar river in the summers of 1994 and 1995 which in turn has caused significant conflicts with downstream uses apperl et al 2015 this situation is expected to be exacerbated by future climate and land use change scenarios pulido velazquez et al 2015 some measures have been recently proposed to reduce agricultural water use and restore the balance in the overexploited mos aquifer notably water pricing peña haro et al 2014 2 2 water pricing in spain irrigators relying on surface water bodies pay river basin authorities a water use fee in spanish tarifa de utilización del agua and a regulation fee canon de regulación designed to recover the investment and maintenance costs of conveyance and water storage infrastructure operated by the public administration e g reservoirs large canals water transfers for which cost recovery levels range from low to moderate eea 2013 water use associations wua can also price water through an additional fee to recover the investment and maintenance costs of storage and distribution infrastructures operated by the wua e g canals within the wua most irrigators across the mos rely on groundwater bodies and do not use water storage and distribution infrastructure and typically do not belong to any wua which makes them exempt from the payment of all the above mentioned fees water use regulation and wua fees on the other hand the falling piezometric levels of aquifers are increasing the energy costs of groundwater pumping which now are 0 1 eur m3 in average up to 0 2 eur m3 for the deepest extractions in the sld and other irrigated areas in the mos itap 2020 jcrmo 2009 jrba 2016 aside from the fees to recover the investments in water storage and distribution infrastructures and the variable costs of pumping groundwater and operating irrigation systems no additional levies on agricultural water use exist in the irrigated areas of the mos this fails to comply with article 9 of the eu water framework directive which calls for the implementation of pricing policies with a double role cost recovery financial instrument and demand management economic instrument to favor economic efficiency in water use those water prices should recover the environmental and resource costs of the resource on top of the financial costs from the construction and operation of irrigation system oj 2000 environmental costs are defined as the damage that water uses impose on ecosystems which can be measured e g as the welfare loss experienced by those who enjoy those ecosystems 4 4 an alternative way of setting water charges is to define safe minimum standards for the quantitative status of water bodies and then impose a set of prices sufficient to achieve these standards while not pareto efficient such approach can achieve safe minimum standards at a minimum cost for the economy baumol and oates 1971 while resource costs are defined as the opportunity cost foregone economic benefits of water allocation over space and time heinz et al 2007 pulido velazquez et al 2008 wateco 2003 both of these costs are present and significant in the overallocated and overexploited mos but are not recovered peña haro et al 2014 as a result the water charge applied is significantly lower than the theoretical water charge that would allow for full cost recovery and insufficient to effectively curb down demand olmstead and stavins 2007 pulido velazquez et al 2013 in our application of the model to our case study area we simulate a pricing instrument that applies incremental water charges to recover the resource and environmental costs of water use 3 methods and data 3 1 pmaup model setting this paper integrates for the first time to the best of our knowledge a continuous crop water agronomic production function into a pmaup model pmaup modeling builds on the theory of planned behavior ajzen 1991 which argues that agent s responses stem from a summary of psychological evaluations based on farmers beliefs on the goodness or badness of an object which can be associated to multiple attributes that are often conflicting e g expected profit v risk gómez limón et al 2016 accordingly pmaup models feature a characteristic multi attribute utility function that typically includes measures of profit risk and management complexity albeit other attributes can be explored bartolini et al 2007 gómez limón et al 2016 pérez blanco and standardi 2019 rausser and yassour 1981 agents in our pmaup model decide on the allocation of land and water i e the decision variables so to maximize utility through the provision of the above mentioned utility relevant attributes within a feasible region conformed by a series of constraints e g water availability land availability 1 max x w u u z x w p 1 m z p a p x w s t 2 i 1 n x i 1 0 x i 1 3 i 1 n w i x i wa 4 x w f r n 5 z x w r m where u is the utility or objective function which in our case adopts a cobb douglas specification as it is common practice in the pmaup literature 5 5 multiplicative functions such as the cobb douglas are regarded as a superior alternative to additive forms in multi attribute modeling sampson 1999 cobb douglas functions comply with the inada 1963 conditions and guarantee the existence of a global optimum provided the efficiency frontier is convex since attributes parameters a j are all lower than one cobb douglas functions are also consistent with the neoclassical postulate of decreasing marginal utility attributes parameters can be also interpreted as a weight or indicator of the relative importance of each attribute in driving agents behavior for an early discussion on this see e g bronfenbrenner 1944 brown 1957 see e g sapino et al 2020 x is the crop portfolio vector which contains information on the fraction of land allocated to each crop i x i w is the water application vector which contains information on the water applied to each crop per hectare w i wa represents the average water availability per hectare z x w is the vector of attributes a function of the decision variables in vectors x w which contains information on the provision of each utility relevant attribute z p all attributes are defined so that more is better i e all else equal increasing the provision of a given attribute yields a utility gain m is the number of individual attributes z p and parameters a p considered and f is the feasible region which includes the following constraints land availability see eq 2 above available agricultural land is assumed constant in all simulations considered water availability see eq 3 in all simulations water application has a maximum bound to the observed water allotment per hectare in the case study area climate soil know how due to the specific climatic and soil characteristics and irrigator s know how the crop portfolio is restricted to those crops that are already present in the area and observable in the database which are also the only crops for which historical data is available and ad hoc continuous crop water production function can be calibrated essenfelder et al 2018 6 i 1 n y i x i 0 y i 0 1 where y i 0 means the crop is observable and y i 1 means the crop is not observable in the area crop specific constraints some crops in the portfolio have an upper and or lower area bound in our application to the sld this restriction is used to set a minimum maximum threshold for almond trees of 5 although the pricing policy instrument is designed to work in the long run and it could result in more than 5 crop portfolio changes this may lead to significant dis investments with impacts not accounted for in our models which rely on yearly market variables notably profit essenfelder et al 2018 for example perennials add value outside the agricultural business itself through carbon sequestration and amenities e g landscape value that would be lost if perennials are substituted by annuals on the other hand perennials involve non trivial investment costs that are not captured by yearly market variables such as profit and would not be recovered and remain as sunk costs if the perennial is replaced by an annual crop loch et al 2020a 6 6 note that in spanish drought management plans perennials are allotted a high priority perennials are guaranteed the minimum amount of water needed for their survival not the amount of water towards achieving a positive yield though and only after this amount of water is satisfied annuals can receive any water accurately representing long run changes in the surface of permanent crops would demand the inclusion of other relevant variables e g carbon prices payment for ecosystem services and is beyond the scope of this paper alternatively a minimum maximum bound for ligneous trees is common practice in the literature e g gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 parrado et al 2019 note that the optimization problem above is resolved for a representative hectare and all output variables are expressed in units per hectare 3 2 pmaup model calibration in order to elicit the parameters of the utility function α we adapt the pmaup calibration method originally developed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 for the case of a single decision variable x to the case of a pmaup with a crop water production function and two decision variables x w following standard economic theory the parameters of the objective function are elicited by means of equalizing the opportunity cost of trading one unit of attribute z k off for one unit of attribute z p i e the slope of the efficient frontier or marginal rate of transformation mrt kp to the willingness to give up one unit of attribute z k in exchange for a unit of attribute z p i e the slope of the indifference curve of the utility function or marginal rate of substitution mrs kp repeating this process for every possible combination of two individual attributes z k z p within the finite set of attributes in the vector z yields a system of equations that after being solved provides the parameter values the mrs kp is conditional on the specification used for the objective function under a cobb douglas specification as the one used in this paper the m r s k p can be obtained as follows 7 m r s k p u z p u z k α p α k z k z p the main challenge in the calibration of pmaup models concerns the elicitation of the efficient frontier to calculate the mrt kp the efficient frontier is defined as the maximum value of attribute z p that can be achieved for a given value of attribute z k given a series of restrictions and vice versa marginal displacements along the efficient frontier give information on the opportunity cost between attributes i e the cost of increasing the provision of attribute z k in terms of attribute z p also known as the m r t k p note that the term opportunity cost implies convexity if an efficient frontier is not found to be convex there is no tradeoff between attributes and one of them should be removed from the attribute set since efficient frontiers cannot be analytically defined using a closed function gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 numerical methods are typically used to estimate them pmaup literature reports several alternative methods to approximate the efficient frontier among which the projection method developed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 is the most commonly used see e g essenfelder et al 2018 gutiérrez martín et al 2014 parrado et al 2019 in fact it is not necessary to know every point of the efficient frontier but only those landing points between the efficient frontier and the utility function where the m r t k p will be equaled to the m r s k p as well as the slope of the efficient frontier m r t k p in these points the projection method starts by resolving two optimization problems in the two dimensional space k p that calculate the maximum value that attribute z k can achieve when z p equals its observed value i e z p o and vice versa for every p k 8 m a x z p x w x w s t 9 z k x w z k o x w k p and 10 m a x z k x w x w s t 11 z p x w z p o x w p k by solving the two optimization problems above we project the observed attribute values to the efficient frontier thus obtaining two points τ within the efficient set τ z k z p o and τ z k o z p see fig 2 these two points are subsequently connected through a hyperplane to approximate the m r t k p through the slope β k p τ as follows 12 m r t k p β k p τ z p z p o z k z k o next the m r s k p and the approximated m r t k p are equalized for every combination of two attributes z k and z p to elicit the parameters of the objective function as follows 13 m r s k p u z p u z k α p α k z k z p β k p τ m r t k p p k 14 p 1 m α p 1 the system of equations above is resolved for every possible attribute set i e for alternative vectors z considered to elicit the corresponding objective function parameters next for each set of attributes considered and related objective function parameters we resolve the optimization problem in eqs 1 5 and obtain the simulated land x and water application w vectors and the corresponding provision of attributes z p p 1 m we next assess the performance of each set of attributes considered to represent observed behavior using three calibration residual metrics i e x the distance between the observed x o and simulated land allocation x ii e w the distance between the observed w o and simulated water application w and iii e τ the distance between the observed z p o and simulated attributes provision z p which are then aggregated to calculate the average

their related set of parameters and objective functions the relevant attribute set and objective function that is used in the simulation exercises is the one that minimizes the average calibration residual e m 3 3 pmaup model attributes the attributes explored are selected based on a literature review on the multi attribute utility theory bartolini et al 2007 gómez limón et al 2016 pérez blanco and standardi 2019 rausser and yassour 1981 and include expected profit risk avoidance and hired labor avoidance a proxy of management complexity expected profit is the only attribute considered in single attribute wpm and critical towards explaining agents choices risk avoidance reflects on the fact that agents are willing to sacrifice a fraction of expected profit so to reduce its variability finally hired labor avoidance is a proxy of management complexity avoidance which reflects on the fact that economic agents are willing to sacrifice a fraction of expected profit so to reduce the management complexity involved in their choices the relevance of risk avoidance and management complexity avoidance attributes is visible in agents choices who rarely select a single profit maximizing crop but rather a crop portfolio that balances the provision of utility relevant attributes all attributes are defined so that more is better i e all else equal increasing the provision of a given attribute yields a utility gain below we formally describe each of the attributes explored expected profit z 1 is obtained as the summation of the expected per hectare gross margin π i of each crop i times the fraction of land allocated to that crop x i the expected gross margin per hectare π i is obtained as price p i in eur kg times yield y i in kg ha plus coupled farm subsidies s i minus variable costs c i in eur ha in the classical pmaup model p i y i s i and c i are obtained as the average values of longitudinal data on prices yields subsidies and variable costs respectively the innovation presented in this work is the integration of continuous crop water production functions into the pmaup model transforming the expected profit attribute as follows 19 z 1 x w i x i π i w i i x i p i y i w i s i c i y i w i where x represents the crop portfolio vector the first choice variable in the model that allows for extensive and super extensive margin adjustments w is the water application vector the second choice variable in the model that allows for intensive margin adjustments and y i w i and c i y i w i are the crop water production function and the variable costs function respectively which now are variable and depend on the decision of how much water to apply consistent with the majority of papers in our review we approximate the crop water production function through a quadratic function that adopts the following form 20 y i w i a i w i 2 b i w i d i where y i w i is the yield in kg per hectare and a i b i and d i are the parameters of a quadratic function determining yield responses to alternative water application levels w i in m3 ha for a given crop i if the crop can be cultivated under rainfed agriculture d i is positive and equals expected yield under rainfed agriculture otherwise it is zero or negative peña haro et al 2014 for our case study in the sld a i b i and d i were elicited using data from field experiments combined with simulation outputs from a process based agronomic model peña haro et al 2014 the rationale for the use of simulations on top of field experiments in the calibration of the crop water production function comes from the need to account for the complex impact and variability of different factors governing crop growth and yield other than water if a researcher calibrates a production function using only a field experiment on water yield relationship she would be ignoring other factors that are responsible for the variation in crop yields from year to year temporal variability and across space spatial variability in fact the same plot cultivated year after year in an identical way without a priori limitations of any element nutrients water other has a temporal variability in yields due to climatic conditions soil etc similarly there is also spatial variability across plots to account for this variability the literature on crop water production functions complements field experiments with simulation models by combining field experiments with process based crop growth models it is possible to capture the interacting effects of farmers intra seasonal irrigation decision making stochastic weather conditions and physical and socio economic water supply constraints on seasonal crop yield response to water a recent review and application through aquacrop os on how to simulate crop water production functions using field experiments and process based agronomic models is available in foster and brozović 2018 we adopt a similar approach in our model where we use the process based gis based environmental policy integrated climate gepic model liu et al 2007 to account for temporal and spatial variability gepic is the distributed gis version of epic the calibration results for the crop water production functions of irrigated crops in the sld are available in section 4 1 1 note that the production functions adopted in our paper are local and only have validity in the context of the area where they have been developed the variable costs function c i y i w i adopts a linear form with respect of yield in kg ha as follows 21 c i y i w i e i y i w i f i variable costs include plants and seeds fertilizers phytosanitary products spare parts and repair services subcontracting hired labor and other supplies although national statistics only report two measures of variable costs per year and crop under rainfed and irrigated agriculture variable costs will typically be higher lower the higher lower the yield e g more labor during harvest we adjust the crop water production function to account for this by making the variable costs of crop i a linear function of yield with a fixed f i a parameter representing the minimum threshold for variable costs and a variable e i component calculated as follows 22 e i c i i r r i g a t e d c i r a i n f e d max y i w i m i n y i w i 23 f i c i r a i n f e d where c i i r r i g a t e d are the average values of

and c i r a i n f e d equal 0 risk avoidance z 2 is obtained as the profit variability measured through the variance and covariance matrix attached to the profit maximizing combination of land x and water inputs w minus the profit variability attached to the land x and water input w allocation chosen by the agent recall attributes are defined so that more is better gómez limón et al 2016 24 z 2 x w x t v c v π w x x t v c v π w x where v c v π w is the variance and covariance matrix of the gross variable margin and π is a vector that contains the per hectare gross margin of each crop π i note that information on yields under deficit irrigation for the crops in the sld is available for a maximum of two years while this makes possible to calibrate a crop water production function y i w i using a combination of field data and agronomic model simulations peña haro et al 2014 see section 4 1 insufficient longitudinal data on crop yield for alternative water application levels precludes the calculation of a variance and covariance matrix that differentiates between crop and water application levels alternatively we can obtain the variance and covariance matrix using observed longitudinal data on yield per crop available in official statistics which is obtained as total irrigated rainfed if observed crop production at an agricultural district level divided by the surface of that irrigated rainfed crop in that agricultural district i e without distinguishing water application levels this means we have only one two if the series is available for both rainfed and irrigated technique longitudinal series per crop instead of one longitudinal series per crop and water application level thus risk avoidance is assumed to be the same for different levels of water applied for the same crop this is a limitation of the model that can only be addressed with additional longitudinal data that is currently unavailable hired labor avoidance z 3 is measured as the difference between the labor requirements of the profit maximizing combination of land x and water inputs w minus the labor requirements of the alternative simulated land x and water input w

calibration of the crop water production functions crop water production functions for annual crops in the sld namely wheat barley corn onion garlic were generated combining field data and agronomic simulations using the gepic model liu et al 2007 building on previous work by peña haro et al 2014 in the sld gepic is a distributed version of the epic model williams et al 1983 through a loose coupling between arcgis and the epic model in our application to the sld gepic was calibrated using the outcomes of field experiments that assessed the effect of water applied on the yield of annual crops field experiments were conducted in 2000 and 2009 growing seasons at the experimental station las tiesas in the sld fabeiro cortés et al 2003 itap 2005 paired values of crop yield per level of applied water in the field experiments v modelled yield were compared using regression analysis in order to calibrate the production functions crop responses to different water application values in the different type of soils and climatic areas were simulated in order to generate enough variability to fit the coefficients of the crop water production functions note that since the production of corn and onion is considered unfeasible under rainfed agriculture in the sld the d parameter adopts a negative value for these crops since there are no process based agronomic models that simulate ligneous crops crop water production functions for ligneous crops in the sld almond were directly calibrated from observed data using the results of deficit irrigation field experiments developed by the itap near the sld area jiménez et al 2004 accordingly crop water production functions for almond trees do not account for the complex impact and variability of different factors governing crop growth and yield other than water we consider nonetheless that having a production function with limitations is preferrable to ignoring a relevant crop in the case study area and therefore have chosen to include this production function in the model calibration results for the crop water production functions in the sld are reported in the table 3 the table also reports the correlation between the values estimated with the agronomic model and the ones simulated with the quadratic function the values range from 0 worst performance of the quadratic function to 1 best performance peña haro et al 2010 the reader is referred to peña haro et al 2014 for a more detailed discussion of the results methods and a discussion on the precision of the calibrated model 4 1 2 pmuap model calibration pmaup model calibration results and residuals for the sld are shown in table 4 the columns α 1 α 2 and α 3 display the parameter values of the cobb douglas utility function for the attributes profit z 1 risk avoidance z 2 and hired labor avoidance z 3 while e m is the average calibration residual calibration results show that the most relevant attribute driving agents decisions is profit risk avoidance has also a relevant role in explaining the behavior of irrigators in the sld the attribute measuring management complexity avoidance z 3 is marginally relevant caution must be exercised in interpreting the results for example it cannot be inferred that a high risk avoidance parameter will yield a low profit variability since choices are ultimately constrained by the feasible region nonetheless attribute parameters offer valuable insights on agent s preferences and can serve to project behavior provided calibration errors are low in the case of the sld metrics for performance evaluation are satisfactory with a very low average calibration residual pérez blanco et al 2015 4 2 simulation results we simulate a progressive increase of water prices in the sld from 0 to 1 eur m3 at 0 01 eur m3 intervals for each simulation run we obtain the crop portfolio and water application responses by irrigators and calculate the compensating variation i e monetized foregone utility foregone income and water saved simulations are run using the model setting described in section 3 which integrates the crop water production function of irrigated crops into the objective function and allows for adjustments at the intensive extensive and super extensive margin w pmaup the results thus obtained are subsequently compared with those from an alternative classic pmaup model setting c pmaup where the continuous agronomic production functions are substituted by point values that represent average expected production under irrigated and or rainfed agriculture for each crop i e a maximum of two points per crop thus allowing only for extensive and super extensive margin adjustments pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 the difference between the modeling outcomes from these two model settings reveals the net effect of intensive margin adjustments on the expected economic and environmental performance of water pricing note that only the w pmaup model is calibrated the c pmaup model uses the same parameters obtained for the w pmaup with different crop water production functions point values representing crop yield under rainfed and irrigated agriculture instead of continuous crop water production function if we calibrated both models separately considering a continuous production function for the w pmaup and point values for the c pmaup calibration results would differ both because of the alternative model settings and because of the different data inputs in reality though intensive margin adjustments are a feasible option which is indeed frequently adopted by farmers in the sld and elsewhere meaning that any model calibrated on a database that excludes this option would incur in data measurement errors therefore we use a single database the one closer to observed irrigators decisions which includes continuous agronomic crop water production functions and once the model is calibrated w pmaup we replace the continuous agronomic production functions by point values c pmaup to compare simulation outcomes with both settings and thus reveal the net effect of intensive margin adjustments fig 3 and fig 4 represent agents responses to incremental water pricing under the w pmaup and c pmaup model settings in terms of land allocation to alternative crops extensive and super extensive margin adjustments both model settings show similar responses in every simulation run see fig 3 albeit dissimilarities arise regarding water application to crops intensive water adjustment fig 4 under the w pmaup model setting agents can respond to higher prices by progressively decreasing the amount of water applied to irrigated crops deficit irrigation deficit irrigation is observed in the w pmaup model for all crops with the exception of garlic the most profitable crop in the case study area which is fully irrigated in all simulations and water intensive corn for which irrigation abruptly stops in both models after a charge increase of 0 13 eur m3 on the other hand in the c pmaup model agents are constrained to apply water in fixed proportions to land meaning that intensive margin adjustments are not possible and crops receive a constant amount of water inputs until abruptly interrupting irrigation and shifting to rainfed agriculture according to graveline and mérel 2014 there are three critical factors conditioning intensive margin adjustments i water intensity water intensive crops are those that can contribute more significantly towards water saving ii yield elasticity to water use the higher yield elasticity to water use the lower deficit irrigation is observed and iii profitability crops with higher profit will be less affected by deficit irrigation it can be observed that these three factors explain water application responses to pricing in the w pmaup model setting garlic the most profitable crop can afford a price increase of up to 1 eur m3 without applying deficit irrigation i e a 600 1000 increase in the volumetric cost of water as compared to the observed groundwater pumping costs of 0 1 0 20 eur m3 while in the case of onion the second most profitable crop water applied per hectare remains constant until a charge increase of 0 78 eur m3 a 490 780 water cost increase at which point onion is replaced by other crops with deficit irrigation briefly applied in the interim barley and wheat are the crops with the lowest yield elasticity to water use accordingly deficit irrigation is observed from the initial water price increases until both crops eventually shift to rainfed agriculture which happens at a water charge increase of 0 19 barley and 0 44 eur m3 wheat almond starts deficit irrigation in the initial simulation runs with a slight rebound at a 0 12 eur m3 price increase due to a substitution effect with corn in the case of corn the high yield elasticity to water application overtakes all the other effects meaning that irrigated corn is abruptly substituted by less water intensive crops without intermediary deficit irrigation at a charge increase of 0 12 eur m3 the possibility to adapt at the intensive margin in the w pmaup setting means crop yield per hectare is not constant anymore across the alternative price simulations as happens in models where water input is applied in fixed proportions to land c pmaup setting fig 5 shows how different water application choices affect yield in kg ha for each crop under the w pmaup model setting for those crops that can be cultivated under rainfed agriculture wheat barley and almond irrigation water is progressively diminished and yield reduces until irrigation stops altogether and yield equates that under rainfed agriculture fig 6 shows the water demand curve representing the relationship between water prices and water application for both the w pmaup and c pmaup model settings simulation results using the c pmaup model setting displays a jumpy behavior with quasi inelastic responses in the initial and final stretches of the demand function this outcome is consistent with those coming from the literature on agricultural water pricing under scarcity where the model structures adopted also ignore deficit irrigation intensive margin adjustments on the other hand the w pmaup model setting that allows for deficit irrigation displays a gradual reduction in water use along with higher prices in the initial and middle stretches of the demand function and a quasi inelastic response for a price increase of 0 43 eur m3 or higher this result suggests that having or not quasi inelastic responses in the initial and middle stretches of the demand function is conditional on the model structure settings choice the upshot is that where intensive margin adaptation responses are possible in the model water pricing is cost effective towards water saving in the initial stretches of the demand function which thus far have been often assumed to be inelastic for example a price increase of 0 09 eur m3 which represents a non trivial price increase of 45 90 in the sld is ineffective towards water saving in the c pmaup but can save up to 390 m3 ha 11 of the average water application of 3606 m3 ha in the w pmaup model setting in addition quasi inelastic responses in the final stretches of the demand function while appearing in both model settings emerge at higher prices in the w pmaup from 0 43 eur m3 as compared to the c pmaup model setting from 0 25 eur m3 fig 7 reports the economic impact of higher prices in terms of foregone profit a and the monetized utility loss or compensating variation b i e the amount of money the irrigator would need to achieve his initial utility following price increases the compensating variation is consistently higher for the c pmaup model setting in all simulations indicating a larger utility loss as compared to the w pmaup model setting which is particularly visible in the charge increase interval between 0 1 eur m3 and 0 4 eur m3 between 1 and 8 higher compensating variation in the c pmaup than in the w pmaup model setting a similar outcome is observed for the foregone profit which again is higher in the c pmaup model setting up to 0 4 eur m3 increase with a marked gap in the 0 1 eur m3 0 4 eur m3 interval between 0 7 and 8 3 higher foregone income in the c pmaup than in the w pmaup model setting the superior economic performance under the w pmaup setting is attributable to the increased number of adaptive responses available in the w pmaup as compared to the c pmaup and reveals the net effect of intensive margin adjustments on economic outputs 5 conclusion this paper integrates a continuous crop water production function into a pmaup model to assess the influence of intensive margin adjustments on the expected water saving and economic performance of water pricing the model is calibrated for an agricultural area in a water scarce agricultural area in southeastern spain el salobral los llanos in the júcar river basin so to factor in climatic soil and other local factors conditioning the crop yield water input relationship results reveal non trivial dissimilarities in the economic and water saving performance of the w pmaup intensive extensive and super extensive margin adjustments and c pmaup only extensive and super extensive margin adjustments model settings the quasi inelastic responses in the initial and middle stretches of the c pmaup demand function which are consistent with findings in the literature on water charges in water scarce areas are transformed into elastic responses in the w pmaup suggesting a more cost effective contribution of water pricing towards water saving ignoring intensive margin adjustments also tends to overestimate the economic impact of water pricing with a higher foregone profit and compensating variation obtained in the c pmaup model setting as compared to the w pmaup model setting in all simulation runs the compensating variation foregone profit is up to 1 8 0 7 8 3 higher in the c pmaup than in the w pmaup model setting for the water price increase range 80 200 given that deficit irrigation is a commonly used adaptation response in the sld we argue that ignoring it may not accurately reflect the actual adaptation options available to irrigators and recommend the use of wpm that integrate crop water production functions the model proposed in this paper can be improved in several ways future efforts should aim at gathering longitudinal data on yields for alternative water application levels with high granularity through remote sensing surveys field experiments or other means so to build increasingly accurate site specific crop water production functions and more detailed utility relevant attributes e g through the development of a variance and covariance matrix that differentiates between crop types and water application in the risk avoidance attribute this will facilitate the application of the model and replication of the experiments elsewhere a prerequisite to validate the preliminary findings obtained for our case study area in the sld note that although calibration residuals are low in the case study area performance may be less satisfactory elsewhere which calls for exploring alternative additional attributes e g alternative definitions of the management complexity avoidance attribute and more comprehensive and spatially detailed data such as water use data to better define the feasible region e g leveraging on earth observation and in situ monitoring digital data acquisition and management and predictive analytics furthermore other input e g fertilizer could be introduced in the production function to consider other aspects of the complex mechanism that govern crop growth and yield even though this goes beyond the object of this paper which is to test the performance of a crop water production function in saving water through pricing building multi model ensemble experiments combining multiple wpm that allow for intensive margin adjustments can help us sample modeling uncertainty and establish confidence intervals for the environmental and economic performance of alternative water conservation policies sapino et al 2020 beyond multi model ensembles decision making should be also informed by multiple scenarios that complement the pricing simulations in our model which may in turn reveal far reaching and under recognized implications for our policy pannell 2006 for example our findings rely on the assumption that both water charges and water allocations are effectively enforced however where agents can resort to alternative sources of water e g through illegal aquifer withdrawals higher charges may lead to an increase in the use of alternative sources which calls for complementary policies such as use of remote sensing and penalties in the case of water theft loch et al 2020b coupling the proposed pmaup model with a hydrologic model and a river basin management model is also necessary to assess the environmental impacts of water conservation across space thus supporting the identification of potential distributive issues e g upstream v downstream water conservation finally accurate estimates on the environmental and resource costs of water are needed to design realistic water pricing scenarios that substitute the hypothesized scenarios adopted in our simulations albeit these costs are at present difficult to obtain given that there are few standardized methods to measure the

strongly affected by the irrigation treatments the fit treatment had a value of 2 for cumulative sie indicating that this treatment was rarely exposed to drought water stress the results showed that irrigation and early planting date together had synergistic effects on grain yield delaying planting dates for the fit led to yield reduction of 1 3 and 11 after planting dates of april 30 may 10 and

important food all around the world the maize cultivation region ranges from arid and semi arid to humid and semi humid areas expanded in both hemispheres ramirez cabral et al 2017 the united states is one of the largest maize producer countries and the majority of maize production in the united states corn belt is grown under rainfed conditions except in nebraska where a substantial portion of maize land area is irrigated for quantifying maize response to water to develop effective management practices as well as projections it is important to develop the relationships between yield and weather variables which can vary significantly between the regions kent et al 2017 the studies between relationships of maize productivity versus environmental weather variables can be quantified accurately with field measurements which can be time consuming expensive and difficult however field measurements have an essential function to run crop models and to verify the simulation accuracy of

biomass lai water use efficiency and soil water content the model evaluation was satisfactory with rmsen ranging from 1 9 to 25 3 rugira et al 2021 marek et al 2017 simulated yield and lai by ceres maize model and the results for the fully irrigated treatments yield and lai were acceptable however there was a considerable overestimation of yield and lai in the limited irrigation treatments representing a potential deficiency in the model s water stress algorithms another research indicated that the ceres maize model could simulate growth and grain yield accurately with less than 10 difference between simulated and observed values in no water deficit plots however in water deficit treatments the model performed poorly and underestimated the grain yield up to 15 biomass up to 23 and lai up to 26 for maximum lai saseendran et al 2008 due to its comprehensive module structure the ceres maize model can be used to quantify drought stress and its potential impacts on crop growth development and yield drought stress has been determined by an implemented comparison between plant extractable soil water or soil water uptake and potential demand when the soil dries out due to crop water uptake and evaporation of soil water the soil water conductivity declines in dssat models the drought stress index for leaf expansion sie is initiated when the proportion between potential root water for uptake and potential evapotranspiration ratio is less than 1 5 however if this proportion is reduced to a value less than 1 0 the drought stress index for photosynthesis sip and biomass production is initiated ritchie 1998 in fact crop functions such as growth and assimilated production are estimated at their optimum levels unless limited factors such as nitrogen air temperature or water deficit are present soler et al 2013 used dssat to evaluate relationships between yield sie and sip for peanut they found that cumulative drought stress indices for photosynthesis and leaf expansion are inversely related to simulated yield they suggested that before harvest maturity for simulating potential harvestable yield a calculated value of the cumulative drought stress could be a helpful method there is a lack of literature regarding the performance of the ceres maize model under full and limited irrigation and rainfed conditions in the midwestern united states and in regions with similar climate and soil characteristics and soil and crop management practices the objectives of this research were to i calibrate and validate the ceres maize model under full irrigation limited irrigation and rainfed conditions and evaluate the model performance for simulating crop parameters such as grain yield above ground biomass lai and soil water content swc using long term field measured data ii simulate sip sie and investigate the relationships between sip and sie vs grain yield using long term field measured datasets and iii quantify and analyze the impact of planting date on simulated grain yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions using long term 35 yr climate data 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of field experiments experimental details were outlined in irmak 2015a b and were not repeated here briefly datasets from a long term six years 2005 2010 field research that was conducted and reported by irmak 2015a b were used to evaluate the ceres maize model performance the field research was conducted in the irmak research laboratory irl advanced crop production evapotranspiration and climate vs crop water productivity field research facilities at the university of nebraska lincoln unl south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 43 n and 98 8 w at an altitude of 552 asl near clay center nebraska usa irmak 2015a b experimental data were collected during growing seasons from 2005 to 2010 based on completely randomized block design with three replications of each treatment and the same management practices in the same field the soil in the experimental field was a hastings silt loam 15 sand 65 silt and 20 clay with 2 5 organic matter with water holding characteristics of 0 34 m3 m 3 field capacity 0 14 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point and 0 53 m3 m 3 saturation point typical effective rooting depth of maize in the study area was usually between 1 20 and 1 50 m irmak 2015a b the experimental field was irrigated using a variable rate center pivot irrigation system irrigation was triggered based on the soil water content of fit in all years four water regimes were imposed rainfed control fully irrigated treatment fit and limited irrigation treatments 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit with the exception in 2005 where only fit and rainfed treatments were imposed irmak 2015a various plant measurements including lai and above ground biomass were taken during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons and grain yield phenological stage observations and soil water content measurements were done in all seasons from all treatments the volumetric soil water content swc was measured at rooting depth 0 1 5 m on a weekly or biweekly basis in all years and in all treatments using a model 4300 neutron attenuation soil moisture meter troxler electronics laboratories inc research triangle park north carolina usa a total of 280 241 132 51 178 and 127 mm of irrigation was applied in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 to fit respectively irmak 2015a b 2 2 ceres maize model the ceres maize model v4 7 is a deterministic model that is capable of simulating the effects of rainfed and irrigation conditions planting date and other management practices and environmental variables on maize growth and yield hoogenboom et al 2017 it considers crop development in relation to rainfed and irrigation conditions leaf area growth daily plant growth rate biomass accumulation and partitioning to plant organs in the model photosynthesis is simulated by using the radiation use efficiency method the priestly taylor equation is used for simulation of evapotranspiration in the model jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 ceres maize model was calibrated using experimental data of 2009 to predict phenology lai and above ground biomass grain yield and final biomass under different water management the model was validated by using experimental data from 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons dataset required to calibrate the ceres maize model for genetic coefficients of the cultivar for ceres maize model included date of emergence days after planting to flowering and maturity day lai above ground biomass final biomass and grain yield since this study was focused on irrigation treatments other parameters such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and their relationships with crops were considered within an optimum condition these genetic coefficients of the ceres maize model were thermal time from seedling emergence to end of juvenile stage p1 photoperiod sensitivity coefficient p2 thermal time growing degree days from silking to physiological maturity p5 maximum possible number of kernels per plant g2 potential grain filling rate g3 and interval in thermal time between successive leaf tip appearance phint for drought stress indices the proportion between potential root water uptake and evapotranspiration as defined by ritchie 1998 was considered the proportion less than 1 5 showed drought stress factors for stem and leaf expansion while the proportion less than 1 0 represented drought stress factors for biomass production and photosynthesis if drought stress continues when no additional water is added to the soil profile through irrigation and or precipitation consequently the proportion value can reach zero and sometimes model simulates crop failure in such cases the total cumulative drought stress index for leaf expansion sie and photosynthesis sip indices were presented as drought stress indexes for each growing season day considered a value of 0 referred to no water stress crop conditions while the value of 1 referred to severe stress during the growing season from planting to harvest the total cumulative drought stress index was computed by summing the daily values for each drought stress index in this research the relationships between grain yield and the sie and sip indices for all years were developed and analyzed based on the model output in addition to conducting extensive performance analyses of ceres maize for simulating grain yield crop growth and development lai biomass and phenology with respect to field measured data validated ceres maize model was also employed to assess climate impacts on grain yield and interactive effects of fit irrigation and rainfed on grain yield and physiological maturity of maize using 35 years 1985 2020 of measured weather data daily weather data for these analyses were obtained from the high plains regional climate center automated weather data network for the weather station that was located only about 2 km from the experimental field grain yields and physiological maturity of maize were simulated for four planting dates with 10 days intervals i e april 20 april 30 may 10 and may 20 cumulative frequency plots over 35 years were used to present the results of simulated yields and duration of growing cycle number of days from planting to physiological maturity grain yield over 35 years for each planting date rainfed and irrigation management were calculated and analyzed 2 3 model evaluation the model accuracy was determined by several statistical indicators such as student s t test p t coefficient of determination r2 relative error or percent error pe root mean squared error rmse and normalized root mean squared error rmsen if the results of p values from the t test were greater than 0 05 it means that the simulation values at the 95 probability level were similar to the actual field measured values the eqs 1 3 were used to calculate pe rmse and rmsen values respectively 1 p e p i o i o i 100 2 rmse rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 3 rmse n rmse σ 100 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated values respectively ō is the average of the observed values and n is number of treatments in each experimental year pe value approaching zero indicated better model performance the rmse values extended from zero to infinity and when these values were close to zero residual estimation errors decreased the simulation results were considered to be the most satisfactory if the rmsen was minimal moreover for rmsen values less than 10 between 10 and 20 between 20 and 30 and more than 30 the model simulations were considered as excellent good fair and poor respectively nasim et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions measured daily meteorological variables for the study area during the six growing seasons 2005 2010 are shown in fig 1 the annual total precipitation values were 496 546 996 1030 601 and 806 mm in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively but the total precipitation in growing seasons i e from early may to late september early october were 291 393 474 503 367 and 560 mm for 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons respectively which represented 59 72 46 51 60 and 70 of the annual total precipitation amounts for the same years respectively substantial variations in precipitation and other climate variables between the growing seasons resulted in different crop irrigation requirements crop water use growth and physiological maturity which also provided unique opportunities to evaluate the model performance in various climatic conditions at the end of september or early october maize usually reaches its physiological maturity and seasonal precipitation decreases between planting to silking periods the maximum mean air temperature was observed as 21 7 c in 2006 and the minimum was 18 1 c in 2009 3 2 plant growth and development phenology lai and above ground biomass some of the specific parameters of the maize hybrid used in all growing seasons mycogen genotype that generated from the calibration experiments in 2009 are presented in table 1 after model calibration comparisons were made between observed and simulated values statistical analysis carried out over measured and ceres maize simulated days after planting to flowering dapf and maturity day dapm and the results for all growing seasons are presented in table 2 the pe of days for phenological phases ranged from 9 to 4 for dapf and from 12 to 14 for dapm table 2 the rmse for dapf and dapm were 3 and 13 days respectively on the other hand the rmsen for dapf and dapm were 4 and 8 respectively the p values of paired t test showed that there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the measured and simulated dapf or dapm values the close agreement between the observed and simulated values for dapf and dapm showed that mycogen cultivar was compatible enough to the phenological parameters that were assigned and used in the ceres maize model andrea et al 2018 used the dssat model to simulate the phenology of six maize producing zones in brazil the rmses were 1 7 days for days to anthesis and 0 21 days for days to maturity although the results of simulated values were satisfactory for days for anthesis a greater deviation was observed for days for maturity which could create challenges for accurately simulating crop and soil water variables and crop yield in a study in which the ceres maize model was calibrated and validated by malik and dechmi 2019 in spain a good rmse was obtained between observed and simulated values with less than 7 days and rmsen with less than 8 for anthesis and physiological maturity adnan et al 2020 used the ceres maize model under field experiments for 16 maize varieties in northern nigeria the rmse values for simulation of anthesis days ranged from 0 38 to 1 22 for calibration and from 0 62 to 1 12 days for validation song and jin 2020 reported that under full irrigation management pes for dapf and dapm were between 3 6 and 0 2 respectively they also reported that the ceres maize model had a close simulation of days after planting to flowering in the current study the ceres maize model was calibrated using experimental data of 2009 to simulate lai and above ground biomass under rainfed and all irrigation management treatments the progression of simulated and observed lai for all treatments is presented in fig 2 the calibration of the lai showed that the best simulation was obtained for the rainfed treatments with a normalized rmsen of 17 while the highest rmsen of 22 was obtained for the 60 fit treatment table 3 the simulated lai values had a strong correlation with the observed data during calibration in general the simulated lai values were close to the observed values from planting to maturity the model simulated above ground biomass with good accuracy for the rainfed and water management treatments under calibration conditions with rmsen values ranging from 14 to 22 with the closest simulation results to the measure data for the rainfed and fit table 3 the model also simulated the above ground biomass under rainfed and all irrigation management treatments quite well fig 3 the ceres maize model was validated for simulating lai and above ground biomass using experimental data of 2010 for the rainfed and irrigated treatments statistical results of the model for lai table 4 showed that r2 was high 0 87 accompanied with the moderate rmsen values ranging from 9 to 17 indicating that the model simulated the lai accurately fig 4 the statistical analyses results for above ground biomass are shown in table 4 high values of r2 0 89 and low to moderate rmsen values 5 16 indicate that the ceres maize model simulated the above ground biomass accurately during the validation for rainfed and water management treatments fig 5 paired t test results indicated that there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the measured and simulated lai values or above ground biomass under rainfed limited or full irrigation management tables 3 and 4 the model s robustness is an important performance indicator and in this study the model robustness was inferred from its consistency in simulating the aforementioned variables between the years with different climatic conditions and different irrigation management in terms of timing and irrigation water amount applied fig 6 compared simulated and observed lai as well as simulated and observed above ground biomass for pooled dataset from all years for calibration and validation for reference the 1 1 line plus and minus the standard error se of the measured variables is also shown in fig 6 nearly 86 of the above ground biomass and 75 of the lai data points fell within the plus and minus se lines of measured values the high accuracy pertaining to simulation of lai and above ground biomass by the model was indicated by the following statistical indices rmsen values of 17 for lai and 16 for above ground biomass r2 values of 0 79 for lai and 0 95 for above ground biomass it was noted in fig 6 that for both lai and above ground biomass the model simulation accuracy performance increased with increasing lai and above ground biomass values overall the model simulation performance when considering calibration and validation datasets is considered to be accurate the results of this current study are in agreement in part with previous studies carried out by nouna et al 2000 who suggested that the functions describing leaf growth and senescence could be modified to improve the simulation of lai for specific environments ran et al 2020 evaluated the ceres maize model to simulate lai and above ground biomass under different irrigation levels and observed that the simulated values were in good agreement with the observed data soler et al 2007 evaluated the ceres maize to simulate growth development for four different maturity maize hybrids in brazil under rainfed and irrigated conditions the results showed that rmsen for lai ranged from 10 to 24 4 and it ranged from 10 to 32 9 for above ground biomass another research conducted by mubeen et al 2016 with the same model under limited and non limited water conditions in a semiarid climate of pakistan showed that there was a satisfactory agreement between measured and simulated values with simulation error ranging from 17 9 to 20 for lai and from 9 2 to 14 3 for above ground biomass 3 3 grain yield the calibration of the model for grain yield simulations resulted in strong performance with rmse rmsen and r2 values of 0 36 t ha 3 and 0 98 respectively table 5 in the calibration period the measured grain yield varied from 9 05 t ha for rainfed treatment to 15 51 t ha for fit in 2009 while the simulated grain yield values followed the measured values closely and varied from 9 27 t ha for rainfed treatment to 14 8 t ha for fit table 5 the simulation error for grain yield varied from 5 in fit negative sign represents underestimation to 3 in rainfed positive sign represents overestimation the measured and simulated grain yield table 6 had a wide range between the years for the same treatments and within the years between the treatments and varied from 4 7 to 14 8 t ha for rainfed and from 6 54 to 15 45 t ha for fit in 2005 from 6 4 to 15 2 t ha for rainfed and from 6 75 to 17 55 t ha for fit in 2006 from 8 7 to 14 8 t ha for rainfed and from 8 12 to 11 57 t ha for fit in 2007 from 13 9 to 16 1 t ha for rainfed and from 12 01 to 15 16 for fit in 2008 and from 11 8 to 15 4 t ha for rainfed and from 10 42 to 15 82 t ha for fit in 2010 the average observed grain yield for six growing seasons ranged from 8 88 t ha for the rainfed treatment to 15 2 t ha for the fit simulated grain yield average of six years was close to the measured values ranging from 9 31 t ha for the rainfed condition to 14 90 t ha for the fit fig 7 grain yield had a linear and strong correlation with irrigation amount plus precipitation with r2 values of 0 96 the percent deviation in simulating grain yield was 5 for the rainfed 3 for the 50 fit 4 for the 60 fit 1 for the 75 fit and 2 for the fit the rmse of 0 38 t ha and rmsen of 3 indicate that model had an acceptable performance for simulating grain yield fig 8 in comparison of grain yield for the rainfed and limited irrigation treatments with the fit grain yield showed a reduction by 42 12 8 and 3 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit and 75 fit respectively while the simulated grain yield represented a reduction by 38 12 9 and 1 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit and 75 fit respectively the simulated grain yield reductions were comparable to those measured values indicating that the ceres maize model was able to simulate the grain yield reduction due to water stress accurately which was revealed by the statistics related to the model performance araya et al 2017 evaluated water limited cropping systems using the same model under different irrigation levels in western kansas the observed and simulated values of maize yield from model evaluation had rmsen of 14 3 and r2 of 0 81 simulation study of grain yield using the ceres maize model conducted by malik and dechmi 2019 resulted in rmse of 607 694 kg ha and rmsen of 4 5 for calibration and rmse of 622 679 kg ha and rmsen of 5 for validation the aforementioned simulation results for grain yield were more accurate than those reported by ran et al 2020 r2 0 34 and kisekka et al 2016 rmsen 9 21 who reported lower model performance based on the calibration and validation results of the ceres maize model in this study there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the model satisfactorily simulated maize grain yield for the rainfed limited irrigation and full irrigation settings under these experimental conditions 3 4 soil water content calibration results for soil water content swc are shown in table 7 simulated swc values moderately agreed with measured values with r2 values ranging from 0 46 to 0 78 the model also showed that the most accuracy in simulating swc was pertained to the fit treatment calibrated rmsen 4 and rmse 0 01 m3 m 3 fig 9 exhibits simulated values of swc by ceres maize under different irrigation treatments the results showed that the ceres maize model had the least accuracy in simulating the soil water content under rainfed conditions while the accuracy of simulations increased with reduction in drought stress from limited irrigation to fit as swc increases fig 9 the evaluation results of the ceres maize model for swc for the validation conditions are shown in table 8 the rmse values ranged from 0 01 m3 m 3 to 0 05 m3 m 3 and the rmsen ranged from 5 to 21 the r2 values showed a wide range between the treatments ranging from 0 09 to 0 71 the model validation results for the swc were presented only for the rainfed treatment fig 10 and fit fig 11 as was the case with the calibration results the model s accuracy was the best when simulating swc trends and magnitudes in the fit and least accuracy was in the rainfed treatment during all experimental years this is due to uncertainty and variability in soil water dynamics and plant growth and water uptake relationships that are influenced by variability and nonuniformity in wetting and rewetting and drying cycles in soil water in the rainfed and limited irrigation treatments as compared with more uniform wetting and drying cycles and plant water uptake in the fit despite high spatio temporal variability of the swc simulations the overall swc trends were simulated with marginal to poor accuracy these marginal agreements between simulated and observed swc indicated that ceres maize could potentially be a capable tool to schedule irrigation for maize after further calibration and validation and adjustment in the model s soil and water parameters swc was simulated using ceres maize model by ran et al 2020 with an rmsen of 14 and r2 of 0 69 in another research zhang et al 2021 investigated swc trends and magnitudes using the ceres maize model for different irrigation treatments in colorado usa the statistical results over the observed and simulated values of swc by model showed the rmsen of 15 and r2 of 0 47 song and jin 2020 found that ceres maize was acceptable to simulate swc under optimum conditions however there was a relatively poor model performance for simulating swc under stressed conditions it was emphasized that improving the model for maize obtain better results under water stress is needed anothai et al 2013 reported that ceres maize model could simulate swc under fully irrigated treatment with sufficient accuracy but poorly simulated swc under rainfed and water stress conditions 3 5 drought stress index the cumulative drought stress index for photosynthesis sip and drought stress index for leaf expansion sie as simulated by the ceres maize model was strongly affected by the irrigation treatments and by the water supply irrigation precipitation the cumulative values of sip at harvest maturity were 27 12 8 5 and 3 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit 75 fit and fit treatments respectively fig 12 the rainfed condition had a cumulative sie of 30 at harvest maturity indicating a substantial exposure to drought conditions which was also evident from significantly reduced grain yield as compared with irrigated treatments especially fit while the 50 fit had a value of 10 which indicates that the plants in this treatment were exposed to drought stress during only a small portion of the growing season fig 13 the fit treatment had a value of 2 for cumulative sie indicating that treatment was rarely exposed to water stress the cumulative sip at maturity was 27 for the rainfed treatment as compared with 30 for the cumulative sie the cumulative values of sip were smaller than for leaf growth expansion based on the inherent method of calculation there was an inverse relationship between the cumulative sip and observed grain yield with an r2 value of 0 99 fig 12 similar results were found for the cumulative sie with an r2 value of 0 97 between this index and the observed grain yield fig 13 there was also an inverse relationship between the cumulative sip and simulated grain yield with an r2 value of 0 97 fig 12 similar results were obtained from analyzing the cumulative sie versus the simulated grain yield r2 0 98 fig 13 soler et al 2013 found that r2 values for the inverse relationship between sip and sie with observed simulated yield were higher than 0 88 which agrees with the results of current study calculating the cumulative drought stress index for photosynthesis sip and drought stress index for leaf expansion sie can be an applicable method to measure drought stress levels the high correlation of the cumulative sip and sie indices with the observed and simulated grain yield represented that the equations and correlation coefficients are useful to evaluate drought stress levels overall this information can be potentially used for determining yield reduction in different irrigation management conditions due to the water stress using ceres maize 3 6 planting date impact on maize yield fig 14 shows 35 year simulated grain yield results as a function of planting dates under rainfed and fit conditions the grain yield probability curves had a considerable spread indicating inter annual variability due to weather conditions the 50 of probability of grain yield under fit was simulated by the model as 15 25 t ha for april 20 14 77 t ha for april 30 14 62 t ha for may 10 and 13 42 t ha for may 20 fig 14a for the rainfed conditions 50 of probability of grain yield was simulated as 11 46 t ha for april 20 10 46 t ha for april 30 9 83 t ha for may 10 and 9 17 t ha for may 20 fig 14b fig 14a shows that grain yields on planting dates of april 20 april 30 and may 10 are somewhat similar while the grain yields for may 20 are significantly different p 0 05 than other planting dates grain yields for planting dates of april 20 april 30 may 10 and may 20 under fit were 14 95 14 79 14 42 and 13 24 t ha respectively table 9 fig 14b shows that grain yields under rainfed on planting dates of april 20 and april 30 were similar to each other while the grain yields for planting dates of may 10 and may 20 were different from others grain yields on planting dates of april 20 april 30 may 10 and may 20 under rainfed were 10 89 10 21 9 78 and 9 11 t ha respectively table 9 delay in planting date under fit resulted in yield reductions of 1 3 and 11 for planting after april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively delay in planting date under rainfed resulted in yield reduction of 6 10 and 18 for planting after april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively delay in planting date from april 20 led to only a slight reduction in yield maize planting date in mid april in the experimental site is usually accompanied by suitable soil temperature for adequate plant emergence and moisture availability from spring precipitation and moisture carried over from winter in the early season that provide favorable conditions full irrigation resulted in increased grain yield and the grain yield in rainfed conditions was reduced by 30 results clearly showed that planting date has a significant effect on maize grain yield when all other factors are equal and that irrigation and early planting date had synergistic effects on grain yield the duration of growing cycle number of days from planting to physiological maturity in rainfed conditions is in the range of 157 167 days while days from planting to harvest in fit are between 160 and 168 air temperature and soil water were the main effects for differences in growing season length under rainfed and fit conditions warmer temperatures accelerate the rate of crop development leading to shorter vegetative and reproductive phases growth duration clearly decreased when planting dates were delayed under rainfed and fit conditions also there were substantial inter annual variations in grain yield due to the differences in climate variables and irrigation timing and amount significant yield reduction was found when planting date was postponed until after late april in mid south us bruns and abbas 2006 which was mainly due to more frequent influence of pest and diseases at late planting long et al 2017 reported that a delay for maize planting date from mid april to mid may led to a significant reduction in yield they also reported that suitable maize planting dates were late april and early may for 40 45 n latitude for the same experimental site in south central nebraska through a comprehensive and detailed research irmak and djaman 2016 investigated the grain yield response to three planting population densities ppd 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 plants per hectare pph and three planting dates may 4 16 and 23 in 2011 and april 24 may 8 and may 17 in 2012 for subsurface drip irrigated fit and rainfed maize production they observed that grain yield increased with increasing ppd relative to the 1st planting date by 15 9 12 2 and 12 7 for the 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 ppd respectively under irrigated conditions and increased by 7 7 2 9 and 5 6 for the same ppds respectively under rainfed overall the impact of planting date on grain yield varied with the ppd and year and with rainfed or irrigated conditions however in general delaying the planting date by every 1 day from may 4 resulted in an average yield increase of 0 043 t ha in a wet year in 2011 and delaying the planting by every 1 day from april 24 resulted in an average yield increase of 0 056 t ha in a dry year in 2012 4 conclusions the aims of this research were achieved by filling the gap in the literature pertaining to the evaluation of the ceres maize model ver 4 7 using long term 2005 2010 field measured data under rainfed limited and full irrigation conditions in the calibration and validation steps the rmsen values of the simulated lai and above ground biomass were in the range of 9 22 and 5 22 respectively the rmse for simulated and observed grain yield ranged between 1 02 and 2 05 t ha and rmsen ranged from 3 to 18 the pe of dapf and dapm ranged from 9 to 4 for dapf and from 12 to 14 for dapm there was a strong agreement between simulated and observed values of lai above ground biomass grain yield and phenological phases under rainfed and irrigation management treatments there was an inverse and strong relationship between the simulated grain yield and cumulative sip and sie determining the sip and sie value prior to reaching harvest maturity could be beneficial in simulating maize grain yield good agreement between simulated and observed swc indicated that ceres maize had the potential for its useful application as tool to schedule irrigation for maize the model needs improvement in terms of simulating water stress impact s on crop growth and development which in turn impact the crop water uptake and swc dynamics thus more accurate simulation of stress timing and magnitude severity can potentially improve the accuracy of crop water uptake and swc trends and magnitudes in the soil profile the planting dates impact on grain yield planting dates with 10 days increments starting from april 20 with 50 of probability of grain yield under fit irrigated conditions was simulated by the model as 15 25 t ha for april 20 14 77 t ha for april 30 14 62 t ha for may 10 and 13 42 t ha for may 20 for the rainfed conditions 50 of probability was simulated as 11 46 t ha for april 20 10 46 t ha for april 30 9 83 t ha for may 10 and 9 17 t ha for may 20 irrigation and early planting date had synergistic effects on grain yield a delay in planting date for the fit led to a yield reduction of 1 3 and 11 after planting dates of april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively a delay in planting date under rainfed led to a greater yield reduction of 6 10 and 18 after planting dates of april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively based on the calibration and validation results of the ceres maize model it can be concluded that the model satisfactorily simulated swc phenological stages lai above ground biomass and grain yield of maize for the rainfed limited irrigation and full irrigation conditions under these experimental conditions moreover the ceres maize model can be a viable tool for simulating various management scenarios for enhancing maize productivity and estimating maize growth and yield response

production the model was calibrated and validated using long term 2005 2010 field measured data under full irrigation treatment fit limited irrigation treatments 50 60 and 75 of fit and rainfed conditions in a transition zone between the subhumid and semi arid climatic region in nebraska usa model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 absolute and normalized root mean squared errors rmse and rmsen respectively between simulated and measured data the rmse between model simulated and observed data for days after planting to flowering dapf and maturity day dapm were 3 and 13 days respectively there was an acceptable agreement between simulated and observed lai rmsen 17 and r2 0 79 and above ground biomass rmsen 16 and r2 0 95 grain yield estimates by the model showed moderately high r2 0 80 and moderate rmsen 3 18 values confirming that the model simulated the grain yield accurately the accuracy of the model in simulating swc in fit conditions was good but with increasing water stress the accuracy decreased the cumulative drought stress index for photosynthesis sip and drought stress index for leaf expansion sie were also simulated and evaluated there was an inverse relationship between grain yield and the sip and sie r2 0 97 indicating the potential applicability of sip and sie for estimating maize grain yield both sip and sie were strongly affected by the irrigation treatments the fit treatment had a value of 2 for cumulative sie indicating that this treatment was rarely exposed to drought water stress the results showed that irrigation and early planting date together had synergistic effects on grain yield delaying planting dates for the fit led to yield reduction of 1 3 and 11 after planting dates of april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively delay in planting date under rainfed led to greater yield reduction of 6 10 and 18 after planting dates of april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively the ceres maize model simulated maize crop parameters relatively accurately under rainfed full and limited irrigation management conditions under the experimental and climatic conditions presented in this study and can be a viable tool for simulating various management scenarios for increasing maize productivity keywords irrigation leaf area index modeling photosynthesis rainfed water stress 1 introduction maize grain is an important food all around the world the maize cultivation region ranges from arid and semi arid to humid and semi humid areas expanded in both hemispheres ramirez cabral et al 2017 the united states is one of the largest maize producer countries and the majority of maize production in the united states corn belt is grown under rainfed conditions except in nebraska where a substantial portion of maize land area is irrigated for quantifying maize response to water to develop effective management practices as well as projections it is important to develop the relationships between yield and weather variables which can vary significantly between the regions kent et al 2017 the studies between relationships of maize productivity versus environmental weather variables can be quantified accurately with field measurements which can be time consuming expensive and difficult however field measurements have an essential function to run crop models and to verify the simulation accuracy of crop models models in general can be considered as a simplified representation of a process or system including agricultural and crop production systems and their interactions with the environment modeling is an expression of a formal mathematical statement or set of statements to describe a process simulation is the process of building models and analyzing the system chakrabarti 2012 crop simulation model is a tool that describes processes of crop growth and development yield and other variables as a function of climate crop phenology irrigation soil characteristics and field management in fact crop modeling can facilitate the investigations related to the estimation of attainable yield long or short term yield forecasting impact assessment of climate change on crop productivity specifying crop rotations optimization of agricultural management such as dates of planting types of variety or genotype irrigation scheduling agricultural water management and nitrogen n fertilizer management numerous crop models have been developed that vary in their simulation input requirements and simulation accuracy dssat decision support system for agro technology transfer is one of the most widely used crop model packages which is able to determine the yield irrigation development growth and n uptake of different crop species the primary goal of dssat is the integration of climate soil crops and management practices for transferring production technology where the location climate crop diversity and soils differ hoogenboom et al 2010 yakoub et al 2017 since crop models developed by dssat are integrated with scientific concepts pertained to soil plant atmosphere relationships they can aid in understanding the impacts of drought stress on plant growth and development soil water deficit and magnitude of plant water stress soil water deficit leads to the potential yield reduction which can be determined by simulating soil water balance and plant water status white and hoogenboom 2010 dssat model has been utilized in various regions of the world for simulation of crop parameters under different climatic conditions quiring and legates 2008 liu et al 2012 kisekka et al 2016 araya et al 2017 yakoub et al 2017 kaur and arora 2018 malik and dechmi 2019 adnan et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 irrigation management kadiyala et al 2015 kisekka et al 2016 araya et al 2017 kaur and arora 2018 malik and dechmi 2019 and fertilizer n management liu et al 2012 yakoub et al 2017 kaur and arora 2018 malik and dechmi 2019 ceres maize which is one of the major modules in dssat has been applied to simulate crop parameters such as leaf area index lai yield and biomass production under different climate soil irrigation and n management conditions the results derived from the simulation of the ceres maize model for maize grown under without stress conditions showed that the model could simulate yield biomass and lai with sufficient precision marek et al 2017 saddique et al 2019 song and jin 2020 attia et al 2021 on the other hand the results of ceres maize model simulations under water stress conditions have been shown to represent larger errors in simulating the yield biomass and lai saseendran et al 2008 dejonge et al 2011 marek et al 2017 song and jin 2020 attia et al 2021 well calibrated and validated crop simulation models are reliable enough for users to apply for long term field experiments which are very costly and in some cases may not be feasible thus crop models can play important role in these and similar situations for the same cropping system e g maize the ceres maize model can perform differently between the regions with similar or different management conditions song and jin 2020 found that ceres maize underestimated the lai and above ground biomass under water stress which could be due to the effects of water stress on photosynthesis which could not be simulated accurately by the model the csm ceres maize model has been applied to assess irrigation strategies for maize in pakistan the model evaluation showed variability of 4 3 11 2 in total dry matter and 15 8 28 7 in grain yield mubeen et al 2016 ceres maize was used in china fenhe basin to determine optimum planting dates and irrigation management for spring maize production the model s performance was evaluated by applying the values of yield biomass lai water use efficiency and soil water content the model evaluation was satisfactory with rmsen ranging from 1 9 to 25 3 rugira et al 2021 marek et al 2017 simulated yield and lai by ceres maize model and the results for the fully irrigated treatments yield and lai were acceptable however there was a considerable overestimation of yield and lai in the limited irrigation treatments representing a potential deficiency in the model s water stress algorithms another research indicated that the ceres maize model could simulate growth and grain yield accurately with less than 10 difference between simulated and observed values in no water deficit plots however in water deficit treatments the model performed poorly and underestimated the grain yield up to 15 biomass up to 23 and lai up to 26 for maximum lai saseendran et al 2008 due to its comprehensive module structure the ceres maize model can be used to quantify drought stress and its potential impacts on crop growth development and yield drought stress has been determined by an implemented comparison between plant extractable soil water or soil water uptake and potential demand when the soil dries out due to crop water uptake and evaporation of soil water the soil water conductivity declines in dssat models the drought stress index for leaf expansion sie is initiated when the proportion between potential root water for uptake and potential evapotranspiration ratio is less than 1 5 however if this proportion is reduced to a value less than 1 0 the drought stress index for photosynthesis sip and biomass production is initiated ritchie 1998 in fact crop functions such as growth and assimilated production are estimated at their optimum levels unless limited factors such as nitrogen air temperature or water deficit are present soler et al 2013 used dssat to evaluate relationships between yield sie and sip for peanut they found that cumulative drought stress indices for photosynthesis and leaf expansion are inversely related to simulated yield they suggested that before harvest maturity for simulating potential harvestable yield a calculated value of the cumulative drought stress could be a helpful method there is a lack of literature regarding the performance of the ceres maize model under full and limited irrigation and rainfed conditions in the midwestern united states and in regions with similar climate and soil characteristics and soil and crop management practices the objectives of this research were to i calibrate and validate the ceres maize model under full irrigation limited irrigation and rainfed conditions and evaluate the model performance for simulating crop parameters such as grain yield above ground biomass lai and soil water content swc using long term field measured data ii simulate sip sie and investigate the relationships between sip and sie vs grain yield using long term field measured datasets and iii quantify and analyze the impact of planting date on simulated grain yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions using long term 35 yr climate data 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of field experiments experimental details were outlined in irmak 2015a b and were not repeated here briefly datasets from a long term six years 2005 2010 field research that was conducted and reported by irmak 2015a b were used to evaluate the ceres maize model performance the field research was conducted in the irmak research laboratory irl advanced crop production evapotranspiration and climate vs crop water productivity field research facilities at the university of nebraska lincoln unl south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 43 n and 98 8 w at an altitude of 552 asl near clay center nebraska usa irmak 2015a b experimental data were collected during growing seasons from 2005 to 2010 based on completely randomized block design with three replications of each treatment and the same management practices in the same field the soil in the experimental field was a hastings silt loam 15 sand 65 silt and 20 clay with 2 5 organic matter with water holding characteristics of 0 34 m3 m 3 field capacity 0 14 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point and 0 53 m3 m 3 saturation point typical effective rooting depth of maize in the study area was usually between 1 20 and 1 50 m irmak 2015a b the experimental field was irrigated using a variable rate center pivot irrigation system irrigation was triggered based on the soil water content of fit in all years four water regimes were imposed rainfed control fully irrigated treatment fit and limited irrigation treatments 75 fit 60 fit and 50 fit with the exception in 2005 where only fit and rainfed treatments were imposed irmak 2015a various plant measurements including lai and above ground biomass were taken during 2009 and 2010 growing seasons and grain yield phenological stage observations and soil water content measurements were done in all seasons from all treatments the volumetric soil water content swc was measured at rooting depth 0 1 5 m on a weekly or biweekly basis in all years and in all treatments using a model 4300 neutron attenuation soil moisture meter troxler electronics laboratories inc research triangle park north carolina usa a total of 280 241 132 51 178 and 127 mm of irrigation was applied in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 to fit respectively irmak 2015a b 2 2 ceres maize model the ceres maize model v4 7 is a deterministic model that is capable of simulating the effects of rainfed and irrigation conditions planting date and other management practices and environmental variables on maize growth and yield hoogenboom et al 2017 it considers crop development in relation to rainfed and irrigation conditions leaf area growth daily plant growth rate biomass accumulation and partitioning to plant organs in the model photosynthesis is simulated by using the radiation use efficiency method the priestly taylor equation is used for simulation of evapotranspiration in the model jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 ceres maize model was calibrated using experimental data of 2009 to predict phenology lai and above ground biomass grain yield and final biomass under different water management the model was validated by using experimental data from 2005 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 growing seasons dataset required to calibrate the ceres maize model for genetic coefficients of the cultivar for ceres maize model included date of emergence days after planting to flowering and maturity day lai above ground biomass final biomass and grain yield since this study was focused on irrigation treatments other parameters such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and their relationships with crops were considered within an optimum condition these genetic coefficients of the ceres maize model were thermal time from seedling emergence to end of juvenile stage p1 photoperiod sensitivity coefficient p2 thermal time growing degree days from silking to physiological maturity p5 maximum possible number of kernels per plant g2 potential grain filling rate g3 and interval in thermal time between successive leaf tip appearance phint for drought stress indices the proportion between potential root water uptake and evapotranspiration as defined by ritchie 1998 was considered the proportion less than 1 5 showed drought stress factors for stem and leaf expansion while the proportion less than 1 0 represented drought stress factors for biomass production and photosynthesis if drought stress continues when no additional water is added to the soil profile through irrigation and or precipitation consequently the proportion value can reach zero and sometimes model simulates crop failure in such cases the total cumulative drought stress index for leaf expansion sie and photosynthesis sip indices were presented as drought stress indexes for each growing season day considered a value of 0 referred to no water stress crop conditions while the value of 1 referred to severe stress during the growing season from planting to harvest the total cumulative drought stress index was computed by summing the daily values for each drought stress index in this research the relationships between grain yield and the sie and sip indices for all years were developed and analyzed based on the model output in addition to conducting extensive performance analyses of ceres maize for simulating grain yield crop growth and development lai biomass and phenology with respect to field measured data validated ceres maize model was also employed to assess climate impacts on grain yield and interactive effects of fit irrigation and rainfed on grain yield and physiological maturity of maize using 35 years 1985 2020 of measured weather data daily weather data for these analyses were obtained from the high plains regional climate center automated weather data network for the weather station that was located only about 2 km from the experimental field grain yields and physiological maturity of maize were simulated for four planting dates with 10 days intervals i e april 20 april 30 may 10 and may 20 cumulative frequency plots over 35 years were used to present the results of simulated yields and duration of growing cycle number of days from planting to physiological maturity grain yield over 35 years for each planting date rainfed and irrigation management were calculated and analyzed 2 3 model evaluation the model accuracy was determined by several statistical indicators such as student s t test p t coefficient of determination r2 relative error or percent error pe root mean squared error rmse and normalized root mean squared error rmsen if the results of p values from the t test were greater than 0 05 it means that the simulation values at the 95 probability level were similar to the actual field measured values the eqs 1 3 were used to calculate pe rmse and rmsen values respectively 1 p e p i o i o i 100 2 rmse rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 3 rmse n rmse σ 100 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated values respectively ō is the average of the observed values and n is number of treatments in each experimental year pe value approaching zero indicated better model performance the rmse values extended from zero to infinity and when these values were close to zero residual estimation errors decreased the simulation results were considered to be the most satisfactory if the rmsen was minimal moreover for rmsen values less than 10 between 10 and 20 between 20 and 30 and more than 30 the model simulations were considered as excellent good fair and poor respectively nasim et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions measured daily meteorological variables for the study area during the six growing seasons 2005 2010 are shown in fig 1 the annual total precipitation values were 496 546 996 1030 601 and 806 mm in 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively but the total precipitation in growing seasons i e from early may to late september early october were 291 393 474 503 367 and 560 mm for 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and 2010 growing seasons respectively which represented 59 72 46 51 60 and 70 of the annual total precipitation amounts for the same years respectively substantial variations in precipitation and other climate variables between the growing seasons resulted in different crop irrigation requirements crop water use growth and physiological maturity which also provided unique opportunities to evaluate the model performance in various climatic conditions at the end of september or early october maize usually reaches its physiological maturity and seasonal precipitation decreases between planting to silking periods the maximum mean air temperature was observed as 21 7 c in 2006 and the minimum was 18 1 c in 2009 3 2 plant growth and development phenology lai and above ground biomass some of the specific parameters of the maize hybrid used in all growing seasons mycogen genotype that generated from the calibration experiments in 2009 are presented in table 1 after model calibration comparisons were made between observed and simulated values statistical analysis carried out over measured and ceres maize simulated days after planting to flowering dapf and maturity day dapm and the results for all growing seasons are presented in table 2 the pe of days for phenological phases ranged from 9 to 4 for dapf and from 12 to 14 for dapm table 2 the rmse for dapf and dapm were 3 and 13 days respectively on the other hand the rmsen for dapf and dapm were 4 and 8 respectively the p values of paired t test showed that there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the measured and simulated dapf or dapm values the close agreement between the observed and simulated values for dapf and dapm showed that mycogen cultivar was compatible enough to the phenological parameters that were assigned and used in the ceres maize model andrea et al 2018 used the dssat model to simulate the phenology of six maize producing zones in brazil the rmses were 1 7 days for days to anthesis and 0 21 days for days to maturity although the results of simulated values were satisfactory for days for anthesis a greater deviation was observed for days for maturity which could create challenges for accurately simulating crop and soil water variables and crop yield in a study in which the ceres maize model was calibrated and validated by malik and dechmi 2019 in spain a good rmse was obtained between observed and simulated values with less than 7 days and rmsen with less than 8 for anthesis and physiological maturity adnan et al 2020 used the ceres maize model under field experiments for 16 maize varieties in northern nigeria the rmse values for simulation of anthesis days ranged from 0 38 to 1 22 for calibration and from 0 62 to 1 12 days for validation song and jin 2020 reported that under full irrigation management pes for dapf and dapm were between 3 6 and 0 2 respectively they also reported that the ceres maize model had a close simulation of days after planting to flowering in the current study the ceres maize model was calibrated using experimental data of 2009 to simulate lai and above ground biomass under rainfed and all irrigation management treatments the progression of simulated and observed lai for all treatments is presented in fig 2 the calibration of the lai showed that the best simulation was obtained for the rainfed treatments with a normalized rmsen of 17 while the highest rmsen of 22 was obtained for the 60 fit treatment table 3 the simulated lai values had a strong correlation with the observed data during calibration in general the simulated lai values were close to the observed values from planting to maturity the model simulated above ground biomass with good accuracy for the rainfed and water management treatments under calibration conditions with rmsen values ranging from 14 to 22 with the closest simulation results to the measure data for the rainfed and fit table 3 the model also simulated the above ground biomass under rainfed and all irrigation management treatments quite well fig 3 the ceres maize model was validated for simulating lai and above ground biomass using experimental data of 2010 for the rainfed and irrigated treatments statistical results of the model for lai table 4 showed that r2 was high 0 87 accompanied with the moderate rmsen values ranging from 9 to 17 indicating that the model simulated the lai accurately fig 4 the statistical analyses results for above ground biomass are shown in table 4 high values of r2 0 89 and low to moderate rmsen values 5 16 indicate that the ceres maize model simulated the above ground biomass accurately during the validation for rainfed and water management treatments fig 5 paired t test results indicated that there was no significant difference p 0 05 between the measured and simulated lai values or above ground biomass under rainfed limited or full irrigation management tables 3 and 4 the model s robustness is an important performance indicator and in this study the model robustness was inferred from its consistency in simulating the aforementioned variables between the years with different climatic conditions and different irrigation management in terms of timing and irrigation water amount applied fig 6 compared simulated and observed lai as well as simulated and observed above ground biomass for pooled dataset from all years for calibration and validation for reference the 1 1 line plus and minus the standard error se of the measured variables is also shown in fig 6 nearly 86 of the above ground biomass and 75 of the lai data points fell within the plus and minus se lines of measured values the high accuracy pertaining to simulation of lai and above ground biomass by the model was indicated by the following statistical indices rmsen values of 17 for lai and 16 for above ground biomass r2 values of 0 79 for lai and 0 95 for above ground biomass it was noted in fig 6 that for both lai and above ground biomass the model simulation accuracy performance increased with increasing lai and above ground biomass values overall the model simulation performance when considering calibration and validation datasets is considered to be accurate the results of this current study are in agreement in part with previous studies carried out by nouna et al 2000 who suggested that the functions describing leaf growth and senescence could be modified to improve the simulation of lai for specific environments ran et al 2020 evaluated the ceres maize model to simulate lai and above ground biomass under different irrigation levels and observed that the simulated values were in good agreement with the observed data soler et al 2007 evaluated the ceres maize to simulate growth development for four different maturity maize hybrids in brazil under rainfed and irrigated conditions the results showed that rmsen for lai ranged from 10 to 24 4 and it ranged from 10 to 32 9 for above ground biomass another research conducted by mubeen et al 2016 with the same model under limited and non limited water conditions in a semiarid climate of pakistan showed that there was a satisfactory agreement between measured and simulated values with simulation error ranging from 17 9 to 20 for lai and from 9 2 to 14 3 for above ground biomass 3 3 grain yield the calibration of the model for grain yield simulations resulted in strong performance with rmse rmsen and r2 values of 0 36 t ha 3 and 0 98 respectively table 5 in the calibration period the measured grain yield varied from 9 05 t ha for rainfed treatment to 15 51 t ha for fit in 2009 while the simulated grain yield values followed the measured values closely and varied from 9 27 t ha for rainfed treatment to 14 8 t ha for fit table 5 the simulation error for grain yield varied from 5 in fit negative sign represents underestimation to 3 in rainfed positive sign represents overestimation the measured and simulated grain yield table 6 had a wide range between the years for the same treatments and within the years between the treatments and varied from 4 7 to 14 8 t ha for rainfed and from 6 54 to 15 45 t ha for fit in 2005 from 6 4 to 15 2 t ha for rainfed and from 6 75 to 17 55 t ha for fit in 2006 from 8 7 to 14 8 t ha for rainfed and from 8 12 to 11 57 t ha for fit in 2007 from 13 9 to 16 1 t ha for rainfed and from 12 01 to 15 16 for fit in 2008 and from 11 8 to 15 4 t ha for rainfed and from 10 42 to 15 82 t ha for fit in 2010 the average observed grain yield for six growing seasons ranged from 8 88 t ha for the rainfed treatment to 15 2 t ha for the fit simulated grain yield average of six years was close to the measured values ranging from 9 31 t ha for the rainfed condition to 14 90 t ha for the fit fig 7 grain yield had a linear and strong correlation with irrigation amount plus precipitation with r2 values of 0 96 the percent deviation in simulating grain yield was 5 for the rainfed 3 for the 50 fit 4 for the 60 fit 1 for the 75 fit and 2 for the fit the rmse of 0 38 t ha and rmsen of 3 indicate that model had an acceptable performance for simulating grain yield fig 8 in comparison of grain yield for the rainfed and limited irrigation treatments with the fit grain yield showed a reduction by 42 12 8 and 3 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit and 75 fit respectively while the simulated grain yield represented a reduction by 38 12 9 and 1 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit and 75 fit respectively the simulated grain yield reductions were comparable to those measured values indicating that the ceres maize model was able to simulate the grain yield reduction due to water stress accurately which was revealed by the statistics related to the model performance araya et al 2017 evaluated water limited cropping systems using the same model under different irrigation levels in western kansas the observed and simulated values of maize yield from model evaluation had rmsen of 14 3 and r2 of 0 81 simulation study of grain yield using the ceres maize model conducted by malik and dechmi 2019 resulted in rmse of 607 694 kg ha and rmsen of 4 5 for calibration and rmse of 622 679 kg ha and rmsen of 5 for validation the aforementioned simulation results for grain yield were more accurate than those reported by ran et al 2020 r2 0 34 and kisekka et al 2016 rmsen 9 21 who reported lower model performance based on the calibration and validation results of the ceres maize model in this study there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the model satisfactorily simulated maize grain yield for the rainfed limited irrigation and full irrigation settings under these experimental conditions 3 4 soil water content calibration results for soil water content swc are shown in table 7 simulated swc values moderately agreed with measured values with r2 values ranging from 0 46 to 0 78 the model also showed that the most accuracy in simulating swc was pertained to the fit treatment calibrated rmsen 4 and rmse 0 01 m3 m 3 fig 9 exhibits simulated values of swc by ceres maize under different irrigation treatments the results showed that the ceres maize model had the least accuracy in simulating the soil water content under rainfed conditions while the accuracy of simulations increased with reduction in drought stress from limited irrigation to fit as swc increases fig 9 the evaluation results of the ceres maize model for swc for the validation conditions are shown in table 8 the rmse values ranged from 0 01 m3 m 3 to 0 05 m3 m 3 and the rmsen ranged from 5 to 21 the r2 values showed a wide range between the treatments ranging from 0 09 to 0 71 the model validation results for the swc were presented only for the rainfed treatment fig 10 and fit fig 11 as was the case with the calibration results the model s accuracy was the best when simulating swc trends and magnitudes in the fit and least accuracy was in the rainfed treatment during all experimental years this is due to uncertainty and variability in soil water dynamics and plant growth and water uptake relationships that are influenced by variability and nonuniformity in wetting and rewetting and drying cycles in soil water in the rainfed and limited irrigation treatments as compared with more uniform wetting and drying cycles and plant water uptake in the fit despite high spatio temporal variability of the swc simulations the overall swc trends were simulated with marginal to poor accuracy these marginal agreements between simulated and observed swc indicated that ceres maize could potentially be a capable tool to schedule irrigation for maize after further calibration and validation and adjustment in the model s soil and water parameters swc was simulated using ceres maize model by ran et al 2020 with an rmsen of 14 and r2 of 0 69 in another research zhang et al 2021 investigated swc trends and magnitudes using the ceres maize model for different irrigation treatments in colorado usa the statistical results over the observed and simulated values of swc by model showed the rmsen of 15 and r2 of 0 47 song and jin 2020 found that ceres maize was acceptable to simulate swc under optimum conditions however there was a relatively poor model performance for simulating swc under stressed conditions it was emphasized that improving the model for maize obtain better results under water stress is needed anothai et al 2013 reported that ceres maize model could simulate swc under fully irrigated treatment with sufficient accuracy but poorly simulated swc under rainfed and water stress conditions 3 5 drought stress index the cumulative drought stress index for photosynthesis sip and drought stress index for leaf expansion sie as simulated by the ceres maize model was strongly affected by the irrigation treatments and by the water supply irrigation precipitation the cumulative values of sip at harvest maturity were 27 12 8 5 and 3 for the rainfed 50 fit 60 fit 75 fit and fit treatments respectively fig 12 the rainfed condition had a cumulative sie of 30 at harvest maturity indicating a substantial exposure to drought conditions which was also evident from significantly reduced grain yield as compared with irrigated treatments especially fit while the 50 fit had a value of 10 which indicates that the plants in this treatment were exposed to drought stress during only a small portion of the growing season fig 13 the fit treatment had a value of 2 for cumulative sie indicating that treatment was rarely exposed to water stress the cumulative sip at maturity was 27 for the rainfed treatment as compared with 30 for the cumulative sie the cumulative values of sip were smaller than for leaf growth expansion based on the inherent method of calculation there was an inverse relationship between the cumulative sip and observed grain yield with an r2 value of 0 99 fig 12 similar results were found for the cumulative sie with an r2 value of 0 97 between this index and the observed grain yield fig 13 there was also an inverse relationship between the cumulative sip and simulated grain yield with an r2 value of 0 97 fig 12 similar results were obtained from analyzing the cumulative sie versus the simulated grain yield r2 0 98 fig 13 soler et al 2013 found that r2 values for the inverse relationship between sip and sie with observed simulated yield were higher than 0 88 which agrees with the results of current study calculating the cumulative drought stress index for photosynthesis sip and drought stress index for leaf expansion sie can be an applicable method to measure drought stress levels the high correlation of the cumulative sip and sie indices with the observed and simulated grain yield represented that the equations and correlation coefficients are useful to evaluate drought stress levels overall this information can be potentially used for determining yield reduction in different irrigation management conditions due to the water stress using ceres maize 3 6 planting date impact on maize yield fig 14 shows 35 year simulated grain yield results as a function of planting dates under rainfed and fit conditions the grain yield probability curves had a considerable spread indicating inter annual variability due to weather conditions the 50 of probability of grain yield under fit was simulated by the model as 15 25 t ha for april 20 14 77 t ha for april 30 14 62 t ha for may 10 and 13 42 t ha for may 20 fig 14a for the rainfed conditions 50 of probability of grain yield was simulated as 11 46 t ha for april 20 10 46 t ha for april 30 9 83 t ha for may 10 and 9 17 t ha for may 20 fig 14b fig 14a shows that grain yields on planting dates of april 20 april 30 and may 10 are somewhat similar while the grain yields for may 20 are significantly different p 0 05 than other planting dates grain yields for planting dates of april 20 april 30 may 10 and may 20 under fit were 14 95 14 79 14 42 and 13 24 t ha respectively table 9 fig 14b shows that grain yields under rainfed on planting dates of april 20 and april 30 were similar to each other while the grain yields for planting dates of may 10 and may 20 were different from others grain yields on planting dates of april 20 april 30 may 10 and may 20 under rainfed were 10 89 10 21 9 78 and 9 11 t ha respectively table 9 delay in planting date under fit resulted in yield reductions of 1 3 and 11 for planting after april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively delay in planting date under rainfed resulted in yield reduction of 6 10 and 18 for planting after april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively delay in planting date from april 20 led to only a slight reduction in yield maize planting date in mid april in the experimental site is usually accompanied by suitable soil temperature for adequate plant emergence and moisture availability from spring precipitation and moisture carried over from winter in the early season that provide favorable conditions full irrigation resulted in increased grain yield and the grain yield in rainfed conditions was reduced by 30 results clearly showed that planting date has a significant effect on maize grain yield when all other factors are equal and that irrigation and early planting date had synergistic effects on grain yield the duration of growing cycle number of days from planting to physiological maturity in rainfed conditions is in the range of 157 167 days while days from planting to harvest in fit are between 160 and 168 air temperature and soil water were the main effects for differences in growing season length under rainfed and fit conditions warmer temperatures accelerate the rate of crop development leading to shorter vegetative and reproductive phases growth duration clearly decreased when planting dates were delayed under rainfed and fit conditions also there were substantial inter annual variations in grain yield due to the differences in climate variables and irrigation timing and amount significant yield reduction was found when planting date was postponed until after late april in mid south us bruns and abbas 2006 which was mainly due to more frequent influence of pest and diseases at late planting long et al 2017 reported that a delay for maize planting date from mid april to mid may led to a significant reduction in yield they also reported that suitable maize planting dates were late april and early may for 40 45 n latitude for the same experimental site in south central nebraska through a comprehensive and detailed research irmak and djaman 2016 investigated the grain yield response to three planting population densities ppd 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 plants per hectare pph and three planting dates may 4 16 and 23 in 2011 and april 24 may 8 and may 17 in 2012 for subsurface drip irrigated fit and rainfed maize production they observed that grain yield increased with increasing ppd relative to the 1st planting date by 15 9 12 2 and 12 7 for the 59 300 74 100 and 88 900 ppd respectively under irrigated conditions and increased by 7 7 2 9 and 5 6 for the same ppds respectively under rainfed overall the impact of planting date on grain yield varied with the ppd and year and with rainfed or irrigated conditions however in general delaying the planting date by every 1 day from may 4 resulted in an average yield increase of 0 043 t ha in a wet year in 2011 and delaying the planting by every 1 day from april 24 resulted in an average yield increase of 0 056 t ha in a dry year in 2012 4 conclusions the aims of this research were achieved by filling the gap in the literature pertaining to the evaluation of the ceres maize model ver 4 7 using long term 2005 2010 field measured data under rainfed limited and full irrigation conditions in the calibration and validation steps the rmsen values of the simulated lai and above ground biomass were in the range of 9 22 and 5 22 respectively the rmse for simulated and observed grain yield ranged between 1 02 and 2 05 t ha and rmsen ranged from 3 to 18 the pe of dapf and dapm ranged from 9 to 4 for dapf and from 12 to 14 for dapm there was a strong agreement between simulated and observed values of lai above ground biomass grain yield and phenological phases under rainfed and irrigation management treatments there was an inverse and strong relationship between the simulated grain yield and cumulative sip and sie determining the sip and sie value prior to reaching harvest maturity could be beneficial in simulating maize grain yield good agreement between simulated and observed swc indicated that ceres maize had the potential for its useful application as tool to schedule irrigation for maize the model needs improvement in terms of simulating water stress impact s on crop growth and development which in turn impact the crop water uptake and swc dynamics thus more accurate simulation of stress timing and magnitude severity can potentially improve the accuracy of crop water uptake and swc trends and magnitudes in the soil profile the planting dates impact on grain yield planting dates with 10 days increments starting from april 20 with 50 of probability of grain yield under fit irrigated conditions was simulated by the model as 15 25 t ha for april 20 14 77 t ha for april 30 14 62 t ha for may 10 and 13 42 t ha for may 20 for the rainfed conditions 50 of probability was simulated as 11 46 t ha for april 20 10 46 t ha for april 30 9 83 t ha for may 10 and 9 17 t ha for may 20 irrigation and early planting date had synergistic effects on grain yield a delay in planting date for the fit led to a yield reduction of 1 3 and 11 after planting dates of april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively a delay in planting date under rainfed led to a greater yield reduction of 6 10 and 18 after planting dates of april 30 may 10 and may 20 respectively based on the calibration and validation results of the ceres maize model it can be concluded that the model satisfactorily simulated swc phenological stages lai above ground biomass and grain yield of maize for the rainfed limited irrigation and full irrigation conditions under these experimental conditions moreover the ceres maize model can be a viable tool for simulating various management scenarios for enhancing maize productivity and estimating maize growth and yield response
