pr china graphical abstract anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs as promising technologies increasingly attract attention for the treatment of municipal wastewater in particular given their ability to recover biomethane nonetheless their performance in trace organic contaminants trocs removal requires in depth understanding this review summarizes the current knowledge on the removal and fate of the frequently reported trocs in sewage treated by anmbrs chemicals containing strong electron donating functional groups in their molecular structures and highly hydrophobic compounds can be effectively removed by anmbrs adsorption and the subsequent biodegradation have been identified as the dominant processes for trocs removal in addition the combination of membrane separation technologies and the bioreactor technology could greatly improve the removal of trocs under different wastewater sources or contents the influence of operating conditions is critically analyzed to provide information for further development furthermore the challenges and perspectives related to the operation of anmbrs are elucidated to facilitate the widespread application of anmbrs and enhance their capability for trocs removal keywords trace organic contaminants anaerobic membrane bioreactor sorption biodegradation 1 introduction trace organic contaminants trocs comprise a wide range of anthropogenic and natural compounds such as pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps steroid hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pesticides and many other emerging compounds 1 the high rate of medication uses in human healthcare and the incomplete transformation of the medications in the human body increase the transfer of pharmaceutically active compounds and persistent chemical residues to wastewater treatment plants wwtps through urban sewage pipe network systems 2 however current wwtps based on aerobic and anaerobic processes are not specifically designed to remove these categories of organic contaminants 3 most trocs particularly the persistent and toxic contaminants are hardly degraded by conventional biological treatments therefore municipal wastewater has been recognized as a crucial source through which these partially transformed contaminants are transferred to the aquatic environment 3 5 despite occurring at low concentrations ranging from a few nanograms per litre to several micrograms per litre trocs exhibit a range of adverse health effects in human and aquatic environments 6 8 therefore it is of great importance to develop systems for the effective removal of trocs from wastewater before their discharge membrane bioreactors mbrs based on the conventional biological processes and filtration technologies that reject particulate sludge and biomass have emerged as a viable solution these advanced technologies are reportedly notably effective at the removal of trocs 9 10 nonetheless recent studies suggest that the introduction of anaerobic processes with both methanogenesis and electrogenesis can further improve the trocs removal in mbrs 11 12 consequently anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs integrating anaerobic processes and membrane technologies have been demonstrated to be particularly effective at wastewater treatment and have become increasingly attractive in recent years these bioreactors have been reported to ameliorate the removal of antibiotics endocrine disrupting compounds and other refractory chemicals with unique operating conditions such as extended solid retention time srt enriched specific anaerobic sludge enzymes e g acetate kinase and the involved functional genes 13 14 despite the absence of oxygen anaerobic wastewater treatment features several advantages it produces less residual sludge and generates biogas therefore requiring less energy moreover anmbrs have distinctive advantages over the conventional activated sludge processes such as the increased total biomass retention excellent effluent quality and small footprint furthermore the low sludge production and lower energy costs make it more attractive compared with the aerobic membrane reactors aembrs 15 17 currently anmbrs have a wide range of applications in wastewater treatment most studies have focused on their applications on high strength organic industrial wastewater such as textile brewery pharmaceutical phac and slaughterhouse industries 18 cheng et al 19 demonstrated anmbrs as promising technologies for the degradation of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in phac wastewater the research on anmbr has been mostly focused on investigating high strength wastewater treatment however the anmbr technology has also shown satisfactory results for low strength sewage treatment for example some trocs in municipal wastewater such as sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim clozapine triclocarban and 4 n nonylphenol have been effectively removed while cod removal efficiencies exceeding 90 in anmbr systems have been realized 20 22 given the great potential of anmbr treatment the study on the fate of trocs and factors affecting their removal in anmbr have been advancing gradually 20 31 studies comparing the use of anaerobic systems for high strength wastewater treatment have been well reported in the literature however equivalent studies for sewage treatment via anmbr with varying levels of trace contaminants have been carried out only within the past few years similarly since the perception of trocs is in the initial phase detailed statistical analyses are lacking an example of such is a meta analysis of available studies to establish performance drivers and ascertain the correlation between trocs removal and governing factors furthermore the presence of phacs in bioreactors may pose several challenges some of them could induce biological effects that can affect the characteristics of sludge and mixed liquor 32 such biological effects include increased production of extracellular polymeric substances eps alteration of microbial community structures and their behavior and promotion of membrane fouling 33 35 the large number of current studies provides an opportunity to summarize the existing knowledge on the performance of anmbrs and the corresponding design and operational factors for the removal of trocs however the available evidence indicates that no review aimed at summarizing current knowledge on trocs removal by anmbrs has been conducted therefore the lack of comprehensive and critical analyses on most of the above mentioned thematic areas necessitates the undertaking of more research especially focusing on the impact of experimental design and the operational factors affecting trocs removal efficiencies in anmbrs to realize evidence based general conclusions this review aims to provide a consolidate review on the present state of research and advancement in anmbr technologies for trocs removal the specific objectives of this review are 1 to comprehensively assess the fate of trocs in anmbr treatments for municipal wastewater 2 to summarize the current understanding of trocs possible removal processes and mechanisms 3 to examine the influence of design and operational factors 4 to analyze the impact of the physicochemical parameters of anmbrs 5 to combine the available knowledge and provide perspectives on various approaches to improve anmbrs performance for trocs removal 2 removal efficiencies of trocs by anmbrs several recent studies have evaluated the performance of anmbr and integrated anmbr systems in trocs removal under various operational conditions table 1 the high removals of total organic constituents could be achieved by anmbrs even if the addition of trocs may have some adverse effects on the bioreactor e g the change of microbial community causing severe membrane fouling in theory however the removal efficiencies of commonly studied contaminants show notable variations for instance removal efficiencies of 11 and 99 have been reported for primidone and sulfamethoxazole respectively on larger scale monsalvo et al 20 reported that only a quarter of 38 compounds were highly removed at over 90 efficiency while three fifths were removed at efficiencies less than 50 nonetheless due to differences in operating conditions and diversity of microbial cultures the trocs removal efficiencies reported in other studies mostly surpass those reported by monsalvo et al some studies in which anmbrs are integrated with other technologies indicate enhanced removal of refractory trocs from sewage such technologies include selective membrane separation downstream of the anaerobic treatment systems in the form of nanofiltration nf or membrane distillation md 23 30 specifically the integration of anmbr with a downstream nf system shows a higher overall trocs removal than the anmbr system alone up to 87 trocs removal has been attributed to the nf process 36 furthermore the addition of adsorbents such as granular activated carbon gac has been reported to significantly improve the trocs removal performance by enhancing the biotransformation of the compounds in anmbrs 31 37 for instance using powdered activated carbon pac in an anmbr reportedly increased the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim to more than 99 while corresponding anmbr systems without pac achieved 67 8 and 94 2 under the same operating conditions moreover dutta et al 42 demonstrated the staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor safmbr system to be one of the most promising processes for trocs removal because of the combined effects of the biodegradation sorption and membrane filtration in another study the treatment of a safmbr with gac as carrier medium was demonstrated to effectively remove a wide range of trocs 86 100 except for diclofenac 78 in both stages 37 similarly michael et al 41 reported that the safmbr using gac as fluidized medium can completely remove diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole which were mainly degraded by the adsorption to gacs or biofilm and biodegradation caused by the biofilm formed on gacs the current knowledge on anmbr demonstrates that it can effectively remove highly hydrophobic contaminants such as nonylphenol and triclocarban 15 other compounds that contain electron donating functional groups similarly achieve a certain removal efficiency conversely compounds with electron withdrawing functional groups in most cases are barely removed by anmbrs furthermore song et al 29 reported that some hydrophilic compounds containing nitrogen and electron donating groups edgs could be effectively removed at 60 similar findings have also been reported 21 28 31 37 43 the characteristics of common trocs in the literature and their removal using anmbrs are summarized in table 2 compared with the aembr the anaerobic operation of mbrs can enhance the removal of a minority of trocs that present restricted aerobic biodegradation potential sulfamethoxazole 44 trimethoprim 45 carbamazepine 46 amitriptyline and atrazine 38 have been reported to be more effectively removed by anmbrs fig 1 a in contrast the degradations of ibuprofen naproxen 17α ethinylestradiol roxithromycin and erythromycin are only expected in the aerobic process 47 several studies demonstrate that some contaminants that present biological resistance under aerobic conditions could be efficiently eliminated in anmbrs könig et al 46 observed that carbamazepine a compound with an electron withdrawing group ewg could be degraded to 1011 dihydro carbamazepine under anaerobic conditions by hydrogenation wang et al 16 reported anmbr systems to show a high performance of over 95 removal of polycyclic musks from low strength sulfate wastewater halogenated trocs such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons could also be effectively biodegraded by anaerobic reductive dehalogenation 48 for instance in a combined system comprising mbr and an anaerobic filter pretreatment to treat municipal landfill leachate the anaerobic process reportedly removed 88 of pesticides and 58 of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 49 in addition many researchers have demonstrated the efficiency of anmbrs for antibiotic type trocs removal and reduction in the risk of arg persistence 50 rysz et al 51 observed that tetracycline args disappeared from bacterial cultures more rapidly under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions harb et al 23 indicated that the multiple antibiotic type trocs removal rates in anmbrs were higher than in aembr while the associated antibiotic resistance genes were lower in the anaerobic system fig 1b shows the removal efficiencies of trocs observed in anaerobic digestion ad treatment compared with the ranges in anmbr treatment systems similar to the removal reported by anmbr the compounds removal efficiencies were also significantly variable reported average removals ranging from more than 80 to less than 30 gonz alez gil et al 52 studied the removal of 20 trocs during ad β estradiol galaxolide and triclosan were poor removed with removal efficiency below 20 butkovskyi et al 53 studied the removal of trocs during the composting of sludge coming from a up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor the removal efficiencies of diclofenac carbamazepine metoprolol and triclosan were 85 which higher than their reported by anmbr anmbr systems combining with the characteristics of ad and membrane separation showed a higher average removal efficiency of most trocs than ad treatment however as an advanced ad technology the capacity of anmbr to remove trocs is still limited 54 the bioreactor serves as the primary removal site for trocs the removal rate is believed to depend on oxidation conditions 55 lahti and oikari et al 56 compared naproxen and bisoprolol removal efficiencies under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the biodegradation rates of naproxen and bisoprolol were 97 3 and 14 1 in anaerobic respectively and about 40 and 35 in aerobic condition some other compounds such as carbamazepine diclofenac and bisphenol a show biological resistance regardless of dissolved oxygen in environments 57 some reports suggest that low dissolved oxygen conditions could favor some trocs degradation cases 26 58 hai et al 59 demonstrated the significantly higher removal efficiencies of carbamazepine in near anoxic conditions compared with those in aerobic and anaerobic conditions in contrast the removal efficiencies of a special group of compounds including ketoprofen ibuprofen and gemfibrozil whose molecular structures lacked sulfur nitrogen or hydrophilic elements were reportedly higher in aembrs alvarino et al 60 investigated the fate of 16 trocs by operated an anaerobic uasb reactor as pre treatment before aerobic mbr process which can enhance trocs biodegradation rates compared to a conventional aerobic anaerobic process consequently the treatment of anaerobic aerobic combined processes is expected to improve the degradation of some common trocs that exhibit specific and non specific in vitro toxicity as well as their metabolites 61 3 fate of trocs in anmbrs 3 1 sorption the removal of trocs in the aqueous phase by anmbr can be attributed to three primary processes hydrolysis adsorption and biodegradation 62 the adsorption of contaminants onto sludge particles or biomass is essential to controlling the trocs removal in anmbr treatment systems this process generally refers to the interaction between chemicals and solid phases 63 nonetheless the physicochemical characteristics of trocs e g hydrogen bond hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions and the adsorbents e g mass concentration largely determine the adsorption efficiency the solid water distribution coefficient k d is vital to quantifying the sorption of trocs onto sludge here k d is defined as the ratio of the concentration of chemicals in the solid to that in the aqueous phase at equilibrium 64 the k d l gss value at equilibrium is expressed by eq 1 1 k d c s o r b e d x s s s s o l u b l e where csorbed is the concentration of a trocs adsorbed on sludge in μg l xss is the concentration of the suspended solids in wastewater or sludge gss l and ssoluble is the concentration of the soluble part of the compound μg l eq 1 assumes the sorption process is in equilibrium and neglects kinetic factors although anmbr systems may be far from equilibrium a prolonged sorption process in anaerobic systems can be achieved 65 supposing that there is no significant biodegradation in a completely mixed system at equilibrium the removal efficiency ηsorb of trocs depends on xss and k d as eq 2 2 η s o r b c s o r b e d c s o r b e d s s o l u b l e k d x s s 1 k d x s s k d c s o r b e d x s s s s o l u b l e generally xss is combined with the concentrations of biomass hence a high sludge concentration in anmbrs 6 10 gss l is likely to be the explanation for their better performance for trocs removal compared with the conventional activated sludge process 2 5 4 0 gss l 10 for most analgesics and anti inflammatory compounds with k d 0 5 l gss adsorption is not the main removal mechanism 66 conversely for compounds with k d 5 l gss such as hormones endocrine disrupting compounds and musk fragrances anmbr systems can remove them via immobilizing them on the sludge and completely detoxifying them by biological degradation the sorption of trocs onto sludge or biomass comprises two mechanisms fig 2 on the one hand trocs retention onto solid surfaces can be attributed to electrostatic interaction the positively charged groups of trocs such as quaternary amines can be adsorbed to the negatively charged surface of the cells 63 the acid dissociation constant pka characterizes the electrostatic interaction on the other hand as a result of the hydrophobicity of trocs the contaminants in the aqueous phase can be adsorbed into the lipid fraction of the sludge consequently the trocs enter into the lipophilic cell membranes of microorganisms thus the further conversion of the compounds is promoted by their reaction with enzymes on the membrane this process can be described by the octanol water partition coefficient kow value which is defined as the ratio of a substance concentration in an octanol saturated phase to its concentration in a water saturated phase 67 as for sludges the kow and pka determine their sorption trends 64 68 previous research has indicated that trocs with medium or high hydrophobic behaviors molecules with high values for kow are preferentially adsorbed onto sludge 68 69 for instance according to alvarino et al 45 substances such as musk fragrances and many other lipophilic trocs adsorbed on granular biomass can accumulate with time however pka is also an important consideration in the aqueous phase ionized or dissociated trocs such as cationic compound trimethoprim can be adsorbed via electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged surfaces of biomass 68 nonetheless the hydrophobic interaction will become unfavorable if the compounds are extensively ionized 70 the hydrophobicity and ionization characteristics of trocs are supposed to be equally considered to obtain a more accurate parameter for the sorption of trocs at different ph values then it can be described by dph the relationship between dph and different species can be determined by eq 3 3 log d p h l o g n o n i o n i z e d i o n i z e d s p e c i e s o c t a n o l n o n i o n i z e d i o n i z e d s p e c i e s w a t e r the hydrophobicity logdph of trocs plays an essential role in the adsorption process at the same ph conditions a higher logdph value means the compound is more hydrophobic normally hydrophobic compounds can exhibit a considerably higher sorption tendency 71 previous experimental data show that anmbrs could achieve higher removal efficiencies for relatively hydrophobic compounds logdph 3 2 at ph 7 than hydrophilic compounds logdph 3 2 at ph 7 20 30 monsalvo et al 20 also reported that the high hydrophobicity of trocs not only can reach the highest removal efficiencies in anmbr but also is conducive to biodegradation in other words these highly hydrophobic compounds were mainly considered to be removed by biodegradation in addition sorption could provide more chances for trocs having sufficient contact with biomass in anmbrs furthermore cheng et al 19 indicated that epss and soluble microbial products smps in anmbrs could also influence the sorption of hydrophilic trocs since the chemical structures of epss contain cationic and anionic functional groups hydrophilic trocs can be adsorbed onto epss by electrostatic interactions 72 73 thus the removal of some antibiotics can be improved through sorption by the eps and smp protein components 35 74 however for those compounds with low logdph the attractive electrostatic interaction between positively charged molecules e g caffeine with logd ph 7 0 63 and negatively charged membranes can also cause strong adsorption 75 previous studies indicate that macrolides having logd ph 7 around 3 could interact with the membrane for their removal 76 in general the k d values of trocs correlate strongly with logdph values as k d measures the distribution between phases and quantifies the sorption whereas logdph is a strong predictor for hydrophobic adsorption 68 nevertheless sorption without further biodegradation would generate a temporary build up of trocs in an anmbr system 20 therefore at very long srts biotransformation plays a primary role in the removal of trocs by anmbrs 42 3 2 biodegradation biodegradation is a crucial mechanism for trocs removal and it contributes greatly to governing trocs accumulation in the sludge phase of the anmbr treatment process 62 the biodegradation of trocs in anmbr systems follows the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 4 77 4 ⅆ c ⅆ t k b i o l x s s s s o l u b l e where c ssoluble are the concentrations of total trocs μg l and the soluble part of the trocs μg l respectively xss is the concentration of suspended solids gss l and t is time d moreover kbiol is defined as the pseudo first order reaction rate constant l gss d and it can digitally describe the maximum biological activity in an anmbr in addition kbiol is commonly obtained in kinetic batch tests thus it is not affected by other operational conditions 45 even though the chemical properties and redox conditions are involved in determining the biological removal efficiency of trocs the biological degradation processes show the relatively low removal efficiencies kbiol 1 l gss d for those containing strong ewgs molecules on the contrary hydrophobic compounds with edgs in their chemical structures are more readily biodegradable 70 wijekoon et al 15 reported that edg compounds hydrophilic or not were significantly removed biodegradability 70 while most hydrophilic trocs and compounds containing ewgs e g nitro and amides were poorly removed biodegradability 50 by anmbrs additionally previous reports demonstrate that methanogenic archaea sulfate reducing iron reducing and nitrate reducing bacteria play a pivotal role in trocs anaerobic biodegradation using nitrate ferric iron or sulfate as electron acceptors at methanogenic conditions 78 in one study 17α ethinylestradiol nonylphenol and most polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons could be significantly biodegraded under nitrate or sulfate reducing conditions 79 nevertheless in the absence of a necessary substance to assist in biodegradation the trocs adsorption on the solid could be the dominant removal mechanism e g 17α ethinylestradiol biodegradation lacking nitrate 80 to date the correlation between the functions of specific anaerobic microbial populations and the removal of trocs is yet to be further investigated the biodegradation of trocs in anmbr is likely to occur through two major pathways metabolism and co metabolism fig 3 81 microorganisms degrade these compounds via metabolism and or co metabolism through the system redox conditions the microbial populations and the degree of trocs hydrolysis in the liquid phase 66 regarding metabolism fig 3a microorganisms consume trocs as the main energy and carbon source to facilitate their biomass growth and generate the relevant enzymes for trocs disintegration however in most instances trocs cannot be used directly for microbial growth owing to their toxicity biological recalcitrance and occurrence in municipal wastewater at extremely low concentrations 82 moreover the microbial community in an anaerobic system is relatively simple thus it is difficult for anaerobic microorganisms to directly catabolize certain trocs therefore co metabolism fig 3b is one of the main pathways in the degradation of refractory compounds 83 in this process the persistent contaminants are converted into more bio transformable intermediate products by specific bacteria and oxidoreductase enzymes 84 so far few studies about co metabolism were performed under anaerobic condition 85 87 notably the acidogenic phase of the ad processes may be the vital in co metabolism degradation of most trocs as compared to acetogenesis methanogenesis 87 the presence of hydrolyzing acidifying bacteria may contribute to benzene ring cracking under anaerobic conditions which facilitates the complete biodegradation of trocs 88 the biodegradation of some trocs can be described from two aspects of their chemical structure and the enzymatic activities a previous study reported that the long chain fatty acid coa ligase played an important role in some trocs removal cases as it targeted carboxyl or hydroxyl groups catalyzing chemical conversion in the initial step of biodegradation 23 furthermore gonzalez gil et al 85 found that acetate kinase could trigger some specific chemical transformations in an anaerobic biological process such as the transformations of galaxolide naproxen nonylphenol ibuprofen diclofenac bisphenol a and triclosan in methanogenesis additionally the biocatalytic action of enzymes participates in the trocs removal and this is strongly dependent on the chemical structure of the trocs in other words compounds containing susceptible functional groups such as carboxyl or hydroxyl group can be transformed examples of such trocs to be well biodegraded 20 in anaerobic processes include acetaminophen clarithromycin erythromycin citalopram climbazole atenolol terbutryn and sulfamethoxazole 89 furthermore co metabolism has also been frequently studied in the case of nitrification 81 84 86 the enzyme ammonium monooxygenase amo has been reported to catalyze the trocs nh3 co metabolism by utilizing elemental oxygen to incorporate hydroxyl functional groups into molecules due to its low specificity 90 apart from co metabolism and metabolism ion trapping has been suggested as a feasible approach to remove aliphatic amines and trocs from liquid in ion trapping the neutral species of amine containing compounds diﬀ use through the cell membrane and further into the acidic vesicles present in eukaryotes to separate them from the aqueous phase 91 this mechanism could be responsible for the incomplete biotransformation of some trocs e g fluoxetine since ion trapping is considered to be sequestrated with microorganisms in addition high pka and lipophilicity compounds are more likely to be removed by ion trapping in anaerobic systems 92 when the anmbr operates for a long period biotransformation gradually becomes the dominant trocs removal mechanism and most of the compounds that are liable to be degraded in anaerobic environment can be steadily removed in this process in addition since almost no excess sludge is generated during anmbr treatment most degraded or and incomplete degraded trocs can be retained in the reactor without being discharged to the external environment 42 thus compared with other biological treatment technologies with shorter srt anmbrs can not only enhance the biodegradation by prolonging the contact time of trocs and biomass but also reduce the occurrence of secondary pollution however it is worth noting that the removal efficiencies of trocs are strongly influenced by their biodegradability under the conditions of low biodegradability trocs are enriched in the solid phase which may lead to the exhaustion of adsorption capacity and deterioration in the anmbr performance 65 for example the presence of some trocs e g carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen and their principal metabolites in biomass at around 5 μg l can lead to microorganisms death and induce an increase in protein polysaccharide ratio in the bioreactor 93 94 3 3 membrane separation processes owing to the high removal rate of low molecular weight pollutants and the strong ability to purify water quality membrane separation processes and their integration systems have become an important alternative to for trocs removal either in water or wastewater 95 microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are commonly used membrane filtration technologies of mbr in wastewater treatment 96 97 in the advanced treatment of wastewater nanofiltration nf forward osmosis fo and reverse osmosis ro are used to achieve higher effluent standards 98 100 and the application of integration of nf fo ro and membrane distillation md with other systems to generates high quality water is increasing 13 24 30 76 100 103 the membrane acts as a hindrance to remain trocs in the bioreactor by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion or adsorption 104 105 therefore contact between the trocs and the microorganisms inside the bioreactor is prolonged which can contribute to the degradation of the trocs 106 however the removal efficiency of trocs by separation processes mainly depend on the physicochemical properties of the compounds membrane properties i e pore size hydrophobic and fouling levels and so on which make trocs removal difficult to predict 107 3 3 1 membrane properties according to the hydrophilicity of membrane material membrane can be divided into organic membrane and inorganic membrane 108 polysulfone psf polyether sulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and other materials are commonly used in the make of organic membranes inorganic materials such as ceramics glass zeolites and metal oxides are important for the manufacture of inorganic membranes 109 some reports suggested that inorganic membranes may be an ideal alternative for the trocs removing under harsh condition 110 112 stylianos k et al 112 investigated the fate and removal of 5 trocs by a ceramic membrane contacting process for ozone and peroxone treatment and the results showed that the ceramic membrane with the highest possible inner surface in each volume can improve the trocs efficiency of the ozone treatment process generally inorganic membranes are relatively stable but the cost of inorganic materials too high to be used on a large scale so most mbr use organic polymeric membranes at present the application and operation of mf and uf are relatively simple and their transmembrane pressure are much lower than other membrane separation technologies mf and uf are separating based techniques in this process trocs are not retained but undergo by size exclusion generally the pore sizes 0 01 0 1 μm and molecular weight cutoff ranging from 1 to 200 kda of mf uf are larger than the molecular sizes of trocs 113 in addition due to the high solubility of trocs mf and uf are considered to be inefficient in removing dissolved solutes from water 76 the sorption of lipophilic trocs such as musk fragrances onto membrane surfaces has been observed in some commonly used hydrophobic membranes 114 the electrostatic interactions between trocs and the membrane surfaces can also affect the sorption of trocs by the membranes 99 nghiem et al 115 reported that hydrogen bonds formation on the membrane surface could also enhance the trocs retention membrane fouling is a major weakness of mf uf membrane filtration processes 116 saturated membranes lower the trocs removal efficiencies by reducing flux and hence retention additionally in comparison with aembr the high concentrations of solids and suspended matter in anmbr could increase the tendency for severe membrane fouling 117 however some trocs can be captured by the fouling layer and become absorbed onto the mf uf membrane surface thereby enhancing the trocs removal efficiencies 118 similar findings by monsalvo et al 20 indicated that in a microfiltration anmbr the retention by fouling layers contributed significantly to the removal of 17α ethinylestradiol estrone octylphenol and bisphenol a the retention of trocs in the fouling layers could explain the slightly higher removal efficiency reported for the mbr over those obtained by conventional biology treatments nf ro and fo processes have been proven to be effective in removing trocs however the drawback of these processes is the high energy consumption caused by their high transmembrane pressure 119 yoon et al 120 used a nf membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 200 da the rejection ratios for 52 endocrine disrupting compounds ranged from 0 to more than 90 the variation of nf rejection ratios may cause by the hydrophilicity and or molecular weight cutoff of trocs regarding the fo membrane process the rejection by fo membranes has been studied for a wide range of trocs and has shown great potential 102 103 121 122 the trocs could be completely removed in fo process due to the forward flux blockage by the reverse solute flux of the draw solute which has been shown to achieve higher rejections compared to the pressure used gradient in ro process 3 3 2 hybrid system some post treatment membrane processes such as nf ro fo and md are specifically applied to enhance the trocs removal efficiency for example the rejection rates of trocs increased from about 20 to almost 100 by a stand alone nf process 98 in another study combining an anmbr with a downstream nf unit the removal efficiency of trocs could be improved by 80 92 36 furthermore thin film composite nf and ro membranes could significantly reject most of the negatively charged compounds but for neutral chemicals the rejection mainly relied on the molecular weights of the compounds 29 76 furthermore in order to overcome the serious fouling issue which driven by hydraulics as the driving force for both anmbr and post treatment such as ro and nf kim et al 103 proposed a protocol for anaerobic fertilizer drawn forward osmosis membrane bioreactor by integrating anmbr with fo instead of conventional pressurized membrane processes this system can effectively remove contaminants and reduce the membrane fouling problem song et al 30 reported that integrating md into an anmbr could increase the overall removal efficiencies of 26 selected trocs from 76 to almost 100 forward osmosis and md have shown low membrane fouling potentials and very high removal efficiencies for even compounds that could be barely removed by anmbr systems 4 factors affecting trocs removal in anmbrs 4 1 physicochemical properties 4 1 1 chemical structure and hydrophobicity the removal of trocs in anmbr systems is highly dependent on their molecular structure and physicochemical properties regarding their chemical structure there is no significant distinction between removals of heterocyclic or non heterocyclic compounds 123 similarly no discernible difference between the removals of mononuclear and polynuclear compounds has been reported despite the difficulty in correlating the removal efficiency to compound complexity aliphatic monocyclic aromatic compounds containing edgs are generally more biodegradable while polycyclic compounds containing ewgs are less susceptible to decomposition 124 commonly in anaerobic systems hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic compounds possessing strong ewgs show consistently low removal efficiencies 15 123 hydrophilic compounds can be easily discharged with the effluent from the reactor owing to their feebleness absorption capacity additionally the presence of ewgs in the chemical structure can generate an electron deficiency which makes the chemical difficult to serve as an oxidizing agent on the contrary high removal efficiencies were recorded in anmbrs for compounds with edgs such as hydroxyl and primary amine groups 69 the edg promotes the biodegradation through the strengthening of electrophilic attack by anaerobic bacteria for example atenolol is likely transformed biotransformation accounting for 20 into atenolol acid through amide hydrolysis in anaerobic sludge via enzymatic reactions 89 125 however the degradation of trocs may be initiated by the mere cleavage of a side chain structure and the nucleus complexity may contribute to further mineralization regardless of the structure of the compound 123 thus the trocs removal efficiency in anmbrs may not entirely represent the complete mineralization of the contaminants 4 1 2 molecular weight the biotransformation of high molecular weight compounds can be enhanced by membrane filtration in anmbrs a higher molecular weight means the chemical structure may have more complex branches and the microbes have a higher chance to selectively cleave to a certain target site to initiate degradation tadkaew et al 123 reported an overall removal of up to 60 for compounds with a molecular weight of over 300 g mol while compounds with molecular weights less than 300 g mol presented no or little removal to over 98 4 2 operating conditions 4 2 1 srt and hrt combining different operating parameters may optimize the trocs removal in anmbr treatment the srt and hydraulic retention time hrt are the most significant factors in the anmbr operation 66 it has been reported that prolonged srt notably increases the biomass concentration to enhance trocs removal 126 thus a long srt is one of the advantages of anmbrs over other biological treatment systems anaerobic sludge intercepted by membrane modules in the bioreactor can retain the hardly degradable compounds within the highly concentrated sludge which can become more biodegradable with increasing sludge retention time 127 not only is a longer srt beneficial for methanogenesis to increase biogas production but it also enhances the anaerobic microbial degradation of trocs during the methanogenesis process nonetheless due to the slow growth of anaerobic microorganisms a long srt is inevitable mostly an srt of between 150 and 180 days is sufficient for the majority of trocs to be eliminated from anmbr systems in addition the srt changes trocs degradation pathways of the reactor as reported by xiao et al 31 in an anmbr operation with long srt 150 d biodegradation was the decisive mechanism to remove the five selected trocs adsorption only contributed significantly to the removal of highly hydrophobic chemicals within the initial phase about 10 days the hrt is an important factor in the system operation to maintain the microbial activity and ensure system efficiency of the anmbr several studies indicate that the influences of hrt on trocs removal in anmbr treatments may not be significant within the range of 2 20 h 128 129 hu et al 130 demonstrated that tetrahydrofuran could be effectively removed in an anmbr treating phacs wastewater at an hrt of 24 h decreasing the hrt to 12 h showed a considerable decline in the biological removal efficiency because microbial activities were inhibited additionally due to higher biomass concentrations in anmbrs a very short hrt may cause membrane fouling 131 while a long hrt e g hrts 18 h could significantly mitigate membrane fouling could significantly mitigate 132 therefore optimizing the hrt or srt in anmbrs may be crucial to enhancing trocs removal and controlling membrane fouling 4 2 2 ph in anmbrs ph is an important factor that affects both the sorption and biological processes for trocs removal the dominant microorganisms involved in the trocs biodegradation and the activity of the enzymes are ph dependent according to sanguanpak et al 133 higher removal efficiencies of trocs are associated with low ph conditions due to the increase in lipophilicity variations in ph might also impact the dissociation of certain chemicals that possess distinct functional classes e g neutral cationic and anionic 134 tadkaew et al 135 demonstrated that the removal efficiencies of ionizable chemicals such as most analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs were largely ph dependent on the contrary the removal of non ionizable compounds in anmbrs depends more on their physicochemical properties during treatment furthermore during long term filtration in an anmbr membrane fouling can emerge as one of the most crucial issues especially when the system is operated at highly acidic or alkaline conditions 136 4 2 3 temperature temperature is one of the most significant factors that affect the performance of anmbrs since the microorganism growth and activity vary with temperature changes 137 138 moreover the organic compound degradation mechanism can change with temperature for example in one study under mesophilic 25 3 c and thermophilic 35 3 c conditions the biodegradation of tetrahydrofuran in an anmbr was the major mechanism for degradation while the physical removal by membranes dominated at low temperatures of 15 3 c 130 despite the large number of studies focused on the operation of anmbrs under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions operating anmbrs under moderate to low temperatures is more realistic for municipal wastewater treatment 139 the ability of anmbrs to strongly tolerate temperature fluctuations between 12 c and 26 c ensures their stable removal efficiency even at low temperatures 140 the factors discussed above and their influences on trocs removal are summarized in table 3 4 3 anmbr processes augmentation the addition of different forms of activated carbon i e pac and gac and artificial biomass carriers i e sponges and plastic supports to anmbr treatments can be used to improve some of the specific features of these systems and enhance the removal of certain classes of trocs for example the use of pac can simultaneously improve the sorption of trocs and biodegradation of medium biodegradability compounds such as carbamazepine and diclofenac 31 141 besides adding activated carbon in anmbr can smoother membrane surface which could control the further fouling 18 142 luo et al 143 studied a sponge based hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor membrane bioreactors mbbrs for the treatment of a set of 22 trocs this study observed that hydrophobic compounds were well removed and the overall trocs removal efficiency was higher than that in mbr operating under the same conditions according to the fate of the trocs in anmbr process the biotransformation of trocs mainly through the co metabolic pathway lack of enzymes involved in the co metabolic process or low enzyme activity may results in the low removal efficiency of trocs by anmbr treatment the application of enzyme augmentation on anmbr system for the removal of these persistent trocs can led to positive results 144 a recent study demonstrated that acetate kinase involved in the co metabolic of several trocs removal i e sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen atenolol and clarithromycin in anaerobic environments 145 in another study a combination of laccase and hollow fiber membrane bioreactor was applied to remove acetaminophen methaminoic acid and carbamazepine in this study the hybrid system achieved almost total trocs elimination and the membrane fouling was reduced 146 the utilization of enzymes can lower the risk of emerging resistance to micropollutants in compare with microbes the utilization of enzymes can lower the menace of emerging resistance to trocs mainly antibiotics in compare with microbes 147 however enzymatic activities were generally not elevated suggesting that the exogenous enzymes were inactivated within one day therefore requiring regular supplementation however some studies reported that the exogenous enzymes added into the reactor were inactivated within one day so it needs to be replenished regularly therefore the addition of enzymes has only a short term effect and the enzymatic activities in bioreactor were almost not elevated furthermore anaerobic electrochemical membrane bioreactor anembr is also can be considered as a promising choice that can improve the removal efficiency of trocs and reduce the membrane fouling however more researches are needed to be conduct on the feasibility of anembr for trocs wastewater treatment 148 149 5 challenges and future perspectives 5 1 challenges despite the high potential of anmbr for the removal of specific recalcitrant contaminants from wastewater there remain notable challenges especially for the treatment of municipal sewage these challenges include the extremely low concentration of trocs in municipal wastewater and the complex physicochemical properties of the trocs the slow microorganism metabolic rates the low microbial community diversity in anaerobic systems and the adverse effects of the trocs in contrast to aerobic systems slow microorganism metabolic rates and low microbial community diversity are the drawbacks to the overall trocs removal efficiency in anaerobic treatment 64 in addition the concentrations of trocs in sewage at trace levels limit the use of most trocs as a primary substrate in microbial metabolism adsorption and hydrolysis dominate the removal of trocs in the initial stage of anmbr treatment thus the potential threats of trocs to the environment remain owing to the incomplete elimination of trocs by anmbr systems the presence of trocs in anmbr may cause negative effects on the various processes cannot be overstated wang z et al 154 reported that the presence of trocs in anmbrs may induce the change of sludge when anaerobic sludge was exposed to cyclophosphamide of approximately 5 μg l the floc sizes significantly increased similarly the presence of some antibiotics e g carbamazepine can induce the sludge deflocculation which consequently causes severe membrane fouling and weakens the bioreactor performance owing to the biomass decomposition 155 furthermore the outcome of trocs removal in anmbr is still not totally understood thus further studies need to be carried out to elucidate the main degradation pathways of trocs with varying properties and the products formed during the biodegradation under anaerobic conditions moreover the relative toxicity and side effects of trocs compared with the parent compounds should be assessed 71 in the case of co metabolism as the main pathway for trocs degradation substantial studies are required to determine the roles of other active enzymes and the possible chemical reactions in anaerobic biodegradation 5 2 future perspectives anmbrs show good promise for the removal of trocs and the provision of high quality effluent in municipal wastewater treatment because of their unique operating conditions such as long srt specific functional genes enzymes and membrane separation adsorption and biodegradation may simultaneously contribute to the trocs removal in anmbrs for the low hydrophobic compounds molecular weight chemical structure and specific functional groups may affect their biodegradability and consequently decide the overall removal efficiency the inclusion of physical retention mechanisms in wastewater treatment can be considered to enhance the ability to removing recalcitrant trocs for example the addition of activated carbon in bioreactors can enhance the trocs removal by promoting sorption furthermore the removal of medium biodegradability compounds can be enhanced by adding pac in biological reactors which facilitates both the biodegradation and sorption processes 31 it is reported that trocs containing edgs molecules can be effectively removed by anmbr treatment while trocs such as diclofenac ketoprofen naproxen and erythromycin have relatively limited dehalogenation hydrogenation ability under the anaerobic condition 62 125 for this case the removal of trocs relies on the enzymatic activities in biological processes thus the application of specific enzymes in biological wastewater treatment to target the recalcitrant compounds has become a promising alternative in addition the enzyme usage will lower the risk of causing bacterial resistance to chemicals 156 158 gebreyohannes et al 159 established a set of methods for the biodegradation of recalcitrant chemicals using native extractive enzymes cell free lysates from activated sludge these methods lay a foundation for the use of native enzymes for trocs degradation given that in long term operations pressure driven membranes are more susceptible to fouling combining innovative membrane technology such as fo and md with the anmbr technology provides new insights for further improvement 6 conclusions anaerobic mbrs provide a feasible option to tackle the potential threats posed by trocs during water reclamation sorption and biodegradation are the dominant mechanisms contributing to trocs removal in anmbrs and the combination of membrane separation processes with anmbrs results in a more efficient performance compared with the conventional biological treatment the sorption efficiency is associated with the hydrophobicity and ionization characteristics of the trocs while the biodegradation which includes co metabolism and metabolism results in a high trocs removal efficiency owing to the high biomass concentrations and long srts 150 180 days in anmbrs despite that the classification scheme and predictive framework of the trocs removal have been based on kow kbiol pka structure and k d values it is still too early to establish a specific removal mechanism for trocs with various physicochemical properties and under different physical or chemical environments e g temperature and ph moreover the sustainable application of anmbrs requires further investigation of how to reduce the side effects e g the risk of increased membrane fouling of introducing trocs in bioreactors and how to enhance the anmbr operation by combining

pr china graphical abstract anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs as promising technologies increasingly attract attention for the treatment of municipal wastewater in particular given their ability to recover biomethane nonetheless their performance in trace organic contaminants trocs removal requires in depth understanding this review summarizes the current knowledge on the removal and fate of the frequently reported trocs in sewage treated by anmbrs chemicals containing strong electron donating functional groups in their molecular structures and highly hydrophobic compounds can be effectively removed by anmbrs adsorption and the subsequent biodegradation have been identified as the dominant processes for trocs removal in addition the combination of membrane separation technologies and the bioreactor technology could greatly improve the removal of trocs under different wastewater sources or contents the influence of operating conditions is critically analyzed to provide information for further development furthermore the challenges and perspectives related to the operation of anmbrs are elucidated to facilitate the widespread application of anmbrs and enhance their capability for trocs removal keywords trace organic contaminants anaerobic membrane bioreactor sorption biodegradation 1 introduction trace organic contaminants trocs comprise a wide range of anthropogenic and natural compounds such as pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps steroid hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds edcs pesticides and many other emerging compounds 1 the high rate of medication uses in human healthcare and the incomplete transformation of the medications in the human body increase the transfer of pharmaceutically active compounds and persistent chemical residues to wastewater treatment plants wwtps through urban sewage pipe network systems 2 however current wwtps based on aerobic and anaerobic processes are not specifically designed to remove these categories of organic contaminants 3 most trocs particularly the persistent and toxic contaminants are hardly degraded by conventional biological treatments therefore municipal wastewater has been recognized as a crucial source through which these partially transformed contaminants are transferred to the aquatic environment 3 5 despite occurring at low concentrations ranging from a few nanograms per litre to several micrograms per litre trocs exhibit a range of adverse health effects in human and aquatic environments 6 8 therefore it is of great importance to develop systems for the effective removal of trocs from wastewater before their discharge membrane bioreactors mbrs based on the conventional biological processes and filtration technologies that reject particulate sludge and biomass have emerged as a viable solution these advanced technologies are reportedly notably effective at the removal of trocs 9 10 nonetheless recent studies suggest that the introduction of anaerobic processes with both methanogenesis and electrogenesis can further improve the trocs removal in mbrs 11 12 consequently anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbrs integrating anaerobic processes and membrane technologies have been demonstrated to be particularly effective at wastewater treatment and have become increasingly attractive in recent years these bioreactors have been reported to ameliorate the removal of antibiotics endocrine disrupting compounds and other refractory chemicals with unique operating conditions such as extended solid retention time srt enriched specific anaerobic sludge enzymes e g acetate kinase and the involved functional genes 13 14 despite the absence of oxygen anaerobic wastewater treatment features several advantages it produces less residual sludge and generates biogas therefore requiring less energy moreover anmbrs have distinctive advantages over the conventional activated sludge processes such as the increased total biomass retention excellent effluent quality and small footprint furthermore the low sludge production and lower energy costs make it more attractive compared with the aerobic membrane reactors aembrs 15 17 currently anmbrs have a wide range of applications in wastewater treatment most studies have focused on their applications on high strength organic industrial wastewater such as textile brewery pharmaceutical phac and slaughterhouse industries 18 cheng et al 19 demonstrated anmbrs as promising technologies for the degradation of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes args in phac wastewater the research on anmbr has been mostly focused on investigating high strength wastewater treatment however the anmbr technology has also shown satisfactory results for low strength sewage treatment for example some trocs in municipal wastewater such as sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim clozapine triclocarban and 4 n nonylphenol have been effectively removed while cod removal efficiencies exceeding 90 in anmbr systems have been realized 20 22 given the great potential of anmbr treatment the study on the fate of trocs and factors affecting their removal in anmbr have been advancing gradually 20 31 studies comparing the use of anaerobic systems for high strength wastewater treatment have been well reported in the literature however equivalent studies for sewage treatment via anmbr with varying levels of trace contaminants have been carried out only within the past few years similarly since the perception of trocs is in the initial phase detailed statistical analyses are lacking an example of such is a meta analysis of available studies to establish performance drivers and ascertain the correlation between trocs removal and governing factors furthermore the presence of phacs in bioreactors may pose several challenges some of them could induce biological effects that can affect the characteristics of sludge and mixed liquor 32 such biological effects include increased production of extracellular polymeric substances eps alteration of microbial community structures and their behavior and promotion of membrane fouling 33 35 the large number of current studies provides an opportunity to summarize the existing knowledge on the performance of anmbrs and the corresponding design and operational factors for the removal of trocs however the available evidence indicates that no review aimed at summarizing current knowledge on trocs removal by anmbrs has been conducted therefore the lack of comprehensive and critical analyses on most of the above mentioned thematic areas necessitates the undertaking of more research especially focusing on the impact of experimental design and the operational factors affecting trocs removal efficiencies in anmbrs to realize evidence based general conclusions this review aims to provide a consolidate review on the present state of research and advancement in anmbr technologies for trocs removal the specific objectives of this review are 1 to comprehensively assess the fate of trocs in anmbr treatments for municipal wastewater 2 to summarize the current understanding of trocs possible removal processes and mechanisms 3 to examine the influence of design and operational factors 4 to analyze the impact of the physicochemical parameters of anmbrs 5 to combine the available knowledge and provide perspectives on various approaches to improve anmbrs performance for trocs removal 2 removal efficiencies of trocs by anmbrs several recent studies have evaluated the performance of anmbr and integrated anmbr systems in trocs removal under various operational conditions table 1 the high removals of total organic constituents could be achieved by anmbrs even if the addition of trocs may have some adverse effects on the bioreactor e g the change of microbial community causing severe membrane fouling in theory however the removal efficiencies of commonly studied contaminants show notable variations for instance removal efficiencies of 11 and 99 have been reported for primidone and sulfamethoxazole respectively on larger scale monsalvo et al 20 reported that only a quarter of 38 compounds were highly removed at over 90 efficiency while three fifths were removed at efficiencies less than 50 nonetheless due to differences in operating conditions and diversity of microbial cultures the trocs removal efficiencies reported in other studies mostly surpass those reported by monsalvo et al some studies in which anmbrs are integrated with other technologies indicate enhanced removal of refractory trocs from sewage such technologies include selective membrane separation downstream of the anaerobic treatment systems in the form of nanofiltration nf or membrane distillation md 23 30 specifically the integration of anmbr with a downstream nf system shows a higher overall trocs removal than the anmbr system alone up to 87 trocs removal has been attributed to the nf process 36 furthermore the addition of adsorbents such as granular activated carbon gac has been reported to significantly improve the trocs removal performance by enhancing the biotransformation of the compounds in anmbrs 31 37 for instance using powdered activated carbon pac in an anmbr reportedly increased the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim to more than 99 while corresponding anmbr systems without pac achieved 67 8 and 94 2 under the same operating conditions moreover dutta et al 42 demonstrated the staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor safmbr system to be one of the most promising processes for trocs removal because of the combined effects of the biodegradation sorption and membrane filtration in another study the treatment of a safmbr with gac as carrier medium was demonstrated to effectively remove a wide range of trocs 86 100 except for diclofenac 78 in both stages 37 similarly michael et al 41 reported that the safmbr using gac as fluidized medium can completely remove diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole which were mainly degraded by the adsorption to gacs or biofilm and biodegradation caused by the biofilm formed on gacs the current knowledge on anmbr demonstrates that it can effectively remove highly hydrophobic contaminants such as nonylphenol and triclocarban 15 other compounds that contain electron donating functional groups similarly achieve a certain removal efficiency conversely compounds with electron withdrawing functional groups in most cases are barely removed by anmbrs furthermore song et al 29 reported that some hydrophilic compounds containing nitrogen and electron donating groups edgs could be effectively removed at 60 similar findings have also been reported 21 28 31 37 43 the characteristics of common trocs in the literature and their removal using anmbrs are summarized in table 2 compared with the aembr the anaerobic operation of mbrs can enhance the removal of a minority of trocs that present restricted aerobic biodegradation potential sulfamethoxazole 44 trimethoprim 45 carbamazepine 46 amitriptyline and atrazine 38 have been reported to be more effectively removed by anmbrs fig 1 a in contrast the degradations of ibuprofen naproxen 17α ethinylestradiol roxithromycin and erythromycin are only expected in the aerobic process 47 several studies demonstrate that some contaminants that present biological resistance under aerobic conditions could be efficiently eliminated in anmbrs könig et al 46 observed that carbamazepine a compound with an electron withdrawing group ewg could be degraded to 1011 dihydro carbamazepine under anaerobic conditions by hydrogenation wang et al 16 reported anmbr systems to show a high performance of over 95 removal of polycyclic musks from low strength sulfate wastewater halogenated trocs such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons could also be effectively biodegraded by anaerobic reductive dehalogenation 48 for instance in a combined system comprising mbr and an anaerobic filter pretreatment to treat municipal landfill leachate the anaerobic process reportedly removed 88 of pesticides and 58 of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 49 in addition many researchers have demonstrated the efficiency of anmbrs for antibiotic type trocs removal and reduction in the risk of arg persistence 50 rysz et al 51 observed that tetracycline args disappeared from bacterial cultures more rapidly under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions harb et al 23 indicated that the multiple antibiotic type trocs removal rates in anmbrs were higher than in aembr while the associated antibiotic resistance genes were lower in the anaerobic system fig 1b shows the removal efficiencies of trocs observed in anaerobic digestion ad treatment compared with the ranges in anmbr treatment systems similar to the removal reported by anmbr the compounds removal efficiencies were also significantly variable reported average removals ranging from more than 80 to less than 30 gonz alez gil et al 52 studied the removal of 20 trocs during ad β estradiol galaxolide and triclosan were poor removed with removal efficiency below 20 butkovskyi et al 53 studied the removal of trocs during the composting of sludge coming from a up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb reactor the removal efficiencies of diclofenac carbamazepine metoprolol and triclosan were 85 which higher than their reported by anmbr anmbr systems combining with the characteristics of ad and membrane separation showed a higher average removal efficiency of most trocs than ad treatment however as an advanced ad technology the capacity of anmbr to remove trocs is still limited 54 the bioreactor serves as the primary removal site for trocs the removal rate is believed to depend on oxidation conditions 55 lahti and oikari et al 56 compared naproxen and bisoprolol removal efficiencies under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions the biodegradation rates of naproxen and bisoprolol were 97 3 and 14 1 in anaerobic respectively and about 40 and 35 in aerobic condition some other compounds such as carbamazepine diclofenac and bisphenol a show biological resistance regardless of dissolved oxygen in environments 57 some reports suggest that low dissolved oxygen conditions could favor some trocs degradation cases 26 58 hai et al 59 demonstrated the significantly higher removal efficiencies of carbamazepine in near anoxic conditions compared with those in aerobic and anaerobic conditions in contrast the removal efficiencies of a special group of compounds including ketoprofen ibuprofen and gemfibrozil whose molecular structures lacked sulfur nitrogen or hydrophilic elements were reportedly higher in aembrs alvarino et al 60 investigated the fate of 16 trocs by operated an anaerobic uasb reactor as pre treatment before aerobic mbr process which can enhance trocs biodegradation rates compared to a conventional aerobic anaerobic process consequently the treatment of anaerobic aerobic combined processes is expected to improve the degradation of some common trocs that exhibit specific and non specific in vitro toxicity as well as their metabolites 61 3 fate of trocs in anmbrs 3 1 sorption the removal of trocs in the aqueous phase by anmbr can be attributed to three primary processes hydrolysis adsorption and biodegradation 62 the adsorption of contaminants onto sludge particles or biomass is essential to controlling the trocs removal in anmbr treatment systems this process generally refers to the interaction between chemicals and solid phases 63 nonetheless the physicochemical characteristics of trocs e g hydrogen bond hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions and the adsorbents e g mass concentration largely determine the adsorption efficiency the solid water distribution coefficient k d is vital to quantifying the sorption of trocs onto sludge here k d is defined as the ratio of the concentration of chemicals in the solid to that in the aqueous phase at equilibrium 64 the k d l gss value at equilibrium is expressed by eq 1 1 k d c s o r b e d x s s s s o l u b l e where csorbed is the concentration of a trocs adsorbed on sludge in μg l xss is the concentration of the suspended solids in wastewater or sludge gss l and ssoluble is the concentration of the soluble part of the compound μg l eq 1 assumes the sorption process is in equilibrium and neglects kinetic factors although anmbr systems may be far from equilibrium a prolonged sorption process in anaerobic systems can be achieved 65 supposing that there is no significant biodegradation in a completely mixed system at equilibrium the removal efficiency ηsorb of trocs depends on xss and k d as eq 2 2 η s o r b c s o r b e d c s o r b e d s s o l u b l e k d x s s 1 k d x s s k d c s o r b e d x s s s s o l u b l e generally xss is combined with the concentrations of biomass hence a high sludge concentration in anmbrs 6 10 gss l is likely to be the explanation for their better performance for trocs removal compared with the conventional activated sludge process 2 5 4 0 gss l 10 for most analgesics and anti inflammatory compounds with k d 0 5 l gss adsorption is not the main removal mechanism 66 conversely for compounds with k d 5 l gss such as hormones endocrine disrupting compounds and musk fragrances anmbr systems can remove them via immobilizing them on the sludge and completely detoxifying them by biological degradation the sorption of trocs onto sludge or biomass comprises two mechanisms fig 2 on the one hand trocs retention onto solid surfaces can be attributed to electrostatic interaction the positively charged groups of trocs such as quaternary amines can be adsorbed to the negatively charged surface of the cells 63 the acid dissociation constant pka characterizes the electrostatic interaction on the other hand as a result of the hydrophobicity of trocs the contaminants in the aqueous phase can be adsorbed into the lipid fraction of the sludge consequently the trocs enter into the lipophilic cell membranes of microorganisms thus the further conversion of the compounds is promoted by their reaction with enzymes on the membrane this process can be described by the octanol water partition coefficient kow value which is defined as the ratio of a substance concentration in an octanol saturated phase to its concentration in a water saturated phase 67 as for sludges the kow and pka determine their sorption trends 64 68 previous research has indicated that trocs with medium or high hydrophobic behaviors molecules with high values for kow are preferentially adsorbed onto sludge 68 69 for instance according to alvarino et al 45 substances such as musk fragrances and many other lipophilic trocs adsorbed on granular biomass can accumulate with time however pka is also an important consideration in the aqueous phase ionized or dissociated trocs such as cationic compound trimethoprim can be adsorbed via electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged surfaces of biomass 68 nonetheless the hydrophobic interaction will become unfavorable if the compounds are extensively ionized 70 the hydrophobicity and ionization characteristics of trocs are supposed to be equally considered to obtain a more accurate parameter for the sorption of trocs at different ph values then it can be described by dph the relationship between dph and different species can be determined by eq 3 3 log d p h l o g n o n i o n i z e d i o n i z e d s p e c i e s o c t a n o l n o n i o n i z e d i o n i z e d s p e c i e s w a t e r the hydrophobicity logdph of trocs plays an essential role in the adsorption process at the same ph conditions a higher logdph value means the compound is more hydrophobic normally hydrophobic compounds can exhibit a considerably higher sorption tendency 71 previous experimental data show that anmbrs could achieve higher removal efficiencies for relatively hydrophobic compounds logdph 3 2 at ph 7 than hydrophilic compounds logdph 3 2 at ph 7 20 30 monsalvo et al 20 also reported that the high hydrophobicity of trocs not only can reach the highest removal efficiencies in anmbr but also is conducive to biodegradation in other words these highly hydrophobic compounds were mainly considered to be removed by biodegradation in addition sorption could provide more chances for trocs having sufficient contact with biomass in anmbrs furthermore cheng et al 19 indicated that epss and soluble microbial products smps in anmbrs could also influence the sorption of hydrophilic trocs since the chemical structures of epss contain cationic and anionic functional groups hydrophilic trocs can be adsorbed onto epss by electrostatic interactions 72 73 thus the removal of some antibiotics can be improved through sorption by the eps and smp protein components 35 74 however for those compounds with low logdph the attractive electrostatic interaction between positively charged molecules e g caffeine with logd ph 7 0 63 and negatively charged membranes can also cause strong adsorption 75 previous studies indicate that macrolides having logd ph 7 around 3 could interact with the membrane for their removal 76 in general the k d values of trocs correlate strongly with logdph values as k d measures the distribution between phases and quantifies the sorption whereas logdph is a strong predictor for hydrophobic adsorption 68 nevertheless sorption without further biodegradation would generate a temporary build up of trocs in an anmbr system 20 therefore at very long srts biotransformation plays a primary role in the removal of trocs by anmbrs 42 3 2 biodegradation biodegradation is a crucial mechanism for trocs removal and it contributes greatly to governing trocs accumulation in the sludge phase of the anmbr treatment process 62 the biodegradation of trocs in anmbr systems follows the pseudo first order kinetic model eq 4 77 4 ⅆ c ⅆ t k b i o l x s s s s o l u b l e where c ssoluble are the concentrations of total trocs μg l and the soluble part of the trocs μg l respectively xss is the concentration of suspended solids gss l and t is time d moreover kbiol is defined as the pseudo first order reaction rate constant l gss d and it can digitally describe the maximum biological activity in an anmbr in addition kbiol is commonly obtained in kinetic batch tests thus it is not affected by other operational conditions 45 even though the chemical properties and redox conditions are involved in determining the biological removal efficiency of trocs the biological degradation processes show the relatively low removal efficiencies kbiol 1 l gss d for those containing strong ewgs molecules on the contrary hydrophobic compounds with edgs in their chemical structures are more readily biodegradable 70 wijekoon et al 15 reported that edg compounds hydrophilic or not were significantly removed biodegradability 70 while most hydrophilic trocs and compounds containing ewgs e g nitro and amides were poorly removed biodegradability 50 by anmbrs additionally previous reports demonstrate that methanogenic archaea sulfate reducing iron reducing and nitrate reducing bacteria play a pivotal role in trocs anaerobic biodegradation using nitrate ferric iron or sulfate as electron acceptors at methanogenic conditions 78 in one study 17α ethinylestradiol nonylphenol and most polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons could be significantly biodegraded under nitrate or sulfate reducing conditions 79 nevertheless in the absence of a necessary substance to assist in biodegradation the trocs adsorption on the solid could be the dominant removal mechanism e g 17α ethinylestradiol biodegradation lacking nitrate 80 to date the correlation between the functions of specific anaerobic microbial populations and the removal of trocs is yet to be further investigated the biodegradation of trocs in anmbr is likely to occur through two major pathways metabolism and co metabolism fig 3 81 microorganisms degrade these compounds via metabolism and or co metabolism through the system redox conditions the microbial populations and the degree of trocs hydrolysis in the liquid phase 66 regarding metabolism fig 3a microorganisms consume trocs as the main energy and carbon source to facilitate their biomass growth and generate the relevant enzymes for trocs disintegration however in most instances trocs cannot be used directly for microbial growth owing to their toxicity biological recalcitrance and occurrence in municipal wastewater at extremely low concentrations 82 moreover the microbial community in an anaerobic system is relatively simple thus it is difficult for anaerobic microorganisms to directly catabolize certain trocs therefore co metabolism fig 3b is one of the main pathways in the degradation of refractory compounds 83 in this process the persistent contaminants are converted into more bio transformable intermediate products by specific bacteria and oxidoreductase enzymes 84 so far few studies about co metabolism were performed under anaerobic condition 85 87 notably the acidogenic phase of the ad processes may be the vital in co metabolism degradation of most trocs as compared to acetogenesis methanogenesis 87 the presence of hydrolyzing acidifying bacteria may contribute to benzene ring cracking under anaerobic conditions which facilitates the complete biodegradation of trocs 88 the biodegradation of some trocs can be described from two aspects of their chemical structure and the enzymatic activities a previous study reported that the long chain fatty acid coa ligase played an important role in some trocs removal cases as it targeted carboxyl or hydroxyl groups catalyzing chemical conversion in the initial step of biodegradation 23 furthermore gonzalez gil et al 85 found that acetate kinase could trigger some specific chemical transformations in an anaerobic biological process such as the transformations of galaxolide naproxen nonylphenol ibuprofen diclofenac bisphenol a and triclosan in methanogenesis additionally the biocatalytic action of enzymes participates in the trocs removal and this is strongly dependent on the chemical structure of the trocs in other words compounds containing susceptible functional groups such as carboxyl or hydroxyl group can be transformed examples of such trocs to be well biodegraded 20 in anaerobic processes include acetaminophen clarithromycin erythromycin citalopram climbazole atenolol terbutryn and sulfamethoxazole 89 furthermore co metabolism has also been frequently studied in the case of nitrification 81 84 86 the enzyme ammonium monooxygenase amo has been reported to catalyze the trocs nh3 co metabolism by utilizing elemental oxygen to incorporate hydroxyl functional groups into molecules due to its low specificity 90 apart from co metabolism and metabolism ion trapping has been suggested as a feasible approach to remove aliphatic amines and trocs from liquid in ion trapping the neutral species of amine containing compounds diﬀ use through the cell membrane and further into the acidic vesicles present in eukaryotes to separate them from the aqueous phase 91 this mechanism could be responsible for the incomplete biotransformation of some trocs e g fluoxetine since ion trapping is considered to be sequestrated with microorganisms in addition high pka and lipophilicity compounds are more likely to be removed by ion trapping in anaerobic systems 92 when the anmbr operates for a long period biotransformation gradually becomes the dominant trocs removal mechanism and most of the compounds that are liable to be degraded in anaerobic environment can be steadily removed in this process in addition since almost no excess sludge is generated during anmbr treatment most degraded or and incomplete degraded trocs can be retained in the reactor without being discharged to the external environment 42 thus compared with other biological treatment technologies with shorter srt anmbrs can not only enhance the biodegradation by prolonging the contact time of trocs and biomass but also reduce the occurrence of secondary pollution however it is worth noting that the removal efficiencies of trocs are strongly influenced by their biodegradability under the conditions of low biodegradability trocs are enriched in the solid phase which may lead to the exhaustion of adsorption capacity and deterioration in the anmbr performance 65 for example the presence of some trocs e g carbamazepine diclofenac ibuprofen and naproxen and their principal metabolites in biomass at around 5 μg l can lead to microorganisms death and induce an increase in protein polysaccharide ratio in the bioreactor 93 94 3 3 membrane separation processes owing to the high removal rate of low molecular weight pollutants and the strong ability to purify water quality membrane separation processes and their integration systems have become an important alternative to for trocs removal either in water or wastewater 95 microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are commonly used membrane filtration technologies of mbr in wastewater treatment 96 97 in the advanced treatment of wastewater nanofiltration nf forward osmosis fo and reverse osmosis ro are used to achieve higher effluent standards 98 100 and the application of integration of nf fo ro and membrane distillation md with other systems to generates high quality water is increasing 13 24 30 76 100 103 the membrane acts as a hindrance to remain trocs in the bioreactor by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion or adsorption 104 105 therefore contact between the trocs and the microorganisms inside the bioreactor is prolonged which can contribute to the degradation of the trocs 106 however the removal efficiency of trocs by separation processes mainly depend on the physicochemical properties of the compounds membrane properties i e pore size hydrophobic and fouling levels and so on which make trocs removal difficult to predict 107 3 3 1 membrane properties according to the hydrophilicity of membrane material membrane can be divided into organic membrane and inorganic membrane 108 polysulfone psf polyether sulfone pes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf and other materials are commonly used in the make of organic membranes inorganic materials such as ceramics glass zeolites and metal oxides are important for the manufacture of inorganic membranes 109 some reports suggested that inorganic membranes may be an ideal alternative for the trocs removing under harsh condition 110 112 stylianos k et al 112 investigated the fate and removal of 5 trocs by a ceramic membrane contacting process for ozone and peroxone treatment and the results showed that the ceramic membrane with the highest possible inner surface in each volume can improve the trocs efficiency of the ozone treatment process generally inorganic membranes are relatively stable but the cost of inorganic materials too high to be used on a large scale so most mbr use organic polymeric membranes at present the application and operation of mf and uf are relatively simple and their transmembrane pressure are much lower than other membrane separation technologies mf and uf are separating based techniques in this process trocs are not retained but undergo by size exclusion generally the pore sizes 0 01 0 1 μm and molecular weight cutoff ranging from 1 to 200 kda of mf uf are larger than the molecular sizes of trocs 113 in addition due to the high solubility of trocs mf and uf are considered to be inefficient in removing dissolved solutes from water 76 the sorption of lipophilic trocs such as musk fragrances onto membrane surfaces has been observed in some commonly used hydrophobic membranes 114 the electrostatic interactions between trocs and the membrane surfaces can also affect the sorption of trocs by the membranes 99 nghiem et al 115 reported that hydrogen bonds formation on the membrane surface could also enhance the trocs retention membrane fouling is a major weakness of mf uf membrane filtration processes 116 saturated membranes lower the trocs removal efficiencies by reducing flux and hence retention additionally in comparison with aembr the high concentrations of solids and suspended matter in anmbr could increase the tendency for severe membrane fouling 117 however some trocs can be captured by the fouling layer and become absorbed onto the mf uf membrane surface thereby enhancing the trocs removal efficiencies 118 similar findings by monsalvo et al 20 indicated that in a microfiltration anmbr the retention by fouling layers contributed significantly to the removal of 17α ethinylestradiol estrone octylphenol and bisphenol a the retention of trocs in the fouling layers could explain the slightly higher removal efficiency reported for the mbr over those obtained by conventional biology treatments nf ro and fo processes have been proven to be effective in removing trocs however the drawback of these processes is the high energy consumption caused by their high transmembrane pressure 119 yoon et al 120 used a nf membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 200 da the rejection ratios for 52 endocrine disrupting compounds ranged from 0 to more than 90 the variation of nf rejection ratios may cause by the hydrophilicity and or molecular weight cutoff of trocs regarding the fo membrane process the rejection by fo membranes has been studied for a wide range of trocs and has shown great potential 102 103 121 122 the trocs could be completely removed in fo process due to the forward flux blockage by the reverse solute flux of the draw solute which has been shown to achieve higher rejections compared to the pressure used gradient in ro process 3 3 2 hybrid system some post treatment membrane processes such as nf ro fo and md are specifically applied to enhance the trocs removal efficiency for example the rejection rates of trocs increased from about 20 to almost 100 by a stand alone nf process 98 in another study combining an anmbr with a downstream nf unit the removal efficiency of trocs could be improved by 80 92 36 furthermore thin film composite nf and ro membranes could significantly reject most of the negatively charged compounds but for neutral chemicals the rejection mainly relied on the molecular weights of the compounds 29 76 furthermore in order to overcome the serious fouling issue which driven by hydraulics as the driving force for both anmbr and post treatment such as ro and nf kim et al 103 proposed a protocol for anaerobic fertilizer drawn forward osmosis membrane bioreactor by integrating anmbr with fo instead of conventional pressurized membrane processes this system can effectively remove contaminants and reduce the membrane fouling problem song et al 30 reported that integrating md into an anmbr could increase the overall removal efficiencies of 26 selected trocs from 76 to almost 100 forward osmosis and md have shown low membrane fouling potentials and very high removal efficiencies for even compounds that could be barely removed by anmbr systems 4 factors affecting trocs removal in anmbrs 4 1 physicochemical properties 4 1 1 chemical structure and hydrophobicity the removal of trocs in anmbr systems is highly dependent on their molecular structure and physicochemical properties regarding their chemical structure there is no significant distinction between removals of heterocyclic or non heterocyclic compounds 123 similarly no discernible difference between the removals of mononuclear and polynuclear compounds has been reported despite the difficulty in correlating the removal efficiency to compound complexity aliphatic monocyclic aromatic compounds containing edgs are generally more biodegradable while polycyclic compounds containing ewgs are less susceptible to decomposition 124 commonly in anaerobic systems hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic compounds possessing strong ewgs show consistently low removal efficiencies 15 123 hydrophilic compounds can be easily discharged with the effluent from the reactor owing to their feebleness absorption capacity additionally the presence of ewgs in the chemical structure can generate an electron deficiency which makes the chemical difficult to serve as an oxidizing agent on the contrary high removal efficiencies were recorded in anmbrs for compounds with edgs such as hydroxyl and primary amine groups 69 the edg promotes the biodegradation through the strengthening of electrophilic attack by anaerobic bacteria for example atenolol is likely transformed biotransformation accounting for 20 into atenolol acid through amide hydrolysis in anaerobic sludge via enzymatic reactions 89 125 however the degradation of trocs may be initiated by the mere cleavage of a side chain structure and the nucleus complexity may contribute to further mineralization regardless of the structure of the compound 123 thus the trocs removal efficiency in anmbrs may not entirely represent the complete mineralization of the contaminants 4 1 2 molecular weight the biotransformation of high molecular weight compounds can be enhanced by membrane filtration in anmbrs a higher molecular weight means the chemical structure may have more complex branches and the microbes have a higher chance to selectively cleave to a certain target site to initiate degradation tadkaew et al 123 reported an overall removal of up to 60 for compounds with a molecular weight of over 300 g mol while compounds with molecular weights less than 300 g mol presented no or little removal to over 98 4 2 operating conditions 4 2 1 srt and hrt combining different operating parameters may optimize the trocs removal in anmbr treatment the srt and hydraulic retention time hrt are the most significant factors in the anmbr operation 66 it has been reported that prolonged srt notably increases the biomass concentration to enhance trocs removal 126 thus a long srt is one of the advantages of anmbrs over other biological treatment systems anaerobic sludge intercepted by membrane modules in the bioreactor can retain the hardly degradable compounds within the highly concentrated sludge which can become more biodegradable with increasing sludge retention time 127 not only is a longer srt beneficial for methanogenesis to increase biogas production but it also enhances the anaerobic microbial degradation of trocs during the methanogenesis process nonetheless due to the slow growth of anaerobic microorganisms a long srt is inevitable mostly an srt of between 150 and 180 days is sufficient for the majority of trocs to be eliminated from anmbr systems in addition the srt changes trocs degradation pathways of the reactor as reported by xiao et al 31 in an anmbr operation with long srt 150 d biodegradation was the decisive mechanism to remove the five selected trocs adsorption only contributed significantly to the removal of highly hydrophobic chemicals within the initial phase about 10 days the hrt is an important factor in the system operation to maintain the microbial activity and ensure system efficiency of the anmbr several studies indicate that the influences of hrt on trocs removal in anmbr treatments may not be significant within the range of 2 20 h 128 129 hu et al 130 demonstrated that tetrahydrofuran could be effectively removed in an anmbr treating phacs wastewater at an hrt of 24 h decreasing the hrt to 12 h showed a considerable decline in the biological removal efficiency because microbial activities were inhibited additionally due to higher biomass concentrations in anmbrs a very short hrt may cause membrane fouling 131 while a long hrt e g hrts 18 h could significantly mitigate membrane fouling could significantly mitigate 132 therefore optimizing the hrt or srt in anmbrs may be crucial to enhancing trocs removal and controlling membrane fouling 4 2 2 ph in anmbrs ph is an important factor that affects both the sorption and biological processes for trocs removal the dominant microorganisms involved in the trocs biodegradation and the activity of the enzymes are ph dependent according to sanguanpak et al 133 higher removal efficiencies of trocs are associated with low ph conditions due to the increase in lipophilicity variations in ph might also impact the dissociation of certain chemicals that possess distinct functional classes e g neutral cationic and anionic 134 tadkaew et al 135 demonstrated that the removal efficiencies of ionizable chemicals such as most analgesics and anti inflammatory drugs were largely ph dependent on the contrary the removal of non ionizable compounds in anmbrs depends more on their physicochemical properties during treatment furthermore during long term filtration in an anmbr membrane fouling can emerge as one of the most crucial issues especially when the system is operated at highly acidic or alkaline conditions 136 4 2 3 temperature temperature is one of the most significant factors that affect the performance of anmbrs since the microorganism growth and activity vary with temperature changes 137 138 moreover the organic compound degradation mechanism can change with temperature for example in one study under mesophilic 25 3 c and thermophilic 35 3 c conditions the biodegradation of tetrahydrofuran in an anmbr was the major mechanism for degradation while the physical removal by membranes dominated at low temperatures of 15 3 c 130 despite the large number of studies focused on the operation of anmbrs under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions operating anmbrs under moderate to low temperatures is more realistic for municipal wastewater treatment 139 the ability of anmbrs to strongly tolerate temperature fluctuations between 12 c and 26 c ensures their stable removal efficiency even at low temperatures 140 the factors discussed above and their influences on trocs removal are summarized in table 3 4 3 anmbr processes augmentation the addition of different forms of activated carbon i e pac and gac and artificial biomass carriers i e sponges and plastic supports to anmbr treatments can be used to improve some of the specific features of these systems and enhance the removal of certain classes of trocs for example the use of pac can simultaneously improve the sorption of trocs and biodegradation of medium biodegradability compounds such as carbamazepine and diclofenac 31 141 besides adding activated carbon in anmbr can smoother membrane surface which could control the further fouling 18 142 luo et al 143 studied a sponge based hybrid moving bed biofilm reactor membrane bioreactors mbbrs for the treatment of a set of 22 trocs this study observed that hydrophobic compounds were well removed and the overall trocs removal efficiency was higher than that in mbr operating under the same conditions according to the fate of the trocs in anmbr process the biotransformation of trocs mainly through the co metabolic pathway lack of enzymes involved in the co metabolic process or low enzyme activity may results in the low removal efficiency of trocs by anmbr treatment the application of enzyme augmentation on anmbr system for the removal of these persistent trocs can led to positive results 144 a recent study demonstrated that acetate kinase involved in the co metabolic of several trocs removal i e sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen atenolol and clarithromycin in anaerobic environments 145 in another study a combination of laccase and hollow fiber membrane bioreactor was applied to remove acetaminophen methaminoic acid and carbamazepine in this study the hybrid system achieved almost total trocs elimination and the membrane fouling was reduced 146 the utilization of enzymes can lower the risk of emerging resistance to micropollutants in compare with microbes the utilization of enzymes can lower the menace of emerging resistance to trocs mainly antibiotics in compare with microbes 147 however enzymatic activities were generally not elevated suggesting that the exogenous enzymes were inactivated within one day therefore requiring regular supplementation however some studies reported that the exogenous enzymes added into the reactor were inactivated within one day so it needs to be replenished regularly therefore the addition of enzymes has only a short term effect and the enzymatic activities in bioreactor were almost not elevated furthermore anaerobic electrochemical membrane bioreactor anembr is also can be considered as a promising choice that can improve the removal efficiency of trocs and reduce the membrane fouling however more researches are needed to be conduct on the feasibility of anembr for trocs wastewater treatment 148 149 5 challenges and future perspectives 5 1 challenges despite the high potential of anmbr for the removal of specific recalcitrant contaminants from wastewater there remain notable challenges especially for the treatment of municipal sewage these challenges include the extremely low concentration of trocs in municipal wastewater and the complex physicochemical properties of the trocs the slow microorganism metabolic rates the low microbial community diversity in anaerobic systems and the adverse effects of the trocs in contrast to aerobic systems slow microorganism metabolic rates and low microbial community diversity are the drawbacks to the overall trocs removal efficiency in anaerobic treatment 64 in addition the concentrations of trocs in sewage at trace levels limit the use of most trocs as a primary substrate in microbial metabolism adsorption and hydrolysis dominate the removal of trocs in the initial stage of anmbr treatment thus the potential threats of trocs to the environment remain owing to the incomplete elimination of trocs by anmbr systems the presence of trocs in anmbr may cause negative effects on the various processes cannot be overstated wang z et al 154 reported that the presence of trocs in anmbrs may induce the change of sludge when anaerobic sludge was exposed to cyclophosphamide of approximately 5 μg l the floc sizes significantly increased similarly the presence of some antibiotics e g carbamazepine can induce the sludge deflocculation which consequently causes severe membrane fouling and weakens the bioreactor performance owing to the biomass decomposition 155 furthermore the outcome of trocs removal in anmbr is still not totally understood thus further studies need to be carried out to elucidate the main degradation pathways of trocs with varying properties and the products formed during the biodegradation under anaerobic conditions moreover the relative toxicity and side effects of trocs compared with the parent compounds should be assessed 71 in the case of co metabolism as the main pathway for trocs degradation substantial studies are required to determine the roles of other active enzymes and the possible chemical reactions in anaerobic biodegradation 5 2 future perspectives anmbrs show good promise for the removal of trocs and the provision of high quality effluent in municipal wastewater treatment because of their unique operating conditions such as long srt specific functional genes enzymes and membrane separation adsorption and biodegradation may simultaneously contribute to the trocs removal in anmbrs for the low hydrophobic compounds molecular weight chemical structure and specific functional groups may affect their biodegradability and consequently decide the overall removal efficiency the inclusion of physical retention mechanisms in wastewater treatment can be considered to enhance the ability to removing recalcitrant trocs for example the addition of activated carbon in bioreactors can enhance the trocs removal by promoting sorption furthermore the removal of medium biodegradability compounds can be enhanced by adding pac in biological reactors which facilitates both the biodegradation and sorption processes 31 it is reported that trocs containing edgs molecules can be effectively removed by anmbr treatment while trocs such as diclofenac ketoprofen naproxen and erythromycin have relatively limited dehalogenation hydrogenation ability under the anaerobic condition 62 125 for this case the removal of trocs relies on the enzymatic activities in biological processes thus the application of specific enzymes in biological wastewater treatment to target the recalcitrant compounds has become a promising alternative in addition the enzyme usage will lower the risk of causing bacterial resistance to chemicals 156 158 gebreyohannes et al 159 established a set of methods for the biodegradation of recalcitrant chemicals using native extractive enzymes cell free lysates from activated sludge these methods lay a foundation for the use of native enzymes for trocs degradation given that in long term operations pressure driven membranes are more susceptible to fouling combining innovative membrane technology such as fo and md with the anmbr technology provides new insights for further improvement 6 conclusions anaerobic mbrs provide a feasible option to tackle the potential threats posed by trocs during water reclamation sorption and biodegradation are the dominant mechanisms contributing to trocs removal in anmbrs and the combination of membrane separation processes with anmbrs results in a more efficient performance compared with the conventional biological treatment the sorption efficiency is associated with the hydrophobicity and ionization characteristics of the trocs while the biodegradation which includes co metabolism and metabolism results in a high trocs removal efficiency owing to the high biomass concentrations and long srts 150 180 days in anmbrs despite that the classification scheme and predictive framework of the trocs removal have been based on kow kbiol pka structure and k d values it is still too early to establish a specific removal mechanism for trocs with various physicochemical properties and under different physical or chemical environments e g temperature and ph moreover the sustainable application of anmbrs requires further investigation of how to reduce the side effects e g the risk of increased membrane fouling of introducing trocs in bioreactors and how to enhance the anmbr operation by combining

13651,graphene based membranes are widely used in the separation of various molecules and ions due to their unique size barrier properties here a hydroxylated graphene goh and graphene oxide go composite nanofiltration membrane was prepared by vacuum filtration go was hydrophilic and softly and easily to wrinkle and stack into a dense go membrane goh which contained more sp2 hybridized aromatic ring structures was more rigid than go sheets and tended to form loose porous structure it could be found that goh was well embedded into the soft layer of go to form a membrane then the performance of the composite membrane go goh was evaluated through typical dye molecules and proteins when the goh content in the composite membrane was less than 50 wt it had no significant effect on the retention of methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb and bovine serum albumin bsa 99 4 but the pure water permeability was 3 6 4 5 times that of the pure go membrane reaching 22 7 26 5 l m 2 h 1 in this work the superior water flux of the go goh composite membrane compared to the reference go membrane was mainly attributed to the moderate increase of interlayer spacing and nanochannels of the membrane keywords nanofiltration membrane graphene nano spacer dye separation 1 introduction with the rapid growth of the global population and the continuous development of industrialization the shortage of water resources and pollution of the water environment on which people depend for survival have become increasingly serious 1 3 at present the commonly used methods for separating dyes from industrial and domestic waste water are adsorption and membrane separation 4 6 among them the most important membrane separation technology is the application of nanofiltration nf membrane technology and process 7 nanofiltration ranges between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis with an average pore size between 0 5 2 0 nm and is often used to separate solute mixtures with a molecular weight of 200 1000 da solvent solute mixture 8 10 however when using an nf membrane for water treatment such nf membranes should have the properties of easy material availability high selectivity high flux improved stability and allowable special solvents 11 12 for example porous ceramic membranes are considered to have the best chemical resistance and waste water purification performance however they also have disadvantages that can not be ignored such as expensive fragile and poor anti fouling performance 13 14 the defects of these membrane materials also hinder their further application prospects therefore current research is mainly focused on finding new nf membrane materials with the best separation performance 15 16 in recent years graphene and graphene oxide go as new two dimensional nanomaterials have unique properties such as excellent physical and chemical stability single atomic layer thickness and controllable chemical surface 17 21 therefore many researchers regard it as a material with great application potential in the preparation of efficient separation of nf membranes however it is well known that the go structure contains sp2 hybridized aromatic ring structures and partially sp3 hybridized oxygen rich regions containing epoxy coc carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl co h 19 21 from the microscopic morphology it can be seen that the surface of go is no longer as smooth and flat as graphene but the surface dwrinkles similar to ridge and valley undulations 22 23 this may be due to the fact that go obtained by strong oxidation treatment may become much softer than graphene in fact other research groups have evaluated the fatigue strength of graphene and go cui et al 19 applied an improved atomic force microscope afm technique to study the fatigue resistance of graphene and go the results showed that the fatigue life of single layer graphene was more than 109 cycles when the average stress was 71 gpa which was much higher than that of go on the one hand a large number of oxygen containing functional groups on go are the main reason for the decrease of its mechanical fatigue resistance on the other hand the presence of oxygen containing functional groups makes go highly hydrophilic water molecules can enter the interlayer domain or connect with oxygen containing functional groups at the edges by hydrogen bonding 24 25 therefore go sheets have high stack ability and are easy to form go membranes under external forces unfortunately the interlayer spacing of go membrane is relatively narrow 0 8 nm which largely limits its further application 23 26 therefore most researchers usually reduce the thickness of the go membrane or expand the d spacing to increase the water flux of the nf membrane 27 among them expanding the d spacing is considered promising for example carbon nanotubes 11 28 29 inorganic nanoparticles 30 32 and metal organic frameworks 33 are embedded under the layer of go membrane to expand the nanochannels of the go membrane however these nanoparticles can only play a partial role in the expansion of the interlayer spacing of the go membrane and there are often phenomena such as agglomeration of nanoparticles obviously graphene sheet also plays an important role in the formation of the nanochannels some research groups 34 35 changed the nanochannel size of the membrane by controlling the reduction degree of graphene oxide joshi and nair et al 36 37 thought that in go membranes the pristine sp2 graphene domains provide fast low friction channels for water flow and the oxygen functional groups clustered together act as spacers to provide appropriate spaces for water transport abraham et al 38 reported that the in plane oxygen functional groups can hinder the water transport in graphene nanochannels by hydrogen bond interaction however there is still a lack of systematic basic research on the effect of graphene nanosheets on the performance of graphene or go membrane compared with graphene the surface of hydroxylated graphene contains a large number of hydrophilic functional groups oh which is beneficial to improve the dispersibility of goh nanosheets in water this makes it easy for the goh and go nanosheets to form a uniformly dispersed mixture in water which is conducive to the formation of composite nanofiltration membranes compared with go the aromatic ring structure in the goh structure is more complete which makes it contain a large number of sp2 graphene domains therefore the hardness of goh nanosheets is also higher we speculated that goh could be used as a sheet layer nano spacer to increase the interlayer spacing of the go layer and effectively prevent the accumulation of go sheets in addition the sp2 graphene domains on goh provide fast low friction channels for water flow hence by changing the go goh ratio the influence of the hardness of graphene nanosheets on the performance of the composite membrane can be systematically studied in this work go goh composite nanofiltration membrane was prepared by simple vacuum filtration method then we studied the influence of the addition of goh nanosheets on the morphology structure and hydrophilicity of the nf membrane the permeability and retention properties of typical dyes proteins nanoparticles and salt solutions of the nf membrane was also analyzed as expected compared with the pure go nf membrane the water flux of the composite nf membrane was significantly improved after adding goh sheets and it also had excellent retention of typical dye molecules 2 experimental 2 1

chloride purchased from sinopharm reagent co ltd pes membrane pore size 0 22 μm and 1 μm purchased from zhejiang haiyan new oriental plastics technology co ltd polystyrene microspheres particle size 500 nm purchased from macklin technology co ltd the entire experiment process uses deionized water produced by the ultrapure water filtration system millipore mill q with a resistivity 18 2 mω cm 2 2 synthesis of hydroxylated graphene goh the preparation of goh refers to the previous work method 39 100 ml of graphene dispersion with a concentration of 1 mg ml was added to the flask and heated to 35 c 0 1 mol l dilute hcl solution was used to adjust the ph to acidity 0 98 g of ferrous chloride was weighed into the graphene dispersion stirred for 5 min completely dissolved and ultrasonically dispersed h2o2 and deionized water were diluted at a volume ratio of 1 3 and then added to the reaction system by a microinjection pump at an injection rate of 50 ml h by controlling the reaction time the amount of h2o2 added to the reaction system was changed to obtain goh materials having different degrees of modification the reaction time was 60 min 120 min and 180 min and the samples obtained are denoted as goh 60 goh 120 and goh 180 respectively graphene was processed in the same way except that h2o2 was not used and the final sample was marked as g the reaction product was filtered and washed with 0 1 mol l hcl to remove residual iron ions in the product the potassium thiocyanate was used to check whether the iron ions were removed then the deionized water was washed to neutrality finally the product was placed in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h 2 3 preparation of graphene oxide go graphene oxide go is prepared by modified hummers 40 41 the preparation process was mainly divided into three stages low temperature medium temperature and high temperature 2 4 preparation of composite membrane in this work go was first dispersed in deionized water to form a 0 1 mg ml solution and goh was also dispersed to prepare a 0 1 mg ml solution the total mass of go and goh loaded on each membrane was 2 mg for example 1 0 mg of go and 1 0 mg of goh were taken out and mixed into a beaker then ultrasonically disperse the go and goh dispersions by 0 5 h finally the mixed solution was deposited on the pes membrane by vacuum filtration the sample was named go goh 120 min 50 wt the composite membranes prepared by adding different weights of goh was recorded as 0 wt pure go 20 wt 40 wt 50 wt 60 wt 80 wt 100 wt place the pes membrane in water before used 2 5 characterizations of membranes the surface and cross sectional morphology of the nanofiltration membrane were characterized using a scanning electron microscope sem gemini sem500 a suitable size sample of the membrane was stuck on the conductive adhesive then it was placed on the scanning electron microscope sample stage to observe the cross section the sample needs to be placed in liquid nitrogen to fragile all samples were gold plated before testing and then scanned under 10 kv scanning voltage x ray solid powder diffraction xrd was carried out using a scanning mode of dx 2007 and 5 50 using a cu ka radiation x ray diffraction system the average interlayer spacing of the sample nf membranes was measured according to bragg s law the water contact angle of the membranes were charactered by a test system contact angle analyzer dca 322 thermo cahn usa a syringe dropped approximately 1 μl of water droplets on the surface of the membrane and captured a static image after the water droplets stabilized it should be noted that at least five different places were selected to measure five points note that at least five different locations were selected to measure and average them to obtain reliable data 2 6 evaluation of the membrane separation performance two typical dyes with different molecular weights including mo and rhb at a concentration of 10 ppm were used to test the separation performance of the membrane on the dye additionally the retention performance of different membranes on ps microspheres diameter 500 nm 100 ppm and bsa 500 ppm was tested in the experiment the support membrane was polyethersulfone pes with a pore size of 0 22 μm when testing the membrane s retention of ps microspheres the pore size of the supporting membrane was 1 μm and the ps microspheres can pass the salt solution separation performance of the membrane was evaluated using aqueous solutions of na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 with a concentration of 1000 ppm in each experiment the effective area of the membrane sample was 12 56 cm 2 a the tests were all carried out at a low pressure of 1 bar the water flux was expressed as j l m2 h 1 bar 1 by collecting permeated water v through the membrane before evaluation the membrane was pre compressed under a pressure of 1 bar for 30 min finally the experiment was measured more to determine the average permeability and then the formula was calculated j v a t p where t is the operating time for membrane measurement when the membrane is filtered for 1 h and the pressure stabilizes at 1 bar record the pure water flux j0 the same method was used to determine the membrane permeation flux among them the dye was a 10 ppm solution of mo and rhb during and at the end of each membrane operation the concentration of retentate and permeate defined as cf and cp respectively can be recorded to monitor the change in retention rate the concentrations of mo and rhb dyes in the feed and permeation were measured by using uv vis spectrophotometry the rejection ratios can be calculated by the following equation r 1 cp cf 100 the rejection rate of four typical salt solution membranes nacl mgcl2 na2so4 and mgso4 with a concentration of 1000 ppm each time before we change to other feed solutions the membrane must be washed with di in the filter tank then stir at 400 rpm for a certain period of time to eliminate the influence of the previous solute in the experimental analysis the concentration change of the inorganic salt solution was measured by a conductivity meter lichen china the changes in the concentration of dye and bsa were measured at the maximum absorption wavelength by tu 1901 dual beam uv vis spectrophotometer in order to ensure the repeatability of experimental results each group of samples has been subjected to at least three repeated separation performance tests 2 7 antifouling performance measurements in measuring the anti fouling performance of the membrane the test was conducted using bovine serum albumin bsa at a concentration of 500 ppm the test condition was 1 bar the test duration was 330 min and the water flux of the membranes was recorded every 15 min the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes were evaluated by a dynamic fouling test with bsa 42 all the foulant concentration in feed solution was set to 500 ppm first during 90 min the water flux record j0 every 15 min was used as the pure water flux of a new membrane then the tank was fed with 500 ppm of foulant solution during 135 min the water flux was recorded every 15 min j1 after filtration the membrane was thoroughly washed with milli q water again the pure water flux was measured j2 very 15 min for 105 min to analyze the fouling process recovery ratio frr j2 j0 100 total fouling ratio rt j0 j1 j0 100 reversible fouling ratio rr j2 j1 j0 100 irreversible fouling ratio rir j0 j2 j0 100 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the preparation process of the go goh composite nanofiltration membrane since the surface of the goh sheet contains hydroxyl functional groups when the goh sheet was mixed with the go sheet under the action of π π interactions and hydrogen bonds the two exhibited good compatibility therefore uniform dispersions of goh and go flakes with different mass ratios was prepared and then a uniformly filled go goh composite membrane was formed on the pes support membrane via vacuum filtration the preparation flow chart in fig 1 shows the structure of the final go goh nanofiltration membrane a large number of oxygen functional groups and dense packing on the surface of pure go seriously hinder the passage of water molecules the addition of goh sheet could not further block the passage of water molecules on the contrary water molecules may flow quickly in the sp2 graphene domain with low friction and low loss therefore when goh was used as a nanosheet spacer embedded in the go sheet the dense go membrane structure was opened and the nanochannel was enlarged fig 1 a is a photo of a typical go goh composite membrane in which goh accounts for 40 wt it could be seen that the go goh composite membrane had a uniform appearance darkened and reflective the membrane of pure goh sheet was black fig s2 photo of goh membrane with different content fig 1 b is a sem of composite membrane from the high resolution sem in fig 1b it seems that there are both wrinkled go and rigid goh nanosheets in addition in the supplementary material fig s1 the pure go membrane fig s1 a and the pure goh membrane fig s1 g can be found to be different in appearance for composite membranes fig s1 b f shown the sem morphologies of different goh ratios with the increase of goh content the existence of the two can be gradually distinguished in addition xrd characterization can also be combined to prove the existence of go and goh in the composite membrane the xrd of the pure go membrane had obvious characteristic peaks around 10 fig 4 a while the xrd of the pure goh film did not when the two were compounded in different proportions the characteristic peaks of go and goh existed in theory multi layer graphene sheets can be used as a kind of nano spacers to expand the nano channels of go based membranes unfortunately due to the lack of hydrophilic functional groups on its surface graphene has poor dispersibility in water therefore goh was used to make up for the disadvantages of poor graphene dispersion fig 2 d is a typical tem image of go it could be seen that the surface of the single layer or double layer go sheet had obvious wrinkles at the same time fig 2 c shows a high resolution tem with multiple layers of goh whose thickness is mainly concentrated in layers 6 7 in addition in order to verify that the dispersibility of goh in water was higher than that of graphene different dispersions were prepared and recorded as graphene dispersions g and goh dispersions obtained at different reaction times were expressed as goh x min x 15 min 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min 180 min and go dispersions the concentration of different dispersions was1 0 mg ml which was used in static sedimentation experiments the results showed that at the beginning of the experiment there was no obvious difference between the different dispersions and the solute did not delaminate or settle fig 2 a however after 5 h the graphene g dispersion had obvious delamination and sedimentation phenomena fig 2 b at the same time there was no similar phenomenon in goh and go dispersions compared with the dispersibility of graphene in water the hydrophilicity of the goh dispersion obtained by the hydroxylation treatment was improved in addition we could find that 60 h after the start of the experiment fig s3 there were significant differences in the goh dispersion obtained at different treatment times from right to left the upper layer of the dispersion gradually becomes transparent and the goh sedimentation height of the lower layer gradually decreases therefore we believed that as the reaction time of the preparation process increased the dispersibility of goh in water was better to further demonstrate the relationship between hydrophilicity and the oxygen containing groups in the material as expected goh had a higher oxygen content than g and increased with processing time fig 2 e the c o 48 01 of g was much higher than that of goh 180 5 61 which means that goh 180 material had a higher number of oxygen containing functional groups fig 2 f of course both of them had higher c o than go 2 11 therefore we believe that a lower c o value is conducive to increased hydrophilicity according to the xps analysis of fig 4 the c1s peaks of different graphene samples g goh 60 goh 120 goh 180 and go correspond to fig 6 a e based on the above results goh could be used as a nano separator to prepare a go goh composite membrane in fig 3 the microstructure of the membrane was observed with scanning electron microscope sem the surface sem images of the pure go nanofiltration membrane figs 3 a and s1 a showed that the surface of the go membrane had ripples and wrinkles however the surface of the membrane was dense and had no obvious defects which was not conducive to the passage of water molecule 34 therefore the flux of go membrane was small about 5 8 6 2 l m 2 h 1 the cross section of the sem fig 3 a1 shown that the pure go membranes appeared densely stacked and well aligned layered structure with a thickness of 0 88 μm the sem image of the pes support membrane fig s1 h appeared a smooth surface with a pore size of several hundred nanometers after the go dispersion was filtered through vacuum a dense wrinkled go layer was gradually deposited on the surface of the pes microporous support fig s1 a the surface of go goh composite nanofiltration membrane fig 3 b g became rougher than go membrane and the surface roughness of the membrane changed significantly with the increase of goh content this phenomenon could also be seen in fig s2 photos of goh composite membranes with different contents it could be found that as the goh content increased the light reflection of the membrane surface decreased and the roughness increased the comparison between pure go membrane fig s2 a and pure goh membrane fig s2 g was more obvious the addition of goh broke the densely packed structure of the original pure go membranes a large number of goh nanosheets were used as spacers to be embedded in go based membranes which caused defects on the surface of the composite membrane the existence of these defects may helped to improve the permeability of membranes since goh acted as a nanosheet spacer in the go base membrane as the goh content increased the membrane thickness increased from 0 88 μm to 2 84 μm fig 3 a1 g1 43 this might be explained by the reason that the pure go nanosheets were soft and easy to form continuous nonporous membrane while the pure goh nanosheets were rigid which was conducive to the formation of loose porous membrane therefore the surface defects and internal two dimensional nanochannels formed by embedding goh would increase the permeability of go goh membrane fig 4 a shows the xrd pattern of the membrane pure go had a fairly narrow and strong diffraction peak at about 10 64 similar to the previous report 44 according to bragg s law which is used to calculate the basal spacing between the planes in the atomic lattice of the layered materials the xrd pattern of go membrane shown that the d spacing was 0 830 nm due to the addition of few layers of goh there may be partially goh intercalating go it can be seen from xrd that the peak position of the composite membrane with goh was slightly shifted compared with that of the pure go membrane for the go goh composite membrane when the goh content was 50 wt the interlayer spacing increased to 0 924 nm which was beneficial to improve the permeability of the membrane moreover we also tested the hydrophilicity of the membrane as shown in fig 4 b as the goh content increased the water contact angle of these composite membranes gradually increased this phenomenon was mainly due to the fact that although the goh sheet contained hydrophilic functional groups oh its type and quantity were not as good as go the lower contact angle 33 2 of pure go membrane also confirmed that it contained more oxygen functional groups since the hydrophilicity of goh was between g and go the hydrophilicity of goh was weaker than that of go the total amount of goh and go goh on the pes support membrane in the manuscript was 2 mg therefore as the proportion of goh increases the go content in the composite membrane decreased finally for the composite membrane the overall hydrophilicity would gradually decrease and the contact angle would increase in addition the higher surface roughness of the pure goh membrane could be one of the important reasons for its larger contact angle 62 7 we systematically studied the repellency of the go goh membrane to dyes bsa and polystyrene microspheres ps fig 5 size distribution of dye molecules bsa and ps microspheres were showed in table s1 the water flux of go goh composite membrane with goh 120 as a nano spacer with the increase of the amount of goh 120 the water flux of the membrane increased fig 5 a the goh 120 content increased from 0 to 50 wt and the water flux of the membrane was about 4 times higher than that of the pure go membrane its water flux increased approximately from 6 1 24 5 l m 2 h 1 in addition combined with the rejection of dye by composite membrane fig 5 b with the increase of goh content the water flux increased and the membranes rejection rates of small molecule dye mo and rhb solution were 99 4 and 99 6 respectively the separation performance of go goh 120 min 50 wt was superior to that of most previously reported go based membranes as shown in table s2 fig s6 a and b uv vis absorption spectra of mo and rhb feed and filtrate also confirmed this therefore when goh was used it was beneficial to increase the water flux of the membrane and hardly affect rejection this could be attribute that in the go goh composite membranes goh acts as a nano layer spacer providing a suitable interlayer distance to accommodate water molecules and a large number of original graphitized sp2 domains to promote rapid water permeability through nearly frictionless flow 36 in fig s5 we also studied the water flux and rejection rate of composite membranes prepared with g and other goh 60 min and 180 min as spacers taking the membrane with goh 50 wt as an example their water fluxes were 29 2 25 2 and 22 7 l m 2 h 1 respectively therefore from the perspective of water flux fg f60 min f120 min f180 min the rejection rate of mo dyes for example their rejection rates were 92 6 98 1 99 4 and 99 6 respectively therefore from the rejection of dyes the order was rg r60 min r120 min r180 min the reason could be attributed to the fact that when goh was prepared the number of oxygen containing functional groups continued to increase with the extension of the reaction time 60 180 min the increase of oxygen containing functional groups had a certain obstructive effect on the flow of water molecules at the same time when goh was used as a nano spacer and go sheet was stacked to form a membrane there might exist some electrostatic force and hydrogen bond between the goh 180 sheets and the go sheet 15 29 therefore goh 120 as a nanosheet spacer had the most excellent membrane performance when the goh 120 content increased from 60 to 100 wt the flux of the membrane increased rapidly from 27 6 3811 l m 2 h 1 while the rejection rate of the membrane dropped sharply these results could be attributed to the fact that excessive goh changed the dense packing structure of the membrane combined with the sem of membrane figs 1 and s1 when the goh 120 content increased to 80 wt fig 1 f and 100 wt fig 1 g the membrane structure morphology appeared the substantial increase in surface roughness and defects from the sem cross section the accumulation between the go membrane and the layer contained a certain amount of goh composite membrane fig 1 a1 a4 was relatively dense and there were no obvious defects however when the goh content reached 80 wt fig 1 f1 and 100 wt fig 1 g1 the membrane thickness increased significantly to 2 03 and 2 84 μm the membrane structure showed that the goh sheets were piled up in a loose form and a large gap was formed between the sheets therefore this membrane structure had a poor rejection effect on dye molecules however our work also confirmed that this loose membrane structure still had a good retention effect on the large particle size ps microspheres 500 nm fig 5 b r 98 1 the pore size 1 μm of the supporting membrane pes used without rejecting ps microspheres the long term stability of the membrane is very important for its practical application here mo 10 ppm and rhb 10 ppm two dye solutions were used to test the long term stability of the composite membrane compared with other ratio membranes go goh goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane had higher dye retention and permeability so it was used for membrane long term stability test operating pressure was 1 bar the water permeability and rejection of the goh go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane were measured during the test time of 300 min the results were showed in fig 6 in general the water flux and dye rejection of the goh 120 min 50 wt membrane remained stable exhibiting only small fluctuations the water flux of the membrane fluctuates in the range of 24 4 22 3 l m 2 h 1 while the rejection of the dye fluctuates in the range of 99 7 99 0 this result showed that the goh go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane had excellent stability furthermore dye removal capability of the go goh membrane was tested by filtrating dye solution with different mo and rhb concentration 10 30 ppm by using go goh 120 min 50 wt as a filtration membrane fig s8 the volume of dye aqueous solution was 20 ml for every test go goh 120 min 50 wt exhibited excellent dye rejection r 99 0 at low dye concentration 10 30 ppm the dye rejection gradually decreases as the increased of dye concentration and reached to 96 for 50 ppm mb solution the slight decreased in two dye rejection with volume may be due to the enhanced concentration gradient of dye on the surface of the membrane in addition at various dye concentrations 10 50 ppm fixed volume of 20 ml the go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane still showed high rejection rates of 96 1 99 7 fig s8 the above results had reasons to show that the adsorption and size sieving effect simultaneously play important roles for the filtration of organic compounds with some molecular weight or size such as mo and rhb dye molecules 5 the interaction between go and dye molecules initially enables the go sheets to capture the dye molecules for instance the electrostatic interaction and p p stacking interaction which result in the tight binding between the dye molecules and the go sheets furthermore go membrane acts as a highly selective sieving to block mo and rhb molecules due to the large size of mo and rhb molecules it is generally believed that the viscosity and molecular size of the solvent are the main factors for solvent filtration 45 in order to further verify the factors that affect flux changes when other solvents passed through the membrane typical solvents of different viscosity were tested fig 7 methanol viscosity 0 58 cp ethanol 1 2 cp nmp 1 65 cp 2 propanol 2 37 cp and ethylene glycol 19 9 cp the fluxes under the same test conditions were 20 2 16 7 10 1 6 7 2 5 l m 2 h 1 respectively this result was consistent with hagen poiseuille theory and previous research results 31 at the same time it showed that the viscosity of the solvent itself was one of the important factors affecting its flux however the flux was also related to factors such as the size and polarity of the solvent 45 therefore go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane prepared by using goh as a nano spacer had excellent chemical stability and high solvent flux to the selected solvent and could be used for the separation of organic solvents in addition to dyes we selected typical pollutant bovine serum albumin bsa and salt solution to evaluate the anti fouling performance and ion separation performance of the membrane the concentration of bsa solution was 500 ppm and the concentration of salt solution na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 was 1000 ppm the test pressure was 1 bar and the mass of goh accounts for 50 wt of the composite membrane as shown in fig 8 a the water flux of the go goh composite nanofiltration membrane was much greater than that of the pure go membrane the water flux of bsa solution increased from 3 8 12 4 l m 2 h 1 therefore after adding 50 wt goh as a nano spacer the water flux of the membrane increased about 3 2 times at the same time it retained a excellent rejection effect on the solute in the solution and the rejection rate of go membrane and go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane to bsa was above 99 2 as shown in fig 8 b the uv vis absorption spectra of the feed solution and filtrate of bsa proved this result our work results showed that the filtrate of the tested solution was clear and transparent and the membrane had excellent separation performance these results were ideal for the application of membranes in the field of nanofiltration membranes therefore the water permeability of the composite nanofiltration membrane obtained by goh intercalation was significantly improved without affecting the rejection of the target solute we further verified that goh sheet as a hydrophilic nanosheet spacer used to prepare go goh composite membrane could effectively improved the separation efficiency of the membrane we conducted membrane separation on common salt solutions with different charge characteristics na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 fig s7 the rejecting effects of the pure go membrane on different salt solutions were na2so4 rejection 75 3 nacl 28 7 mgso4 65 5 and mgcl2 24 9 rejections of the go nanofiltration for different salts were in the order of na2so4 mgso4 nacl mgcl2 according to the reports of other relevant researchers the experimental results may be interpreted through donnan exclusion theory and steric hindrance 47 48 on the one hand go membrane had a higher rejection rate of na2so4 75 3 and the lowest rejection rate of mgcl2 24 9 which was consistent with the typical rule of negatively charged polymer nanofiltration membrane 46 the rejection for na2so4 was higher than that for mgcl2 and nacl due to the donnan effect pure go membrane was negatively charged because of the presence of carboxylic groups at the holes and edges of go sheets which repel so4 2 ions in a stronger way than cl ions the rejection for mgso4 was lower than that for na2so4 because the adsorbed dual charged mg2 ions partially shield the repulsive interactions between the membrane surfaces and so4 2 ions on the other hand due to the size of ionic hydration radius mg2 0 43 nm so4 2 0 38 nm na 0 36 nm and cl 0 33 nm respectively 47 therefore the retention rate of mgso4 65 5 was higher than nacl 28 7 the above results also indicated that the steric hindrance of salt ions played an important role when the solution passed through the nanofiltration membrane as previously assumed in the four salt solutions the rejection rate of salt decreased with the increase of goh content due to the expansion of membrane nano channels and the increase of membrane defects go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane on different salt solutions were na2so4 rejection 60 8 nacl 25 7 mgso4 36 8 and mgcl2 14 2 for go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane the salt rejection rate decreased sharply compared with sodium solution mgso4 65 5 36 8 showed an obvious decreasing trend of the four ions to be measured mg2 had the largest hydration ion and steric hindrance played a more important role in the rejection of magnesium salt and sodium salt therefore the expansion of nano channels in the membrane had a great influence on the rejection rate membrane fouling was a process in which the three main pollutants were considered to be microorganisms inorganic colloids and proteins pollutants gradually settle and accumulate on the surface of the filter membrane resulting in a decrease in membrane performance and an increase in energy consumption 48 the accumulation of dirt hinders the penetration of required molecules reduces the performance of the nanofiltration membrane and ultimately shortens the service life of the membrane studies have shown that the two main factors that affect the antifouling performance of the membrane were the hydrophilicity and roughness of the membrane surface however hydrophilic surfaces could hinder the adsorption of proteins and other dirt through the formation of a water layer a smooth membrane was less likely to stick to the soiling agent than a rough membrane 49 due to its hydrophilicity and chemical resistance go has been used in many laboratories to verify its antifouling and chlorine resistance properties by using bsa solution as a model protein fouling agent the antifouling performance of the membrane was studied the water flux of go and go goh 120 min 50 wt membranes changes with time as shown in fig 9 a the test was carried out in three stages the duration of the pure water flux test was 0 90 min and the water flux test time of the conversion to bsa 500 ppm solution was 90 225 min finally after washing the membrane test the flux of pure water again for 225 330 min the operating pressure condition of the whole experiment was 1 bar data was obtained every 15 min when the feed was switched from di water to bsa solution the permeability of go membrane and go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane decreased rapidly then the water flux reached a stable value after 15 min and kept a slight fluctuation up and down for the following 135 min after washing the water flux of the cleaning membrane was restored to a certain extent however the water flux of the cleaned membrane did not return to that of the original membrane this was due to the membrane fouling caused by the go and goh membranes filtered through the bsa solution to further analyze the fouling process we calculated the frr rt rr and rir of the membrane and listed their values in fig 9 b the higher the frr value the easier it was to recover through hydraulic cleaning it could be seen from fig 9 b that when the dirt was bsa the frr of go membrane and go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane when filtering bsa solution was approximately 74 5 and 70 8 respectively the rt values of go and go goh 120 min 50 wt membranes were 48 5 and 44 6 respectively the rr and rir of the pure go membrane were 24 6 and 23 9 respectively and the rr and rir of the go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane were 16 8 and 27 7 respectively the results showed that goh as a sheet layer nano spacer reduced the antifouling performance of the nanofiltration membrane to a certain extent the fouling resistance of the membrane was affected by the hydrophilicity roughness and surface charge of the membrane surface a more hydrophilic smoother nanofiltration membrane surface was expected to prevent the deposition and accumulation of fouling thereby obtaining better antifouling performance under the quantitative condition of the total amount of composite film as goh content increased go content gradually decreased which made the overall hydrophilicity of the membrane surface gradually decreased therefore in terms of reversible fouling ratio rr of go membrane 24 6 had better performance than that of go goh 120 min 50 wt 16 8 composite membrane the hydration layer formed on the surface of the hydrophilic membrane can prevent the adhesion of dirt when filtering bsa pollutants because the molecular size of the dirt was much larger than the molecular size of go and go goh 120 min 50 wt membranes the dirt stuck in the membrane pores would not cause irreversible pollution 50 in addition considering that there were a large number of oxidized groups on the go sheet the surface of the go goh membrane had a certain degree of roughness in the bsa antifouling test there might be strong interactions between protein molecules and the membrane surface such as hydrogen bonds electrostatic attraction etc these results of many research groups also confirmed this 51 thus the influence of these factors made the antifouling performance of go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane slightly lower than that of go membrane 4 conclusions in summary we prepared high performance go goh composite membranes and systematically studied the effects of different goh nanosheets on the performance of go composite membranes which overcome the present limitations of low flux and instability associated with go membranes furthermore the go goh composite membranes were evaluated extensively in terms of their physicochemical properties by means of xrd sem xps and contact angle analyses the go goh membranes were found to have an excellent removal efficiency of rejection rate mo r 99 4 rhb r 99 6 for the small molecule dyes and an almost complete removal of the representative types of natural organic matter found in raw water bsa this excellent rejection performance was attributed to the combined effects of molecular sieving principally and electrostatic interaction of the go goh composite membranes in the composite membrane hydrophilic goh nanosheets were added to appropriately increase the go layer distance and defects which provided more water molecules with favorable conditions the go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane was found to have the high permeation flux 24 5 l m 2 h 1 which was more than four times the flux of the pure go membrane 6 1 l m 2 h 1 go and go goh membranes still have potential applications in antifouling and sodium solution interception generally this work extends an effective method to improve the separation efficiency of go based membranes using hydrophilic goh nanosheets as spacers declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements

13651,graphene based membranes are widely used in the separation of various molecules and ions due to their unique size barrier properties here a hydroxylated graphene goh and graphene oxide go composite nanofiltration membrane was prepared by vacuum filtration go was hydrophilic and softly and easily to wrinkle and stack into a dense go membrane goh which contained more sp2 hybridized aromatic ring structures was more rigid than go sheets and tended to form loose porous structure it could be found that goh was well embedded into the soft layer of go to form a membrane then the performance of the composite membrane go goh was evaluated through typical dye molecules and proteins when the goh content in the composite membrane was less than 50 wt it had no significant effect on the retention of methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb and bovine serum albumin bsa 99 4 but the pure water permeability was 3 6 4 5 times that of the pure go membrane reaching 22 7 26 5 l m 2 h 1 in this work the superior water flux of the go goh composite membrane compared to the reference go membrane was mainly attributed to the moderate increase of interlayer spacing and nanochannels of the membrane keywords nanofiltration membrane graphene nano spacer dye separation 1 introduction with the rapid growth of the global population and the continuous development of industrialization the shortage of water resources and pollution of the water environment on which people depend for survival have become increasingly serious 1 3 at present the commonly used methods for separating dyes from industrial and domestic waste water are adsorption and membrane separation 4 6 among them the most important membrane separation technology is the application of nanofiltration nf membrane technology and process 7 nanofiltration ranges between ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis with an average pore size between 0 5 2 0 nm and is often used to separate solute mixtures with a molecular weight of 200 1000 da solvent solute mixture 8 10 however when using an nf membrane for water treatment such nf membranes should have the properties of easy material availability high selectivity high flux improved stability and allowable special solvents 11 12 for example porous ceramic membranes are considered to have the best chemical resistance and waste water purification performance however they also have disadvantages that can not be ignored such as expensive fragile and poor anti fouling performance 13 14 the defects of these membrane materials also hinder their further application prospects therefore current research is mainly focused on finding new nf membrane materials with the best separation performance 15 16 in recent years graphene and graphene oxide go as new two dimensional nanomaterials have unique properties such as excellent physical and chemical stability single atomic layer thickness and controllable chemical surface 17 21 therefore many researchers regard it as a material with great application potential in the preparation of efficient separation of nf membranes however it is well known that the go structure contains sp2 hybridized aromatic ring structures and partially sp3 hybridized oxygen rich regions containing epoxy coc carboxyl cooh and hydroxyl co h 19 21 from the microscopic morphology it can be seen that the surface of go is no longer as smooth and flat as graphene but the surface dwrinkles similar to ridge and valley undulations 22 23 this may be due to the fact that go obtained by strong oxidation treatment may become much softer than graphene in fact other research groups have evaluated the fatigue strength of graphene and go cui et al 19 applied an improved atomic force microscope afm technique to study the fatigue resistance of graphene and go the results showed that the fatigue life of single layer graphene was more than 109 cycles when the average stress was 71 gpa which was much higher than that of go on the one hand a large number of oxygen containing functional groups on go are the main reason for the decrease of its mechanical fatigue resistance on the other hand the presence of oxygen containing functional groups makes go highly hydrophilic water molecules can enter the interlayer domain or connect with oxygen containing functional groups at the edges by hydrogen bonding 24 25 therefore go sheets have high stack ability and are easy to form go membranes under external forces unfortunately the interlayer spacing of go membrane is relatively narrow 0 8 nm which largely limits its further application 23 26 therefore most researchers usually reduce the thickness of the go membrane or expand the d spacing to increase the water flux of the nf membrane 27 among them expanding the d spacing is considered promising for example carbon nanotubes 11 28 29 inorganic nanoparticles 30 32 and metal organic frameworks 33 are embedded under the layer of go membrane to expand the nanochannels of the go membrane however these nanoparticles can only play a partial role in the expansion of the interlayer spacing of the go membrane and there are often phenomena such as agglomeration of nanoparticles obviously graphene sheet also plays an important role in the formation of the nanochannels some research groups 34 35 changed the nanochannel size of the membrane by controlling the reduction degree of graphene oxide joshi and nair et al 36 37 thought that in go membranes the pristine sp2 graphene domains provide fast low friction channels for water flow and the oxygen functional groups clustered together act as spacers to provide appropriate spaces for water transport abraham et al 38 reported that the in plane oxygen functional groups can hinder the water transport in graphene nanochannels by hydrogen bond interaction however there is still a lack of systematic basic research on the effect of graphene nanosheets on the performance of graphene or go membrane compared with graphene the surface of hydroxylated graphene contains a large number of hydrophilic functional groups oh which is beneficial to improve the dispersibility of goh nanosheets in water this makes it easy for the goh and go nanosheets to form a uniformly dispersed mixture in water which is conducive to the formation of composite nanofiltration membranes compared with go the aromatic ring structure in the goh structure is more complete which makes it contain a large number of sp2 graphene domains therefore the hardness of goh nanosheets is also higher we speculated that goh could be used as a sheet layer nano spacer to increase the interlayer spacing of the go layer and effectively prevent the accumulation of go sheets in addition the sp2 graphene domains on goh provide fast low friction channels for water flow hence by changing the go goh ratio the influence of the hardness of graphene nanosheets on the performance of the composite membrane can be systematically studied in this work go goh composite nanofiltration membrane was prepared by simple vacuum filtration method then we studied the influence of the addition of goh nanosheets on the morphology structure and hydrophilicity of the nf membrane the permeability and retention properties of typical dyes proteins nanoparticles and salt solutions of the nf membrane was also analyzed as expected compared with the pure go nf membrane the water flux of the composite nf membrane was significantly improved after adding goh sheets and it also had excellent retention of typical dye molecules 2 experimental 2 1

chloride purchased from sinopharm reagent co ltd pes membrane pore size 0 22 μm and 1 μm purchased from zhejiang haiyan new oriental plastics technology co ltd polystyrene microspheres particle size 500 nm purchased from macklin technology co ltd the entire experiment process uses deionized water produced by the ultrapure water filtration system millipore mill q with a resistivity 18 2 mω cm 2 2 synthesis of hydroxylated graphene goh the preparation of goh refers to the previous work method 39 100 ml of graphene dispersion with a concentration of 1 mg ml was added to the flask and heated to 35 c 0 1 mol l dilute hcl solution was used to adjust the ph to acidity 0 98 g of ferrous chloride was weighed into the graphene dispersion stirred for 5 min completely dissolved and ultrasonically dispersed h2o2 and deionized water were diluted at a volume ratio of 1 3 and then added to the reaction system by a microinjection pump at an injection rate of 50 ml h by controlling the reaction time the amount of h2o2 added to the reaction system was changed to obtain goh materials having different degrees of modification the reaction time was 60 min 120 min and 180 min and the samples obtained are denoted as goh 60 goh 120 and goh 180 respectively graphene was processed in the same way except that h2o2 was not used and the final sample was marked as g the reaction product was filtered and washed with 0 1 mol l hcl to remove residual iron ions in the product the potassium thiocyanate was used to check whether the iron ions were removed then the deionized water was washed to neutrality finally the product was placed in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 24 h 2 3 preparation of graphene oxide go graphene oxide go is prepared by modified hummers 40 41 the preparation process was mainly divided into three stages low temperature medium temperature and high temperature 2 4 preparation of composite membrane in this work go was first dispersed in deionized water to form a 0 1 mg ml solution and goh was also dispersed to prepare a 0 1 mg ml solution the total mass of go and goh loaded on each membrane was 2 mg for example 1 0 mg of go and 1 0 mg of goh were taken out and mixed into a beaker then ultrasonically disperse the go and goh dispersions by 0 5 h finally the mixed solution was deposited on the pes membrane by vacuum filtration the sample was named go goh 120 min 50 wt the composite membranes prepared by adding different weights of goh was recorded as 0 wt pure go 20 wt 40 wt 50 wt 60 wt 80 wt 100 wt place the pes membrane in water before used 2 5 characterizations of membranes the surface and cross sectional morphology of the nanofiltration membrane were characterized using a scanning electron microscope sem gemini sem500 a suitable size sample of the membrane was stuck on the conductive adhesive then it was placed on the scanning electron microscope sample stage to observe the cross section the sample needs to be placed in liquid nitrogen to fragile all samples were gold plated before testing and then scanned under 10 kv scanning voltage x ray solid powder diffraction xrd was carried out using a scanning mode of dx 2007 and 5 50 using a cu ka radiation x ray diffraction system the average interlayer spacing of the sample nf membranes was measured according to bragg s law the water contact angle of the membranes were charactered by a test system contact angle analyzer dca 322 thermo cahn usa a syringe dropped approximately 1 μl of water droplets on the surface of the membrane and captured a static image after the water droplets stabilized it should be noted that at least five different places were selected to measure five points note that at least five different locations were selected to measure and average them to obtain reliable data 2 6 evaluation of the membrane separation performance two typical dyes with different molecular weights including mo and rhb at a concentration of 10 ppm were used to test the separation performance of the membrane on the dye additionally the retention performance of different membranes on ps microspheres diameter 500 nm 100 ppm and bsa 500 ppm was tested in the experiment the support membrane was polyethersulfone pes with a pore size of 0 22 μm when testing the membrane s retention of ps microspheres the pore size of the supporting membrane was 1 μm and the ps microspheres can pass the salt solution separation performance of the membrane was evaluated using aqueous solutions of na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 with a concentration of 1000 ppm in each experiment the effective area of the membrane sample was 12 56 cm 2 a the tests were all carried out at a low pressure of 1 bar the water flux was expressed as j l m2 h 1 bar 1 by collecting permeated water v through the membrane before evaluation the membrane was pre compressed under a pressure of 1 bar for 30 min finally the experiment was measured more to determine the average permeability and then the formula was calculated j v a t p where t is the operating time for membrane measurement when the membrane is filtered for 1 h and the pressure stabilizes at 1 bar record the pure water flux j0 the same method was used to determine the membrane permeation flux among them the dye was a 10 ppm solution of mo and rhb during and at the end of each membrane operation the concentration of retentate and permeate defined as cf and cp respectively can be recorded to monitor the change in retention rate the concentrations of mo and rhb dyes in the feed and permeation were measured by using uv vis spectrophotometry the rejection ratios can be calculated by the following equation r 1 cp cf 100 the rejection rate of four typical salt solution membranes nacl mgcl2 na2so4 and mgso4 with a concentration of 1000 ppm each time before we change to other feed solutions the membrane must be washed with di in the filter tank then stir at 400 rpm for a certain period of time to eliminate the influence of the previous solute in the experimental analysis the concentration change of the inorganic salt solution was measured by a conductivity meter lichen china the changes in the concentration of dye and bsa were measured at the maximum absorption wavelength by tu 1901 dual beam uv vis spectrophotometer in order to ensure the repeatability of experimental results each group of samples has been subjected to at least three repeated separation performance tests 2 7 antifouling performance measurements in measuring the anti fouling performance of the membrane the test was conducted using bovine serum albumin bsa at a concentration of 500 ppm the test condition was 1 bar the test duration was 330 min and the water flux of the membranes was recorded every 15 min the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes were evaluated by a dynamic fouling test with bsa 42 all the foulant concentration in feed solution was set to 500 ppm first during 90 min the water flux record j0 every 15 min was used as the pure water flux of a new membrane then the tank was fed with 500 ppm of foulant solution during 135 min the water flux was recorded every 15 min j1 after filtration the membrane was thoroughly washed with milli q water again the pure water flux was measured j2 very 15 min for 105 min to analyze the fouling process recovery ratio frr j2 j0 100 total fouling ratio rt j0 j1 j0 100 reversible fouling ratio rr j2 j1 j0 100 irreversible fouling ratio rir j0 j2 j0 100 3 results and discussion fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the preparation process of the go goh composite nanofiltration membrane since the surface of the goh sheet contains hydroxyl functional groups when the goh sheet was mixed with the go sheet under the action of π π interactions and hydrogen bonds the two exhibited good compatibility therefore uniform dispersions of goh and go flakes with different mass ratios was prepared and then a uniformly filled go goh composite membrane was formed on the pes support membrane via vacuum filtration the preparation flow chart in fig 1 shows the structure of the final go goh nanofiltration membrane a large number of oxygen functional groups and dense packing on the surface of pure go seriously hinder the passage of water molecules the addition of goh sheet could not further block the passage of water molecules on the contrary water molecules may flow quickly in the sp2 graphene domain with low friction and low loss therefore when goh was used as a nanosheet spacer embedded in the go sheet the dense go membrane structure was opened and the nanochannel was enlarged fig 1 a is a photo of a typical go goh composite membrane in which goh accounts for 40 wt it could be seen that the go goh composite membrane had a uniform appearance darkened and reflective the membrane of pure goh sheet was black fig s2 photo of goh membrane with different content fig 1 b is a sem of composite membrane from the high resolution sem in fig 1b it seems that there are both wrinkled go and rigid goh nanosheets in addition in the supplementary material fig s1 the pure go membrane fig s1 a and the pure goh membrane fig s1 g can be found to be different in appearance for composite membranes fig s1 b f shown the sem morphologies of different goh ratios with the increase of goh content the existence of the two can be gradually distinguished in addition xrd characterization can also be combined to prove the existence of go and goh in the composite membrane the xrd of the pure go membrane had obvious characteristic peaks around 10 fig 4 a while the xrd of the pure goh film did not when the two were compounded in different proportions the characteristic peaks of go and goh existed in theory multi layer graphene sheets can be used as a kind of nano spacers to expand the nano channels of go based membranes unfortunately due to the lack of hydrophilic functional groups on its surface graphene has poor dispersibility in water therefore goh was used to make up for the disadvantages of poor graphene dispersion fig 2 d is a typical tem image of go it could be seen that the surface of the single layer or double layer go sheet had obvious wrinkles at the same time fig 2 c shows a high resolution tem with multiple layers of goh whose thickness is mainly concentrated in layers 6 7 in addition in order to verify that the dispersibility of goh in water was higher than that of graphene different dispersions were prepared and recorded as graphene dispersions g and goh dispersions obtained at different reaction times were expressed as goh x min x 15 min 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min 180 min and go dispersions the concentration of different dispersions was1 0 mg ml which was used in static sedimentation experiments the results showed that at the beginning of the experiment there was no obvious difference between the different dispersions and the solute did not delaminate or settle fig 2 a however after 5 h the graphene g dispersion had obvious delamination and sedimentation phenomena fig 2 b at the same time there was no similar phenomenon in goh and go dispersions compared with the dispersibility of graphene in water the hydrophilicity of the goh dispersion obtained by the hydroxylation treatment was improved in addition we could find that 60 h after the start of the experiment fig s3 there were significant differences in the goh dispersion obtained at different treatment times from right to left the upper layer of the dispersion gradually becomes transparent and the goh sedimentation height of the lower layer gradually decreases therefore we believed that as the reaction time of the preparation process increased the dispersibility of goh in water was better to further demonstrate the relationship between hydrophilicity and the oxygen containing groups in the material as expected goh had a higher oxygen content than g and increased with processing time fig 2 e the c o 48 01 of g was much higher than that of goh 180 5 61 which means that goh 180 material had a higher number of oxygen containing functional groups fig 2 f of course both of them had higher c o than go 2 11 therefore we believe that a lower c o value is conducive to increased hydrophilicity according to the xps analysis of fig 4 the c1s peaks of different graphene samples g goh 60 goh 120 goh 180 and go correspond to fig 6 a e based on the above results goh could be used as a nano separator to prepare a go goh composite membrane in fig 3 the microstructure of the membrane was observed with scanning electron microscope sem the surface sem images of the pure go nanofiltration membrane figs 3 a and s1 a showed that the surface of the go membrane had ripples and wrinkles however the surface of the membrane was dense and had no obvious defects which was not conducive to the passage of water molecule 34 therefore the flux of go membrane was small about 5 8 6 2 l m 2 h 1 the cross section of the sem fig 3 a1 shown that the pure go membranes appeared densely stacked and well aligned layered structure with a thickness of 0 88 μm the sem image of the pes support membrane fig s1 h appeared a smooth surface with a pore size of several hundred nanometers after the go dispersion was filtered through vacuum a dense wrinkled go layer was gradually deposited on the surface of the pes microporous support fig s1 a the surface of go goh composite nanofiltration membrane fig 3 b g became rougher than go membrane and the surface roughness of the membrane changed significantly with the increase of goh content this phenomenon could also be seen in fig s2 photos of goh composite membranes with different contents it could be found that as the goh content increased the light reflection of the membrane surface decreased and the roughness increased the comparison between pure go membrane fig s2 a and pure goh membrane fig s2 g was more obvious the addition of goh broke the densely packed structure of the original pure go membranes a large number of goh nanosheets were used as spacers to be embedded in go based membranes which caused defects on the surface of the composite membrane the existence of these defects may helped to improve the permeability of membranes since goh acted as a nanosheet spacer in the go base membrane as the goh content increased the membrane thickness increased from 0 88 μm to 2 84 μm fig 3 a1 g1 43 this might be explained by the reason that the pure go nanosheets were soft and easy to form continuous nonporous membrane while the pure goh nanosheets were rigid which was conducive to the formation of loose porous membrane therefore the surface defects and internal two dimensional nanochannels formed by embedding goh would increase the permeability of go goh membrane fig 4 a shows the xrd pattern of the membrane pure go had a fairly narrow and strong diffraction peak at about 10 64 similar to the previous report 44 according to bragg s law which is used to calculate the basal spacing between the planes in the atomic lattice of the layered materials the xrd pattern of go membrane shown that the d spacing was 0 830 nm due to the addition of few layers of goh there may be partially goh intercalating go it can be seen from xrd that the peak position of the composite membrane with goh was slightly shifted compared with that of the pure go membrane for the go goh composite membrane when the goh content was 50 wt the interlayer spacing increased to 0 924 nm which was beneficial to improve the permeability of the membrane moreover we also tested the hydrophilicity of the membrane as shown in fig 4 b as the goh content increased the water contact angle of these composite membranes gradually increased this phenomenon was mainly due to the fact that although the goh sheet contained hydrophilic functional groups oh its type and quantity were not as good as go the lower contact angle 33 2 of pure go membrane also confirmed that it contained more oxygen functional groups since the hydrophilicity of goh was between g and go the hydrophilicity of goh was weaker than that of go the total amount of goh and go goh on the pes support membrane in the manuscript was 2 mg therefore as the proportion of goh increases the go content in the composite membrane decreased finally for the composite membrane the overall hydrophilicity would gradually decrease and the contact angle would increase in addition the higher surface roughness of the pure goh membrane could be one of the important reasons for its larger contact angle 62 7 we systematically studied the repellency of the go goh membrane to dyes bsa and polystyrene microspheres ps fig 5 size distribution of dye molecules bsa and ps microspheres were showed in table s1 the water flux of go goh composite membrane with goh 120 as a nano spacer with the increase of the amount of goh 120 the water flux of the membrane increased fig 5 a the goh 120 content increased from 0 to 50 wt and the water flux of the membrane was about 4 times higher than that of the pure go membrane its water flux increased approximately from 6 1 24 5 l m 2 h 1 in addition combined with the rejection of dye by composite membrane fig 5 b with the increase of goh content the water flux increased and the membranes rejection rates of small molecule dye mo and rhb solution were 99 4 and 99 6 respectively the separation performance of go goh 120 min 50 wt was superior to that of most previously reported go based membranes as shown in table s2 fig s6 a and b uv vis absorption spectra of mo and rhb feed and filtrate also confirmed this therefore when goh was used it was beneficial to increase the water flux of the membrane and hardly affect rejection this could be attribute that in the go goh composite membranes goh acts as a nano layer spacer providing a suitable interlayer distance to accommodate water molecules and a large number of original graphitized sp2 domains to promote rapid water permeability through nearly frictionless flow 36 in fig s5 we also studied the water flux and rejection rate of composite membranes prepared with g and other goh 60 min and 180 min as spacers taking the membrane with goh 50 wt as an example their water fluxes were 29 2 25 2 and 22 7 l m 2 h 1 respectively therefore from the perspective of water flux fg f60 min f120 min f180 min the rejection rate of mo dyes for example their rejection rates were 92 6 98 1 99 4 and 99 6 respectively therefore from the rejection of dyes the order was rg r60 min r120 min r180 min the reason could be attributed to the fact that when goh was prepared the number of oxygen containing functional groups continued to increase with the extension of the reaction time 60 180 min the increase of oxygen containing functional groups had a certain obstructive effect on the flow of water molecules at the same time when goh was used as a nano spacer and go sheet was stacked to form a membrane there might exist some electrostatic force and hydrogen bond between the goh 180 sheets and the go sheet 15 29 therefore goh 120 as a nanosheet spacer had the most excellent membrane performance when the goh 120 content increased from 60 to 100 wt the flux of the membrane increased rapidly from 27 6 3811 l m 2 h 1 while the rejection rate of the membrane dropped sharply these results could be attributed to the fact that excessive goh changed the dense packing structure of the membrane combined with the sem of membrane figs 1 and s1 when the goh 120 content increased to 80 wt fig 1 f and 100 wt fig 1 g the membrane structure morphology appeared the substantial increase in surface roughness and defects from the sem cross section the accumulation between the go membrane and the layer contained a certain amount of goh composite membrane fig 1 a1 a4 was relatively dense and there were no obvious defects however when the goh content reached 80 wt fig 1 f1 and 100 wt fig 1 g1 the membrane thickness increased significantly to 2 03 and 2 84 μm the membrane structure showed that the goh sheets were piled up in a loose form and a large gap was formed between the sheets therefore this membrane structure had a poor rejection effect on dye molecules however our work also confirmed that this loose membrane structure still had a good retention effect on the large particle size ps microspheres 500 nm fig 5 b r 98 1 the pore size 1 μm of the supporting membrane pes used without rejecting ps microspheres the long term stability of the membrane is very important for its practical application here mo 10 ppm and rhb 10 ppm two dye solutions were used to test the long term stability of the composite membrane compared with other ratio membranes go goh goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane had higher dye retention and permeability so it was used for membrane long term stability test operating pressure was 1 bar the water permeability and rejection of the goh go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane were measured during the test time of 300 min the results were showed in fig 6 in general the water flux and dye rejection of the goh 120 min 50 wt membrane remained stable exhibiting only small fluctuations the water flux of the membrane fluctuates in the range of 24 4 22 3 l m 2 h 1 while the rejection of the dye fluctuates in the range of 99 7 99 0 this result showed that the goh go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane had excellent stability furthermore dye removal capability of the go goh membrane was tested by filtrating dye solution with different mo and rhb concentration 10 30 ppm by using go goh 120 min 50 wt as a filtration membrane fig s8 the volume of dye aqueous solution was 20 ml for every test go goh 120 min 50 wt exhibited excellent dye rejection r 99 0 at low dye concentration 10 30 ppm the dye rejection gradually decreases as the increased of dye concentration and reached to 96 for 50 ppm mb solution the slight decreased in two dye rejection with volume may be due to the enhanced concentration gradient of dye on the surface of the membrane in addition at various dye concentrations 10 50 ppm fixed volume of 20 ml the go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane still showed high rejection rates of 96 1 99 7 fig s8 the above results had reasons to show that the adsorption and size sieving effect simultaneously play important roles for the filtration of organic compounds with some molecular weight or size such as mo and rhb dye molecules 5 the interaction between go and dye molecules initially enables the go sheets to capture the dye molecules for instance the electrostatic interaction and p p stacking interaction which result in the tight binding between the dye molecules and the go sheets furthermore go membrane acts as a highly selective sieving to block mo and rhb molecules due to the large size of mo and rhb molecules it is generally believed that the viscosity and molecular size of the solvent are the main factors for solvent filtration 45 in order to further verify the factors that affect flux changes when other solvents passed through the membrane typical solvents of different viscosity were tested fig 7 methanol viscosity 0 58 cp ethanol 1 2 cp nmp 1 65 cp 2 propanol 2 37 cp and ethylene glycol 19 9 cp the fluxes under the same test conditions were 20 2 16 7 10 1 6 7 2 5 l m 2 h 1 respectively this result was consistent with hagen poiseuille theory and previous research results 31 at the same time it showed that the viscosity of the solvent itself was one of the important factors affecting its flux however the flux was also related to factors such as the size and polarity of the solvent 45 therefore go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane prepared by using goh as a nano spacer had excellent chemical stability and high solvent flux to the selected solvent and could be used for the separation of organic solvents in addition to dyes we selected typical pollutant bovine serum albumin bsa and salt solution to evaluate the anti fouling performance and ion separation performance of the membrane the concentration of bsa solution was 500 ppm and the concentration of salt solution na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 was 1000 ppm the test pressure was 1 bar and the mass of goh accounts for 50 wt of the composite membrane as shown in fig 8 a the water flux of the go goh composite nanofiltration membrane was much greater than that of the pure go membrane the water flux of bsa solution increased from 3 8 12 4 l m 2 h 1 therefore after adding 50 wt goh as a nano spacer the water flux of the membrane increased about 3 2 times at the same time it retained a excellent rejection effect on the solute in the solution and the rejection rate of go membrane and go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane to bsa was above 99 2 as shown in fig 8 b the uv vis absorption spectra of the feed solution and filtrate of bsa proved this result our work results showed that the filtrate of the tested solution was clear and transparent and the membrane had excellent separation performance these results were ideal for the application of membranes in the field of nanofiltration membranes therefore the water permeability of the composite nanofiltration membrane obtained by goh intercalation was significantly improved without affecting the rejection of the target solute we further verified that goh sheet as a hydrophilic nanosheet spacer used to prepare go goh composite membrane could effectively improved the separation efficiency of the membrane we conducted membrane separation on common salt solutions with different charge characteristics na2so4 nacl mgso4 and mgcl2 fig s7 the rejecting effects of the pure go membrane on different salt solutions were na2so4 rejection 75 3 nacl 28 7 mgso4 65 5 and mgcl2 24 9 rejections of the go nanofiltration for different salts were in the order of na2so4 mgso4 nacl mgcl2 according to the reports of other relevant researchers the experimental results may be interpreted through donnan exclusion theory and steric hindrance 47 48 on the one hand go membrane had a higher rejection rate of na2so4 75 3 and the lowest rejection rate of mgcl2 24 9 which was consistent with the typical rule of negatively charged polymer nanofiltration membrane 46 the rejection for na2so4 was higher than that for mgcl2 and nacl due to the donnan effect pure go membrane was negatively charged because of the presence of carboxylic groups at the holes and edges of go sheets which repel so4 2 ions in a stronger way than cl ions the rejection for mgso4 was lower than that for na2so4 because the adsorbed dual charged mg2 ions partially shield the repulsive interactions between the membrane surfaces and so4 2 ions on the other hand due to the size of ionic hydration radius mg2 0 43 nm so4 2 0 38 nm na 0 36 nm and cl 0 33 nm respectively 47 therefore the retention rate of mgso4 65 5 was higher than nacl 28 7 the above results also indicated that the steric hindrance of salt ions played an important role when the solution passed through the nanofiltration membrane as previously assumed in the four salt solutions the rejection rate of salt decreased with the increase of goh content due to the expansion of membrane nano channels and the increase of membrane defects go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane on different salt solutions were na2so4 rejection 60 8 nacl 25 7 mgso4 36 8 and mgcl2 14 2 for go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane the salt rejection rate decreased sharply compared with sodium solution mgso4 65 5 36 8 showed an obvious decreasing trend of the four ions to be measured mg2 had the largest hydration ion and steric hindrance played a more important role in the rejection of magnesium salt and sodium salt therefore the expansion of nano channels in the membrane had a great influence on the rejection rate membrane fouling was a process in which the three main pollutants were considered to be microorganisms inorganic colloids and proteins pollutants gradually settle and accumulate on the surface of the filter membrane resulting in a decrease in membrane performance and an increase in energy consumption 48 the accumulation of dirt hinders the penetration of required molecules reduces the performance of the nanofiltration membrane and ultimately shortens the service life of the membrane studies have shown that the two main factors that affect the antifouling performance of the membrane were the hydrophilicity and roughness of the membrane surface however hydrophilic surfaces could hinder the adsorption of proteins and other dirt through the formation of a water layer a smooth membrane was less likely to stick to the soiling agent than a rough membrane 49 due to its hydrophilicity and chemical resistance go has been used in many laboratories to verify its antifouling and chlorine resistance properties by using bsa solution as a model protein fouling agent the antifouling performance of the membrane was studied the water flux of go and go goh 120 min 50 wt membranes changes with time as shown in fig 9 a the test was carried out in three stages the duration of the pure water flux test was 0 90 min and the water flux test time of the conversion to bsa 500 ppm solution was 90 225 min finally after washing the membrane test the flux of pure water again for 225 330 min the operating pressure condition of the whole experiment was 1 bar data was obtained every 15 min when the feed was switched from di water to bsa solution the permeability of go membrane and go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane decreased rapidly then the water flux reached a stable value after 15 min and kept a slight fluctuation up and down for the following 135 min after washing the water flux of the cleaning membrane was restored to a certain extent however the water flux of the cleaned membrane did not return to that of the original membrane this was due to the membrane fouling caused by the go and goh membranes filtered through the bsa solution to further analyze the fouling process we calculated the frr rt rr and rir of the membrane and listed their values in fig 9 b the higher the frr value the easier it was to recover through hydraulic cleaning it could be seen from fig 9 b that when the dirt was bsa the frr of go membrane and go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane when filtering bsa solution was approximately 74 5 and 70 8 respectively the rt values of go and go goh 120 min 50 wt membranes were 48 5 and 44 6 respectively the rr and rir of the pure go membrane were 24 6 and 23 9 respectively and the rr and rir of the go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane were 16 8 and 27 7 respectively the results showed that goh as a sheet layer nano spacer reduced the antifouling performance of the nanofiltration membrane to a certain extent the fouling resistance of the membrane was affected by the hydrophilicity roughness and surface charge of the membrane surface a more hydrophilic smoother nanofiltration membrane surface was expected to prevent the deposition and accumulation of fouling thereby obtaining better antifouling performance under the quantitative condition of the total amount of composite film as goh content increased go content gradually decreased which made the overall hydrophilicity of the membrane surface gradually decreased therefore in terms of reversible fouling ratio rr of go membrane 24 6 had better performance than that of go goh 120 min 50 wt 16 8 composite membrane the hydration layer formed on the surface of the hydrophilic membrane can prevent the adhesion of dirt when filtering bsa pollutants because the molecular size of the dirt was much larger than the molecular size of go and go goh 120 min 50 wt membranes the dirt stuck in the membrane pores would not cause irreversible pollution 50 in addition considering that there were a large number of oxidized groups on the go sheet the surface of the go goh membrane had a certain degree of roughness in the bsa antifouling test there might be strong interactions between protein molecules and the membrane surface such as hydrogen bonds electrostatic attraction etc these results of many research groups also confirmed this 51 thus the influence of these factors made the antifouling performance of go goh 120 min 50 wt composite membrane slightly lower than that of go membrane 4 conclusions in summary we prepared high performance go goh composite membranes and systematically studied the effects of different goh nanosheets on the performance of go composite membranes which overcome the present limitations of low flux and instability associated with go membranes furthermore the go goh composite membranes were evaluated extensively in terms of their physicochemical properties by means of xrd sem xps and contact angle analyses the go goh membranes were found to have an excellent removal efficiency of rejection rate mo r 99 4 rhb r 99 6 for the small molecule dyes and an almost complete removal of the representative types of natural organic matter found in raw water bsa this excellent rejection performance was attributed to the combined effects of molecular sieving principally and electrostatic interaction of the go goh composite membranes in the composite membrane hydrophilic goh nanosheets were added to appropriately increase the go layer distance and defects which provided more water molecules with favorable conditions the go goh 120 min 50 wt membrane was found to have the high permeation flux 24 5 l m 2 h 1 which was more than four times the flux of the pure go membrane 6 1 l m 2 h 1 go and go goh membranes still have potential applications in antifouling and sodium solution interception generally this work extends an effective method to improve the separation efficiency of go based membranes using hydrophilic goh nanosheets as spacers declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements

13652,high valued nutritional and therapeutic proteins are often recovered from dilute wastewater streams by electroultrafiltration in protein electroultrafiltration use of pulsating d c field has long been confirmed to be substantially advantageous relative to its equivalent constant d c applications however the root cause behind this enhanced performance remained unexplored over years in this article we have presented a first of its kind explanation from the perspective of fatigue rupture in the fouling protein layer bsa water solution was used as the synthetic wastewater feedstock we have constructed the fatigue stress life plot of the visually inaccessible protein layer only from the field induced transient flux regeneration profile after conducting the initial cross flow experiment without any electric field maximum flux regeneration 205 was achieved at moderate field strength 10 000 v m 1 and low frequency 10 hz corresponding regeneration in constant d c euf was limited to 119 only the study provides an insight to the complex interaction between the protein and the pulsating electric field and is expected to outline the appropriate protocol for the effective recovery of proteins from wastewater keywords electroultrafiltration pulsating d c field permeate flux blocking filtration curve fatigue failure 1 introduction recovery of nutritional and therapeutic proteins from wastewater streams of pharmaceutical biochemical and food industries is now a days considered as an essential unit operation 1 discarding this type of effluents without any treatment not only creates environmental problems but also results in huge loss of nutrients these waste streams are mostly of very low protein concentration 2 50 kg m 3 and generally produced in large volume 2 for example dairy industries produce 190 million tons of whey effluent worldwide which contains proteins rich in lysine and sulphur containing amino acids in low concentration 10 kg m 3 3 traditionally protein effluents are subjected to thermal evaporation prior to spray dyeing 4 evaporation is energy intensive and there exists increased risk of protein denaturation at high temperature on the other hand membrane based protein recovery majorly by ultrafiltration uf is relatively inexpensive less energy consuming and easily scalable nevertheless most of the proteins exhibit severe fouling behaviour towards uf membranes irreversible membrane fouling coupled with reversible concentration polarization cp leads to inevitable flux decline in any protein uf 5 as a consequence the apprehended growth of membrane based separation processes is largely hindered due to these operational non idealities remedial methods to alleviate cp and membrane fouling are generally classified into the following categories i boundary layer manipulation which either employs a static turbulent promoter or enhances the shear at the membrane surface independent of feed flow rate as in so called dynamic shear enhanced modules 6 ii upstream techniques such as pre treatment of the feed 7 iii surface modifications of membranes 8 and iv external stimulations backpulsing backflushing backwashing pulsatile flow gas sparging and use of electric fields or ultrasound etc 9 applications of an electric field constant d c pulsating d c alternating field are proved to be effective in remediation of membrane fouling electrophoresis of rejected proteins away from the membrane surface in conjunction with electroosmotic augmentation of permeate flux was suggested to be the fundamental reason behind superior performance of euf modules 10 11 in standard designs the electric field is applied across the membrane in its simplest form cross flow euf consists of two parallel electrodes one is mounted from the top of the cross flow channel while the other is placed below the membrane and also functions as the membrane support 12 bowen suggested the use of a platinum coated titanium electrode as the anode and a perforated stainless steel cathode 13 several studies on constant d c euf of proteins were reported over decades 14 16 these investigations majorly claimed multifold flux enhancement compared to ordinary cross flow uf radovich et al noticed that the permeate flux in constant d c euf with 1 4 w v bsa solution was identical to that of a buffer solution 17 in euf of a colloidal gelatin dispersion even at a low field strength 910 v m 1 permeate flux turned out to be three fold higher relative to that in equivalent cross flow uf 18 advantages of euf mode was alternatively interpreted in terms of reduced pumping cost because of low cross flow velocity requirement 0 1 m s 1 to generate moderately high permeate flux 5 10 6 m3 m 2 s 1 10 in spite of many operational benefits marked increase in power consumption and consequent rise in operating cost primarily impede the growth of euf technology 19 pulsating d c and alternating electric fields were established to be relatively advantageous over constant intensity fields from the perspective of energy consumption robinson et al were the first to report the efficacy of pulsed field euf of a bsa 0 5 5 0 w v 20 water permeation resistance was observed to decrease by 40 with increasing pulsed length to dead time ratio from 0 to 10 corresponding frequency range was 0 75 1 0 hz however power budget analysis and investigation of the scientific basis explaining the enhanced performance were not reported effect of alternating electric field at low frequencies 0 5 50 hz was investigated by zumbusch et al in euf on bsa 21 where the field was applied once the permeate flux reached its quasi steady state respective protocol was referred as step change experiment as opposed to the standard operational method i e electric field being applied from the beginning total permeate throughput of step change experiment was also comparable to that of conventional euf which indicates appreciable power savings steady state flux regeneration was empirically correlated to different process parameters i e field strength frequency and solute concentration nevertheless the root cause analysis for the enhanced permeate throughput was not investigated in a separate study on pulsed d c euf much improved performance was reported upon premixing activated alumina particles 60 200 μm with the protein feedstock 22 alumina microspheres were thought to function as microscale turbulence promoters in the presence of pulsating electric field nearly three fold flux augmentation was noted with mean field of 700 v m 1 and a pulsating frequency of 30 hz separation of alumina particles from the concentrated retentate is the primary disadvantage of this protocol no such technique was suggested additionally no explanation was outlined to justify the enhanced permeation behaviour present literature review clearly points out that in spite of several advantages no analysis was so far undertaken to delineate the higher performance of pulsating d c field in protein euf in this article we have presented an explanation in terms of the fluctuating electrical stress induced fatigue failure of the fouling protein layer visually inaccessible rupture of the said layer was exclusively identified from the flux regeneration profile which clearly marks the novelty of the present approach the fatigue stress life plot of the layer was also constructed to formalize the complex interaction between the protein and the periodic electrical stress present results are apprehended to be beneficial in designing industrial euf module for cost effective protein recovery from dilute effluent streams 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and analysis bio reagent grade 99 pure igg 0 05 endotoxin 1 eu mg 1 and fatty acid 0 1 free bsa average molecular weight 66 kda was procured from srl india such a low impurity level 1 is not expected to influence the results by any measurable extent the solution was prepared upon dissolving the bsa powder in tris buffer the buffer was prepared by mixing 151 14 g of tris base per 1000 ml of deionized water 23 the ph of the feed solution was adjusted around the neural ph range 7 0 7 3 additionally 0 012 w sodium azide was added to prevent any bacterial growth moist semi permeable asymmetric polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes of molecular weight cut off mwco 50 kda were obtained from tech inc pvt ltd india all membranes were rectangular flat sheet type operable in the ph range of 2 10 and a temperature range of 5 54 c maximum operating temperature 65 c concentrations of bsa in the feed retentate and permeate streams were measured using a hitachi dual beam uv vis spectrophotometer model u 2800 according to the standard coomassie brilliant blue method at 280 nm 24 2 2 euf module the module consists of two parts the bottom accommodates the flat sheet membrane effective filtration area 19 5 10 05 cm2 rectangular flange a perforated stainless steel plate that functions as the cathode length 22 cm width 11 cm and thickness 1 0 mm permeate collection chamber permeate outlet feed inlet retentate outlet and electrical connection for anode the top which also acts as a lid holds the rectangular titanium anode coated with platinum dimensions are same as cathode the parts are assembled using equispaced bolt joints the feed flows though the rectangular channel like gap length 25 cm width 15 cm and height 6 mm between these two parts a triplex piston pump delivers the protein solution to the module from a feed tank which is fitted with a cooling coil the retentate is recirculated back while the permeate is collected from the bottom outlet the retentate line is fitted with a back pressure regulator bpr which independently adjusts the transmembrane pressure tmp in order to control the feed flow rate q a needle valve fitted in the bypass line is operated as and when required the custom made d c power supply module is able to generate sinusoidal d c potential with varying frequency amplitude and mean value this has been confirmed by testing its output in a standard oscilloscope hp 54610 schematics of the euf module and the whole filtration bench are depicted in fig 1 a and b respectively 2 3 design of experiment we have planned for two different sets of experiments in the first set the electric field i e both constant and fluctuating d c was applied from the beginning of filtration quasi steady flux and solute rejection under varied parametric conditions were recorded and also compared with those of standard cross flow operation i e without electric field the system was considered to reach its quasi steady state when three successive flux readings were nearly identical within 5 existing reports on alternating and fluctuating d c euf of bsa indicate that the maximum flux condition was achieved at low frequency within 1 20 hz with moderate to high field strength 8000 v m 1 21 22 therefore the following ranges of frequency f and mean field strength were selected f hz 1 20 and e v m 1 1000 10 000 amplitude of the sinusoidal potential function was arbitrarily fixed at 25 of e in addition to e and f tmp 1 2 3 and 4 kgf cm 2 and feed concentration c 0 0 5 1 1 5 a n d 5 w were also varied for thorough characterization feed flow rate q was held constant at 4 lpm which eventually resulted in a very low cross flow velocity v 0 074 m s 1 in the second set we partially followed the step change protocol originally outlined by zumbusch et al 21 initially the cross flow filtration was carried out under fixed tmp and c 0 electric field was only applied once the system reached its quasi steady state the system naturally responded to this stimulus and the flux exhibited a transient growth before levelling off to a new steady state our main objective was to investigate the fatigue behaviour of the protein layer deposited at the end of cross flow filtration towards the pulsating electrical stress we apprehend the protein layer s fatigue to be the primary reason behind the flux regeneration however unlike structural elements we do not have any visual confirmation of the layer rupture or failure the regeneration profile was the only measurable outcome at hand thus we have planned to explore the classical pore blocking models 25 to detect the specific instant of failure according to the pore blocking model the blocking regime can be identified from the slope of d 2 t d v 2 v s d t d v t time v filtrate volume per unit membrane area profile in double logarithmic phase plane in any protein uf complete blocking regime has been reported to be prevalent during the initial stages of filtration provided the solutes are larger than the membrane pores 26 this is exactly consistent with the solute membrane combination under study the mwco of the pvdf membrane used in the present investigation was 50 kda whereas the average molecular weight of bsa is 66 kda furthermore the blocking regime was also reported to gradually switch from complete blocking to cake filtration for proteins 27 this is quite evident as the rejected solutes continually accumulate on the membrane surface leading to a multi layered cake formation whose thickness grows as filtration progresses until a quasi steady state is attained we further hypothesize that upon applying the pulsating electric field as per the step change protocol the system once again returns to the complete blocking regime after passing through an intermediate transience accordingly the final flux regeneration segment of the double logarithmic d 2 t d v 2 v s d t d v profile is expected to be parallel to the initial stages of cross flow experiment which in turn should be operating in the complete blocking mode the specific instant at which the protein layer failure occurs may be subsequently identified as the time at which the two line segments become parallel detailed theoretical justification of this hypothesis is presented in the supplementary section s 1 it is imperative to note that outcomes of any fatigue failure experiment are conventionally represented by the double logarithmic σ s v s n plot where σ s is the maximum stress and n is the number of stress cycles to failure 28 this is also known as fatigue stress life plot or s n diagram 29 we have planned to develop an equivalent plot for the deposited protein layer nevertheless considering the structural heterogeneity and extremely complex interaction of proteins with the electric field we have chosen the maximum electric field strength in v m 1 instead of the actual mechanical stress to equivalently represent σ s thus σ s 1 25 e as we have fixed the amplitude of the pulsating d c potential at 25 of the respective mean field strength i e e on the other hand n was evaluated using the specific time instant of failure t c w h e r e t 0 r e p r e s e n t s t h e o n s e t o f f l u x r e g e n e r a t i o n and the corresponding frequency f as n f t c flux regeneration profiles under fixed set of tmp c 0 f and e were recorded for this purpose however the initial protein layer thickness exclusively depends on tmp and c 0 therefore to trace the fatigue stress life plot step change experiments were conducted with varied e and f once the cross flow flux reached its respective quasi steady state hence we considered four discrete parametric values of e and f as e v m 1 1000 5000 7500 10000 and f h z 1 10 15 20 respectively this gave rise to sixteen sets of step change experiments for each set of tmp and c 0 moreover we have repeated the step change experiments for two subsets of tmp and c 0 in the first subset the parameters were fixed at their lowest values i e tmp 1 0 kgf cm 2 and c 0 0 5 w which was expected to generate a protein layer of minimum thickness the second subset was conducted at tmp 4 0 kgf cm 2 and c 0 5 0 w leading to a protein layer of maximum thickness accordingly thirty two sets of flux regeneration profiles in step change mode were generated to develop two σ s vs n profiles 2 4 experimental procedure rectangular pvdf membrane geometric area 21 21 cm2 was initially fixed over the perforated stainless steel anode by means of the flange joint once the euf module was properly assembled the uncompacted virgin membrane was pressurized in a continuous flow of distilled water at 6 kgf cm 2 which was higher than the highest operating pressure of the present study 4 kgf cm 2 membrane compaction was continued for at least 4 h to have a steady water flux invariance of the water flux was confirmed prior to all experimental runs each experiment of the first set i e pulsating field being applied from beginning was carried out under predefined conditions of tmp c 0 f and e euf with a constant potential was also conducted under identical parametric conditions tmp c 0 and e only for comparative analysis retentate was recirculated back whereas permeate was discarded after necessary measurements solute concentration in the feed tank was monitored throughout and make up water was periodically added to maintain the same feed concentration the feed ph was maintained at the neutral range ph 7 0 7 3 which is far from the corresponding iso electric point of bsa ph 4 71 all experiments were performed at 23 1 c in the step change experiments standard cross flow filtration was carried out from the beginning with a fixed set of tmp and c 0 once the three successive flux readings were nearly identical pulsating d c with fixed values of field variables e f and amplitude 0 25 e was applied similar to cross flow regeneration experiments were terminated when three successive flux data turned out to be nearly identical within 5 3 results and discussion in the following section gross performance characteristics of the euf module for the first set of experiments i e electric field is applied from the beginning of filtration which are also referred as conventional experiments are elaborated 3 1 performance characteristics of euf in conventional experiments variations of the quasi steady permeate flux j s with tmp c 0 and f at different e are presented in fig 2 a to c profiles of j s in cross flow filtration and those obtained from constant d c euf are also included in the same figure for comparison in all experiments j s increased with increasing tmp as expected though in different proportions fig 2 a similarly j s exhibited decreasing trends with increase in c 0 fig 2 c flux profiles were heavily dependent on field parameters i e on e and f for pulsating d c and solely on e for constant d c in both cases percentage reductions of j s with c 0 over its full range i e from 0 5 to 5 w was recorded to decrease with e closer investigation revealed the percentage reduction to decrease from 34 to 6 with an increase of e from 1000 to 10 000 v m 1 whereas the same decreased from 42 to 13 for constant d c applications comparable trends were also noted in variation of j s with tmp the results unambiguously confirm better permeate throughput of pulsating d c euf over that of constant d c mode maximum flux enhancement relative to cross flow operation was around 230 for constant d c applications the maximum increment was limited to 165 only an interesting trend was noticed in variation of j s with pulsating frequency fig 2 b all j s profiles have ubiquitously attained their respective maxima at 10 hz the state of optimum frequency i e f o p t 10 h z remained unchanged for other values of tmp and c 0 as well a similar optimum frequency condition was also reported in a c euf of bsa at tmp 0 8 kgf cm 2 and c 0 0 1 w 21 similarities of optimal frequency conditions may be explained in the light of dynamic electrophoretic mobility μ of bsa furthermore a qualitative justification of the optimal frequency state may also be outlined from the reported profile of μ vs frequency 30 the specific details are provided in the supplementary section s 2 similar to flux profiles of quasi steady observed rejection i e r o 1 c p c 0 w h e r e c p i s t h e p e r m e a t e c o n c e n t r a t i o n with respect to different operating parameters were also investigated trends of observed rejection appeared to be quite useful in understanding the nature of interaction between the electric field and the protein deposits variations of r o with tmp f and c 0 are presented in fig 3 a b and c respectively over the entire range of operating parameters r o was noted to increase with tmp however r o t m p progressively decreased at higher field strength for both pulsating and constant d c eufs for instance at e 1000 v m 1 in pulsating d c euf r o was observed to change by 10 for a change of tmp from 1 kgf cm 2 to 4 kgf cm 2 whereas at the highest mean field strength 10 000 v m 1 the same change was limited to 1 5 only cp naturally increased with tmp in all pressure driven membrane filtrations subsequently the protein layer thickness also increased increased layer thickness necessarily leads to higher mass transfer resistance to solute permeation thus it is natural for r o to increase with tmp corresponding fractional change was maximum 4 per kgf cm 2 of tmp in cross flow filtration without any electric field in all euf modes i e with pulsating as well as with constant d c fields reverse directional protein electrophoresis restricted the growth of protein layer even at high tmp and resistance towards the solute permeation did not increase monotonically therefore r o e u f was recorded to be higher than r o c f additionally the corresponding difference i e r o e u f r o c f was largest at low tmp and gradually decreased towards higher tmp regarding frequency dependence r o was observed to achieve its maximum at 10 hz fig 3 b which is identical to the optimum frequency condition for quasi steady flux fig 2 b observed rejection also increased with increasing feed concentration fig 3 c any increase in c 0 increased the polarized layer thickness and consequently the mass transfer resistance to permeation in cross flow uf r 0 increased maximally 9 for the full scale change of c 0 i e from 0 5 w to 5 w nevertheless the fractional change progressively damped down with increasing field strength for example in pulsating d c euf with e 10 000 v m 1 the same increase was restricted to 2 only in case of constant d c euf with identical field intensity the fractional increase of r 0 was slightly higher 3 8 the specific trends of r 0 may be qualitatively justified in the light of electrophoretic mobility this is elaborated in supplementary section s 3 optimum operating conditions to maximize the quasi steady flux was also evaluated to understand the exact nature of flux profile the final outcomes of optimization analysis are presented in table 1 the results are close to those of qualitative analysis presented in fig 2 especially in relation to maximum j s the optimum state was located at the boundaries of the parametric phase space for tmp c 0 and e optimum frequency condition on the other hand was well within the narrow band of explored frequency i e between 1 and 20 hz detailed results of optimization analysis and related discussions are presented in supplementary section s 4 explanation based on electrophoretic mobility for enhanced performance of pulsating d c euf does not hold for step change experiments the explanation becomes inappropriate as the protein molecules are entrapped in deposited layer with strong protein protein and protein substrate here membrane interactions a more fundamental approach of layer rupture from the perspective of electrical stress induced fatigue is necessary to justify the results this is elaborated in the following section 3 2 step change experiments figs 4 and 5 depict the flux regeneration profiles figs 4 a and 5 a and characteristic blocking filtration curves i e d 2 t d v 2 v s d t d v p r o f i l e s i n d o u b l e l o g a r i t h m i c p h a s e p l a n e figs 4 b and 5 b for the two subsets of step change experiments at 1 and 10 hz similar profiles for 15 and 20 hz are presented in supplementary section fig s 2 and s 3 respectively in section s 5 initial cross flow filtration was observed to change its blocking regime from monolayered complete blocking to multi layered cake filtration as the quasi steady state was approached in the beginning of the cross flow experiment linearity of the double logarithmic d 2 t d v 2 vs d t d v profile with a slope close to two slope 2 precisely confirm the prevalence of complete blocking regime in this stage proteins convected towards the membrane eventually get trapped and adsorbed because of strong protein membrane interactions both dlvo van der waals and electric double layer and non dlvo majorly bridging tethering interaction forces are assumed to play key roles in meditating protein entrapment 31 this is quite consistent with the complete pore blocking picture in later stages increasing protein rejection was expected to cause multi layered deposition multilayering was primarily facilitated by strong tethering interactions between adsorbed and free proteins close to the membrane surface regeneration profiles of the first subset of step change experiments indicate rapid increase of permeate flux from the very beginning before attaining the respective threshold value within 6 8 min fig 4 a and fig s 2 initial regeneration rates and overall regeneration were strongly dependent on field intensity for example at e 10 000 v m 1 final regeneration was close to 185 for a pulsating frequency of 1 hz flux regeneration decreased to 60 for a mean field strength of 1000 v m 1 at the same frequency the trend of increasing percent regeneration was preserved for all other frequencies similar to the conventional experiments percent regenerations were noted to achieve their maxima at 10 hz at this optimum frequency percent regeneration was recorded to vary between 80 205 at different e blocking regime again changed from cake filtration to complete pore blocking towards the end of the regeneration process this was confirmed by the approximate parallel trend of the blocking curves during regeneration phase and the initial cross flow filtration respectively from the regeneration curves it was possible to identify the time at which the fouling mode finally switched complete blocking from cake filtration this is marked as the failure of the deposited protein layer corresponding number of stress cycles n was evaluated as n f t s failure of any material specimen is marked by the presence of end to end transverse cracks which eventually increases its void volume the material may rupture into pieces from either end in the present case the deposited protein layer was considered as a film of soft material to which fluctuating electrical stress was applied naturally this would either cause the growth and propagation of multiple crack tips or might have led to rupture from its top lamina any such failure of the protein layer essentially reduced the hydraulic resistance evidently the permeate flux increased as observed from the regeneration profiles hence t s and n were considered as the time and number of the electrical stress cycles respectively necessary to trigger the failure the dataset of n for different field strengths and frequencies was used to trace the respective fatigue stress life plot which is elaborated in following section flux regeneration profiles and the corresponding blocking filtration curves obtained from the second subset of step change experiments are quite akin to the first however regeneration was delayed because of a comparatively thicker protein layer nearly 15 20 min of electrical field exposure was needed for complete regeneration fig 5 a and fig s 3 maximum regeneration was limited to 167 at a mean field strength of 10 000 v m 1 applied with a frequency of 10 hz relatively lower flux regeneration may be attributed to a thicker protein layer blocking filtration curves were also noted to be similar but the time of regime switch and the respective number of stress cycles increased by several fold to explain the change of fouling regime it is necessary to investigate the behaviour of adsorbed proteins in presence of an electric field interfacial characterization study of bsa in solution and in adsorbed state suggested the presence of positively and negatively charged patches across bsa molecules in addition to the non polar surface segments 32 therefore the coupling of external electric field with bsa was quite evident furthermore the pulsating field may apprehended to trigger the structural instabilities in protein molecules such instabilities often lead to conformational changes 33 and subsequently allow the proteins to break away from the cohesive force field of the fouling layer hence the observed shift of the blocking regime may be substantiated because the continuous escape of proteins from the multi layered cake is expected to finally produce a monolayered film which perfectly corroborates with the complete blocking picture a more elaborate justification is provided in the supplementary section s 6 however the conformational state of the retained proteins in the final monolayer may be entirely different from protein conformation over the initial phases of cross flow filtration the change of conformation might have caused irreversible fouling because of which it was impossible to completely regenerate the flux i e to have a regenerated flux same as the initial flux in the beginning of the cross flow experiment even after applying the electric field at high field strength 10 000 v m 1 and at optimal frequency i e 10 hz over a prolonged time interval step change experiments with identical cross flow conditions were repeated upon applying a constant d c field corresponding field strengths were same as the mean field strengths used for the pulsating d c experiment flux regeneration profiles respective blocking curves and associated comparisons are presented in supplementary section s 7 3 2 1 σ s vs n plots of fouled protein layer fatigue stress life profiles of the protein layer obtained from two different subsets of step change experiment are presented in fig 6 a the number of stress cycles to failure n was observed to monotonically decrease with increasing σ s in both cases this is a typical feature of soft materials 34 once again n was minimum at 10 hz which is uniquely consistent with the outcomes of conventional experiments nevertheless there exists an apparent anomaly in any standard fatigue test failure data points must collapse to a single curve whereas in the present case they are characteristically different for individual frequencies breakage of protein protein interaction through its coupling with the pulsating electric field is largely dependent on the state of polarization of individual bsa molecules 35 bsa is a strongly polarizable protein in addition to the external field induced polarization even the folding pattern of bsa promotes prominent self polarization within the molecule 36 frequency dependent polarization fatigue is quite common in different polymeric materials for instance thin film of vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene copolymer i e pvdf trfe is reported to exhibit notable frequency dependent polarization fatigue 37 bsa is naturally susceptible to this type of frequency dependent fatigue therefore the fatigue rupture of the bsa layer in the present euf is bound to be frequency dependent approximate linearity of the double logarithmic σ s vs n profiles is indicative of a power law relation hence we have tested basquin model described as 1 δ σ a 2 σ f 2 n b where δ σ a is the stress amplitude σ f fatigue strength coefficient and b fatigue strength exponent are two model parameters which are considered as material properties 38 high correlation coefficients r2 0 97 for all frequencies distinctly justify the applicability of basquin model fig 6 b it is imperative to note that we have used the electrical field intensities in place of stress magnitudes as the exact evaluation of the acting mechanical stresses are practically impossible because of the extremely heterogeneous packing in the protein layer thus δ σ a 0 25 e as σ s was fixed at 1 25 e variations of σ f and b with the pulsating frequency are shown as the inserts of fig 6 b both the parameters were noted to pass through their respective minima at 10 hz which once again substantiate the optimal frequency condition additionally the frequency dependence of the material property parameters i e σ f and b is quite justified in relation to the polarization fatigue of proteins as discussed earlier outcomes of the step change experiments clearly suggest improved performance of pulsating d c euf relative to that of constant d c mode however the real life applications of the step change protocol needs rigorous economic optimization 4 conclusion electroultrafiltration mediated recovery of bsa from its synthetic effluent using a pulsating d c field has been demonstrated to enhance the permeate throughput by 90 230 relative to that of the baseline cross flow filtration in the first set of experiments the electric field was applied from the beginning in the second set the field was applied once the permeate flux attained its quasi steady state after the initial cross flow operation this is commonly referred as a step change protocol we have adopted the same protocol to investigate for the root cause behind the enhanced performance of pulsating d c euf the well known blocking filtration model was explored for this purpose pulsating stress induced fatigue failure of the deposited protein layer was identified to be the principal reason of elevated permeation throughput the basquin model of fatigue failure was found to formally describe the behaviour of fouled protein layer in a nutshell the present investigation deciphers the scientific root cause behind the enhanced protein recovery from wastewater by pulsating d c electroultrafiltration corresponding outcomes are expected to serve as a knowledge base in process optimization of any industrial electroultrafiltration system furthermore we apprehend a strong influence of the pulsating waveform e g ramp square pulse etc on the permeate flux therefore a collective optimization study of waveform and frequency is necessary to update the present state of the art we plan to investigate about the effects of waveform in near future declaration of competing interest no benefits in any form have

13652,high valued nutritional and therapeutic proteins are often recovered from dilute wastewater streams by electroultrafiltration in protein electroultrafiltration use of pulsating d c field has long been confirmed to be substantially advantageous relative to its equivalent constant d c applications however the root cause behind this enhanced performance remained unexplored over years in this article we have presented a first of its kind explanation from the perspective of fatigue rupture in the fouling protein layer bsa water solution was used as the synthetic wastewater feedstock we have constructed the fatigue stress life plot of the visually inaccessible protein layer only from the field induced transient flux regeneration profile after conducting the initial cross flow experiment without any electric field maximum flux regeneration 205 was achieved at moderate field strength 10 000 v m 1 and low frequency 10 hz corresponding regeneration in constant d c euf was limited to 119 only the study provides an insight to the complex interaction between the protein and the pulsating electric field and is expected to outline the appropriate protocol for the effective recovery of proteins from wastewater keywords electroultrafiltration pulsating d c field permeate flux blocking filtration curve fatigue failure 1 introduction recovery of nutritional and therapeutic proteins from wastewater streams of pharmaceutical biochemical and food industries is now a days considered as an essential unit operation 1 discarding this type of effluents without any treatment not only creates environmental problems but also results in huge loss of nutrients these waste streams are mostly of very low protein concentration 2 50 kg m 3 and generally produced in large volume 2 for example dairy industries produce 190 million tons of whey effluent worldwide which contains proteins rich in lysine and sulphur containing amino acids in low concentration 10 kg m 3 3 traditionally protein effluents are subjected to thermal evaporation prior to spray dyeing 4 evaporation is energy intensive and there exists increased risk of protein denaturation at high temperature on the other hand membrane based protein recovery majorly by ultrafiltration uf is relatively inexpensive less energy consuming and easily scalable nevertheless most of the proteins exhibit severe fouling behaviour towards uf membranes irreversible membrane fouling coupled with reversible concentration polarization cp leads to inevitable flux decline in any protein uf 5 as a consequence the apprehended growth of membrane based separation processes is largely hindered due to these operational non idealities remedial methods to alleviate cp and membrane fouling are generally classified into the following categories i boundary layer manipulation which either employs a static turbulent promoter or enhances the shear at the membrane surface independent of feed flow rate as in so called dynamic shear enhanced modules 6 ii upstream techniques such as pre treatment of the feed 7 iii surface modifications of membranes 8 and iv external stimulations backpulsing backflushing backwashing pulsatile flow gas sparging and use of electric fields or ultrasound etc 9 applications of an electric field constant d c pulsating d c alternating field are proved to be effective in remediation of membrane fouling electrophoresis of rejected proteins away from the membrane surface in conjunction with electroosmotic augmentation of permeate flux was suggested to be the fundamental reason behind superior performance of euf modules 10 11 in standard designs the electric field is applied across the membrane in its simplest form cross flow euf consists of two parallel electrodes one is mounted from the top of the cross flow channel while the other is placed below the membrane and also functions as the membrane support 12 bowen suggested the use of a platinum coated titanium electrode as the anode and a perforated stainless steel cathode 13 several studies on constant d c euf of proteins were reported over decades 14 16 these investigations majorly claimed multifold flux enhancement compared to ordinary cross flow uf radovich et al noticed that the permeate flux in constant d c euf with 1 4 w v bsa solution was identical to that of a buffer solution 17 in euf of a colloidal gelatin dispersion even at a low field strength 910 v m 1 permeate flux turned out to be three fold higher relative to that in equivalent cross flow uf 18 advantages of euf mode was alternatively interpreted in terms of reduced pumping cost because of low cross flow velocity requirement 0 1 m s 1 to generate moderately high permeate flux 5 10 6 m3 m 2 s 1 10 in spite of many operational benefits marked increase in power consumption and consequent rise in operating cost primarily impede the growth of euf technology 19 pulsating d c and alternating electric fields were established to be relatively advantageous over constant intensity fields from the perspective of energy consumption robinson et al were the first to report the efficacy of pulsed field euf of a bsa 0 5 5 0 w v 20 water permeation resistance was observed to decrease by 40 with increasing pulsed length to dead time ratio from 0 to 10 corresponding frequency range was 0 75 1 0 hz however power budget analysis and investigation of the scientific basis explaining the enhanced performance were not reported effect of alternating electric field at low frequencies 0 5 50 hz was investigated by zumbusch et al in euf on bsa 21 where the field was applied once the permeate flux reached its quasi steady state respective protocol was referred as step change experiment as opposed to the standard operational method i e electric field being applied from the beginning total permeate throughput of step change experiment was also comparable to that of conventional euf which indicates appreciable power savings steady state flux regeneration was empirically correlated to different process parameters i e field strength frequency and solute concentration nevertheless the root cause analysis for the enhanced permeate throughput was not investigated in a separate study on pulsed d c euf much improved performance was reported upon premixing activated alumina particles 60 200 μm with the protein feedstock 22 alumina microspheres were thought to function as microscale turbulence promoters in the presence of pulsating electric field nearly three fold flux augmentation was noted with mean field of 700 v m 1 and a pulsating frequency of 30 hz separation of alumina particles from the concentrated retentate is the primary disadvantage of this protocol no such technique was suggested additionally no explanation was outlined to justify the enhanced permeation behaviour present literature review clearly points out that in spite of several advantages no analysis was so far undertaken to delineate the higher performance of pulsating d c field in protein euf in this article we have presented an explanation in terms of the fluctuating electrical stress induced fatigue failure of the fouling protein layer visually inaccessible rupture of the said layer was exclusively identified from the flux regeneration profile which clearly marks the novelty of the present approach the fatigue stress life plot of the layer was also constructed to formalize the complex interaction between the protein and the periodic electrical stress present results are apprehended to be beneficial in designing industrial euf module for cost effective protein recovery from dilute effluent streams 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and analysis bio reagent grade 99 pure igg 0 05 endotoxin 1 eu mg 1 and fatty acid 0 1 free bsa average molecular weight 66 kda was procured from srl india such a low impurity level 1 is not expected to influence the results by any measurable extent the solution was prepared upon dissolving the bsa powder in tris buffer the buffer was prepared by mixing 151 14 g of tris base per 1000 ml of deionized water 23 the ph of the feed solution was adjusted around the neural ph range 7 0 7 3 additionally 0 012 w sodium azide was added to prevent any bacterial growth moist semi permeable asymmetric polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes of molecular weight cut off mwco 50 kda were obtained from tech inc pvt ltd india all membranes were rectangular flat sheet type operable in the ph range of 2 10 and a temperature range of 5 54 c maximum operating temperature 65 c concentrations of bsa in the feed retentate and permeate streams were measured using a hitachi dual beam uv vis spectrophotometer model u 2800 according to the standard coomassie brilliant blue method at 280 nm 24 2 2 euf module the module consists of two parts the bottom accommodates the flat sheet membrane effective filtration area 19 5 10 05 cm2 rectangular flange a perforated stainless steel plate that functions as the cathode length 22 cm width 11 cm and thickness 1 0 mm permeate collection chamber permeate outlet feed inlet retentate outlet and electrical connection for anode the top which also acts as a lid holds the rectangular titanium anode coated with platinum dimensions are same as cathode the parts are assembled using equispaced bolt joints the feed flows though the rectangular channel like gap length 25 cm width 15 cm and height 6 mm between these two parts a triplex piston pump delivers the protein solution to the module from a feed tank which is fitted with a cooling coil the retentate is recirculated back while the permeate is collected from the bottom outlet the retentate line is fitted with a back pressure regulator bpr which independently adjusts the transmembrane pressure tmp in order to control the feed flow rate q a needle valve fitted in the bypass line is operated as and when required the custom made d c power supply module is able to generate sinusoidal d c potential with varying frequency amplitude and mean value this has been confirmed by testing its output in a standard oscilloscope hp 54610 schematics of the euf module and the whole filtration bench are depicted in fig 1 a and b respectively 2 3 design of experiment we have planned for two different sets of experiments in the first set the electric field i e both constant and fluctuating d c was applied from the beginning of filtration quasi steady flux and solute rejection under varied parametric conditions were recorded and also compared with those of standard cross flow operation i e without electric field the system was considered to reach its quasi steady state when three successive flux readings were nearly identical within 5 existing reports on alternating and fluctuating d c euf of bsa indicate that the maximum flux condition was achieved at low frequency within 1 20 hz with moderate to high field strength 8000 v m 1 21 22 therefore the following ranges of frequency f and mean field strength were selected f hz 1 20 and e v m 1 1000 10 000 amplitude of the sinusoidal potential function was arbitrarily fixed at 25 of e in addition to e and f tmp 1 2 3 and 4 kgf cm 2 and feed concentration c 0 0 5 1 1 5 a n d 5 w were also varied for thorough characterization feed flow rate q was held constant at 4 lpm which eventually resulted in a very low cross flow velocity v 0 074 m s 1 in the second set we partially followed the step change protocol originally outlined by zumbusch et al 21 initially the cross flow filtration was carried out under fixed tmp and c 0 electric field was only applied once the system reached its quasi steady state the system naturally responded to this stimulus and the flux exhibited a transient growth before levelling off to a new steady state our main objective was to investigate the fatigue behaviour of the protein layer deposited at the end of cross flow filtration towards the pulsating electrical stress we apprehend the protein layer s fatigue to be the primary reason behind the flux regeneration however unlike structural elements we do not have any visual confirmation of the layer rupture or failure the regeneration profile was the only measurable outcome at hand thus we have planned to explore the classical pore blocking models 25 to detect the specific instant of failure according to the pore blocking model the blocking regime can be identified from the slope of d 2 t d v 2 v s d t d v t time v filtrate volume per unit membrane area profile in double logarithmic phase plane in any protein uf complete blocking regime has been reported to be prevalent during the initial stages of filtration provided the solutes are larger than the membrane pores 26 this is exactly consistent with the solute membrane combination under study the mwco of the pvdf membrane used in the present investigation was 50 kda whereas the average molecular weight of bsa is 66 kda furthermore the blocking regime was also reported to gradually switch from complete blocking to cake filtration for proteins 27 this is quite evident as the rejected solutes continually accumulate on the membrane surface leading to a multi layered cake formation whose thickness grows as filtration progresses until a quasi steady state is attained we further hypothesize that upon applying the pulsating electric field as per the step change protocol the system once again returns to the complete blocking regime after passing through an intermediate transience accordingly the final flux regeneration segment of the double logarithmic d 2 t d v 2 v s d t d v profile is expected to be parallel to the initial stages of cross flow experiment which in turn should be operating in the complete blocking mode the specific instant at which the protein layer failure occurs may be subsequently identified as the time at which the two line segments become parallel detailed theoretical justification of this hypothesis is presented in the supplementary section s 1 it is imperative to note that outcomes of any fatigue failure experiment are conventionally represented by the double logarithmic σ s v s n plot where σ s is the maximum stress and n is the number of stress cycles to failure 28 this is also known as fatigue stress life plot or s n diagram 29 we have planned to develop an equivalent plot for the deposited protein layer nevertheless considering the structural heterogeneity and extremely complex interaction of proteins with the electric field we have chosen the maximum electric field strength in v m 1 instead of the actual mechanical stress to equivalently represent σ s thus σ s 1 25 e as we have fixed the amplitude of the pulsating d c potential at 25 of the respective mean field strength i e e on the other hand n was evaluated using the specific time instant of failure t c w h e r e t 0 r e p r e s e n t s t h e o n s e t o f f l u x r e g e n e r a t i o n and the corresponding frequency f as n f t c flux regeneration profiles under fixed set of tmp c 0 f and e were recorded for this purpose however the initial protein layer thickness exclusively depends on tmp and c 0 therefore to trace the fatigue stress life plot step change experiments were conducted with varied e and f once the cross flow flux reached its respective quasi steady state hence we considered four discrete parametric values of e and f as e v m 1 1000 5000 7500 10000 and f h z 1 10 15 20 respectively this gave rise to sixteen sets of step change experiments for each set of tmp and c 0 moreover we have repeated the step change experiments for two subsets of tmp and c 0 in the first subset the parameters were fixed at their lowest values i e tmp 1 0 kgf cm 2 and c 0 0 5 w which was expected to generate a protein layer of minimum thickness the second subset was conducted at tmp 4 0 kgf cm 2 and c 0 5 0 w leading to a protein layer of maximum thickness accordingly thirty two sets of flux regeneration profiles in step change mode were generated to develop two σ s vs n profiles 2 4 experimental procedure rectangular pvdf membrane geometric area 21 21 cm2 was initially fixed over the perforated stainless steel anode by means of the flange joint once the euf module was properly assembled the uncompacted virgin membrane was pressurized in a continuous flow of distilled water at 6 kgf cm 2 which was higher than the highest operating pressure of the present study 4 kgf cm 2 membrane compaction was continued for at least 4 h to have a steady water flux invariance of the water flux was confirmed prior to all experimental runs each experiment of the first set i e pulsating field being applied from beginning was carried out under predefined conditions of tmp c 0 f and e euf with a constant potential was also conducted under identical parametric conditions tmp c 0 and e only for comparative analysis retentate was recirculated back whereas permeate was discarded after necessary measurements solute concentration in the feed tank was monitored throughout and make up water was periodically added to maintain the same feed concentration the feed ph was maintained at the neutral range ph 7 0 7 3 which is far from the corresponding iso electric point of bsa ph 4 71 all experiments were performed at 23 1 c in the step change experiments standard cross flow filtration was carried out from the beginning with a fixed set of tmp and c 0 once the three successive flux readings were nearly identical pulsating d c with fixed values of field variables e f and amplitude 0 25 e was applied similar to cross flow regeneration experiments were terminated when three successive flux data turned out to be nearly identical within 5 3 results and discussion in the following section gross performance characteristics of the euf module for the first set of experiments i e electric field is applied from the beginning of filtration which are also referred as conventional experiments are elaborated 3 1 performance characteristics of euf in conventional experiments variations of the quasi steady permeate flux j s with tmp c 0 and f at different e are presented in fig 2 a to c profiles of j s in cross flow filtration and those obtained from constant d c euf are also included in the same figure for comparison in all experiments j s increased with increasing tmp as expected though in different proportions fig 2 a similarly j s exhibited decreasing trends with increase in c 0 fig 2 c flux profiles were heavily dependent on field parameters i e on e and f for pulsating d c and solely on e for constant d c in both cases percentage reductions of j s with c 0 over its full range i e from 0 5 to 5 w was recorded to decrease with e closer investigation revealed the percentage reduction to decrease from 34 to 6 with an increase of e from 1000 to 10 000 v m 1 whereas the same decreased from 42 to 13 for constant d c applications comparable trends were also noted in variation of j s with tmp the results unambiguously confirm better permeate throughput of pulsating d c euf over that of constant d c mode maximum flux enhancement relative to cross flow operation was around 230 for constant d c applications the maximum increment was limited to 165 only an interesting trend was noticed in variation of j s with pulsating frequency fig 2 b all j s profiles have ubiquitously attained their respective maxima at 10 hz the state of optimum frequency i e f o p t 10 h z remained unchanged for other values of tmp and c 0 as well a similar optimum frequency condition was also reported in a c euf of bsa at tmp 0 8 kgf cm 2 and c 0 0 1 w 21 similarities of optimal frequency conditions may be explained in the light of dynamic electrophoretic mobility μ of bsa furthermore a qualitative justification of the optimal frequency state may also be outlined from the reported profile of μ vs frequency 30 the specific details are provided in the supplementary section s 2 similar to flux profiles of quasi steady observed rejection i e r o 1 c p c 0 w h e r e c p i s t h e p e r m e a t e c o n c e n t r a t i o n with respect to different operating parameters were also investigated trends of observed rejection appeared to be quite useful in understanding the nature of interaction between the electric field and the protein deposits variations of r o with tmp f and c 0 are presented in fig 3 a b and c respectively over the entire range of operating parameters r o was noted to increase with tmp however r o t m p progressively decreased at higher field strength for both pulsating and constant d c eufs for instance at e 1000 v m 1 in pulsating d c euf r o was observed to change by 10 for a change of tmp from 1 kgf cm 2 to 4 kgf cm 2 whereas at the highest mean field strength 10 000 v m 1 the same change was limited to 1 5 only cp naturally increased with tmp in all pressure driven membrane filtrations subsequently the protein layer thickness also increased increased layer thickness necessarily leads to higher mass transfer resistance to solute permeation thus it is natural for r o to increase with tmp corresponding fractional change was maximum 4 per kgf cm 2 of tmp in cross flow filtration without any electric field in all euf modes i e with pulsating as well as with constant d c fields reverse directional protein electrophoresis restricted the growth of protein layer even at high tmp and resistance towards the solute permeation did not increase monotonically therefore r o e u f was recorded to be higher than r o c f additionally the corresponding difference i e r o e u f r o c f was largest at low tmp and gradually decreased towards higher tmp regarding frequency dependence r o was observed to achieve its maximum at 10 hz fig 3 b which is identical to the optimum frequency condition for quasi steady flux fig 2 b observed rejection also increased with increasing feed concentration fig 3 c any increase in c 0 increased the polarized layer thickness and consequently the mass transfer resistance to permeation in cross flow uf r 0 increased maximally 9 for the full scale change of c 0 i e from 0 5 w to 5 w nevertheless the fractional change progressively damped down with increasing field strength for example in pulsating d c euf with e 10 000 v m 1 the same increase was restricted to 2 only in case of constant d c euf with identical field intensity the fractional increase of r 0 was slightly higher 3 8 the specific trends of r 0 may be qualitatively justified in the light of electrophoretic mobility this is elaborated in supplementary section s 3 optimum operating conditions to maximize the quasi steady flux was also evaluated to understand the exact nature of flux profile the final outcomes of optimization analysis are presented in table 1 the results are close to those of qualitative analysis presented in fig 2 especially in relation to maximum j s the optimum state was located at the boundaries of the parametric phase space for tmp c 0 and e optimum frequency condition on the other hand was well within the narrow band of explored frequency i e between 1 and 20 hz detailed results of optimization analysis and related discussions are presented in supplementary section s 4 explanation based on electrophoretic mobility for enhanced performance of pulsating d c euf does not hold for step change experiments the explanation becomes inappropriate as the protein molecules are entrapped in deposited layer with strong protein protein and protein substrate here membrane interactions a more fundamental approach of layer rupture from the perspective of electrical stress induced fatigue is necessary to justify the results this is elaborated in the following section 3 2 step change experiments figs 4 and 5 depict the flux regeneration profiles figs 4 a and 5 a and characteristic blocking filtration curves i e d 2 t d v 2 v s d t d v p r o f i l e s i n d o u b l e l o g a r i t h m i c p h a s e p l a n e figs 4 b and 5 b for the two subsets of step change experiments at 1 and 10 hz similar profiles for 15 and 20 hz are presented in supplementary section fig s 2 and s 3 respectively in section s 5 initial cross flow filtration was observed to change its blocking regime from monolayered complete blocking to multi layered cake filtration as the quasi steady state was approached in the beginning of the cross flow experiment linearity of the double logarithmic d 2 t d v 2 vs d t d v profile with a slope close to two slope 2 precisely confirm the prevalence of complete blocking regime in this stage proteins convected towards the membrane eventually get trapped and adsorbed because of strong protein membrane interactions both dlvo van der waals and electric double layer and non dlvo majorly bridging tethering interaction forces are assumed to play key roles in meditating protein entrapment 31 this is quite consistent with the complete pore blocking picture in later stages increasing protein rejection was expected to cause multi layered deposition multilayering was primarily facilitated by strong tethering interactions between adsorbed and free proteins close to the membrane surface regeneration profiles of the first subset of step change experiments indicate rapid increase of permeate flux from the very beginning before attaining the respective threshold value within 6 8 min fig 4 a and fig s 2 initial regeneration rates and overall regeneration were strongly dependent on field intensity for example at e 10 000 v m 1 final regeneration was close to 185 for a pulsating frequency of 1 hz flux regeneration decreased to 60 for a mean field strength of 1000 v m 1 at the same frequency the trend of increasing percent regeneration was preserved for all other frequencies similar to the conventional experiments percent regenerations were noted to achieve their maxima at 10 hz at this optimum frequency percent regeneration was recorded to vary between 80 205 at different e blocking regime again changed from cake filtration to complete pore blocking towards the end of the regeneration process this was confirmed by the approximate parallel trend of the blocking curves during regeneration phase and the initial cross flow filtration respectively from the regeneration curves it was possible to identify the time at which the fouling mode finally switched complete blocking from cake filtration this is marked as the failure of the deposited protein layer corresponding number of stress cycles n was evaluated as n f t s failure of any material specimen is marked by the presence of end to end transverse cracks which eventually increases its void volume the material may rupture into pieces from either end in the present case the deposited protein layer was considered as a film of soft material to which fluctuating electrical stress was applied naturally this would either cause the growth and propagation of multiple crack tips or might have led to rupture from its top lamina any such failure of the protein layer essentially reduced the hydraulic resistance evidently the permeate flux increased as observed from the regeneration profiles hence t s and n were considered as the time and number of the electrical stress cycles respectively necessary to trigger the failure the dataset of n for different field strengths and frequencies was used to trace the respective fatigue stress life plot which is elaborated in following section flux regeneration profiles and the corresponding blocking filtration curves obtained from the second subset of step change experiments are quite akin to the first however regeneration was delayed because of a comparatively thicker protein layer nearly 15 20 min of electrical field exposure was needed for complete regeneration fig 5 a and fig s 3 maximum regeneration was limited to 167 at a mean field strength of 10 000 v m 1 applied with a frequency of 10 hz relatively lower flux regeneration may be attributed to a thicker protein layer blocking filtration curves were also noted to be similar but the time of regime switch and the respective number of stress cycles increased by several fold to explain the change of fouling regime it is necessary to investigate the behaviour of adsorbed proteins in presence of an electric field interfacial characterization study of bsa in solution and in adsorbed state suggested the presence of positively and negatively charged patches across bsa molecules in addition to the non polar surface segments 32 therefore the coupling of external electric field with bsa was quite evident furthermore the pulsating field may apprehended to trigger the structural instabilities in protein molecules such instabilities often lead to conformational changes 33 and subsequently allow the proteins to break away from the cohesive force field of the fouling layer hence the observed shift of the blocking regime may be substantiated because the continuous escape of proteins from the multi layered cake is expected to finally produce a monolayered film which perfectly corroborates with the complete blocking picture a more elaborate justification is provided in the supplementary section s 6 however the conformational state of the retained proteins in the final monolayer may be entirely different from protein conformation over the initial phases of cross flow filtration the change of conformation might have caused irreversible fouling because of which it was impossible to completely regenerate the flux i e to have a regenerated flux same as the initial flux in the beginning of the cross flow experiment even after applying the electric field at high field strength 10 000 v m 1 and at optimal frequency i e 10 hz over a prolonged time interval step change experiments with identical cross flow conditions were repeated upon applying a constant d c field corresponding field strengths were same as the mean field strengths used for the pulsating d c experiment flux regeneration profiles respective blocking curves and associated comparisons are presented in supplementary section s 7 3 2 1 σ s vs n plots of fouled protein layer fatigue stress life profiles of the protein layer obtained from two different subsets of step change experiment are presented in fig 6 a the number of stress cycles to failure n was observed to monotonically decrease with increasing σ s in both cases this is a typical feature of soft materials 34 once again n was minimum at 10 hz which is uniquely consistent with the outcomes of conventional experiments nevertheless there exists an apparent anomaly in any standard fatigue test failure data points must collapse to a single curve whereas in the present case they are characteristically different for individual frequencies breakage of protein protein interaction through its coupling with the pulsating electric field is largely dependent on the state of polarization of individual bsa molecules 35 bsa is a strongly polarizable protein in addition to the external field induced polarization even the folding pattern of bsa promotes prominent self polarization within the molecule 36 frequency dependent polarization fatigue is quite common in different polymeric materials for instance thin film of vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene copolymer i e pvdf trfe is reported to exhibit notable frequency dependent polarization fatigue 37 bsa is naturally susceptible to this type of frequency dependent fatigue therefore the fatigue rupture of the bsa layer in the present euf is bound to be frequency dependent approximate linearity of the double logarithmic σ s vs n profiles is indicative of a power law relation hence we have tested basquin model described as 1 δ σ a 2 σ f 2 n b where δ σ a is the stress amplitude σ f fatigue strength coefficient and b fatigue strength exponent are two model parameters which are considered as material properties 38 high correlation coefficients r2 0 97 for all frequencies distinctly justify the applicability of basquin model fig 6 b it is imperative to note that we have used the electrical field intensities in place of stress magnitudes as the exact evaluation of the acting mechanical stresses are practically impossible because of the extremely heterogeneous packing in the protein layer thus δ σ a 0 25 e as σ s was fixed at 1 25 e variations of σ f and b with the pulsating frequency are shown as the inserts of fig 6 b both the parameters were noted to pass through their respective minima at 10 hz which once again substantiate the optimal frequency condition additionally the frequency dependence of the material property parameters i e σ f and b is quite justified in relation to the polarization fatigue of proteins as discussed earlier outcomes of the step change experiments clearly suggest improved performance of pulsating d c euf relative to that of constant d c mode however the real life applications of the step change protocol needs rigorous economic optimization 4 conclusion electroultrafiltration mediated recovery of bsa from its synthetic effluent using a pulsating d c field has been demonstrated to enhance the permeate throughput by 90 230 relative to that of the baseline cross flow filtration in the first set of experiments the electric field was applied from the beginning in the second set the field was applied once the permeate flux attained its quasi steady state after the initial cross flow operation this is commonly referred as a step change protocol we have adopted the same protocol to investigate for the root cause behind the enhanced performance of pulsating d c euf the well known blocking filtration model was explored for this purpose pulsating stress induced fatigue failure of the deposited protein layer was identified to be the principal reason of elevated permeation throughput the basquin model of fatigue failure was found to formally describe the behaviour of fouled protein layer in a nutshell the present investigation deciphers the scientific root cause behind the enhanced protein recovery from wastewater by pulsating d c electroultrafiltration corresponding outcomes are expected to serve as a knowledge base in process optimization of any industrial electroultrafiltration system furthermore we apprehend a strong influence of the pulsating waveform e g ramp square pulse etc on the permeate flux therefore a collective optimization study of waveform and frequency is necessary to update the present state of the art we plan to investigate about the effects of waveform in near future declaration of competing interest no benefits in any form have

13653,the wastewater reuse and industrial salt recovery from coal gasification brine cgb is the last step for the zero liquid discharge zld of coal chemical wastewater and the heavy metals removal is the key limiting factor for the zld process in this research heavy metals were removed by using the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing technology step by step the optimal type and dosage of chelating agent and flocculant as well as the optimal coagulant dosage was determined via the single factor method additionally the impacts of critical water quality parameters temperature ph salinity and organics etc on the removal of heavy metals were also investigated finally the model targeted the removal of total arsenic as was constructed by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design the initial heavy metal concentration the amount of heavy metal chelating agents hmcas the amount of flocculant and the amount of coagulant were taken as independent variables while the total as concentration of effluent was taken as the dependent variable obtaining the significant regression equation y 0 1165 0 04187x1 0 01829x3 0 00941x2 2 0 0116x3 2 0 00719x2x3 f2 264 22380 p 0 01 the results demonstrated that appropriate amount of hmcas and flocculant determined removal efficiency of heavy metals keywords coal gasification brine heavy metals zero liquid discharge chelating agent mathematical model 1 introduction due to rapid development of industrialization and scarce oil deposits asia pacific region has become the largest coal depend energy consumer in the world coal gasification was regarded as one of the most promising industries for alternative production of petroleum and natural gas 1 2 however huge water consumption and serious environmental risk of coal gasification wastewater cgw became the bottlenecks of coal gasification industry to realize the energy sustainable development zld of the wastewater has become the inevitable demand furthermore as the end of cgw cgb was concentrated water by reverse osmosis from gas washing wastewater circulating water system drainage desalination system drainage as well as effluent after biochemical treatment 3 it was characterized by high salt content total dissolved solids tds 40000 80000 mg l with chloride sulfate nitrate silicon calcium magnesium etc 4 herein the industrial salt recovery and wastewater reuse was the key point for zld with both economic and environmental benefits however cgb also contained a tremendous amount of refractory organic matter chemical oxygen demand 500 2000 mg l and heavy metals including pb cu cr and as 5 these toxic metals would cause great safety hazard due to the accumulation in organisms and transfer to human body 6 as a result the crystal salt products were usually treated as hazardous solid waste because of residue heavy metals exceeding the standard leading to serious resources wasting and huge economic expenditure therefore the heavy metals removal was one of the most critical issues for the sustainable development of coal chemical industry among water purification technologies chemical precipitation was the most widely used by industrial enterprises due to its advantages of convenient operation and cost efficiency for heavy metals removal 7 according to different precipitants it could be divided into hydroxide precipitation sulfide precipitation and ferrite coprecipitation 8 since metal hydroxides showed much less solubility in the ph range of 8 0 11 0 as an economically applicable precipitant quicklime was frequently used for heavy metal removal however this approach was limited by poor removal efficiency for low concentration metals and secondary pollution problem with plenty of sludge productions 9 in contrast to hydroxide precipitation sulfide precipitation realized efficient removal of heavy metals in a wide ph range and the solubility of metal sulfide precipitated was much lower but the precipitation also triggered potential risk with toxic h2s gas emission under acidic conditions 10 additionally the ferrite coprecipitation method was relatively less applied in industrial wastewater treatment because of large energy consumption to achieve reaction temperature of 50 80 8 aiming at the drawbacks of the traditional precipitation methods new types of hmcas began to emerge in the market and replaced conventional precipitants which was widely used in electroplating industry metal processing industry and petrochemical industry containing heavy metal ions 11 hmcas contained coordination atoms p n and s which used functional groups in the molecular structure to form coordination ions with the empty orbitals of heavy metal ions to capture and remove heavy metals 12 the hmcas including 2 4 6 trimercaptotiazine tmt sodium thiocarbonate and dithiocarbamate compounds could efficiently and simultaneously remove a variety of heavy metals of very low concentration μg l in water 13 as one of the frequently used hmcas tmt could specifically remove divalent and monovalent heavy metals but there were scarce studies on its removal performance for heavy metals and the chemical stability of chelates formed with heavy metals in addition the removal of typical heavy metal as in cgb was vital and lack of attention as was the most abundant heavy metal and potential human carcinogen in the environment and it presented in cgb with two forms as iii and as v which were both stable in water and difficult to remove 14 as was usually removed by flocculation method while the process was strongly fluctuant and limited by ph and temperature similar to precipitation low dosage of flocculant was inadequate for as removal but high dosage produced plenty toxic sludge 15 meanwhile the as capture strategy by tmt has been not reported so far thus the as removal by enhanced flocculation coupled with tmt was worthy investigating and the impact factors and their role in heavy metal capturing process also demanded exploration for the purpose of zld and sustainable development in coal chemical industry to improve resource recovery and heavy metal removal in cgb a novel strategy of heavy metal capturing was studied by using tmt for targeted heavy metal cu2 ni2 and total as herein heavy metals were removed by enhanced coagulation coupling with heavy metal capture technology firstly the optimum type and dosage of hmcas and flocculant and coagulant dosage were determined secondly the impact of water quality conditions of cgb on heavy metals removal by enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing technology was explored finally the mathematical model of heavy metal removal was established by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design through model influence factor analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 the synthetized cgb the actual cgb was obtained from the secondary reverse osmosis effluent in a coal gasification plant of the inner mongolia province china the water quality was analyzed and listed in table 1 considering the heavy metals involved in potential ecological risk 16 and according to relatively higher concentration in cgb as cu and ni were selected as the target heavy metal ions moreover combined with performance loss for heavy metal removal in pratical cgb the experimental concentrations of cu2 ni2 and total as were increased by 3 4 times to 0 5 mg l 0 4 mg l and 0 3 mg l respectively the crude phenolic solution was collected from the coal gasification plant thereafter as the major organic components the phenolic solutions were added with heavy metals to synthetize cgb and the initial total organic concentration toc was 220 mg l table 2 displayed the main constituents of synthetized cgb in which initial ph was set as neutral 2 2 enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing technology 2 2 1 the selection of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants by comparing the cost efficiency and engnieering application three kinds of chelating agents tmt 15 tmt 18b and tmt 18 f were selected which was obtained from wuhan boren di technology co ltd the reaction mechanism and major parameters of chelating agents were listed in e component thereafter according to the literature review common aluminum and iron flocculants were selected 17 which was polyaluminum chloride pac ferric chloride fecl3 ferrous sulfate feso4 and polyferric sulfate pfs and all of them were prepared for solutions with mass ratio at 1 as for the most frequently used coagulant agent polyacrylamide pam was selected in this research the flocculants and coagulants were brought from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute tianjin china and coagulant was stocked as 0 1 solution 2 2 2 the experimetal procedure before every experiement 200 ml of synthetized cgb with neutral ph was stocked into each 250 ml conical flask firstly a certain amount of hmcas was added and the conical flask was placed on a magnetic stirrer 85 2a jintan instrument manufacturing co ltd china to react at 1000 rpm for 10 min afterwards the reaction was continued for 5 min with adding a certain dosage of pac and then pam was added with rotation speed to 500 rpm for 5 min after the reaction ended and stood for 25 min the supernatant was finally collected to determine the heavy metal ion concentration the entire reaction process was performed at 20 to study the effect of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants single factor method was used the experimental dosage range of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants were 10 ml l 50 ml l 5 ml l 25 ml l and 0 35 ml l respectively 2 3 impact of water quality factors on heavy metal removal based on the optimal dosage of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants obtained from the above experiment the impact of water temperature ph salinity and organic concentration was respectively explored on the removal performance for heavy metals by single factor method for temperature factor the range was set for 15 to 35 by temperature control device on magnetic stirrer in terms of ph factor a control group with no chelating agents was compared under the ph at 3 11 which was regulated by 0 1 m ca oh 2 and 0 1 m hcl solution in addition the control group was also introduced for studying impacts of salinity 0 mg l and organic concentration 0 mg l by adding single type of salt into crude phenolic solution to synthetize cgb the solution only contained one salt of 20 g l such as only nacl na2so4 nano3 and cacl2 to explore the impact of salt type on the removal of heavy metals finally the toc of synthetized cgb was adjusted via the dosage of crude phenolic solution and the impact of organic concentration of 0 440 mg l was studied 2 4 four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design according to the above experiments the total as was selected as the control factor for model construction thereafter four main influencing factors including initial heavy metal concentration x1 hmcas dosage x2 flocculant dosage x3 and coagulant dosage x4 and the remaining heavy metal concentration total as were applied as the evaluation index y in the experiment 18 19 a four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination experimental design table 3 was used to determine input levels of different variables for a particular level of response a statistical software dps v7 05 was applied for statistical analysis of values in table 3 and then resulted in regression equation and analysis of variance anova for response surface 2 5 analytical methods in the experiment ph value measured by ph meter hq30d hach usa and tds value was obtained by conductivity benchtop meter ec 215 hanna italy toc was determined by toc analyzer toc v shimadzun corporation japan as for ions concentration the metal ions were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 5300dv perkinelmer usa while the anions were quantified by ion chromatography ic 3000 dionex usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method 3 1 1 effect of the type and dosage of hmcas as fig 1 showed different kinds of hmcas exhibited distinctive efficiency for the removal of different heavy metal ions and meanwhile all hmcas exerted relatively low removal performance on as for tmt 15 it was very efficient for cu2 removal with the highest efficiency 98 00 at 30 ml l and meanwhile ni2 removal efficiency followed with much lower efficiency 52 75 obviously the removal of all heavy metals followed the same trend and 30 ml l was the optimal dosage for tmt 15 the comprehensive removal rate of targeted heavy metals achieved the peak value 53 25 with optimal dosage however the tmt 18b displayed completely different trend of heavy metal removal with dosage increasing the removal performance of cu2 and ni2 were almost constant and quite close 96 60 99 00 vs 99 50 99 85 while as removal efficiency was much lower 6 33 11 67 the highest comprehensive removal rate 69 37 of targeted heavy metals was found for tmt 18b at the highest dosage 50 ml l combined with fig 1b and c tmt 18b and tmt 18 f followed very similar trend and level on cu2 and as removal although tmt 18 f realized relatively higher cu2 removal 99 00 the ni2 captured 12 25 57 25 by tmt 18 f was significantly less than tmt 18b the optimal dosage for tmt 18 f was 50 ml l with maximum removal rate 59 24 of targeted heavy metals the costs for cgb treatment by hmcas were listed in table 4 clearly tmt 18 series of hmcas showed economic advantage over tmt 15 with 45 reduction of cost in 1 l of cgb according to the removal performance tmt 18b performed the best on total heavy metal ions following by tmt 18 f and tmt 15 moreover tmt 18 f and tmt 15 significantly increased the chromaticity of cgb by turning it into orange red whereas the supernatant was still clear when tmt 18b was added therefore tmt 18b was considered as preferred hmcas and the optimal dosage was 50 ml l after tmt 18b capturing the concentration of residual cu2 and ni2 in cgb respectively reached 0 002 mg l and 0 001 mg l which satisfied not only standard for pollution control on the hazardous waste landfill gb 18598 2019 but also the environmental quality standards for surface water level iv gb 3838 2002 however the concentration of total as remained in cgb was 0 265 mg l which satisfied the standard for pollution control on the hazardous waste landfill gb 18598 2019 but still exceeded the environmental quality standards for surface water level iv gb 3838 2002 the residue as caused potential risk for cgb recovery in industrial water area thus further removal of heavy metals by coupling with enhanced flocculation process was necessary to improve the safety of cgb recovery 3 1 2 effect of the type and dosage of flocculant during the above experimental process only using hmcas was not enough to remove targeted heavy metals and the observed floc was small and difficult to settle naturally based on the principles of electric neutralization destabilization adsorption bridging or adhesion sweeping flocculants addition could form coarse grained flocs so as to accelerate precipitation and improve the removal rate of heavy metal ions 20 the effect of the type and dosage of flocculant was studied with tmt 18b participating 50 ml l and it was depicted in fig 2 when pac was used as flocculant the removal rates of cu2 and ni2 exceeded 92 and the optimal removal efficiency of total as was 18 67 with the increase of pac dosage the comprehensive removal rate showed a trend of first rise and then decline and it reached the top level when pac dosage was 20 ml l in regard to fecl3 its removal rates 93 of cu2 and ni2 was close to pac but it exhibited much higher capturing efficiency than pac on total as removal nearly 61 meanwhile fecl3 shared the similar curves of comprehensive removal rate with pac and the optimal dosage of fecl3 was 20 ml l with maximum metals removal 85 93 furthermore with pfs as flocculant the maximum removal rate of cu2 95 83 ni2 100 and total as 72 10 were all promoted this flocculant followed the same trend on heavy metals removal with fecl3 and pac and the highest comprehensive removal rate 89 37 occurred at 20 ml l of pfs in contrast to the above flocculants the metal removal curves of feso4 showed constant increasing trend within selected dosage due to relatively high removal efficiency 85 95 of total heavy metal with 25 mg l of feso4 the removal curves were extended in fig 3 with more feso4 addition the maximum removal rate 87 43 appeared to obtain at 40 ml l and cu2 and ni2 were totally eliminated while the as removal remained stable level 62 33 in conclusion the ferric flocculants presented superior capturing capacity for heavy metal comparing with pac and their advantage was mainly found on total as removal according to previous study 21 the flocculation process was influenced by wastewater characteristics and aluminum hydroxide precipitates which appeared less stable than amorphous solid hydroxide of fe moreover fe hydroxides were more capable of as removal with large available surface area for absorption due to more open and loose structure than al hydroxide 22 as for different kinds of ferric flocculants in addition to metal removal performance their impacts on water quality were also compared since the phenolic compounds were major organic pollutants of cgb which would react with ferric ions for blue color of complex the reaction between ferric flocculants and phenols was compared the result demonstrated that the supernatant turned slightly light blue after flocculation and precipitation process and ferric flocculants synchronously realized phenolic removal pfs achieved the highest removal efficiency for over 70 which could effectively reduce the pressure in the subsequent cgb recovery process furthermore by measuring the ph of the supernatant after the reaction the effluent ph was 5 57 5 82 and 5 7 respectively under the optimal dosage of fecl3 pfs and feso4 pfs also displayed relatively lower disturbance on ph neutrality importantly one of the shortcomings of ferric flocculants was the residue of ferric ion in the effluent as depicted in fig 4 under the same dosage of flocculant the rank of iron concentration in supernatant was fecl3 pfs feso4 with the optimal dosage the iron concentration residue by using fecl3 pfs and feso4 was respectively 14 71 mg l 11 70 mg l 36 13 mg l in summary pfs exhibited the most excellent removal performance for heavy metals and facilitated the finest condition for cgb recovery process at the optimal dosage of 20 ml l pfs removed nearly all cu2 99 95 and completely all ni2 100 and total as in effluent was only 0 089 mg l which satisfied the environmental quality standards for surface water level iv gb 3838 2002 benefitting the safety of cgb recovery within industrial area additionally the optimal dosage of flocculant was about 0 2 g l for synchronous cu2 0 5 mg l ni2 0 4 mg l and total as 0 3 mg l removal which were obviously lower than conventional flocculant arts for instance previous researches 21 23 for only as removal 0 3 mg l 1 0 mg l in groundwater consumed over 0 2 g l ferric flocculant accompanied with 5 mg l ca clo 2 3 1 3 effect of coagulant dosage for the purpose of improving stability of flocs and flocculation efficiency coagulant was usually applied to assist the removal of heavy metals 24 pam was identified as the most widely used coagulant agent with excellent flocculation adsorption thickening shear resistance drag reduction and dispersion properties 25 during the flocculation process the addition of coagulant agents could accelerate flocculation and precipitation by 1 3 times moreover with the optimal dosage of hmcas and flocculant the coagulant assisted tmt 18b and pfs for completely removal of cu2 and obvious promotion of as removal according to fig 5 the enhanced effects followed the trend of firstly rise and then decrease and the maximum enhancement occurred at 20 ml l of pam by which the flocculation realized the highest removal of total as 75 67 and comprehensive removal rate 91 87 in terms of the decreased performance with coagulant agents increasing it was assumed that the colloid was encapsulated by exceeded coagulant agents resulting in colloid protection which kept the system stable and reduced the removal of total as 26 considering the environmental influence on flocculation process the factors of water quality need investigation to discover their impacts on heavy metals removal and further find the optimal environmental parameters 3 2 impact of water quality factors on heavy metal removal 3 2 1 impact of water temperature on heavy metal removal fig 6 depicted the removal rate of heavy metal ions changing with water temperature from 15 to 20 the removal rate increased and then kept stable till 30 apparently the optimal removal rate was obtained at 30 with the highest cu2 99 98 ni2 99 98 total as 77 33 and comprehensive removal rate 92 43 the concentration of total as in the supernatant of effluent was 0 068 mg l as for the stable removal rate during temperature increasing it was attributed to the effective collision rate 27 under low temperature the effective collision between hmcas and heavy metal ions slowed down accompanied with limited hydrolysis of flocculant and coagulant which were both unfavorable to the removal of heavy metals oppositely the effective collision between particles increased with temperature ascending by which adsorption and capturing of heavy metals accelerated from fig 6 the removal rate curves decreased after 35 because the pam was organic coagulant which might lose efficacy when temperature increased a lot the result illustrated the enhanced flocculation process was robust at normal temperature range 20 30 3 2 2 impact of ph on heavy metal removal for ph factors in contrast to optimal experimental group with tmt 18b a control group without hmcas was also studied the removal rate of heavy metals in both groups fluctuated obviously with ph changing fig 7 the removal rate of cu2 ni2 and comprehensive removal rate in experimental group were all higher than control group at different ph condition however the removal rate of total as showed a different trend the experimental group exerted advantage over control group when ph 7 but the control group presented relatively higher removal rate of as than experimental group at ph 7 the lowest removal rate 56 96 of as in experimental group was obtained at ph 5 this phenomena evidenced that as removal was largely depended by ph in comparison to cu2 and ni2 for the experimental group the total as removal rate decreased continuously with increasing ph at ph 5 and increased again with increasing ph at ph 5 under different conditions fig s2 the presence morphology of as iii changed with ph 28 the removal rate of total as in the experimental group first decreased and then increased with the increase of ph because the as iii presented as h3aso3 when the ph was 7 29 under acidic conditions h3aso3 was positively charged by protonation and more easily trapped by negatively charged hmcas thus increasing the removal rate of total as however under alkaline conditions ph 7 as ⅲ would hydrolyze to h2aso3 with the increase of ph value the total as was mainly removed by adsorption of ferrite which was formed by hydrolysis of fe3 in pfs the removal rate of heavy metal ions in control group varied greatly with ph which was also related to the morphology of heavy metals at different ph conditions the hydrolysis of cu ii started from ph 6 and all cu ii in water existed as cu2 in the range of ph 6 with the increase of ph value cu ⅱ began to hydrolyze and the degree of hydrolysis increased gradually the products generated were cuoh cu2 oh 2 2 cu oh 2 cu oh 3 and cu oh 4 2 ni ii hydrolyzed only when ph 8 and the removal of ni2 is harsher to the alkaline conditions of ph than cu2 for total as the formation of ferrite increased with the improving of ph ph 7 and co precipitation removal of as might occur with the precipitation of other heavy metals thus increasing the adsorption and removal of total as in terms of acid condition when the tmt 18b was added to the experimental group it exerted better chelating effect on both cu2 and ni2 which could compensate for the reduced removal rate caused by alkaline deficiency 30 thus the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method was more robust to ph fluctuation in comparison to conventional alkaline precipitation method 3 2 3 impact of salinity on heavy metal removal fig 8 illustrated the removal rate of heavy metal changing with types of salt solution it was observed that in the cacl2 solution the removal effect of total as cu2 and ni2 was the highest mainly due to the hydrolysis of ca2 which resulted in alkaline solution and in turn strengthened the removal of heavy metals in different salt solution the removal rates of total as decreased with nacl nano3 control na2so4 moreover in nacl and nano3 solutions salinity increasing turn improved the number of ions in the solution and promoted the effective collision between ions which was beneficial to remove the total as to some extent however in na2so4 solution the removal effect of total as was the lowest because the negative divalent so4 2 increased the negative electricity of the total as reducing its adsorption and removal the removal rate of cu2 from high to low was control na2so4 nano3 nacl while the removal rate of ni2 in different salt solutions was the same as that of cu2 these results indicated that salt containing wastewater was unfavorable for the removal of cu2 and ni2 especially nacl solution since the cl was more likely to associate with cu2 and ni2 to form ion pairs 31 the main salt components in cgb were nacl na2so4 and nano3 32 based on the gradient changes of salt content of 0 g l 10 g l 20 g l 30 g l and 40 g l the effect of salt content of single component on the removal effect of heavy metals is explored fig 9 in nacl and nano3 solutions the total as removal rate increased with increasing salt content while the removal rate displayed the opposite trend in na2so4 solution the removal rates of both cu2 and ni2 reduced with increasing salt content and their removal rate reduced the most obviously in the nacl solution in regard to the comprehensive removal rate it decreased with increased nacl or na2so4 salt content while increased with nano3 salt content in conclusion the high proportion of nacl and na2so4 inhibited the removal of heavy metals in cgb while the presence of nano3 promoted it to some extent 3 2 4 impact of organic on heavy metal removal organic substance in cgb would complex with heavy metal ions to form new pollutants leading to more difficulties on heavy metal removal 4 the crude phenolic solution was added to the experimental salty water to set toc at 0 mg l control group 110 mg l 220 mg l 330 mg l and 440 mg l respectively to explore the effect of toc concentration on heavy metal removal and the experimental results were shown in fig 10 apparently the total as concentration in the effluent supernatant increased with toc increasing while the concentrations of cu2 and ni2 decreased when the toc concentration achieved 440 mg l the contents of heavy metal ions total as cu2 and ni2 in the effluent supernatant were 0 243 mg l 0 001 mg l and 0 001 mg l respectively the removal rate of total heavy metals reduced with the increase of toc which was mainly manifested as the decrease of total as removal rate with toc at 440 mg l the total removal rate reached the lowest level 70 98 and the total as removal rate was only 19 in the absence of phenolic compounds the removal effect of total as was up to 90 39 the reduced removal rate of total as with increased toc was attributed to the competition between phenolic hydroxyl groups and as iii for the adsorption site of flocculates 33 for ni2 and cu2 because there are many suspended particles in crude phenol which could be used as crystal nuclei and helpful for the flocculation process 34 the removal rates of ni2 and cu2 improved with toc increased 3 3 mathematical model of heavy metal removal 3 3 1 model influence factors during the process of enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method the complexation reaction firstly occurred between the added hmcas and dissolved heavy metals in cgb which mainly depended on the complexation of s group of hmcas and heavy metals when flocculant and coagulant were added and formed into floccules it was primarily the hydroxyl group of floccules surface that complexed with heavy metals finally floccules continued to become larger and became precipitates therefore the removal of heavy metals in cgb was determined by the complexation process of s groups and hydroxyl groups with them 35 according to the molecular structural formula of tmt 18b and principle of complexation reaction 36 37 the chelation reaction of tmt 18b with heavy metal ions was shown in eq s 1 2 1 z r s 3 3 m e z r s z m e 3 2 k 1 r s z m e 3 r s 3 z m e z 3 in eq s 1 2 rs3 indicated tmt 18b with s groups and mez suggested heavy metal ions with z valence k1 was the equilibrium constant of reactions between tmt 18b and heavy metals there were hydroxyl groups on the surface of particulates after flocculation and its adsorption process for heavy metals removal was essentially a complexation reaction between heavy metals and the surface of particulates 38 which was expressed by eq s 3 4 3 s o h m e z s o m e z 1 h 4 k 2 s o m e z 1 h s o h m e z where soh indicated floc particles with hydroxyl groups and k2 meant equilibrium constant of the reaction between flocs and heavy metals from the whole process the removal of soluble heavy metal ions in cgb involved the above two complexation reactions and they belonged to the competitive reaction when the dynamic equilibrium reached the constant k calculation was presented as eq 5 5 k k 1 k 2 r s z m e 3 s o m e z 1 h r s 3 z m e z 4 s o h in summary the main factors affecting heavy metal removal during the reaction were the amount of hmcas and the initial heavy metal ion concentration meanwhile the removal efficiency of heavy metals is closely related to the flocculation effect assuming that the flocculation conditions maintained the same during the reaction including temperature 20 rotation speed and agitation time the main factors affecting the complexation adsorption on the flocculating surface were flocculant dosage and coagulant dosage 3 3 2 model construction in contrast to the high removal rate of ni2 and cu2 and their wide range of adaptation to the operating conditions in this experiment the removal of total as was much more difficult and was regarded as major limited process thus the removal rate total as was considered as control factor by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination experiment there were 36 groups of experiments at 5 levels for each factor and table 5 documented the experimental results dps 7 05 was applied for statistical analysis of the data in table 5 and meanwhile the insignificant term at significance level α 0 05 was excluded afterwards the simplified regression equation between concentration of residual heavy metal ions and each factor was obtained in eq 6 6 y 0 1165 0 04187 x 1 0 01829 x 3 0 00941 x 2 2 0 0116 x 3 2 0 00719 x 2 x 3 to test the validity of the regression equation it was tested through lack of fit f tests and the analysis of quadratic regression equation were listed in table 6 the analysis of quadratic regression equation showed that the lack of fit was not significant f1 2 04138 p 0 05 indicating that other unknown factors had little effect on the experimental results moreover the regression equation reached a very significant level f2 264 22380 p 0 01 suggesting the predicted value of the model in good agreement with the actual value thus the quadratic regression equation model given above was appropriate based on this model except for x4 coagulant input which impacted little on the experimental results the other single factors showed significant effects on the results following the order as x1 initial heavy metal concentration x3 flocculant input x2 chelating agent input furthermore when one dimensional variable is fixed as zero level the two dimensional contour map of the model was depicted in fig s3 the interaction of hmcas dosage x2 and flocculant dosage x3 was presented as oval in the contour map evidencing that their interaction exerted a significant effect on the experimental results 18 according to the above studies increasing the dosage of hmcas while decreasing the dosage of flocculants was unfavorable for the removal of total as on the contrary regulating and controlling the optimal rang of both hmcas and flocculants benefitted as removal 4 conclusion for cgb recovery the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method was studied for the target heavy metal ions total as cu2 and ni2 it revealed that the comprehensive removal rates of heavy metals reached the highest 91 87 accompanied with the removal rates of total as cu2 and ni2 at 75 67 99 98 and 99 98 respectively when 50 ml l tmt 18b 1 20 ml l pfs 1 and 20 ml l pam 0 1 were added the removal performance fluctuated with water quality the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method adapted a wide range of temperature 20 30 and ph at 3 11 meanwhile in cgb the cl inhibited the removal of cu2 and ni2 and removal of total as reduced with toc increasing by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design the obtained model exhibited a high level of significance and good applicability to predict the total as concentration in cgb or to optimize the addition of hmcas flocculants and coagulants declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13653,the wastewater reuse and industrial salt recovery from coal gasification brine cgb is the last step for the zero liquid discharge zld of coal chemical wastewater and the heavy metals removal is the key limiting factor for the zld process in this research heavy metals were removed by using the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing technology step by step the optimal type and dosage of chelating agent and flocculant as well as the optimal coagulant dosage was determined via the single factor method additionally the impacts of critical water quality parameters temperature ph salinity and organics etc on the removal of heavy metals were also investigated finally the model targeted the removal of total arsenic as was constructed by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design the initial heavy metal concentration the amount of heavy metal chelating agents hmcas the amount of flocculant and the amount of coagulant were taken as independent variables while the total as concentration of effluent was taken as the dependent variable obtaining the significant regression equation y 0 1165 0 04187x1 0 01829x3 0 00941x2 2 0 0116x3 2 0 00719x2x3 f2 264 22380 p 0 01 the results demonstrated that appropriate amount of hmcas and flocculant determined removal efficiency of heavy metals keywords coal gasification brine heavy metals zero liquid discharge chelating agent mathematical model 1 introduction due to rapid development of industrialization and scarce oil deposits asia pacific region has become the largest coal depend energy consumer in the world coal gasification was regarded as one of the most promising industries for alternative production of petroleum and natural gas 1 2 however huge water consumption and serious environmental risk of coal gasification wastewater cgw became the bottlenecks of coal gasification industry to realize the energy sustainable development zld of the wastewater has become the inevitable demand furthermore as the end of cgw cgb was concentrated water by reverse osmosis from gas washing wastewater circulating water system drainage desalination system drainage as well as effluent after biochemical treatment 3 it was characterized by high salt content total dissolved solids tds 40000 80000 mg l with chloride sulfate nitrate silicon calcium magnesium etc 4 herein the industrial salt recovery and wastewater reuse was the key point for zld with both economic and environmental benefits however cgb also contained a tremendous amount of refractory organic matter chemical oxygen demand 500 2000 mg l and heavy metals including pb cu cr and as 5 these toxic metals would cause great safety hazard due to the accumulation in organisms and transfer to human body 6 as a result the crystal salt products were usually treated as hazardous solid waste because of residue heavy metals exceeding the standard leading to serious resources wasting and huge economic expenditure therefore the heavy metals removal was one of the most critical issues for the sustainable development of coal chemical industry among water purification technologies chemical precipitation was the most widely used by industrial enterprises due to its advantages of convenient operation and cost efficiency for heavy metals removal 7 according to different precipitants it could be divided into hydroxide precipitation sulfide precipitation and ferrite coprecipitation 8 since metal hydroxides showed much less solubility in the ph range of 8 0 11 0 as an economically applicable precipitant quicklime was frequently used for heavy metal removal however this approach was limited by poor removal efficiency for low concentration metals and secondary pollution problem with plenty of sludge productions 9 in contrast to hydroxide precipitation sulfide precipitation realized efficient removal of heavy metals in a wide ph range and the solubility of metal sulfide precipitated was much lower but the precipitation also triggered potential risk with toxic h2s gas emission under acidic conditions 10 additionally the ferrite coprecipitation method was relatively less applied in industrial wastewater treatment because of large energy consumption to achieve reaction temperature of 50 80 8 aiming at the drawbacks of the traditional precipitation methods new types of hmcas began to emerge in the market and replaced conventional precipitants which was widely used in electroplating industry metal processing industry and petrochemical industry containing heavy metal ions 11 hmcas contained coordination atoms p n and s which used functional groups in the molecular structure to form coordination ions with the empty orbitals of heavy metal ions to capture and remove heavy metals 12 the hmcas including 2 4 6 trimercaptotiazine tmt sodium thiocarbonate and dithiocarbamate compounds could efficiently and simultaneously remove a variety of heavy metals of very low concentration μg l in water 13 as one of the frequently used hmcas tmt could specifically remove divalent and monovalent heavy metals but there were scarce studies on its removal performance for heavy metals and the chemical stability of chelates formed with heavy metals in addition the removal of typical heavy metal as in cgb was vital and lack of attention as was the most abundant heavy metal and potential human carcinogen in the environment and it presented in cgb with two forms as iii and as v which were both stable in water and difficult to remove 14 as was usually removed by flocculation method while the process was strongly fluctuant and limited by ph and temperature similar to precipitation low dosage of flocculant was inadequate for as removal but high dosage produced plenty toxic sludge 15 meanwhile the as capture strategy by tmt has been not reported so far thus the as removal by enhanced flocculation coupled with tmt was worthy investigating and the impact factors and their role in heavy metal capturing process also demanded exploration for the purpose of zld and sustainable development in coal chemical industry to improve resource recovery and heavy metal removal in cgb a novel strategy of heavy metal capturing was studied by using tmt for targeted heavy metal cu2 ni2 and total as herein heavy metals were removed by enhanced coagulation coupling with heavy metal capture technology firstly the optimum type and dosage of hmcas and flocculant and coagulant dosage were determined secondly the impact of water quality conditions of cgb on heavy metals removal by enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing technology was explored finally the mathematical model of heavy metal removal was established by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design through model influence factor analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 the synthetized cgb the actual cgb was obtained from the secondary reverse osmosis effluent in a coal gasification plant of the inner mongolia province china the water quality was analyzed and listed in table 1 considering the heavy metals involved in potential ecological risk 16 and according to relatively higher concentration in cgb as cu and ni were selected as the target heavy metal ions moreover combined with performance loss for heavy metal removal in pratical cgb the experimental concentrations of cu2 ni2 and total as were increased by 3 4 times to 0 5 mg l 0 4 mg l and 0 3 mg l respectively the crude phenolic solution was collected from the coal gasification plant thereafter as the major organic components the phenolic solutions were added with heavy metals to synthetize cgb and the initial total organic concentration toc was 220 mg l table 2 displayed the main constituents of synthetized cgb in which initial ph was set as neutral 2 2 enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing technology 2 2 1 the selection of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants by comparing the cost efficiency and engnieering application three kinds of chelating agents tmt 15 tmt 18b and tmt 18 f were selected which was obtained from wuhan boren di technology co ltd the reaction mechanism and major parameters of chelating agents were listed in e component thereafter according to the literature review common aluminum and iron flocculants were selected 17 which was polyaluminum chloride pac ferric chloride fecl3 ferrous sulfate feso4 and polyferric sulfate pfs and all of them were prepared for solutions with mass ratio at 1 as for the most frequently used coagulant agent polyacrylamide pam was selected in this research the flocculants and coagulants were brought from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute tianjin china and coagulant was stocked as 0 1 solution 2 2 2 the experimetal procedure before every experiement 200 ml of synthetized cgb with neutral ph was stocked into each 250 ml conical flask firstly a certain amount of hmcas was added and the conical flask was placed on a magnetic stirrer 85 2a jintan instrument manufacturing co ltd china to react at 1000 rpm for 10 min afterwards the reaction was continued for 5 min with adding a certain dosage of pac and then pam was added with rotation speed to 500 rpm for 5 min after the reaction ended and stood for 25 min the supernatant was finally collected to determine the heavy metal ion concentration the entire reaction process was performed at 20 to study the effect of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants single factor method was used the experimental dosage range of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants were 10 ml l 50 ml l 5 ml l 25 ml l and 0 35 ml l respectively 2 3 impact of water quality factors on heavy metal removal based on the optimal dosage of chelating agents flocculants and coagulants obtained from the above experiment the impact of water temperature ph salinity and organic concentration was respectively explored on the removal performance for heavy metals by single factor method for temperature factor the range was set for 15 to 35 by temperature control device on magnetic stirrer in terms of ph factor a control group with no chelating agents was compared under the ph at 3 11 which was regulated by 0 1 m ca oh 2 and 0 1 m hcl solution in addition the control group was also introduced for studying impacts of salinity 0 mg l and organic concentration 0 mg l by adding single type of salt into crude phenolic solution to synthetize cgb the solution only contained one salt of 20 g l such as only nacl na2so4 nano3 and cacl2 to explore the impact of salt type on the removal of heavy metals finally the toc of synthetized cgb was adjusted via the dosage of crude phenolic solution and the impact of organic concentration of 0 440 mg l was studied 2 4 four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design according to the above experiments the total as was selected as the control factor for model construction thereafter four main influencing factors including initial heavy metal concentration x1 hmcas dosage x2 flocculant dosage x3 and coagulant dosage x4 and the remaining heavy metal concentration total as were applied as the evaluation index y in the experiment 18 19 a four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination experimental design table 3 was used to determine input levels of different variables for a particular level of response a statistical software dps v7 05 was applied for statistical analysis of values in table 3 and then resulted in regression equation and analysis of variance anova for response surface 2 5 analytical methods in the experiment ph value measured by ph meter hq30d hach usa and tds value was obtained by conductivity benchtop meter ec 215 hanna italy toc was determined by toc analyzer toc v shimadzun corporation japan as for ions concentration the metal ions were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer 5300dv perkinelmer usa while the anions were quantified by ion chromatography ic 3000 dionex usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method 3 1 1 effect of the type and dosage of hmcas as fig 1 showed different kinds of hmcas exhibited distinctive efficiency for the removal of different heavy metal ions and meanwhile all hmcas exerted relatively low removal performance on as for tmt 15 it was very efficient for cu2 removal with the highest efficiency 98 00 at 30 ml l and meanwhile ni2 removal efficiency followed with much lower efficiency 52 75 obviously the removal of all heavy metals followed the same trend and 30 ml l was the optimal dosage for tmt 15 the comprehensive removal rate of targeted heavy metals achieved the peak value 53 25 with optimal dosage however the tmt 18b displayed completely different trend of heavy metal removal with dosage increasing the removal performance of cu2 and ni2 were almost constant and quite close 96 60 99 00 vs 99 50 99 85 while as removal efficiency was much lower 6 33 11 67 the highest comprehensive removal rate 69 37 of targeted heavy metals was found for tmt 18b at the highest dosage 50 ml l combined with fig 1b and c tmt 18b and tmt 18 f followed very similar trend and level on cu2 and as removal although tmt 18 f realized relatively higher cu2 removal 99 00 the ni2 captured 12 25 57 25 by tmt 18 f was significantly less than tmt 18b the optimal dosage for tmt 18 f was 50 ml l with maximum removal rate 59 24 of targeted heavy metals the costs for cgb treatment by hmcas were listed in table 4 clearly tmt 18 series of hmcas showed economic advantage over tmt 15 with 45 reduction of cost in 1 l of cgb according to the removal performance tmt 18b performed the best on total heavy metal ions following by tmt 18 f and tmt 15 moreover tmt 18 f and tmt 15 significantly increased the chromaticity of cgb by turning it into orange red whereas the supernatant was still clear when tmt 18b was added therefore tmt 18b was considered as preferred hmcas and the optimal dosage was 50 ml l after tmt 18b capturing the concentration of residual cu2 and ni2 in cgb respectively reached 0 002 mg l and 0 001 mg l which satisfied not only standard for pollution control on the hazardous waste landfill gb 18598 2019 but also the environmental quality standards for surface water level iv gb 3838 2002 however the concentration of total as remained in cgb was 0 265 mg l which satisfied the standard for pollution control on the hazardous waste landfill gb 18598 2019 but still exceeded the environmental quality standards for surface water level iv gb 3838 2002 the residue as caused potential risk for cgb recovery in industrial water area thus further removal of heavy metals by coupling with enhanced flocculation process was necessary to improve the safety of cgb recovery 3 1 2 effect of the type and dosage of flocculant during the above experimental process only using hmcas was not enough to remove targeted heavy metals and the observed floc was small and difficult to settle naturally based on the principles of electric neutralization destabilization adsorption bridging or adhesion sweeping flocculants addition could form coarse grained flocs so as to accelerate precipitation and improve the removal rate of heavy metal ions 20 the effect of the type and dosage of flocculant was studied with tmt 18b participating 50 ml l and it was depicted in fig 2 when pac was used as flocculant the removal rates of cu2 and ni2 exceeded 92 and the optimal removal efficiency of total as was 18 67 with the increase of pac dosage the comprehensive removal rate showed a trend of first rise and then decline and it reached the top level when pac dosage was 20 ml l in regard to fecl3 its removal rates 93 of cu2 and ni2 was close to pac but it exhibited much higher capturing efficiency than pac on total as removal nearly 61 meanwhile fecl3 shared the similar curves of comprehensive removal rate with pac and the optimal dosage of fecl3 was 20 ml l with maximum metals removal 85 93 furthermore with pfs as flocculant the maximum removal rate of cu2 95 83 ni2 100 and total as 72 10 were all promoted this flocculant followed the same trend on heavy metals removal with fecl3 and pac and the highest comprehensive removal rate 89 37 occurred at 20 ml l of pfs in contrast to the above flocculants the metal removal curves of feso4 showed constant increasing trend within selected dosage due to relatively high removal efficiency 85 95 of total heavy metal with 25 mg l of feso4 the removal curves were extended in fig 3 with more feso4 addition the maximum removal rate 87 43 appeared to obtain at 40 ml l and cu2 and ni2 were totally eliminated while the as removal remained stable level 62 33 in conclusion the ferric flocculants presented superior capturing capacity for heavy metal comparing with pac and their advantage was mainly found on total as removal according to previous study 21 the flocculation process was influenced by wastewater characteristics and aluminum hydroxide precipitates which appeared less stable than amorphous solid hydroxide of fe moreover fe hydroxides were more capable of as removal with large available surface area for absorption due to more open and loose structure than al hydroxide 22 as for different kinds of ferric flocculants in addition to metal removal performance their impacts on water quality were also compared since the phenolic compounds were major organic pollutants of cgb which would react with ferric ions for blue color of complex the reaction between ferric flocculants and phenols was compared the result demonstrated that the supernatant turned slightly light blue after flocculation and precipitation process and ferric flocculants synchronously realized phenolic removal pfs achieved the highest removal efficiency for over 70 which could effectively reduce the pressure in the subsequent cgb recovery process furthermore by measuring the ph of the supernatant after the reaction the effluent ph was 5 57 5 82 and 5 7 respectively under the optimal dosage of fecl3 pfs and feso4 pfs also displayed relatively lower disturbance on ph neutrality importantly one of the shortcomings of ferric flocculants was the residue of ferric ion in the effluent as depicted in fig 4 under the same dosage of flocculant the rank of iron concentration in supernatant was fecl3 pfs feso4 with the optimal dosage the iron concentration residue by using fecl3 pfs and feso4 was respectively 14 71 mg l 11 70 mg l 36 13 mg l in summary pfs exhibited the most excellent removal performance for heavy metals and facilitated the finest condition for cgb recovery process at the optimal dosage of 20 ml l pfs removed nearly all cu2 99 95 and completely all ni2 100 and total as in effluent was only 0 089 mg l which satisfied the environmental quality standards for surface water level iv gb 3838 2002 benefitting the safety of cgb recovery within industrial area additionally the optimal dosage of flocculant was about 0 2 g l for synchronous cu2 0 5 mg l ni2 0 4 mg l and total as 0 3 mg l removal which were obviously lower than conventional flocculant arts for instance previous researches 21 23 for only as removal 0 3 mg l 1 0 mg l in groundwater consumed over 0 2 g l ferric flocculant accompanied with 5 mg l ca clo 2 3 1 3 effect of coagulant dosage for the purpose of improving stability of flocs and flocculation efficiency coagulant was usually applied to assist the removal of heavy metals 24 pam was identified as the most widely used coagulant agent with excellent flocculation adsorption thickening shear resistance drag reduction and dispersion properties 25 during the flocculation process the addition of coagulant agents could accelerate flocculation and precipitation by 1 3 times moreover with the optimal dosage of hmcas and flocculant the coagulant assisted tmt 18b and pfs for completely removal of cu2 and obvious promotion of as removal according to fig 5 the enhanced effects followed the trend of firstly rise and then decrease and the maximum enhancement occurred at 20 ml l of pam by which the flocculation realized the highest removal of total as 75 67 and comprehensive removal rate 91 87 in terms of the decreased performance with coagulant agents increasing it was assumed that the colloid was encapsulated by exceeded coagulant agents resulting in colloid protection which kept the system stable and reduced the removal of total as 26 considering the environmental influence on flocculation process the factors of water quality need investigation to discover their impacts on heavy metals removal and further find the optimal environmental parameters 3 2 impact of water quality factors on heavy metal removal 3 2 1 impact of water temperature on heavy metal removal fig 6 depicted the removal rate of heavy metal ions changing with water temperature from 15 to 20 the removal rate increased and then kept stable till 30 apparently the optimal removal rate was obtained at 30 with the highest cu2 99 98 ni2 99 98 total as 77 33 and comprehensive removal rate 92 43 the concentration of total as in the supernatant of effluent was 0 068 mg l as for the stable removal rate during temperature increasing it was attributed to the effective collision rate 27 under low temperature the effective collision between hmcas and heavy metal ions slowed down accompanied with limited hydrolysis of flocculant and coagulant which were both unfavorable to the removal of heavy metals oppositely the effective collision between particles increased with temperature ascending by which adsorption and capturing of heavy metals accelerated from fig 6 the removal rate curves decreased after 35 because the pam was organic coagulant which might lose efficacy when temperature increased a lot the result illustrated the enhanced flocculation process was robust at normal temperature range 20 30 3 2 2 impact of ph on heavy metal removal for ph factors in contrast to optimal experimental group with tmt 18b a control group without hmcas was also studied the removal rate of heavy metals in both groups fluctuated obviously with ph changing fig 7 the removal rate of cu2 ni2 and comprehensive removal rate in experimental group were all higher than control group at different ph condition however the removal rate of total as showed a different trend the experimental group exerted advantage over control group when ph 7 but the control group presented relatively higher removal rate of as than experimental group at ph 7 the lowest removal rate 56 96 of as in experimental group was obtained at ph 5 this phenomena evidenced that as removal was largely depended by ph in comparison to cu2 and ni2 for the experimental group the total as removal rate decreased continuously with increasing ph at ph 5 and increased again with increasing ph at ph 5 under different conditions fig s2 the presence morphology of as iii changed with ph 28 the removal rate of total as in the experimental group first decreased and then increased with the increase of ph because the as iii presented as h3aso3 when the ph was 7 29 under acidic conditions h3aso3 was positively charged by protonation and more easily trapped by negatively charged hmcas thus increasing the removal rate of total as however under alkaline conditions ph 7 as ⅲ would hydrolyze to h2aso3 with the increase of ph value the total as was mainly removed by adsorption of ferrite which was formed by hydrolysis of fe3 in pfs the removal rate of heavy metal ions in control group varied greatly with ph which was also related to the morphology of heavy metals at different ph conditions the hydrolysis of cu ii started from ph 6 and all cu ii in water existed as cu2 in the range of ph 6 with the increase of ph value cu ⅱ began to hydrolyze and the degree of hydrolysis increased gradually the products generated were cuoh cu2 oh 2 2 cu oh 2 cu oh 3 and cu oh 4 2 ni ii hydrolyzed only when ph 8 and the removal of ni2 is harsher to the alkaline conditions of ph than cu2 for total as the formation of ferrite increased with the improving of ph ph 7 and co precipitation removal of as might occur with the precipitation of other heavy metals thus increasing the adsorption and removal of total as in terms of acid condition when the tmt 18b was added to the experimental group it exerted better chelating effect on both cu2 and ni2 which could compensate for the reduced removal rate caused by alkaline deficiency 30 thus the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method was more robust to ph fluctuation in comparison to conventional alkaline precipitation method 3 2 3 impact of salinity on heavy metal removal fig 8 illustrated the removal rate of heavy metal changing with types of salt solution it was observed that in the cacl2 solution the removal effect of total as cu2 and ni2 was the highest mainly due to the hydrolysis of ca2 which resulted in alkaline solution and in turn strengthened the removal of heavy metals in different salt solution the removal rates of total as decreased with nacl nano3 control na2so4 moreover in nacl and nano3 solutions salinity increasing turn improved the number of ions in the solution and promoted the effective collision between ions which was beneficial to remove the total as to some extent however in na2so4 solution the removal effect of total as was the lowest because the negative divalent so4 2 increased the negative electricity of the total as reducing its adsorption and removal the removal rate of cu2 from high to low was control na2so4 nano3 nacl while the removal rate of ni2 in different salt solutions was the same as that of cu2 these results indicated that salt containing wastewater was unfavorable for the removal of cu2 and ni2 especially nacl solution since the cl was more likely to associate with cu2 and ni2 to form ion pairs 31 the main salt components in cgb were nacl na2so4 and nano3 32 based on the gradient changes of salt content of 0 g l 10 g l 20 g l 30 g l and 40 g l the effect of salt content of single component on the removal effect of heavy metals is explored fig 9 in nacl and nano3 solutions the total as removal rate increased with increasing salt content while the removal rate displayed the opposite trend in na2so4 solution the removal rates of both cu2 and ni2 reduced with increasing salt content and their removal rate reduced the most obviously in the nacl solution in regard to the comprehensive removal rate it decreased with increased nacl or na2so4 salt content while increased with nano3 salt content in conclusion the high proportion of nacl and na2so4 inhibited the removal of heavy metals in cgb while the presence of nano3 promoted it to some extent 3 2 4 impact of organic on heavy metal removal organic substance in cgb would complex with heavy metal ions to form new pollutants leading to more difficulties on heavy metal removal 4 the crude phenolic solution was added to the experimental salty water to set toc at 0 mg l control group 110 mg l 220 mg l 330 mg l and 440 mg l respectively to explore the effect of toc concentration on heavy metal removal and the experimental results were shown in fig 10 apparently the total as concentration in the effluent supernatant increased with toc increasing while the concentrations of cu2 and ni2 decreased when the toc concentration achieved 440 mg l the contents of heavy metal ions total as cu2 and ni2 in the effluent supernatant were 0 243 mg l 0 001 mg l and 0 001 mg l respectively the removal rate of total heavy metals reduced with the increase of toc which was mainly manifested as the decrease of total as removal rate with toc at 440 mg l the total removal rate reached the lowest level 70 98 and the total as removal rate was only 19 in the absence of phenolic compounds the removal effect of total as was up to 90 39 the reduced removal rate of total as with increased toc was attributed to the competition between phenolic hydroxyl groups and as iii for the adsorption site of flocculates 33 for ni2 and cu2 because there are many suspended particles in crude phenol which could be used as crystal nuclei and helpful for the flocculation process 34 the removal rates of ni2 and cu2 improved with toc increased 3 3 mathematical model of heavy metal removal 3 3 1 model influence factors during the process of enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method the complexation reaction firstly occurred between the added hmcas and dissolved heavy metals in cgb which mainly depended on the complexation of s group of hmcas and heavy metals when flocculant and coagulant were added and formed into floccules it was primarily the hydroxyl group of floccules surface that complexed with heavy metals finally floccules continued to become larger and became precipitates therefore the removal of heavy metals in cgb was determined by the complexation process of s groups and hydroxyl groups with them 35 according to the molecular structural formula of tmt 18b and principle of complexation reaction 36 37 the chelation reaction of tmt 18b with heavy metal ions was shown in eq s 1 2 1 z r s 3 3 m e z r s z m e 3 2 k 1 r s z m e 3 r s 3 z m e z 3 in eq s 1 2 rs3 indicated tmt 18b with s groups and mez suggested heavy metal ions with z valence k1 was the equilibrium constant of reactions between tmt 18b and heavy metals there were hydroxyl groups on the surface of particulates after flocculation and its adsorption process for heavy metals removal was essentially a complexation reaction between heavy metals and the surface of particulates 38 which was expressed by eq s 3 4 3 s o h m e z s o m e z 1 h 4 k 2 s o m e z 1 h s o h m e z where soh indicated floc particles with hydroxyl groups and k2 meant equilibrium constant of the reaction between flocs and heavy metals from the whole process the removal of soluble heavy metal ions in cgb involved the above two complexation reactions and they belonged to the competitive reaction when the dynamic equilibrium reached the constant k calculation was presented as eq 5 5 k k 1 k 2 r s z m e 3 s o m e z 1 h r s 3 z m e z 4 s o h in summary the main factors affecting heavy metal removal during the reaction were the amount of hmcas and the initial heavy metal ion concentration meanwhile the removal efficiency of heavy metals is closely related to the flocculation effect assuming that the flocculation conditions maintained the same during the reaction including temperature 20 rotation speed and agitation time the main factors affecting the complexation adsorption on the flocculating surface were flocculant dosage and coagulant dosage 3 3 2 model construction in contrast to the high removal rate of ni2 and cu2 and their wide range of adaptation to the operating conditions in this experiment the removal of total as was much more difficult and was regarded as major limited process thus the removal rate total as was considered as control factor by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination experiment there were 36 groups of experiments at 5 levels for each factor and table 5 documented the experimental results dps 7 05 was applied for statistical analysis of the data in table 5 and meanwhile the insignificant term at significance level α 0 05 was excluded afterwards the simplified regression equation between concentration of residual heavy metal ions and each factor was obtained in eq 6 6 y 0 1165 0 04187 x 1 0 01829 x 3 0 00941 x 2 2 0 0116 x 3 2 0 00719 x 2 x 3 to test the validity of the regression equation it was tested through lack of fit f tests and the analysis of quadratic regression equation were listed in table 6 the analysis of quadratic regression equation showed that the lack of fit was not significant f1 2 04138 p 0 05 indicating that other unknown factors had little effect on the experimental results moreover the regression equation reached a very significant level f2 264 22380 p 0 01 suggesting the predicted value of the model in good agreement with the actual value thus the quadratic regression equation model given above was appropriate based on this model except for x4 coagulant input which impacted little on the experimental results the other single factors showed significant effects on the results following the order as x1 initial heavy metal concentration x3 flocculant input x2 chelating agent input furthermore when one dimensional variable is fixed as zero level the two dimensional contour map of the model was depicted in fig s3 the interaction of hmcas dosage x2 and flocculant dosage x3 was presented as oval in the contour map evidencing that their interaction exerted a significant effect on the experimental results 18 according to the above studies increasing the dosage of hmcas while decreasing the dosage of flocculants was unfavorable for the removal of total as on the contrary regulating and controlling the optimal rang of both hmcas and flocculants benefitted as removal 4 conclusion for cgb recovery the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method was studied for the target heavy metal ions total as cu2 and ni2 it revealed that the comprehensive removal rates of heavy metals reached the highest 91 87 accompanied with the removal rates of total as cu2 and ni2 at 75 67 99 98 and 99 98 respectively when 50 ml l tmt 18b 1 20 ml l pfs 1 and 20 ml l pam 0 1 were added the removal performance fluctuated with water quality the enhanced coagulation coupled with heavy metal capturing method adapted a wide range of temperature 20 30 and ph at 3 11 meanwhile in cgb the cl inhibited the removal of cu2 and ni2 and removal of total as reduced with toc increasing by four factor quadratic regression orthogonal rotation combination design the obtained model exhibited a high level of significance and good applicability to predict the total as concentration in cgb or to optimize the addition of hmcas flocculants and coagulants declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of

13654,several bio based adsorbents containing cations were screened for radioactive iodide removal from a water environment the efficiency of the selected adsorbents was assessed in different ph temperature as well as competitive ions based on the adsorption capacity iron alginate fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were selected as potential adsorbents they possessed 139 18 9 and 45 1 mg g iodide i adsorption capacities respectively the adsorption equilibrium time for fe alg was 30 min while hazelnut shells and sash inchi shells took 120 min to stabilize the adsorption results fit the langmuir isotherm model with predicted adsorption capacities similar to those of the experimental data the fitting of pseudo first order reaction and the negative values of the arrhenius activation energy inferred that the adsorption had a physical nature the iodine x ray absorption edges of 4552 83 4553 40 ev from the near edge structure analysis confirmed the physisorption as the i in bio based adsorbents did not go through any chemical transformation fe3 was used to synthesize fe alg with an energy dispersive x ray analysis magnesium potassium and calcium were detected in the hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells consequently the binding of i to the surface of the adsorbents was mainly through electrostatic forces with the cationic species on the surface of the adsorbents the selected bio based adsorbents could be used for industrial effluents in natural water environments as they exhibited i adsorption at various ph levels temperatures and in the presence of competitive anions keywords adsorption isotherms radioactive iodide biomaterials water environment 1 introduction with the growth of the world population a rise in energy consumption is inevitable nuclear power is considered as an essential source for securing future electrical power however its radioactive waste products have been an issue to be dealt with 1 the radioactive iodine species are considered to be hazardous although i 131 has a half life of 8 days its decay mechanism produces β particles with high specific activity 130 000 ci g that can destroy the thyroid gland and causes thyroid cancer 2 4 i 129 emits β particles with a less specific energy of 1 8 10 4 ci g but its 1 6 million year half life causes a problem of radioactive waste accumulation 2 a recent study suggested that after three decades of chernobyl incidents 1 56 m bq kg of highly water soluble i 129 was still detected in the soil of the contaminated areas 5 during the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident in japan up to 11 pbq total activity of i 131 and 62 107 atoms l of i 129 were discharged into the water environment 6 7 leakages from nuclear waste disposal sites and medical facilities also contributed to the discharge of the contaminants 8 11 in the water environment iodide i is a common disassociate form of radioactive iodine the sources of the pollutant include nuclear power plants and waste disposal sites 12 13 many kinds of technologies have been used to remove i from water these include membrane separation silver precipitation and immobilization by cementitious materials 14 16 membrane separation requires high energy while the silver precipitation method adds metallic silver directly to the water body both technologies are suitable only in closed environment remediation cement production is poisonous to the environment because it produces by products such as chlorine sox nox mercury lead chromium and arsenic 17 adsorption processes have become an essential technology for the natural environment and industry effluent remediation the merits of adsorption include straightforward operation economical utilization of low cost bio based materials effectiveness at low contaminant concentrations and continuous improvement by adsorbent modification for selectivity of adsorbate several types of commercial polystyrene based anion exchange resins were reported to reduce i in groundwater in a laboratory study the i removal capacity of a silica based ion exchange resin was about 149 mg g 18 19 however these polystyrene based resins bearing cationic quaternary amines relied on fossil fuel based chemicals for their production other commercial adsorbents such as activated carbon and zeolite were considered as bio derived materials however they were susceptible to a low adsorption efficiency of about 50 and 30 respectively at 50 μg l initial i concentration 20 there were attempts to improve the performance of the activated carbon by incorporating silver an estimated maximum i adsorption capacity of 127 mg g was reported 21 22 the complexation of alginate by metal ions could also create potential adsorbents for anionic contaminant removal with the reduction of i2 to i maghemite and titanium dioxide alginate beads yielded 19 5 mg g adsorption capacity 23 the adsorption of arsenate by copper and iron alginate complexes was studied 24 however these adsorbents have not been used for the direct adsorption of i in solution another group of potential bio based adsorbents is biomass that contains cationic functional groups in our previous study an agricultural waste that contained anthocyanin successfully exhibited i adsorption through electrostatic and ion exchange mechanisms 25 the same concept brought our attention to plant wastes such as seeds and shells which contain abundant cationic minerals or proteins 26 28 this study has found new and potential natural based products and waste biomass for the i removal in water the screening tests are carried out for several bio based adsorbents the dried form of iron alginate hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells show satisfactory performance and are studied for i adsorption in detail to our knowledge these adsorbents have never been tested for i removal in an aqueous environment by choosing these adsorbents we take the simple concept of electrostatic attraction and use it for removing anion pollution the adsorbents are also characterized to confirm the underlying i adsorption mechanism lastly the other adsorbents in previous research were brought to compare with the selected bio based adsorbents in this study 2 methodology 2 1 reagents the list of reagents their abbreviations used in this text and sources are shown in table 1 in this study the source of i was ki the reagents for i quantification include 4 4 4 methylidynetris n n dimethylaniline monopersulfate triple salt c6h8o7 h2o nh4oh nh4h2po4 hgcl2 and h2so4 the laboratory grade sodium alginate and chitosan flakes were not preferred due to their high cost and less suitability for the adsorbent preparation 2 2 bio based adsorbent preparations the sodium alginate gel of 2 w v was prepared and added dropwise into different 2 w v metal solutions these solutions were prepared separately with cacl2 cucl2 and fecl₃ a metering pump dmi 1 1 16 grundfos germany was used and set up for 1 l h to control the bead size swollen beads of calcium alginate ca alg copper alginate cu alg and iron alginate fe alg were formed the beads were allowed to settle in the solution for 24 h after separation the beads were washed 3 times with di water and dried at 60 c in an oven a swollen bead was about 5 cm in diameter when it was dried the diameter was reduced to about 2 cm before being used dried beads were kept in a closed container while swollen beads were kept in di water the chitosan flakes were crushed into pieces they were weighted and added to the 2 v v acetic acid solution to create 2 w v chitosan gel the solution was stirred until the flakes dissolved the obtained chitosan gel was added dropwise to a 2 w v stpp solution the swollen beads were allowed to sit in the solution for 24 h after drying in an oven at a temperature of 60 c the dried beads were kept in a closed container before being used and the swollen ones were kept in di water pistachio shells peanut shells sacha inchi plukenetia volubilis shells and coconut husks were obtained from a local market at the same time hazelnuts were bought from an online store and only its shells were used all plant wastes were washed with di water before being dried in an oven they were ground sieved with standard sieves for 0 5 0 711 mm pieces and stored in sealed containers until further use an anion exchange resin of commercial grade was employed as a reference in the adsorption experiment the resin had a 50 100 mesh size and was used without further modification the summary of adsorbent names abbreviation and preparation methods are tabulated in table 2 2 3 screening tests to quantify i in solution the leuco crystal violet lcv method was employed 29 the method created a violet solution in which the intensity was proportional to i concentration quantified by the absorption of light 592 nm produced by a uv vis spectrometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa at room temperature the adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate on an orbital shaker 150 rpm the screening test condition was set up with 10 mg l initial i concentration 2 h contact time and the adsorbent doses of 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 2 and 5 g l the removal efficiency was determined by the total percentage of i being adsorbed by the adsorbent after a given contact time i removal efficiency was calculated by eq 1 1 i removal efficiency c i c e c i 100 where ci and cₑ represents i concentration in the water mg l before and after the adsorption respectively only the selected adsorbents from the screening test were characterized and examined further for the adsorption mechanism 2 4 bio based adsorbent characterizations the i saturated adsorbents were prepared by conducting the adsorption at 100 mg l i initial concentration the optimum dose of adsorbents and equilibrium contact time were used a scanning electron microscope sem joel jcm 6000plus japan was employed to investigate the surface morphology alteration sem images of the virgin and i saturated adsorbents were obtained for comparison the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx joel jcm 6000plus japan was used to analyze the elemental composition in the virgin and saturated adsorbents 2 5 adsorption experiments the appropriate dose of adsorbent was chosen for the kinetic experiment which was conducted at 0 180 min at room temperature the initial i concentration was 10 mg l the pseudo order reactions were used to explain the behavior of the rate limiting steps of the i adsorption the adsorption results were fit to the linearized form of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order reactions as displayed in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 is the constant derived from pseudo first order

the adsorbate was tested the desorption of i was determined after leaving the adsorbents in contact with i for a duration equivalent to the half life of i 131 8 days or 192 h after the kinetic experiment the obtained equilibrium time for the respective adsorbent was used to understand the adsorption efficiency at various i concentrations 0 5 10 20 40 60 80 100 and 200 mg l the adsorbent capacity denoted by q mg g in the concentration dependent study can be calculated by eq 2 2 q c i c ₑ v m where ci and cₑ are defined as the i concentration in the water mg l before and after the adsorption respectively v is the volume of solute l while m represents the mass of the bio based adsorbent used in the adsorption experiment the optimum dose of adsorbent was used at room temperature to comprehend the isothermal process of the i adsorption the linear equations of the langmuir model in eq 4 and freundlich model in eq 5 were used 4 c e q 1 k l q m a x c e q m a x 5 ln q 1 n ln c e ln k f where qmax is the i adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model mg g and kl and kf are the langmuir l g and freundlich constant l g respectively n from freundlich equation refers to an exponent corresponding to the degree of free energy and sorption intensity to evaluate the effect of temperature the i adsorption at various concentrations was repeated at 5 15 25 45 and 65 c the linear plot of eq 6 and the calculation of eq 7 were used to determine the thermodynamic parameters the activation energy was also obtained from the fitting of the arrhenius equation eq 8 6 ln k l δ h

experiment with low adsorbate concentration and weak charge interaction kl calculated from the langmuir model is recommended as a distribution coefficient by a previous study 30 the effect of ph 3 5 7 and 11 on i adsorption was investigated hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m were added to the solute to adjust the ph to examine the anion selectivity the adsorption experiment was conducted with additions of competitive anions such as cl so4 2 hco₃ and br these anions were prepared from nacl naso4 nahco₃ and kbr respectively with the concentration of the seawater composition 31 tap water and seawater were also used in the selectivity experiment the seawater was taken from chon buri province thailand the adsorption regeneration tests were performed for 5 cycles each regeneration was done by submerging the bio based adsorbents in excess 1 m nacl for 1 h in the ph anion selectivity and adsorption regeneration experiments the optimum dose of adsorbent and equilibrium time were used with 10 mg l initial i concentration at room temperature 2 6 investigation of i removal mechanism zeta potential mv of fe alg and sacha inchi shells were determined in different ph conditions 3 5 7 and 11 hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m were used to adjust the ph of di water the adsorbents were ground into powder and added to ph adjusted water to create colloid after 2 h the colloid was transferred to a clear disposable zeta cell zeta potential was measured by a particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd uk with the dynamic light scattering method x ray absorption spectroscopy xas was used to determine the adsorbents local structure of and the adsorbed iodine oxidation state the instrument was located at beamline 5 2 in synchrotron light research institute nakhon ratchasima thailand the xas was equipped with electron energy of 1 2 gev iodine liii edge probe element 4557 ev of 0 2 ev energy step and germanium 220 double crystals monochromator to obtain the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra the fluorescence mode was applied during the analysis of i saturated adsorbents ki and kio₃ were used as references the possible functional groups responsible for attracting i was investigated by analyzing the adsorbents virgin and saturated with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher scientific nicolet is50 usa the removal of moisture was done by leaving the adsorbents in a vacuum oven 40 c for 6 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening test and adsorbent doses the screening test for i removal was performed with various adsorbents and doses the results of the screening test are displayed in fig 1 in 2 h 0 1 g l fe alg was able to remove more than 95 of the i in the water while higher doses yielded 100 efficiency the fe alg adsorbent was observed to outperform the commercial anion exchange resin which started to reach a maximum efficiency of 100 at 1 g l the other adsorbents with high and acceptable i removal include hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells the hazelnut shells removed about 70 and 85 i at doses of 2 and 5 g l respectively the sacha inchi shells with a 5 g l dose have 100 efficiency as a result fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi were used for an extensive study as potential i adsorbents the optimum adsorbent dose of 0 5 g l for fe alg and 2 g l for hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were chosen for the detailed adsorption experiments ca alg swollen and dried cu alg swollen and dried fe alg swollen chitosan flakes swollen and dried pistachio shells peanut shells and coconut husks were not selected for further experiments due to an i removal efficiency of less than 70 at various doses the swollen fe alg at all doses was observed to adsorb i at less than 40 this was due to the presence of water in the complex which trapped fe3 and prevented its interaction with i 32 for the other metal alginate complexes ca2 and cu2 may exhibit less i attraction when compared to fe3 due to a lower positive charge the other adsorbents such as chitosan flakes pistachio shells peanut shells and coconut husks may not contain enough cationic functional groups for i removal 3 2 surface morphology and elemental composition the sem images of fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells are shown in fig 2 at 10 μm magnification the virgin fe alg was observed to have an uneven surface structure without visible pores fig 2a1 after being saturated with i a more irregular surface was observed fig 2a2 a highly irregular surface structure was apparent in the virgin form of hazelnut shells fig 2b1 and sacha inchi shells fig 2c1 while the hazelnut shells surface was observed with layers of particulates the image of sacha inchi shells exhibited a more fibrous structure slight changes to the surface morphology for hazelnut shells fig 2b2 and sacha inchi shells fig 2c2 after i adsorption was observed the elemental composition of the bio based adsorbents before and after i adsorption is reported in table 3 all adsorbents had an increased iodine mass percentage after being left in contact with i iron fe was calculated to be more than 40 becoming the dominant species in fe alg fe was bound to the alginate through metal carboxylate interactions which formed an egg box model 33 34 for hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells the edx analysis detected magnesium mg potassium k and calcium ca these compositions were due to the natural cationic mineral constituents that are present in these bio based adsorbents 28 35 the cationic nature of these adsorbents was potentially responsible for attracting i refer to section 3 3 for more information 3 3 adsorption experiments 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics and pseudo order reactions the kinetics of i removal for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were examined the results of i removal efficiency for 180 min are displayed in fig 3 a fe alg and sacha inchi shells showed 100 removal efficiency within 10 min fe alg could remove more than 99 of the i and became stable at about 30 min while anion exchange resin took 180 min to adsorb the same amount of i sacha inchi shells reached equilibrium at about 120 min hazelnut shells showed a maximum of 72 i removal with a 120 min equilibrium time the 8 day experimental results revealed that all the bio based adsorbents could retain their maximum efficiency for a 10 mg l initial i concentration fig 3a inset the linear fittings of pseudo first order and pseudo second order reactions calculated by eqs 2 and 3 are shown in fig 3b and c respectively the calculated parameters of these models are tabulated in table 4 some of the data points close to equilibrium were omitted to avoid bias as suggested by a study 36 according to the values of r2 the rate limiting step in adsorption processes for all adsorbents was better explained by the pseudo first order reaction the pseudo first order reaction eq 2 was integrated by a reaction of an order higher than 1 which is supposedly dependent on more than one reactant however only one of the reactants was considered and another was neglected as an excess reactant 37 by default the term physisorption was given as the underlying rate limiting step process in which only one reactant was considered as a result the adsorption of i by bio based adsorbents was more likely to be governed by physisorption processes 3 3 2 adsorption capacity and isotherms the concentration dependent adsorption is represented by the plots of q vs ce as presented in fig 4 a fe alg and sacha inchi shells had maximum experimental q values of about 139 and 48 4 mg g respectively both adsorbents displayed higher i adsorption capacities than that of the commercial anion exchange resin which was about 39 4 mg g at 18 9 mg g the hazelnut shells possessed the lowest experimental q value the adsorption capacity results were observed to be proportional to the amount of cationic species that is present in the adsorbents as shown in the elemental composition table 3 moreover the charges of cationic species may also affect the adsorption phenomena such that fe3 in fe alg exhibited a stronger i attraction than the ionic forms of mg k and ca the linear fits of the langmuir and freundlich models calculated by eq 4 and 5 are displayed in fig 4b and c respectively the calculated parameters of both models are shown in table 5 the langmuir model produced better fits for the bio based adsorbents with r2 values of 0 999 fig 4b the isothermal process describes the equal energy of all adsorption sites where the interactions between neighboring adsorbed molecules were neglected 38 39 this may be true for fe alg in which the attraction by fe3 was regarded as the main mechanism the calculation with langmuir model qmax yielded the maximum adsorption capacities of 139 18 8 and 45 1 mg g for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells respectively the values of qmax are similar to those of the experimental q fig 4a the log transformed results of sacha inchi shells also fit the freundlich model with r2 values of more than 0 974 fig 4c the model considered the difference in energy for different adsorption sites this could be from the effects of i attraction by different cation species on the surface of the adsorbents 38 39 n values of higher than 1 table 5 suggested that the increase in i concentration enhanced the adsorption free energy of sacha inchi shells at all sites for further sorption 3 3 3 temperature variation and thermodynamics fig 5 exhibits the i adsorption by bio based adsorbents at different temperature the adsorption capacities for all adsorbents were observed to decrease as the temperature increased from 5 to 65 c the phenomenon illustrated an exothermic nature with heat dissipation during the adsorption process this was confirmed with the thermodynamic calculation table 6 as δh values for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were 11 2 5 10 and 8 84 respectively the results of δg indicated a spontaneous reaction and δs for all systems was positive implying an increase in disorder at the surface of adsorbents as more i were being adsorbed 40 fig 4d displayed the fitting of arrhenius and the parameters calculated from eq 8 are shown in table 6 the bio based adsorbents possessed negative ea ea values of less than 40 kj mol suggest physisorption processes 41 in addition negative ea was also possible because an adsorbent with physisorption properties may not require activation energy to adsorb on a target solute rapidly 40 consequently the adsorption of i by fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells was determined to be governed by physical processes this coincided with the fittings of the pseudo first order reaction fig 3b 3 3 4 effects of ph and zeta potential competitive anions and regeneration the effects of ph are depicted in fig 6 a as the ph increases the i adsorption capacity is observed to decrease for all the bio based adsorbents at ph 3 the q values for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were 135 20 8 and 46 8 mg g respectively the adsorbents sustained their adsorption capacities until ph 7 at ph 11 the q values dropped to 128 8 12 1 and 37 9 mg g for the respective bio based adsorbent the results of zeta potential fig 6b can be used to explain the ph effect ph at the point of zero charge phpzc for fe alg and sacha inchi shells were 7 and 9 respectively at phpzc the net charge on the adsorbent surface was equal to zero this may be due to the addition of oh which was attracted by the positive charges on the adsorbent surface at higher ph phpzc the net charge on the adsorbent surface was negative due to the oh layer this may create repulsion force between the oh layer and i leading to a decrease in q the same adsorption behavior across different ph condition was observed in the adsorption of f by fumarate based metal organic frameworks and the removal of microalgae by cationic cassava starch composite 42 43 the results of i removal efficiency in the presence of other anions are exhibited in fig 6c the removal efficiency of all bio based adsorbents was highly affected by so42 this was perhaps due to the higher negative charge of the ion that created a higher attraction toward the adsorbents in seawater the i removal efficiency of fe alg was observed to decrease from 100 to 34 while sacha inchi shells adsorbed 53 of i and became the most efficient adsorbent the other anions in seawater compete for the adsorption sites in sacha inchi shells and hazelnut shells however the significant drop in the i removal efficiency of fe alg was due to the leaching of iron as the change of solute color was apparent in seawater conditions the leaching of inorganic iron could occur by hydrolysis reactions and subsequent precipitation 44 the adsorption regeneration was assessed for 5 cycles fig 6d in cycle 2 fe alg still maintained 100 i removal efficiency while in cycle 5 the efficiency decreased to 90 9 the i removal efficiency of hazelnut shells decreased to 54 2 in cycle 5 from 68 in cycle 1 the sacha inchi shells were most affected by the regeneration process as their i removal efficiency dropped to 49 9 in cycle 5 from 95 in cycle 1 each regeneration cycle reduced the adsorption performance possibly due to a loss of active surface functional groups to the solute 45 moreover this study only investigated one set of conditions for adsorbent regeneration by increasing the time or changing the temperature the i removal performance per regeneration cycle can be improved 46 3 4 mechanism of iodide adsorption by bio based adsorbents the results of xanes analyses are presented with a graph of normalized absorbance vs energy in fig 7 the characteristic absorption edges of the iodine species in the bio adsorbents were 4552 83 4553 40 ev the absorption edges were closer to that of the ki reference at 4552 83 ev than kio3 at 4560 77 ev fig 7 this verified that the oxidation state of iodine in the adsorbent was 1 47 the mechanism in the adsorption could be confirmed as physisorption i was attracted to the adsorbent without a chemical reaction or change in the iodine oxidation number this agreed with the adsorption experiment and thermodynamic calculations physisorption is explained as the attraction between adsorbents and adsorbates via processes such as hydrogen bonding electrostatic forces hydrophobic interactions or combinations 48 due to the cationic nature of the adsorbents the attraction of i by electrostatic forces is the most probable mechanism the ftir analysis was then employed to determine the functional groups or chemical species involved in the attraction of i by electrostatic forces the spectra in fig 8 a reveal peak modifications of the fe alg the asymmetric stretching of coo at 1585 cm 1 and symmetric stretching of coo at 1402 cm 1 were observed with weaker intensity after i adsorption these corresponded to the carboxylate functional groups which cross linked with fe3 in fe alg 49 a decrease in the co stretching peak at 1021 cm 1 was also observed the ftir analysis could not detect the electrostatic interaction between fe3 and i however this phenomenon may indirectly influence the structure of the neighboring deprotonated carboxyl molecules causing the peak intensity to decrease 50 the ftir results of sacha inchi shells fig 8b and hazelnut shells fig 8c exhibited to some extent a deprotonated carboxyl peak intensity modification at 1540 1650 cm 1 additionally for sacha inchi shells the oh stretching at 3372 cm 1 before i adsorption shifted to 3320 cm after i adsorption while the co stretching at 1024 cm 1 experienced a minor intensity decrease after the adsorption fig 8c according to the edx analysis sacha inchi shells and hazelnut shells contain several cationic minerals such as k mg2 and ca2 table 3 these minerals were presumed to form complexes with the proteins or lipids in plants 51 moreover tannin tannic acid was found to be abundant in hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells tannic acid can bind cationic metals mostly through the chelation by the aromatic co 28 52 53 the electrostatic attraction of i may cause alteration in the neighboring functional groups of the cationic mineral based on the bio based adsorbents characterization proposed i adsorption mechanisms are illustrated in fig 9 the electrostatic force was responsible for the i adsorption in all bio based adsorbents in the case of fe alg fe3 in the alginate complex was the cation that attracted i fig 9a on the other hand cationic minerals such as k mg2 and ca2 which could be chelated by tannic acid were responsible for removing i from the water fig 9b 3 5 comparison study recent studies on i adsorption were compared with the bio based adsorbents in this research the experimental i adsorption capacity equilibrium time and mechanism are tabulated in table 7 fe alg was observed to be comparable to the silica based poly 4 vinyl pyridine in terms of adsorption capacity and equilibrium time it outperformed fe based mof which incorporated bismuth bi to assist fe in the i attraction among all the adsorbents presented in table 7 the cryogel incorporated with silver was observed to possess the highest adsorption 326 mg g however it required a long equilibrium time 32 h hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were the only unmodified adsorbents the experimental i adsorption capacities were higher than those of palygorskite based polymer microspheres and silver based chitosan microspheres the sacha inchi shells also surpassed the commercial resin the palygorskite based polymer microspheres had the fastest equilibrium time with a higher initial i concentration the palygorskite based polymer microspheres could yield higher performance from the results of this study it can be concluded that fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells can remove i from a water environment sacha inchi shells and hazelnut shells are readily available wastes they are minimally modified and are economical incurring no costs associated with syntheses as plant based adsorbents they do not produce secondary pollution and are suitable for open environment remediation fe alg needed synthesis but the inclusion of fe3 required a simple complexation reaction in water this saved time and the usage of other solvents fe alg exhibited comparable equilibrium time and adsorption capacity to the other adsorbents with more complicated synthesis routes alginate is readily available due to its source being brown algae however with a metal in the adsorbent the adsorbent is only suitable for closed environment remediation 4 conclusion in the present study a screening test was done to search for new cation containing bio adsorbents for i adsorption based on the capacity fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were selected with 139 mg g adsorption capacity and 30 min equilibrium time fe alg outperformed the commercial polystyrene based resin and was comparable to some recently synthesized materials in removing i from water unlike fe alg the unmodified plant wastes did not require synthesis sacha inchi shells possessed 48 4 mg g of i adsorption capacity this value was higher than the commercial resin and some of the adsorbents in the literature fe alg and sacha inchi maintained a 100 removal efficiency of 10 mg l i after 8 days i 131 decay half life of contact time hazelnut shells showed a low adsorption capacity of 18 9 mg g but was stable after 5 regeneration cycles all the adsorbents were better explained by the langmuir model than the freundlich model indicating equal local energy on all adsorption sites the adsorption mechanism for these adsorbents was concluded as physisorption electrostatic attraction due to their fit to the pseudo first order model and negative ea moreover the xanes analysis revealed that no chemical reactions occurred during the adsorption as i was the only iodine species found in the adsorbent after i adsorption a change in ftir peaks occurred mostly at those peaks corresponding to the neighboring functional groups of fe3 in fe alg and cationic minerals mg2 k and ca2 of hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells in controlled waste management conditions the i removal by bio based adsorbents should be performed at low temperatures 5 25 c because exothermic processes governed the adsorption the bio based adsorbents could also be employed for i remediation in the presence of high chloride and tap water they could be used at reduced efficiency in a high ph condition and even after 5 regeneration cycles the study of i adsorption by fe alg

13654,several bio based adsorbents containing cations were screened for radioactive iodide removal from a water environment the efficiency of the selected adsorbents was assessed in different ph temperature as well as competitive ions based on the adsorption capacity iron alginate fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were selected as potential adsorbents they possessed 139 18 9 and 45 1 mg g iodide i adsorption capacities respectively the adsorption equilibrium time for fe alg was 30 min while hazelnut shells and sash inchi shells took 120 min to stabilize the adsorption results fit the langmuir isotherm model with predicted adsorption capacities similar to those of the experimental data the fitting of pseudo first order reaction and the negative values of the arrhenius activation energy inferred that the adsorption had a physical nature the iodine x ray absorption edges of 4552 83 4553 40 ev from the near edge structure analysis confirmed the physisorption as the i in bio based adsorbents did not go through any chemical transformation fe3 was used to synthesize fe alg with an energy dispersive x ray analysis magnesium potassium and calcium were detected in the hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells consequently the binding of i to the surface of the adsorbents was mainly through electrostatic forces with the cationic species on the surface of the adsorbents the selected bio based adsorbents could be used for industrial effluents in natural water environments as they exhibited i adsorption at various ph levels temperatures and in the presence of competitive anions keywords adsorption isotherms radioactive iodide biomaterials water environment 1 introduction with the growth of the world population a rise in energy consumption is inevitable nuclear power is considered as an essential source for securing future electrical power however its radioactive waste products have been an issue to be dealt with 1 the radioactive iodine species are considered to be hazardous although i 131 has a half life of 8 days its decay mechanism produces β particles with high specific activity 130 000 ci g that can destroy the thyroid gland and causes thyroid cancer 2 4 i 129 emits β particles with a less specific energy of 1 8 10 4 ci g but its 1 6 million year half life causes a problem of radioactive waste accumulation 2 a recent study suggested that after three decades of chernobyl incidents 1 56 m bq kg of highly water soluble i 129 was still detected in the soil of the contaminated areas 5 during the fukushima daiichi nuclear accident in japan up to 11 pbq total activity of i 131 and 62 107 atoms l of i 129 were discharged into the water environment 6 7 leakages from nuclear waste disposal sites and medical facilities also contributed to the discharge of the contaminants 8 11 in the water environment iodide i is a common disassociate form of radioactive iodine the sources of the pollutant include nuclear power plants and waste disposal sites 12 13 many kinds of technologies have been used to remove i from water these include membrane separation silver precipitation and immobilization by cementitious materials 14 16 membrane separation requires high energy while the silver precipitation method adds metallic silver directly to the water body both technologies are suitable only in closed environment remediation cement production is poisonous to the environment because it produces by products such as chlorine sox nox mercury lead chromium and arsenic 17 adsorption processes have become an essential technology for the natural environment and industry effluent remediation the merits of adsorption include straightforward operation economical utilization of low cost bio based materials effectiveness at low contaminant concentrations and continuous improvement by adsorbent modification for selectivity of adsorbate several types of commercial polystyrene based anion exchange resins were reported to reduce i in groundwater in a laboratory study the i removal capacity of a silica based ion exchange resin was about 149 mg g 18 19 however these polystyrene based resins bearing cationic quaternary amines relied on fossil fuel based chemicals for their production other commercial adsorbents such as activated carbon and zeolite were considered as bio derived materials however they were susceptible to a low adsorption efficiency of about 50 and 30 respectively at 50 μg l initial i concentration 20 there were attempts to improve the performance of the activated carbon by incorporating silver an estimated maximum i adsorption capacity of 127 mg g was reported 21 22 the complexation of alginate by metal ions could also create potential adsorbents for anionic contaminant removal with the reduction of i2 to i maghemite and titanium dioxide alginate beads yielded 19 5 mg g adsorption capacity 23 the adsorption of arsenate by copper and iron alginate complexes was studied 24 however these adsorbents have not been used for the direct adsorption of i in solution another group of potential bio based adsorbents is biomass that contains cationic functional groups in our previous study an agricultural waste that contained anthocyanin successfully exhibited i adsorption through electrostatic and ion exchange mechanisms 25 the same concept brought our attention to plant wastes such as seeds and shells which contain abundant cationic minerals or proteins 26 28 this study has found new and potential natural based products and waste biomass for the i removal in water the screening tests are carried out for several bio based adsorbents the dried form of iron alginate hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells show satisfactory performance and are studied for i adsorption in detail to our knowledge these adsorbents have never been tested for i removal in an aqueous environment by choosing these adsorbents we take the simple concept of electrostatic attraction and use it for removing anion pollution the adsorbents are also characterized to confirm the underlying i adsorption mechanism lastly the other adsorbents in previous research were brought to compare with the selected bio based adsorbents in this study 2 methodology 2 1 reagents the list of reagents their abbreviations used in this text and sources are shown in table 1 in this study the source of i was ki the reagents for i quantification include 4 4 4 methylidynetris n n dimethylaniline monopersulfate triple salt c6h8o7 h2o nh4oh nh4h2po4 hgcl2 and h2so4 the laboratory grade sodium alginate and chitosan flakes were not preferred due to their high cost and less suitability for the adsorbent preparation 2 2 bio based adsorbent preparations the sodium alginate gel of 2 w v was prepared and added dropwise into different 2 w v metal solutions these solutions were prepared separately with cacl2 cucl2 and fecl₃ a metering pump dmi 1 1 16 grundfos germany was used and set up for 1 l h to control the bead size swollen beads of calcium alginate ca alg copper alginate cu alg and iron alginate fe alg were formed the beads were allowed to settle in the solution for 24 h after separation the beads were washed 3 times with di water and dried at 60 c in an oven a swollen bead was about 5 cm in diameter when it was dried the diameter was reduced to about 2 cm before being used dried beads were kept in a closed container while swollen beads were kept in di water the chitosan flakes were crushed into pieces they were weighted and added to the 2 v v acetic acid solution to create 2 w v chitosan gel the solution was stirred until the flakes dissolved the obtained chitosan gel was added dropwise to a 2 w v stpp solution the swollen beads were allowed to sit in the solution for 24 h after drying in an oven at a temperature of 60 c the dried beads were kept in a closed container before being used and the swollen ones were kept in di water pistachio shells peanut shells sacha inchi plukenetia volubilis shells and coconut husks were obtained from a local market at the same time hazelnuts were bought from an online store and only its shells were used all plant wastes were washed with di water before being dried in an oven they were ground sieved with standard sieves for 0 5 0 711 mm pieces and stored in sealed containers until further use an anion exchange resin of commercial grade was employed as a reference in the adsorption experiment the resin had a 50 100 mesh size and was used without further modification the summary of adsorbent names abbreviation and preparation methods are tabulated in table 2 2 3 screening tests to quantify i in solution the leuco crystal violet lcv method was employed 29 the method created a violet solution in which the intensity was proportional to i concentration quantified by the absorption of light 592 nm produced by a uv vis spectrometer lambda 25 perkin elmer usa at room temperature the adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate on an orbital shaker 150 rpm the screening test condition was set up with 10 mg l initial i concentration 2 h contact time and the adsorbent doses of 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 2 and 5 g l the removal efficiency was determined by the total percentage of i being adsorbed by the adsorbent after a given contact time i removal efficiency was calculated by eq 1 1 i removal efficiency c i c e c i 100 where ci and cₑ represents i concentration in the water mg l before and after the adsorption respectively only the selected adsorbents from the screening test were characterized and examined further for the adsorption mechanism 2 4 bio based adsorbent characterizations the i saturated adsorbents were prepared by conducting the adsorption at 100 mg l i initial concentration the optimum dose of adsorbents and equilibrium contact time were used a scanning electron microscope sem joel jcm 6000plus japan was employed to investigate the surface morphology alteration sem images of the virgin and i saturated adsorbents were obtained for comparison the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx joel jcm 6000plus japan was used to analyze the elemental composition in the virgin and saturated adsorbents 2 5 adsorption experiments the appropriate dose of adsorbent was chosen for the kinetic experiment which was conducted at 0 180 min at room temperature the initial i concentration was 10 mg l the pseudo order reactions were used to explain the behavior of the rate limiting steps of the i adsorption the adsorption results were fit to the linearized form of the pseudo first order and pseudo second order reactions as displayed in eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 log q e q t l o g q e k 1 2 303 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k1 is the constant derived from pseudo first order

the adsorbate was tested the desorption of i was determined after leaving the adsorbents in contact with i for a duration equivalent to the half life of i 131 8 days or 192 h after the kinetic experiment the obtained equilibrium time for the respective adsorbent was used to understand the adsorption efficiency at various i concentrations 0 5 10 20 40 60 80 100 and 200 mg l the adsorbent capacity denoted by q mg g in the concentration dependent study can be calculated by eq 2 2 q c i c ₑ v m where ci and cₑ are defined as the i concentration in the water mg l before and after the adsorption respectively v is the volume of solute l while m represents the mass of the bio based adsorbent used in the adsorption experiment the optimum dose of adsorbent was used at room temperature to comprehend the isothermal process of the i adsorption the linear equations of the langmuir model in eq 4 and freundlich model in eq 5 were used 4 c e q 1 k l q m a x c e q m a x 5 ln q 1 n ln c e ln k f where qmax is the i adsorption capacity predicted by the langmuir model mg g and kl and kf are the langmuir l g and freundlich constant l g respectively n from freundlich equation refers to an exponent corresponding to the degree of free energy and sorption intensity to evaluate the effect of temperature the i adsorption at various concentrations was repeated at 5 15 25 45 and 65 c the linear plot of eq 6 and the calculation of eq 7 were used to determine the thermodynamic parameters the activation energy was also obtained from the fitting of the arrhenius equation eq 8 6 ln k l δ h

experiment with low adsorbate concentration and weak charge interaction kl calculated from the langmuir model is recommended as a distribution coefficient by a previous study 30 the effect of ph 3 5 7 and 11 on i adsorption was investigated hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m were added to the solute to adjust the ph to examine the anion selectivity the adsorption experiment was conducted with additions of competitive anions such as cl so4 2 hco₃ and br these anions were prepared from nacl naso4 nahco₃ and kbr respectively with the concentration of the seawater composition 31 tap water and seawater were also used in the selectivity experiment the seawater was taken from chon buri province thailand the adsorption regeneration tests were performed for 5 cycles each regeneration was done by submerging the bio based adsorbents in excess 1 m nacl for 1 h in the ph anion selectivity and adsorption regeneration experiments the optimum dose of adsorbent and equilibrium time were used with 10 mg l initial i concentration at room temperature 2 6 investigation of i removal mechanism zeta potential mv of fe alg and sacha inchi shells were determined in different ph conditions 3 5 7 and 11 hcl 0 1 m and naoh 0 1 m were used to adjust the ph of di water the adsorbents were ground into powder and added to ph adjusted water to create colloid after 2 h the colloid was transferred to a clear disposable zeta cell zeta potential was measured by a particle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd uk with the dynamic light scattering method x ray absorption spectroscopy xas was used to determine the adsorbents local structure of and the adsorbed iodine oxidation state the instrument was located at beamline 5 2 in synchrotron light research institute nakhon ratchasima thailand the xas was equipped with electron energy of 1 2 gev iodine liii edge probe element 4557 ev of 0 2 ev energy step and germanium 220 double crystals monochromator to obtain the x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectra the fluorescence mode was applied during the analysis of i saturated adsorbents ki and kio₃ were used as references the possible functional groups responsible for attracting i was investigated by analyzing the adsorbents virgin and saturated with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher scientific nicolet is50 usa the removal of moisture was done by leaving the adsorbents in a vacuum oven 40 c for 6 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 screening test and adsorbent doses the screening test for i removal was performed with various adsorbents and doses the results of the screening test are displayed in fig 1 in 2 h 0 1 g l fe alg was able to remove more than 95 of the i in the water while higher doses yielded 100 efficiency the fe alg adsorbent was observed to outperform the commercial anion exchange resin which started to reach a maximum efficiency of 100 at 1 g l the other adsorbents with high and acceptable i removal include hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells the hazelnut shells removed about 70 and 85 i at doses of 2 and 5 g l respectively the sacha inchi shells with a 5 g l dose have 100 efficiency as a result fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi were used for an extensive study as potential i adsorbents the optimum adsorbent dose of 0 5 g l for fe alg and 2 g l for hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were chosen for the detailed adsorption experiments ca alg swollen and dried cu alg swollen and dried fe alg swollen chitosan flakes swollen and dried pistachio shells peanut shells and coconut husks were not selected for further experiments due to an i removal efficiency of less than 70 at various doses the swollen fe alg at all doses was observed to adsorb i at less than 40 this was due to the presence of water in the complex which trapped fe3 and prevented its interaction with i 32 for the other metal alginate complexes ca2 and cu2 may exhibit less i attraction when compared to fe3 due to a lower positive charge the other adsorbents such as chitosan flakes pistachio shells peanut shells and coconut husks may not contain enough cationic functional groups for i removal 3 2 surface morphology and elemental composition the sem images of fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells are shown in fig 2 at 10 μm magnification the virgin fe alg was observed to have an uneven surface structure without visible pores fig 2a1 after being saturated with i a more irregular surface was observed fig 2a2 a highly irregular surface structure was apparent in the virgin form of hazelnut shells fig 2b1 and sacha inchi shells fig 2c1 while the hazelnut shells surface was observed with layers of particulates the image of sacha inchi shells exhibited a more fibrous structure slight changes to the surface morphology for hazelnut shells fig 2b2 and sacha inchi shells fig 2c2 after i adsorption was observed the elemental composition of the bio based adsorbents before and after i adsorption is reported in table 3 all adsorbents had an increased iodine mass percentage after being left in contact with i iron fe was calculated to be more than 40 becoming the dominant species in fe alg fe was bound to the alginate through metal carboxylate interactions which formed an egg box model 33 34 for hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells the edx analysis detected magnesium mg potassium k and calcium ca these compositions were due to the natural cationic mineral constituents that are present in these bio based adsorbents 28 35 the cationic nature of these adsorbents was potentially responsible for attracting i refer to section 3 3 for more information 3 3 adsorption experiments 3 3 1 adsorption kinetics and pseudo order reactions the kinetics of i removal for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were examined the results of i removal efficiency for 180 min are displayed in fig 3 a fe alg and sacha inchi shells showed 100 removal efficiency within 10 min fe alg could remove more than 99 of the i and became stable at about 30 min while anion exchange resin took 180 min to adsorb the same amount of i sacha inchi shells reached equilibrium at about 120 min hazelnut shells showed a maximum of 72 i removal with a 120 min equilibrium time the 8 day experimental results revealed that all the bio based adsorbents could retain their maximum efficiency for a 10 mg l initial i concentration fig 3a inset the linear fittings of pseudo first order and pseudo second order reactions calculated by eqs 2 and 3 are shown in fig 3b and c respectively the calculated parameters of these models are tabulated in table 4 some of the data points close to equilibrium were omitted to avoid bias as suggested by a study 36 according to the values of r2 the rate limiting step in adsorption processes for all adsorbents was better explained by the pseudo first order reaction the pseudo first order reaction eq 2 was integrated by a reaction of an order higher than 1 which is supposedly dependent on more than one reactant however only one of the reactants was considered and another was neglected as an excess reactant 37 by default the term physisorption was given as the underlying rate limiting step process in which only one reactant was considered as a result the adsorption of i by bio based adsorbents was more likely to be governed by physisorption processes 3 3 2 adsorption capacity and isotherms the concentration dependent adsorption is represented by the plots of q vs ce as presented in fig 4 a fe alg and sacha inchi shells had maximum experimental q values of about 139 and 48 4 mg g respectively both adsorbents displayed higher i adsorption capacities than that of the commercial anion exchange resin which was about 39 4 mg g at 18 9 mg g the hazelnut shells possessed the lowest experimental q value the adsorption capacity results were observed to be proportional to the amount of cationic species that is present in the adsorbents as shown in the elemental composition table 3 moreover the charges of cationic species may also affect the adsorption phenomena such that fe3 in fe alg exhibited a stronger i attraction than the ionic forms of mg k and ca the linear fits of the langmuir and freundlich models calculated by eq 4 and 5 are displayed in fig 4b and c respectively the calculated parameters of both models are shown in table 5 the langmuir model produced better fits for the bio based adsorbents with r2 values of 0 999 fig 4b the isothermal process describes the equal energy of all adsorption sites where the interactions between neighboring adsorbed molecules were neglected 38 39 this may be true for fe alg in which the attraction by fe3 was regarded as the main mechanism the calculation with langmuir model qmax yielded the maximum adsorption capacities of 139 18 8 and 45 1 mg g for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells respectively the values of qmax are similar to those of the experimental q fig 4a the log transformed results of sacha inchi shells also fit the freundlich model with r2 values of more than 0 974 fig 4c the model considered the difference in energy for different adsorption sites this could be from the effects of i attraction by different cation species on the surface of the adsorbents 38 39 n values of higher than 1 table 5 suggested that the increase in i concentration enhanced the adsorption free energy of sacha inchi shells at all sites for further sorption 3 3 3 temperature variation and thermodynamics fig 5 exhibits the i adsorption by bio based adsorbents at different temperature the adsorption capacities for all adsorbents were observed to decrease as the temperature increased from 5 to 65 c the phenomenon illustrated an exothermic nature with heat dissipation during the adsorption process this was confirmed with the thermodynamic calculation table 6 as δh values for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were 11 2 5 10 and 8 84 respectively the results of δg indicated a spontaneous reaction and δs for all systems was positive implying an increase in disorder at the surface of adsorbents as more i were being adsorbed 40 fig 4d displayed the fitting of arrhenius and the parameters calculated from eq 8 are shown in table 6 the bio based adsorbents possessed negative ea ea values of less than 40 kj mol suggest physisorption processes 41 in addition negative ea was also possible because an adsorbent with physisorption properties may not require activation energy to adsorb on a target solute rapidly 40 consequently the adsorption of i by fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells was determined to be governed by physical processes this coincided with the fittings of the pseudo first order reaction fig 3b 3 3 4 effects of ph and zeta potential competitive anions and regeneration the effects of ph are depicted in fig 6 a as the ph increases the i adsorption capacity is observed to decrease for all the bio based adsorbents at ph 3 the q values for fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were 135 20 8 and 46 8 mg g respectively the adsorbents sustained their adsorption capacities until ph 7 at ph 11 the q values dropped to 128 8 12 1 and 37 9 mg g for the respective bio based adsorbent the results of zeta potential fig 6b can be used to explain the ph effect ph at the point of zero charge phpzc for fe alg and sacha inchi shells were 7 and 9 respectively at phpzc the net charge on the adsorbent surface was equal to zero this may be due to the addition of oh which was attracted by the positive charges on the adsorbent surface at higher ph phpzc the net charge on the adsorbent surface was negative due to the oh layer this may create repulsion force between the oh layer and i leading to a decrease in q the same adsorption behavior across different ph condition was observed in the adsorption of f by fumarate based metal organic frameworks and the removal of microalgae by cationic cassava starch composite 42 43 the results of i removal efficiency in the presence of other anions are exhibited in fig 6c the removal efficiency of all bio based adsorbents was highly affected by so42 this was perhaps due to the higher negative charge of the ion that created a higher attraction toward the adsorbents in seawater the i removal efficiency of fe alg was observed to decrease from 100 to 34 while sacha inchi shells adsorbed 53 of i and became the most efficient adsorbent the other anions in seawater compete for the adsorption sites in sacha inchi shells and hazelnut shells however the significant drop in the i removal efficiency of fe alg was due to the leaching of iron as the change of solute color was apparent in seawater conditions the leaching of inorganic iron could occur by hydrolysis reactions and subsequent precipitation 44 the adsorption regeneration was assessed for 5 cycles fig 6d in cycle 2 fe alg still maintained 100 i removal efficiency while in cycle 5 the efficiency decreased to 90 9 the i removal efficiency of hazelnut shells decreased to 54 2 in cycle 5 from 68 in cycle 1 the sacha inchi shells were most affected by the regeneration process as their i removal efficiency dropped to 49 9 in cycle 5 from 95 in cycle 1 each regeneration cycle reduced the adsorption performance possibly due to a loss of active surface functional groups to the solute 45 moreover this study only investigated one set of conditions for adsorbent regeneration by increasing the time or changing the temperature the i removal performance per regeneration cycle can be improved 46 3 4 mechanism of iodide adsorption by bio based adsorbents the results of xanes analyses are presented with a graph of normalized absorbance vs energy in fig 7 the characteristic absorption edges of the iodine species in the bio adsorbents were 4552 83 4553 40 ev the absorption edges were closer to that of the ki reference at 4552 83 ev than kio3 at 4560 77 ev fig 7 this verified that the oxidation state of iodine in the adsorbent was 1 47 the mechanism in the adsorption could be confirmed as physisorption i was attracted to the adsorbent without a chemical reaction or change in the iodine oxidation number this agreed with the adsorption experiment and thermodynamic calculations physisorption is explained as the attraction between adsorbents and adsorbates via processes such as hydrogen bonding electrostatic forces hydrophobic interactions or combinations 48 due to the cationic nature of the adsorbents the attraction of i by electrostatic forces is the most probable mechanism the ftir analysis was then employed to determine the functional groups or chemical species involved in the attraction of i by electrostatic forces the spectra in fig 8 a reveal peak modifications of the fe alg the asymmetric stretching of coo at 1585 cm 1 and symmetric stretching of coo at 1402 cm 1 were observed with weaker intensity after i adsorption these corresponded to the carboxylate functional groups which cross linked with fe3 in fe alg 49 a decrease in the co stretching peak at 1021 cm 1 was also observed the ftir analysis could not detect the electrostatic interaction between fe3 and i however this phenomenon may indirectly influence the structure of the neighboring deprotonated carboxyl molecules causing the peak intensity to decrease 50 the ftir results of sacha inchi shells fig 8b and hazelnut shells fig 8c exhibited to some extent a deprotonated carboxyl peak intensity modification at 1540 1650 cm 1 additionally for sacha inchi shells the oh stretching at 3372 cm 1 before i adsorption shifted to 3320 cm after i adsorption while the co stretching at 1024 cm 1 experienced a minor intensity decrease after the adsorption fig 8c according to the edx analysis sacha inchi shells and hazelnut shells contain several cationic minerals such as k mg2 and ca2 table 3 these minerals were presumed to form complexes with the proteins or lipids in plants 51 moreover tannin tannic acid was found to be abundant in hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells tannic acid can bind cationic metals mostly through the chelation by the aromatic co 28 52 53 the electrostatic attraction of i may cause alteration in the neighboring functional groups of the cationic mineral based on the bio based adsorbents characterization proposed i adsorption mechanisms are illustrated in fig 9 the electrostatic force was responsible for the i adsorption in all bio based adsorbents in the case of fe alg fe3 in the alginate complex was the cation that attracted i fig 9a on the other hand cationic minerals such as k mg2 and ca2 which could be chelated by tannic acid were responsible for removing i from the water fig 9b 3 5 comparison study recent studies on i adsorption were compared with the bio based adsorbents in this research the experimental i adsorption capacity equilibrium time and mechanism are tabulated in table 7 fe alg was observed to be comparable to the silica based poly 4 vinyl pyridine in terms of adsorption capacity and equilibrium time it outperformed fe based mof which incorporated bismuth bi to assist fe in the i attraction among all the adsorbents presented in table 7 the cryogel incorporated with silver was observed to possess the highest adsorption 326 mg g however it required a long equilibrium time 32 h hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were the only unmodified adsorbents the experimental i adsorption capacities were higher than those of palygorskite based polymer microspheres and silver based chitosan microspheres the sacha inchi shells also surpassed the commercial resin the palygorskite based polymer microspheres had the fastest equilibrium time with a higher initial i concentration the palygorskite based polymer microspheres could yield higher performance from the results of this study it can be concluded that fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells can remove i from a water environment sacha inchi shells and hazelnut shells are readily available wastes they are minimally modified and are economical incurring no costs associated with syntheses as plant based adsorbents they do not produce secondary pollution and are suitable for open environment remediation fe alg needed synthesis but the inclusion of fe3 required a simple complexation reaction in water this saved time and the usage of other solvents fe alg exhibited comparable equilibrium time and adsorption capacity to the other adsorbents with more complicated synthesis routes alginate is readily available due to its source being brown algae however with a metal in the adsorbent the adsorbent is only suitable for closed environment remediation 4 conclusion in the present study a screening test was done to search for new cation containing bio adsorbents for i adsorption based on the capacity fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells were selected with 139 mg g adsorption capacity and 30 min equilibrium time fe alg outperformed the commercial polystyrene based resin and was comparable to some recently synthesized materials in removing i from water unlike fe alg the unmodified plant wastes did not require synthesis sacha inchi shells possessed 48 4 mg g of i adsorption capacity this value was higher than the commercial resin and some of the adsorbents in the literature fe alg and sacha inchi maintained a 100 removal efficiency of 10 mg l i after 8 days i 131 decay half life of contact time hazelnut shells showed a low adsorption capacity of 18 9 mg g but was stable after 5 regeneration cycles all the adsorbents were better explained by the langmuir model than the freundlich model indicating equal local energy on all adsorption sites the adsorption mechanism for these adsorbents was concluded as physisorption electrostatic attraction due to their fit to the pseudo first order model and negative ea moreover the xanes analysis revealed that no chemical reactions occurred during the adsorption as i was the only iodine species found in the adsorbent after i adsorption a change in ftir peaks occurred mostly at those peaks corresponding to the neighboring functional groups of fe3 in fe alg and cationic minerals mg2 k and ca2 of hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells in controlled waste management conditions the i removal by bio based adsorbents should be performed at low temperatures 5 25 c because exothermic processes governed the adsorption the bio based adsorbents could also be employed for i remediation in the presence of high chloride and tap water they could be used at reduced efficiency in a high ph condition and even after 5 regeneration cycles the study of i adsorption by fe alg hazelnut shells and sacha inchi shells yielded novel and sustainable alternatives for radioactive waste remediation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
