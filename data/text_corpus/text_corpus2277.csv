water mean sd concentrations of elements in the sludge water used in the study are presented in table 1 the concentrations of al b fe and mn were higher than the recommended thresholds fao 1985 ema 2007 for both long term and short term irrigation table 1 the cu concentration was within limits for short term use but not for long term use the sludge water had a suspended solid portion of 5 7 which contained much higher proportions of these elements than the liquid fraction the ph of the sludge water was 6 9 0 1 and ec ranged from 0 14 to 0 15 ds m 1 the sludge water was generally low in macronutrients except for p and sulphur table 2 3 2 characteristics of the soils the clay soil had higher organic carbon ph exchangeable k and ca and extractable p and zn and lower mg mn and cu than the sandy loam soil table 3 3 3 dry matter yield of brachiaria and lucerne there was a significant interaction p 0 002 between soil type and sludge water concentration on brachiaria dry matter yield increase in sludge water concentration increased yield p 0 015 in both soils however dry matter yield from pots irrigated with 25 sludge water was not significantly different from the control and there were no differences between the soils at higher sludge water concentrations plants grown in the clay soil had higher dry matter yield than in the sandy loam fig 1 a lucerne dry matter yield was higher on the clay soil at sludge water concentrations up to 50 with no differences between the soils at 75 and 100 sludge water the increase in lucerne dry matter in the sandy loam soil was linear while in the clay soil yield increased reached a maximum at 50 sludge water and then declined with increasing sludge water concentration fig 1b 3 4 nutrient uptake by brachiaria and lucerne the interaction effects of soil type and sludge water concentration were not significant on brachiaria n uptake but significant interaction was observed in lucerne brachiaria uptake of n was not affected by soil type but increased with increasing sludge water concentration with 75 and 100 significantly higher than the control fig 2 a lucerne had higher n uptake in the clay than the sandy loam soil only for the 0 and 25 sludge water fig 2b uptake of p k and ca was significantly affected by interaction of soil type and sludge water concentration phosphorus uptake significantly increased with sludge water concentration in the clay soil but not in the sand for both crops and the differences between the soils were only significant for the 50 75 and 100 sludge water fig 2c and d uptake of k and ca followed similar trends to that of dry matter yield with higher uptake in the clay soil in brachiaria ca and k uptake at 50 75 and 100 sludge water were significantly higher than the control in both soils fig 3 a and b while in lucerne this occurred in the sandy loam soil only fig 4 a and b uptake of cu fe mn and zn was significantly affected by the interaction of soil type and sludge water concentration p 0 05 in both brachiaria and lucerne with higher amounts in the clay soil than the sandy loam soil for each water concentration brachiaria uptake of cu significantly increased with increase in sludge water concentration in the clay soil but not in sandy loam table 4 however for lucerne the 50 and 75 treatments in the clay soil as well as 50 and 100 treatments in the sandy loam soil significantly increased cu uptake uptake of fe by both crops was not significantly affected by sludge water concentration in the sandy loam soil however in the clay soil the 50 75 and 100 sludge water concentration had significantly higher fe uptake than the control for both crops brachiaria uptake of mn from the clay soil was significantly higher in the 50 75 and 100 sludge water treatments while lucerne mn uptake in the same soil with all sludge water concentrations was significantly higher than the control brachiaria mn uptake in the sandy loam was significantly higher than the control only at 100 sludge water while lucerne uptake in the same soil was not affected by sludge water concentration brachiaria uptake of b was not significantly affected by soil type but increased with increasing sludge water concentration with 75 and 100 treatments having significantly higher uptake than the control in both soils table 4 lucerne b uptake was significantly affected by both soil type and sludge water concentration with 50 75 and 100 treatments having significantly higher uptake than the control in the sandy loam soil however in the clay soil only the 75 treatment resulted in significantly higher b uptake than the control table 5 3 5 concentrations of trace elements in brachiaria and lucerne tissue there was a significant interaction between sludge water concentration and soil type for tissue mn and cu concentration in both crops brachiaria tissue mn was similar in all the treatments except for the 100 sludge water in the sandy loam soil which had significantly higher concentrations than the control table 6 lucerne tissue mn concentration in the clay soil was higher than in the control in all treatments but no significant differences were found between sludge water treatments in the sandy loam soil table 6 tissue cu of brachiaria in the control 0 sludge water was higher in the clay and lower in the sandy loam than the sludge water treatments with higher concentrations in the sandy loam than the clay soil table 6 for lucerne tissue cu declined with increase in sludge water concentration in the sandy loam and was not affected by sludge water in the clay there were no significant differences in brachiaria tissue zn in both soils and across sludge water concentrations except for the 100 sludge water which had higher concentration than the control in the sandy loam soil table 6 tissue zn in lucerne was higher for the clay than sandy loam soil but was not affected by sludge water concentration tissue concentrations of al and fe in both crops were not significantly affected by sludge water concentration with higher concentrations in the sandy loam than in the clay soil table 7 lucerne tissue fe was higher while al and cu were lower in the clay soil than the sandy loam soil table 7 tissue b was not affected by either soil type or sludge water concentration in both crops 3 6 effect of irrigation of brachiaria and lucerne with sludge water on soil characteristics irrigation of brachiaria with different sludge water concentrations significantly increased soil ph in both soils but with a greater ph change in the sandy loam soil than the clay soil table 8 irrigation of lucerne increased soil ph in the sandy loam soil with the 75 and 100 treatments having significantly higher ph than the control table 9 extractable p was not affected by sludge water concentration in both soils and for both crops in the clay soil extractable cu was significantly higher than the control in the 100 sludge water treatment for both crops however in the sandy loam only the 75 sludge water treatment had available soil cu significantly different from the control for brachiaria and the 100 sludge water treatment for lucerne available mn was not affected by sludge water concentration in the clay soil but was significantly higher at 100 sludge water concentration than the control in the sandy loam for both crops with lucerne available zn decreased with increasing sludge water concentration in the sandy loam but not in the clay soil 4 discussion dry matter yield of lucerne and brachiaria increased with increase in sludge water concentration due to increased uptake of macronutrients and micronutrients which supported plant growth increased uptake of n p ca k mn and zn by brachiaria with increasing sludge water concentration may explain the increased dry matter a number of studies have obtained similar results with sludge solid phase from the sludge water bugbee and frink 1985 mahdy et al 2008 rigby et al 2013 increasing lucerne dry matter yield with increasing sludge water concentration was expected because the sludge water contained high b levels and lucerne is known to respond with increased dry matter yield on addition of b sherrell 1983 turan et al 2009 this view was supported by the b uptake results for lucerne the trend in lucerne dry matter in the clay soil was nonlinear and increased from 0 to 50 sludge water and decreased thereafter a trend similar to that observed in n k and ca uptake at 75 and 100 sludge water concentration lucerne uptake of potentially toxic elements may have increased to levels high enough to affect plant growth this could be explained by higher tissue mn in the clay soil treated with sludge water than the control although there were no significant differences among the different levels of sludge water increasing sludge water concentration was expected to reduce plant availability and subsequent uptake of p zn and mn due to precipitation or adsorption by the aluminium hydroxide in the sludge water makris et al 2005 hanani et al 2008 immobilisation of p is favoured at low ph less than 5 3 and high ph above 7 5 yang et al 2007 the ph values in the soils after harvest were within the range where most plant essential nutrients are readily available under these ph conditions higher concentration of sludge water increased available p in the soil resulting in greater uptake particularly in the clay the sludge water used has only 5 7 total suspended solids making the loading rates lower than dewatered sludge amendments reported in most literature bugbee and frink 1985 codling et al 2002 rigby et al 2013 lower p uptake by lucerne in the clay soil in the 75 and 100 treatments than the 50 treatment may be attributed to the reduced growth and dry matter yield the lower p uptake in the sandy loam soil for both crops may be due to the lower p concentrations in the sandy loam than the clay soil and the lower soil levels were also evident after harvest tables 8 and 9 the higher dry matter accumulation in the clay soil than the sandy soil explains the higher uptake despite the high concentration of al b fe mn and cu mostly in the solid fraction increasing sludge water concentration did not induce any toxicity or reduce yields of brachiaria in both soils this could either be because they are bound in the solid fraction and hence unavailable to the plant and or because brachiaria is known to tolerate low fertility soils grasses like brachiaria are more tolerant to excess mn than legumes hosking et al 1986 renvoize et al 1996 a similar trend was observed in lucerne grown in the sandy loam soil and may be attributed to increase in soil ph with increasing sludge water concentration that may have reduced mn availability in the sandy loam soil the neutral ph of the sludge water and that of the soils after the pot trial especially the 100 sludge water treatment table 8 suggests that most of these elements occurred in the solid phase minimising their uptake by the plants the increase in ph due to sludge water application suggests that long term application may raise the ph of the soil resulting in the immobilisation of these elements with minimal toxic effects however tissue al and fe both 1000 mg kg 1 occurred at levels higher than the maximum tolerable levels for cattle nrc 2005 in both brachiaria and lucerne although they were not affected by the sludge water concentration most of the tissue fe and al originated from the acidic soils used in the study and could be toxic to cattle irrespective of whether sludge water was used or not the increase in ph with sludge water application and its effects on tissue elemental composition including mn al and fe need to be monitored if sludge water is used for irrigation of pastures lucerne grown in the clay soil and irrigated with 100 sludge water showed signs of mn toxicity and this may have been responsible for the reduced yield because lucerne is highly sensitive to excess mn reichman 2002 these symptoms were not observed in lucerne grown on the sandy loam soil probably because mn was in an unavailable form though mn availability decreases with increase in ph mn toxicity is possible at a ph not low enough for al toxicity kabata pendias and pendias 2001 the higher ph increase in the sandy loam soil which was not observed in the clay soil due to its higher buffering capacity may have reduced the availability of mn added with the sludge water for lucerne the tissue mn concentration in all the other treatments besides the control was within the range 500 1 000 mg kg 1 which can be toxic to both plants 300 mg kg 1 and animals fao 1979 smith et al 1983 sale et al 1992 the relatively lower soil exchangeable acidity after brachiaria than after lucerne confirm the view that brachiaria detoxifies al quiceno 2012 available mn and cu in the clay soil did not significantly change but increased in the sandy loam soil under brachiaria because of the addition of these from the sludge water without increased uptake by the plant this increase was not observed in the clay soil under lucerne because increasing sludge water concentrations resulted in an increase in their uptake brachiaria tissue cu concentration and uptake increased with increasing sludge water concentration resulting in reduced available cu in the soil the lower tissue cu in the sludge water treatments than the control for brachiaria in the clay was a dilution effect due to greater dry matter accumulation where biomass accumulation was limited compared to the control this effect was either not evident or followed the opposite trend as smaller plants accumulated the nutrient 5 conclusions the trends observed in brachiaria dry matter showed benefits of irrigating with sludge water even without dilution increase in sludge water concentration resulted in an increase in yield and uptake of both macronutrients and micronutrients without accumulating pollutants in the tissue to plant toxic levels in both soils in lucerne on the sandy loam soil increasing sludge water concentration resulted in increase in dry matter yield and uptake of nutrients however in the clay soil an increase in sludge water concentration resulted in a nonlinear increase in lucerne dry matter yield with the undiluted sludge water resulting in tissue mn concentration that may have been toxic to lucerne the soil ph increased with increasing sludge water application more in the sandy loam soil than in the clay soil availability of mn and cu in the sandy loam soil may be a concern at higher concentrations of sludge water aluminium and fe in brachiaria and lucerne grown in acidic soils exceed maximum tolerable levels for cattle and may lead to toxicity the long term effects of sludge water concentrations on soil properties and plant growth must be investigated experiments with grazing animals are recommended as the long term addition of the elements in the sludge water may be balanced by removal by grazing over long periods and the effects on grazing animals need investigation further studies to assess the effect of the sludge water on soil physical and biological properties are also needed conflicts of interest none funding this work was supported by the african capacity building foundation wua capacity building project grant

macronutrients except for p and sulphur table 2 3 2 characteristics of the soils the clay soil had higher organic carbon ph exchangeable k and ca and extractable p and zn and lower mg mn and cu than the sandy loam soil table 3 3 3 dry matter yield of brachiaria and lucerne there was a significant interaction p 0 002 between soil type and sludge water concentration on brachiaria dry matter yield increase in sludge water concentration increased yield p 0 015 in both soils however dry matter yield from pots irrigated with 25 sludge water was not significantly different from the control and there were no differences between the soils at higher sludge water concentrations plants grown in the clay soil had higher dry matter yield than in the sandy loam fig 1 a lucerne dry matter yield was higher on the clay soil at sludge water concentrations up to 50 with no differences between the soils at 75 and 100 sludge water the increase in lucerne dry matter in the sandy loam soil was linear while in the clay soil yield increased reached a maximum at 50 sludge water and then declined with increasing sludge water concentration fig 1b 3 4 nutrient uptake by brachiaria and lucerne the interaction effects of soil type and sludge water concentration were not significant on brachiaria n uptake but significant interaction was observed in lucerne brachiaria uptake of n was not affected by soil type but increased with increasing sludge water concentration with 75 and 100 significantly higher than the control fig 2 a lucerne had higher n uptake in the clay than the sandy loam soil only for the 0 and 25 sludge water fig 2b uptake of p k and ca was significantly affected by interaction of soil type and sludge water concentration phosphorus uptake significantly increased with sludge water concentration in the clay soil but not in the sand for both crops and the differences between the soils were only significant for the 50 75 and 100 sludge water fig 2c and d uptake of k and ca followed similar trends to that of dry matter yield with higher uptake in the clay soil in brachiaria ca and k uptake at 50 75 and 100 sludge water were significantly higher than the control in both soils fig 3 a and b while in lucerne this occurred in the sandy loam soil only fig 4 a and b uptake of cu fe mn and zn was significantly affected by the interaction of soil type and sludge water concentration p 0 05 in both brachiaria and lucerne with higher amounts in the clay soil than the sandy loam soil for each water concentration brachiaria uptake of cu significantly increased with increase in sludge water concentration in the clay soil but not in sandy loam table 4 however for lucerne the 50 and 75 treatments in the clay soil as well as 50 and 100 treatments in the sandy loam soil significantly increased cu uptake uptake of fe by both crops was not significantly affected by sludge water concentration in the sandy loam soil however in the clay soil the 50 75 and 100 sludge water concentration had significantly higher fe uptake than the control for both crops brachiaria uptake of mn from the clay soil was significantly higher in the 50 75 and 100 sludge water treatments while lucerne mn uptake in the same soil with all sludge water concentrations was significantly higher than the control brachiaria mn uptake in the sandy loam was significantly higher than the control only at 100 sludge water while lucerne uptake in the same soil was not affected by sludge water concentration brachiaria uptake of b was not significantly affected by soil type but increased with increasing sludge water concentration with 75 and 100 treatments having significantly higher uptake than the control in both soils table 4 lucerne b uptake was significantly affected by both soil type and sludge water concentration with 50 75 and 100 treatments having significantly higher uptake than the control in the sandy loam soil however in the clay soil only the 75 treatment resulted in significantly higher b uptake than the control table 5 3 5 concentrations of trace elements in brachiaria and lucerne tissue there was a significant interaction between sludge water concentration and soil type for tissue mn and cu concentration in both crops brachiaria tissue mn was similar in all the treatments except for the 100 sludge water in the sandy loam soil which had significantly higher concentrations than the control table 6 lucerne tissue mn concentration in the clay soil was higher than in the control in all treatments but no significant differences were found between sludge water treatments in the sandy loam soil table 6 tissue cu of brachiaria in the control 0 sludge water was higher in the clay and lower in the sandy loam than the sludge water treatments with higher concentrations in the sandy loam than the clay soil table 6 for lucerne tissue cu declined with increase in sludge water concentration in the sandy loam and was not affected by sludge water in the clay there were no significant differences in brachiaria tissue zn in both soils and across sludge water concentrations except for the 100 sludge water which had higher concentration than the control in the sandy loam soil table 6 tissue zn in lucerne was higher for the clay than sandy loam soil but was not affected by sludge water concentration tissue concentrations of al and fe in both crops were not significantly affected by sludge water concentration with higher concentrations in the sandy loam than in the clay soil table 7 lucerne tissue fe was higher while al and cu were lower in the clay soil than the sandy loam soil table 7 tissue b was not affected by either soil type or sludge water concentration in both crops 3 6 effect of irrigation of brachiaria and lucerne with sludge water on soil characteristics irrigation of brachiaria with different sludge water concentrations significantly increased soil ph in both soils but with a greater ph change in the sandy loam soil than the clay soil table 8 irrigation of lucerne increased soil ph in the sandy loam soil with the 75 and 100 treatments having significantly higher ph than the control table 9 extractable p was not affected by sludge water concentration in both soils and for both crops in the clay soil extractable cu was significantly higher than the control in the 100 sludge water treatment for both crops however in the sandy loam only the 75 sludge water treatment had available soil cu significantly different from the control for brachiaria and the 100 sludge water treatment for lucerne available mn was not affected by sludge water concentration in the clay soil but was significantly higher at 100 sludge water concentration than the control in the sandy loam for both crops with lucerne available zn decreased with increasing sludge water concentration in the sandy loam but not in the clay soil 4 discussion dry matter yield of lucerne and brachiaria increased with increase in sludge water concentration due to increased uptake of macronutrients and micronutrients which supported plant growth increased uptake of n p ca k mn and zn by brachiaria with increasing sludge water concentration may explain the increased dry matter a number of studies have obtained similar results with sludge solid phase from the sludge water bugbee and frink 1985 mahdy et al 2008 rigby et al 2013 increasing lucerne dry matter yield with increasing sludge water concentration was expected because the sludge water contained high b levels and lucerne is known to respond with increased dry matter yield on addition of b sherrell 1983 turan et al 2009 this view was supported by the b uptake results for lucerne the trend in lucerne dry matter in the clay soil was nonlinear and increased from 0 to 50 sludge water and decreased thereafter a trend similar to that observed in n k and ca uptake at 75 and 100 sludge water concentration lucerne uptake of potentially toxic elements may have increased to levels high enough to affect plant growth this could be explained by higher tissue mn in the clay soil treated with sludge water than the control although there were no significant differences among the different levels of sludge water increasing sludge water concentration was expected to reduce plant availability and subsequent uptake of p zn and mn due to precipitation or adsorption by the aluminium hydroxide in the sludge water makris et al 2005 hanani et al 2008 immobilisation of p is favoured at low ph less than 5 3 and high ph above 7 5 yang et al 2007 the ph values in the soils after harvest were within the range where most plant essential nutrients are readily available under these ph conditions higher concentration of sludge water increased available p in the soil resulting in greater uptake particularly in the clay the sludge water used has only 5 7 total suspended solids making the loading rates lower than dewatered sludge amendments reported in most literature bugbee and frink 1985 codling et al 2002 rigby et al 2013 lower p uptake by lucerne in the clay soil in the 75 and 100 treatments than the 50 treatment may be attributed to the reduced growth and dry matter yield the lower p uptake in the sandy loam soil for both crops may be due to the lower p concentrations in the sandy loam than the clay soil and the lower soil levels were also evident after harvest tables 8 and 9 the higher dry matter accumulation in the clay soil than the sandy soil explains the higher uptake despite the high concentration of al b fe mn and cu mostly in the solid fraction increasing sludge water concentration did not induce any toxicity or reduce yields of brachiaria in both soils this could either be because they are bound in the solid fraction and hence unavailable to the plant and or because brachiaria is known to tolerate low fertility soils grasses like brachiaria are more tolerant to excess mn than legumes hosking et al 1986 renvoize et al 1996 a similar trend was observed in lucerne grown in the sandy loam soil and may be attributed to increase in soil ph with increasing sludge water concentration that may have reduced mn availability in the sandy loam soil the neutral ph of the sludge water and that of the soils after the pot trial especially the 100 sludge water treatment table 8 suggests that most of these elements occurred in the solid phase minimising their uptake by the plants the increase in ph due to sludge water application suggests that long term application may raise the ph of the soil resulting in the immobilisation of these elements with minimal toxic effects however tissue al and fe both 1000 mg kg 1 occurred at levels higher than the maximum tolerable levels for cattle nrc 2005 in both brachiaria and lucerne although they were not affected by the sludge water concentration most of the tissue fe and al originated from the acidic soils used in the study and could be toxic to cattle irrespective of whether sludge water was used or not the increase in ph with sludge water application and its effects on tissue elemental composition including mn al and fe need to be monitored if sludge water is used for irrigation of pastures lucerne grown in the clay soil and irrigated with 100 sludge water showed signs of mn toxicity and this may have been responsible for the reduced yield because lucerne is highly sensitive to excess mn reichman 2002 these symptoms were not observed in lucerne grown on the sandy loam soil probably because mn was in an unavailable form though mn availability decreases with increase in ph mn toxicity is possible at a ph not low enough for al toxicity kabata pendias and pendias 2001 the higher ph increase in the sandy loam soil which was not observed in the clay soil due to its higher buffering capacity may have reduced the availability of mn added with the sludge water for lucerne the tissue mn concentration in all the other treatments besides the control was within the range 500 1 000 mg kg 1 which can be toxic to both plants 300 mg kg 1 and animals fao 1979 smith et al 1983 sale et al 1992 the relatively lower soil exchangeable acidity after brachiaria than after lucerne confirm the view that brachiaria detoxifies al quiceno 2012 available mn and cu in the clay soil did not significantly change but increased in the sandy loam soil under brachiaria because of the addition of these from the sludge water without increased uptake by the plant this increase was not observed in the clay soil under lucerne because increasing sludge water concentrations resulted in an increase in their uptake brachiaria tissue cu concentration and uptake increased with increasing sludge water concentration resulting in reduced available cu in the soil the lower tissue cu in the sludge water treatments than the control for brachiaria in the clay was a dilution effect due to greater dry matter accumulation where biomass accumulation was limited compared to the control this effect was either not evident or followed the opposite trend as smaller plants accumulated the nutrient 5 conclusions the trends observed in brachiaria dry matter showed benefits of irrigating with sludge water even without dilution increase in sludge water concentration resulted in an increase in yield and uptake of both macronutrients and micronutrients without accumulating pollutants in the tissue to plant toxic levels in both soils in lucerne on the sandy loam soil increasing sludge water concentration resulted in increase in dry matter yield and uptake of nutrients however in the clay soil an increase in sludge water concentration resulted in a nonlinear increase in lucerne dry matter yield with the undiluted sludge water resulting in tissue mn concentration that may have been toxic to lucerne the soil ph increased with increasing sludge water application more in the sandy loam soil than in the clay soil availability of mn and cu in the sandy loam soil may be a concern at higher concentrations of sludge water aluminium and fe in brachiaria and lucerne grown in acidic soils exceed maximum tolerable levels for cattle and may lead to toxicity the long term effects of sludge water concentrations on soil properties and plant growth must be investigated experiments with grazing animals are recommended as the long term addition of the elements in the sludge water may be balanced by removal by grazing over long periods and the effects on grazing animals need investigation further studies to assess the effect of the sludge water on soil physical and biological properties are also needed conflicts of interest none funding this work was supported by the african capacity building foundation wua capacity building project grant

11386,recently groundwater contamination has increased due to incorrect use of nitrogen fertilizers so that it has caused public concern to solve the problem the most appropriate approach is to manage on time and correct application of water and fertilizer the objective of this study was to provide an optimization program of drip irrigation and fertigation to maximize the nutrients uptake by plants and minimize water and solute losses in field by optimizing the design and management parameters of drip fertigation in this research the hydrus 2d 3d model was used to simulate water and nitrogen transport in soil for this purpose the requirement data for calibration and validation of the model were collected by carrying out corn field experiments and performing drip irrigation and fertigation then the calibrated model was used to simulate water and nitrogen behavior in soil and optimization process to optimize the design and management parameters of fertigation a two stage optimization program was considered in the first stage the amount of irrigation flow rate duration of fertilizer injection and the start time of the injection were simultaneously optimized with the aim of minimizing nitrate leaching in a fertigation cycle the results showed that by selecting the irrigation rate of 0 8 l h 1 and minimum duration of fertigation at the end of irrigation nitrate leaching was minimum in the period of fertigation in the second stage the amount of fertilizer injection at each stage of fertigation was optimized throughout the growth season using the optimum values of the previous step in fact in addition to supplying nitrogen requirement of the plant the amount of nitrate leaching and its accumulation at the end of each fertigation especially at the end of the growing season were also minimized to prevent leaching by post harvest rainfall keywords hydrus 2d 3d nitrate leaching nitrogen uptake particle swarm optimization pso simulation 1 introduction in recent years population growth and the need for producing more food have led to an increase in the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture however due to the lack of proper management in water and fertilizer consumption soil nutrient balance has been disturbed and many environmental problems have arisen nitrogen is a necessary nutrient for plants and nitrate a very mobile and leachable element is one of the most important forms of nitrogen found in soil alva et al 2008 studies have indicated that nitrate is the most common and widespread contaminant of groundwater in the world and can lead to health problems marinov and marinov 2014 best management practices that reduce the amount of water and nitrogen influx without decreasing the yield can decline the potential of nitrate pollution of groundwater shrestha et al 2010 this management should consider different soil moisture management strategies for nitrate transport and managing the application of nitrogen amount and time by considering the plant requirement for nitrogen shrestha et al 2010 inappropriate irrigation management causes water and nutrient losses from the root zone and as a result contaminates groundwater therefore optimal irrigation planning is important in improving the water and nutrient uptake efficiency alva et al 2006 overuse of fertilizers is another reason for nitrogen leaching with an increase in nitrogen application nitrate leaching rapidly increases zvomuya et al 2003 recent studies have emphasized that there is a positive correlation between the groundwater nitrate and the intensity of nitrate application in agriculture costa et al 2002 for example west bengal s villages have recorded high concentration of nitrate in their underground water because of using high levels of nitrogen fertilizer kundu and mandal 2009 on the other hand split application of fertilizer can play an important role in improving fertilizer uptake by plants and reduce fertilizer leaching and environmental contaminations some studies have reported the reduction in nitrate leaching and increase in yield with nitrogen split in sandy loam soils errebhi et al 1998 waddell et al 2000 silber et al 2003 showed that high fertigation frequency causes significant increase in performance mostly in low levels of nutrient concentration which is due to the increase in nutrient absorption in addition it is necessary to apply nitrogen fertilizer at the correct time and coordinate the time of fertigation and plant requirement zebarth and rosen 2007 it can be concluded that proper management of all effective factors in the water and solute transport in the soil is important to increase the efficiency of fertilizer usage and reduce its losses several researchers around the world have recognized the importance of this issue and various studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of various fertigation strategies on the movement and distribution of nitrogen in the soil some of these studies have been carried out in a short run and often in one irrigation cycle li et al 2003 2004 some other long term and seasonal studies have examined the impact of various fertigation strategies on the distribution of nitrate in the soil including different levels of water and fertilizer irrigation and fertigation intervals and injection times and concentration hou et al 2009 kumar et al 2016 rajput and patel 2006 in investigating the impact of different fertigation intervals daily alternate weekly and monthly on nitrate movement in the soil showed that a large amount of nitrate was leached in monthly fertigation in another study the nitrate leaching in the corn farm was investigated by gheysari et al 2009 in different rates of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization levels farneselli et al 2015 showed that the high frequency of fertigation and or irrigation could be a strategy to increase the nitrogen uptake efficiency in tomato fed with very high n and water supply which often exists in tomato production in recent decades many models have been developed for simulating water flow and solute transfer in soil these models are able to study different strategies by calibrating the simulation model rather than conducting various time consuming and costly field experiments simulation models are now recognized as an important tool for optimized planning of agricultural systems and have a significant and increasing role in modern methods of water resources conservation and sustainable agricultural production šimůnek and bradford 2008 one of the most advanced and widely used software packages is hydrus 1d and hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2011 which has the ability to simulate water and solute transport in soil by determining root distribution and water and nutrient uptake by the plant this model has been used to simulate the application of fertigation and the process of nitrogen species transport and different fertigation strategies in different researches some of the researches include short term simulations in the laboratory without the plants li et al 2005 zeng et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 despite the importance of these researches in the early understanding of water and solute movement in the soil new studies have also been carried out in investigating different fertigation strategies with the plant due to the effect of the plant on the absorption of solutes and its movement in soil phogat et al 2013 2014 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 gardenas et al 2005 investigated the effect of fertigation strategy and soil type on nitrate leaching potential for four different micro irrigation systems each associated with a typical crop and showed that fertigation at the end of irrigation cycle decreased nitrate leaching hanson et al 2006 following the previous work of gardenas et al 2005 modeled the distribution of soil nitrogen and nitrate leaching by considering various nutrient injection durations injection times and concentrations ajdary et al 2007 showed that nitrogen leaching can be minimized in shallow root crops by appropriate selection of emitter discharge irrigation duration and its frequency also in order to supply sugarcane requirement for nitrogen the amounts of nitrogen fertilizer application were scheduled by ravikumar et al 2011 using trial and error method and simulation in hydrus ramos et al 2012 in modeling water and nitrogen transport using hydrus 2d indicated that nitrogen movement outside the root zone depends on the amount of water flow and applied nitrogen nitrogen form in fertilizer its application time and number of fertigation events according to the results of their study high nitrate uptake occurred when the number of fertigation events was higher and the used amount was lower in each event in another study karandish and šimůnek 2017 evaluated the effects of different strategies including 11 irrigation levels and 8 nitrogen fertilization rates in two partial root zone drying and deficit irrigation scenarios on the water and nitrogen movement and the yield of corn in the researches discussed above fertigation strategies were compared in some limited scenarios in one irrigation event or in growth season using the experiment or a simulation model and the best scenario was selected despite the use of simulation models in determining the best fertigation strategies optimization methods along with simulation models can be useful tools in optimal managing of irrigation and fertigation in fact using an optimization algorithm a wide range of several design and management parameters can be simultaneously investigated and the best combination of parameters can be selected in the use of optimization tools along with simulation models for proper fertigation planning only a few studies in surface irrigation have been conducted to optimize the design and management parameters of furrow irrigation in an irrigation event ebrahimian et al 2013 and ebrahimian and playán 2014 designed an alternative and conventional furrow fertigation to optimally reduce nitrate losses they used the genetic algorithm and included inflow discharge irrigation cutoff and start times and duration of fertilizer injection as optimizing decision variables to maximize the two objective functions of water and nitrate application efficiency plus uniformity due to the high nitrate leaching potential inappropriate scheduling of fertilizer application not only causes its losses during the growing season but its accumulation at the end of the growing season in the soil profile has the potential for leaching and groundwater contamination by autumn rainfall after crop harvesting therefore optimization of the fertigation parameters based on the decreasing nitrate leaching in one event is not sufficient and proper application of fertigation during the growing season should be simultaneously considered optimum application of nutrients in the crop root zone ensures their optimum utilization higher crop yield and lesser nutrients losses thus optimization of fertigation has an important role in implementation of micro irrigation systems to gain better quality and quantity of agricultural productions without degradation of soil and groundwater the main objective of this study is to present a process to optimize the design and management parameters of drip fertigation so that the goals of this optimization include supplying corn requirement to nitrogen reducing the contaminant of nitrate leaching in the fertigation process and avoiding nitrogen accumulation in the soil at the end of growth season in fact using the results of this research a comprehensive plan for fertigation design and management and in different conditions of soil plant climate and irrigation system can be presented and applied 2 materials and methods 2 1 field study in the present research field experiments were conducted in the study area of urmia university 37 39 n 44 58 e and 1362 m above the sea level urmia university was located in urmia plain the coldest month in this plain is january with normal minimum temperature of 15 1 c and the warmest month is july with normal maximum temperature of 35 5 c the normal annual precipitation is 340 mm the data for calibration and validation phases was collected for modeling process for this purpose corn maxima variety was planted on june 24 2016 in a rectangular farm with dimensions of 20 m 30 m planting rows distance and plants space in a row were 75 and 30 cm respectively to achieve the soil physical properties soil samples were obtained from 5 layers up to a depth of 90 cm 0 10 10 30 30 50 50 70 and 70 90 cm in three repetition table 1 for this purpose undisturbed soil samples were collected from different layers to measure soil bulk density astm 2009 and water retention curve using the pressure plate apparatus on the other hand disturbed soil samples were collected from different mentioned soil layers for measuring soil texture also guelph permeameter method reynolds and elrick 1985 1986 1987 was used to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity of surface layer of the soil 0 30 cm based on soil analysis and agricultural research center recommendations for local farmers 160 kg ha 1 triple superphosphate was added to the soil in land preparing process and 334 kg ha 1 ammonium nitrate was utilized with irrigation water during the growth season surface drip tape irrigation system with emitter discharge of 4 5 l h 1 and distance of 30 cm was selected before corn planting emitter flow rates were measured using catch cans at intervals of 90 cm christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1941 was calculated to assure the uniformity of drippers discharge the high uniformity coefficient about 97 was obtained for tested emitters the irrigation was conducted twice in a week by irrigation frequency of 4 and 3 days started on june 25 2016 for 14 weeks ammonium nitrate fertigation was carried out weekly in the first irrigation of the week this process was continued up to 10 weeks the fertilizer was given to the land in 10 equal splits for 10 min at the end of irrigation after fertigation the irrigation process was continued to avoid emitter clogging regular soil sampling was done 5 times in each week before the first irrigation 1 4 days after the first irrigation of each week to measure soil water content swc and soil nh4 n and no3 n concentration variations during the growth season in fact the fifth sampling was conducted before the second irrigation of each week this process was repeated for 14 weeks soil specimens were collected using an auger from 20 40 and 60 cm depths and with radial distance of 15 cm from dripper and plant fig 1 the moisture of the specimens was measured using the gravimetric method astm 2010 also the concentration of nh4 n and no3 n in specimens was determined by the kjeldhal method bremner and edwards 1965 bremner and keeney 1965 1966 in this method soil sample was shaken with 2 m kcl 1 5 soil solution ratio for 1 h and the obtained extract was analyzed using automatic steam distillation in the steam distillation method magnesium oxide was used for distillation of ammonium devarda alloy was utilized for reduction of nitrate and nitrite to ammonium and sulfamic acid was employed for destruction of nitrite the distillate was collected in saturated h3bo3 indicator solution and titrated to ph 5 0 with standardized 0 005 n h2so4 using digital burette and ph meter the crops were harvested on october 14 2016 after 16 weeks before harvesting last samples were gathered at three depths of soil so the number of samples were 213 during the experiments in the growth period weeds control was continuously conducted in order to avoid the nitrogen uptake by other plants 2 2 hydrus simulation model 2 2 1 governing equations in this study hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2011 was used to simulate water and solute transport in soil based on finite element numerical solutions of the water and solute transport equations this model has the capability to simulate two or three dimensional axially symmetric water flow and solute movement in soil with water and nutrient uptake by roots this model numerically solves the richards 1931 equation for variably saturated water movement in the soil and convection dispersion equation for solute transport also plant s roots uptake in the richards equation can be calculated using the macroscopic approach presented by feddes et al 1978 readers can refer to šimůnek et al šimůnek et al 2011 šimůnek and bradford 2008 and šimůnek and hopmans 2009 for more information in the richards equation determination of relationships between the soil hydraulic variables i e moisture pressure head and hydraulic conductivity is necessary there are different options in the hydrus to express the mentioned relationships such as van genuchten mualem function van genuchten 1980 in order to solve the richards equation in hydrus model soil hydraulic parameters of this function θr θs α n ks and l must be determined and presented to the model the process of calibrating the mentioned parameters in the hydrus model has been extensively discussed in section 2 2 3 for annual vegetation a root growth model is required to simulate the change in rooting depth with time recently a new computational module in hydrus 2d 3d hartmann et al 2018 is provided in which the user can consider time variable rooting depth values in a table or the program calculates the time variable rooting depth assuming that the actual root depth lr t is the product of the maximum rooting depth lm l and a root growth coefficient fr t šimůnek and suarez 1993 1 l r t

value of the rooting depth at the beginning of the growing season l and r is the growth rate t 1 the growth rate r is calculated either from the assumption that 50 of the rooting depth will be reached after 50 of the growing season has elapsed or from given data of root depth at a specified time when variable rooting depth is considered the spatial distribution of roots must be described using either the vrugt vrugt et al 2001a 2001b or hoffman and van genuchten hoffman and van genuchten 1983 functions in this research the roots spatial distribution of vrugt function was used in relation to the parameters of this function our observations indicated that the maximum rooting depth in vertical direction and maximum rooting length in horizontal direction were approximately 60 and 35 cm respectively also many researches have showed that most of the maize root was distributed in 0 60 cm layer of the soil gheysari et al 2009 wang et al 2014 based on the study of wang et al 2014 the parameters for defining the maximum intensity of roots in vertical and horizontal directions z and x were taken 10 and 0 cm respectively and the px and pz both were set to 1 0 in this research the mentioned new module was employed to describe horizontal and vertical root growth for this purpose following parameters were employed to describe the root dynamic growth initial time of the root

respectively μ w and or μ s constants should be considered in the eq 3 as solutes losses from liquid and or solid phases in processes such as denitrification no3 transformation into n2 and n2o volatilization nh4 transformation into nh3 and immobilization conversion of inorganic compounds to organic compounds by micro organisms or plants however γ w and γ s constants are added to the equation when solute enter into the soil such as mineralization of crop residues or other organic wastes and soil humus fraction under anaerobic conditions since the soil is almost in saturated condition nitrate can be denitrified into nitrous oxide in the denitrification processes however in drip irrigation the process of denitrification can be neglected ravikumar et al 2011 furthermore the research farm had not been cultivated for several years and any fertilizer had not been added to the land in addition nitrification of ammonium to nitrate and also nitrate leaching from the soil profile as a result of rainfall in the autumn and spring occurred consequently the organic matter content 0 8 total nitrogen content nh4 n and no3 n concentration in the soil were low therefore mineralization and immobilization were ignored in this research similar to many other studies ajdary et al 2007 hanson et al 2006 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 in addition ammonia volatilization was ignored due to application of the fertilizer with irrigation water nitrogen transport and transformation and also considering differentiation between passive and active nutrient uptake by the roots are very complex therefore in order to avoid facing these complications in which the relative magnitude and relevance are yet to be determined this study assumes that root uptake of ammonium and nitrate is intensively passive and also the mentioned mechanisms are not occurring as mentioned assumptions were done in many other studies listed above since unlimited passive nutrient uptake was considered for nitrogen species the maximum concentration of water removed from the flow region by root water uptake cmax was set to a concentration value larger than the dissolved simulated concentrations c this process allows all dissolved nutrients to be taken up by plant roots such analysis was done by ramos et al 2012 for nitrogen species uptake by sorghum on the other hand μ s and μ w constants are considered when solutes transform to other forms of solutes since the used fertilizer in this research is ammonium nitrate the nitrification nh4 n transformation into n no2 and then further into no3 n was considered as the main process therefore μ s and μ w constants must be applied in the equation to consider the transformation of nh4 n to no3 n due to adsorption of ammonium by soil particles ammonium nh4 n adsorption to the solid phase was considered according to linear adsorption isotherm and distribution coefficient kd kd is zero in the nitrate no3 n form of nitrogen in the solute transport equation of hydrus the components of the dispersion tensor d are given by bear 1972 in which it is necessary to determine longitudinal and transversal dispersivities of soil εl and εt with molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute in free water it is noted that molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute in free water is negligible however dispersion coefficient of soil is considerable for this reason in this research molecular diffusion coefficient of the nh4 n and no3 n in free water were considered to be 0 064 and 0 068 cm2 h 1 respectively based on the values reported in the literature cote et al 2003 nakamura et al 2004 however εl and εt in addition to μ w μ s and kd were calibrated in the hydrus model calibration method has been extensively presented in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 transport domain boundary and initial conditions in the present research the two dimensional transport domain was defined as a rectangular with width and depth of 37 5 and 120 cm respectively and 2d vertical plane fig 1 a non uniform finite element mesh fem with a high nodal density was considered in the vicinity of the dripper and the low density of nodes far from the dripper was defined in the hydrus initial conditions of swc nh4 n and no3 n concentration were measured and obtained results were entered in the model also a uniform value throughout the soil profile was assumed at the left side of the soil surface where water and solutions were entering to the soil variable flux boundary condition was selected fig 1 in this research a constant width of saturation zone was considered on the basis of field observations during each irrigation wang et al 2014 the constant flux q in the mentioned boundary was defined as 4 q q a q 2 w l where q is the flow rate of an individual emitter 4 5 l h 1 l is the emitter spacing along the dripline 30 cm and w is the width of saturation zone in variable flux boundary 20 cm a free drainage boundary condition was assumed at the bottom of the soil profile a third type cauchy boundary condition was used along flux width at the top boundary to describe the concentration flux no flux boundary condition of water and nitrate was applied to residual boundary of the soil profile when there was no irrigation evaporation occurred from the wet soil surface therefore the evaporation rates were considered in the model as atmospheric boundary condition furthermore a special hydrus 2d option was used that allows the time variable flux boundary condition to be treated as the atmosphere boundary condition in this study in order to determine the potential evaporation from soil surface and potential transpiration via plant as inputs for the hydrus at first eto the reference crop evapotranspiration and etp the potential crop evapotranspiration were calculated using fao penman monteith equation and the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 used parameters in dual crop coefficient method are presented in table 2 although the dual crop coefficient approach computes separately plant transpiration and soil evaporation based on this method a constant value is considered for the transpiration coefficient from planting date to approximately 10 ground cover kcb ini however the amount of transpiration gradually increases and this factor can cause an error in calculating the amount of transpiration therefore ritchie 1972 equation eqs 5 6 was used to separate potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp based on leaf area index kemp et al 1997 vrugt et al 2001a young et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 phogat et al 2010 li et al 2014 in fact plant transpiration changes are considered in this approach from planting date according to leaf area index fig 2 it is noted that after initial stage of plant growth the obtained values by fao and ritchie methods is very close to each other 5 e p e t p exp β l a i 6 t p e t p e p where β is the fixed light extinction coefficient and lai is the leaf area index l2l 2 the value of β which indicates radiation extinction by the crop canopy varies with the sun angle distribution of plants and the arrangement of crop leaves kemp et al 1997 for maize crop this coefficient is equal to 0 65 according to allen et al 1964 in the present research leaf area index was calculated using weekly measurements of leaf area these mesurments were conducted in three iterations the mentioned leaf area was determined by taking photographs of leaves and then processing with the digimizer image analysis software program gustafsson et al 2016 keramatlou et al 2015 ma et al 2016 to calculate evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement a portable meteorological instrument was used in the vicinity of the research field for measuring meteorological parameters including temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation the potential crop evapotranspiration was employed to determine water requirement depth and duration of irrigation in each irrigation event it is noted that the potential evapotranspiration was specified using the dual crop coefficient approach in the former period of each irrigation because of the very low rainfall values in the growth season 2 7 mm and its insignificant effect on the moisture content of the soil its amount was not considered in the hydrus 2 2 3 calibration and validation of the model parameters in this study inverse solution option in the hydrus model was not used to calibrate the parameters because this option does not have the capability to run with the new module of root growth simulation therefore particle swarm optimization pso method eberhart and kennedy 1995 kennedy and eberhart 1995 was employed to calibrate van genuchten mualem and solute transport equations parameters the optimization program with the mentioned module was run in the matlab program the flowchart of different stages of the optimization program was followed fig 3 the objective function for this program was considered as follows 7 m i n i m i z e o f b i 1 n q x z t i q x z t i b 2 where q x z t i and q x z t i b refer to the measured and predicted variable respectively at location of x z and time ti b is unknown vector soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters and n is number of measurements at first the program of the mentioned function was run to optimize soil hydraulic parameters θr θs α n and ks for the objective of minimizing the difference between measured and simulated soil moisture in different depths and times q θ in eq 7 initial estimation of soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by fitting retention curve data in retc table 1 and neural network prediction of pedotransfer function in rosetta software schaap et al 2001 and the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil layer using optimized soil hydraulic parameters in hydrus model eq 7 was run to achieve optimized solute transport parameters εl kd μ s and μ w with the objective of minimizing the difference between measured and simulated nh4 n and no3 n concentration of the soil in different depths and times q c in eq 7 initial estimations of mentioned solute transport parameters were selected according to previous studies ajdary et al 2007 doltra and munoz 2010 gardenas et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 hu et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 since after calibration no significant differences were observed between soil hydraulic properties and solute transport parameters of two soil layers of the study only one soil layer was defined in the hydrus model in this study 80 of the data was used for calibration stage and 20 of data was employed for validation to evaluate the model performance in simulating soil water content and solute transport the root mean square error rmse mean error me index of agreement d and nash sutcliffe efficiency e nash and sutcliffe 1970 were computed the index of agreement represents the degree of accuracy in estimation of observations khodaverdiloo et al 2011 in fact the d statistics was used to overcome certain problems of the commonly used coefficient of determination r2 the d statistics is indicator of model error free but r2 is a measure of correlation or association khodaverdiloo et al 2011 similar to r2 the nash sutcliffe is not very sensitive to systematic model over underprediction and the index of agreement was proposed to overcome the insensitivity of e and r2 to differences in the predicted and observed means and variances krause et al 2005 the mathematical equations of the mentioned statistics are as follows 8 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 9 m e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 10 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 11 e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated values and n is the number of measurements the rmse measures estimations of absolute errors whereas the me shows the overestimation or underestimation of the model the obtained values from the rmse and me close to zero indicate the better performance of the model the range of e is between 1 0 perfect fit and if the predictions of a model are unbiased the e statistic will be in the interval from 0 to 1 mccuen et al 2006 the range of d lies between 0 and 1 2 3 optimization of fertigation management and design parameters the main objective of the present research is to use the hydrus calibrated model for optimizing design and management parameters of irrigation and fertigation the importance of the mentioned optimization is to reduce environmental pollution due to nitrate leaching in order to optimize design and management parameters of fertigation both nitrate leaching during the growing season and its accumulation at the end of the growing season in the soil profile should be prevented because nitrate accumulation has the capacity to leach and transfer to groundwater aquifers due to autumn precipitation after crop harvesting therefore in this study firstly irrigation flow rate duration of the fertilizer injection and the start time of fertigation was optimized for minimizing nitrate leaching in a fertigation cycle after determining the best combination of decision variables of this stage the fertilizer application amount was optimized in each stage of fertigation in the growth season based on the plant s requirement for nitrogen at different stages of growth accordingly besides supplying plant s nitrogen requirements nitrate accumulation was minimized in the end of each fertigation and especially growth season it is noted that in the second stage of optimization the values of optimized design and management parameters of the former stage were considered as injection program however duration of the fertilizer injection in each fertigation stage was selected based on the optimized injection duration of the first stage and the allowed minimum duration of injection to prevent irrigation water salinity eciw 3 ds m 1 nakayama and bucks 1986 in this process the amount of eciw in different fertilizer values was computed using the optimization program code when the amount of eciw at the optimized injection duration was more than 3 ds m 1 the duration of the injection was increased by the program this criterion was added to the constraints of the optimization model table 3 the irrigation and fertigation were conducted twice and once in a week respectively in the first optimization stage the optimization was carried out for a duration of one week with two irrigation events so that the fertigation was conducted in the first irrigation of the mentioned optimization stage in fact the effect of the next irrigation without fertigation was considered on nitrate leaching the second optimization program was exerted for the growth season period with similar irrigation and fertigation scheduling of the first optimization program i e for each week an irrigation with fertigation and the other without fertigation the flowchart of fig 3 is valid for these stages but decision variables and the objective function are different 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the hydrus in this research pso optimization algorithm was used to calibrate water and solutes transport parameters of the model table 4 similar values of soil hydraulic parameters were reported by ajdary et al 2007 for a similar soil texture wide range values of the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient of solute transport in the soil has been reported in different researches 0 3 5 20 12 2 and 25 8 5 and 20 cm by ajdary et al 2007 hanson et al 2006 phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 respectively also in the mentioned researches transversal dispersivity coefficient of solute transport in the soil was taken equal to one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient the mentioned procedure was considered in the optimization program of the present research in this research the distribution coefficient and the rate coefficient for nitrification of ammonium to nitrate were located in the reported range by hanson et al 2006 i e 3 4 cm3 g 1 and 0 02 0 72 day 1 respectively in fact in this study the initial estimations of the distribution coefficient and the rate coefficient for nitrification of ammonium to nitrate were considered 3 5 cm3 g 1 and 0 2 day 1 respectively these values are similar to values in the research conducted by phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 and ravikumar et al 2011 the rmse values of the model in the simulation process of swc varied in the range of 0 011 0 024 cm3 cm 3 for different depths of soil in two calibration and validation phases table 5 ajdary et al 2007 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 and ramos et al 2012 reported that the rmse value in their soil water content simulation varied in the range of 0 017 0 015 0 045 0 011 and 0 033 0 028 cm3 cm 3 respectively the low values of me show good performance of the model table 5 the values of the d index have stayed in the range of 0 721 0 796 dimensionless in two calibration and verification phases at different depths of the soil also the nash sutcliffe efficiencies e with an average of 0 48 dimensionless were in the acceptable range of 0 1 at different depths of the soil it can be concluded that the error of simulation is low enough and therefore the performance of the model is acceptable the results of the model in the simulation of swc in the validation data showed that soil water content was increased by irrigation and then it was decreased due to the evaporation root water uptake deep percolation and drainage fig 4 the rmse values of the model in the simulation of nitrate concentration in the soil is less than 0 020 mg cm 3soil table 5 ramos et al 2012 reported that the rmse value in the simulation of nitrate concentration in soil was 3 078 mmol l 1 also karandish and šimůnek 2017 and wang et al 2014 stated that the rmse value in simulating nitrate concentration in their studied soil varied 0 39 10 9 mg l 1 and 2 6 8 9 mg kg 1 similar to swc the nash sutcliffe efficiencies e have been placed in the acceptable range of 0 1 with an average of 0 40 dimensionless at different depths of the soil table 5 furthermore the value of the d index is in the range of 0 826 0 945 dimensionless at different depths of the soil in two studied phases the validation results of the model in the simulation of the nitrate changes represent good agreement between measured and simulated solute concentration fig 5 it is necessary to explain that the amounts of ammonium measured in the three depths of the soil were negligible furthermore because of ammonium adsorption by the soil particles and its subsequent fast nitrification to nitrate simulated values of nh4 n in three depths of the soil were zero therefore its results were not shown according to simulation results with injecting the fertilizer the concentration of ammonium was high just at the injection spot low concentration of the nh4 n in different soil layers showed that ammonium adsorption by the soil particles and its transformation to nitrate occurred in the vicinity of the injection site therefore injected ammonium did not reach to the depth of 20 cm the trend of soil nitrate variation shows increasing trend after each fertigation event especially in surface layer of soil however after the leaching effects and uptaking by the plant the nitrate concentration decreased to the next fertigation the trend of soil nitrate variation is relatively constant in the 20 cm depth because of gradual transformation of ammonium to nitrate in the surface layer of soil in fact generated nitrate can be leached by the next irrigation the model error in simulating water and solute transport is greater in surface layer than deeper layers table 5 since the variation of soil moisture and solute concentration in deeper layers was less than in the upper layer the model error was low the differences between simulated and measured values can be due to field measurement errors and the errors related to model structure and inputs it can be concluded that the model has the capability to simulate water and solute transport in soil therefore the calibrated model was used to simulate and optimize the fertigation process other studies emphasize the appropriate performance of the hydrus model in different conditions of irrigation and plants hanson et al 2006 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 karandish and šimůnek 2017 ramos et al 2012 3 2 water and nitrogen balance in soil and leaching and deep percolation losses the calibrated hydrus model was employed to simulate water and solute transport in soil investigation of the nitrate distribution in the soil profile in different times during the growth season indicated that in the early weeks of the growth season since irrigation depth is low and its duration is short moisture advance front is short fig 6 this process can cause a shorter nitrate advance front however by increasing plant water requirement irrigation depth and its duration were increased and the nitrate could advance to the deeper layers with irrigation water the nitrate concentration in the root zone is considerably high before the 4th fertigation fig 6 b however its concentration is low before the 8th fertigation the reason of this issue can be explained by considering the equal amount of fertilizer splits in this research in fact in the early weeks of the growth season nitrate uptake by the roots was low because of the shorter roots and low water requirement therefore in the mentioned period the concentration of the nitrate was considerable in the root zone however in the last fertigations due to the higher nitrate uptake by the plant and higher amounts of irrigation and leaching less nitrate was observed in the soil surface before fertigation nitrate continuously moved downward until the end of the growth season the nitrate was not adsorbed and the denitrification was assumed negligible high nitrate concentration occurred near the dripper after fertigation due to nitrate injection and nitrification process then the nitrate concentration in the mentioned locations decreased because of plant uptake and dispersion process investigating the soil nitrate distribution in the harvest time fig 6 f indicated that a component of the nitrate was leached below the root zone during the growing season and accumulated in the soil profile at the end of the growing season the comparison of the nitrogen fertilizer requirement of corn during its different life stages on the basis of abendroth et al 2011 and okeeffe 2009 and the absorbed fertilizer by the roots indicated that nitrogen uptake in different stages of growth does not match with the plant requirement fig 7 fertilizer application scheduling in this research was based on the local recommendation 334 kg ha 1 in 10 equal splits simulated components of soil water balance in growth season showed that 26 38 and 63 45 percent of the irrigated water was specified to evaporation from soil surface and plant uptake respectively table 6 the potential transpiration was 324 mm in the growth season period so that about 87 of the potential transpiration was consumed by the plant on the basis of water accessibility in the soil and moisture stress condition also the results showed that the irrigation water cause an increase in soil moisture of about 0 5 percent during the simulation period and about 9 65 of irrigated water was deep percolation losses water balance components values were considered for the upper 65 cm or root zone by the model and the deep percolation amounts were calculated for below the root zone 65 cm low value of deep percolation relates to relatively heavy soil texture of the field in fact high uptake of the moisture by the plant can relate to soil texture which has low hydraulic conductivity this low hydraulic conductivity causes the irrigated water to remain in the root zone region ajdary et al 2007 reported low deep percolation in less permeable soils and trickle irrigation method also wang et al 2014 showed low deep percolation losses about 10 in drip irrigation approach and low precipitation condition simulation of nitrogen balance components in the root zone for growth season showed that most applied nh4 n fastly nitrified to no3 n about 99 and its uptake by the plant was very low table 7 furthermore there was no leaching of nh4 n from the root zone simulated distribution of nh4 n in the soil in different times of the growth season data not shown indicated that the ammonium remained in the vicinity of the dripper there was only slight movement of nh4 n because of soil adsorption and subsequent fast nitrification and roots uptake despite existing fertigation in each week total injected ammonium was transformed to nitrate until end of the week the reason of less uptake of ammonium by corn can be explained by paying attention to this point ramos et al 2012 showed non leachability of the ammonium to the deeper depths and lesser uptake by the plant simulation of nitrate balance components in the soil showed that 73 5 of total nitrate initial content in the soil nitrate injection and nitrification process was absorbed by the plant and 7 1 leached table 7 some studies have indicated more leaching of nitrate than ammonium and its relatively high uptake by the plant hanson et al 2006 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 reported 16 of nitrate leaching in dry condition of precipitation in drip irrigation the reason of low nitrate leaching in the present research compared to other studies can be related to the relatively heavy texture of the soil and its low deep percolation percentage therefore because of high concentration of nitrate in the root zone its uptake by plants in the present study was more than other similar studies furthermore the low leaching and high uptake of nitrate in our study can be explained by giving attention to the suitable amount and time of fertigation and number of its splits the research of farneselli et al 2015 showed that the high frequency of fertigation and or irrigation could be a strategy to increase the nitrogen uptake efficiency also ramos et al 2012 indicated that leaching of nitrate increased by decreasing the number of fertilizer splits in this research the accumulation of the nitrate in the root zone was considerable 19 4 as a result by considering the leaching and remained nitrate in the end of growth season the nitrate not taken up by plants was about 26 5 high concentrations of the nitrate in the root zone has the potential for leaching the remained nitrate during the autumn precipitation after crop harvesting especially in the regions with shallow groundwater level wang et al 2014 emphasized in their research that a considerable precipitation at the end of the season causes more drainage compared to even distribution of precipitation during the growth season therefore it is necessary to manage and control the nitrate leaching and its accumulation during the growth season 3 3 optimization results of fertigation design and management in this section of the research nitrate leaching and nitrogen uptake were investigated in two different fertilizer application scenarios in the calibrated model scenario 1 is fertilizer application in three splits which is implemented by local farmers i e 50 25 and 25 of n fertilizer application at the beginning of the growing season knee stage and tasselling stage respectively furthermore attentions have recently been paid to high fertilizer application frequency as a strategy to increase n uptake efficiency and crop yield farneselli et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 therefore in scenario 2 nitrate leaching and nitrogen uptake were investigated in weekly application of the fertilizer in the growth season fertilizer doses calculated in each fertigation event for two scenarios are shown in table 8 investigating the nitrogen fertilizer requirement of the plant and its uptake fig 8 a shows that in scenario 1 due to injection of high amount of fertilizer in each split and low nitrate leaching nitrate is often available in the root zone and its uptake is higher than the plant requirement in this scenario absorbed fertilizer is about 245 kg ha 1 and its leaching and accumulation at the end of the growing season are 29 95 and 64 25 kg ha 1 respectively table 9 however with weekly splits fig 8 b up to the 7th week the crop little requirements are provided then with root growth and need for water and nitrogen uptake the corn uptake is less than the plant requirement due to the equal amount of the fertilizer in each split despite the decrease in nitrate leaching this scenario increased its accumulation in the soil profile at the end of the growing season table 9 this process may cause gradually leaching of nitrate by following precipitations at the same time it reduced nitrogen uptake to 210 kg ha 1 therefore increasing the fertigation frequency cannot always be a suitable strategy for optimum fertilizer absorbing and reducing its losses appropriate fertigation planning is necessary for simultaneous reduction of nitrate leaching and accumulation in the soil profile and at the same time supply the nitrogen demand of the plant therefore fertigation management was optimized not only in each fertigation event but also in the growth season simultaneous optimization results of three parameters including irrigation flow rate duration of the fertilizer injection and start time of injection showed that nitrate leaching was minimum by selecting irrigation flow rate equal to 0 8 l h 1 minimum duration of the fertilizer injection 5 min in this optimization program and fertilizer injection before providing the opportunity to wash the pipes and emitters in the second stage of the optimization the amount of fertilizer application in different stages of the growth season was optimized since salinity problems can occur in the high amounts of fertilizers under optimized conditions of the first stage the salinity contrainst was considered in the second stage of the optimization procces in fact the fertigation duration was adjusted by considering the criteria of eciw 3 ds m 1 increasing the fertigation duration based on mentioned criteria cause injected salts to spread in the soil profile and prevent root water uptake reduction by increasing the osmotic potential in a surface soil layer in the vicinity of roots optimized values of the fertilizer application in the second stage of optimization are presented in table 8 in optimized scheduling of fertigation nitrogen uptake by the plant in each stage of growth was matched with the plant requirement fig 8 c in fact based on the amount of nitrogen present in the soil this optimization simulation model optimizes the amount of required fertilizer to be added to the soil at different time scales so after the interactions occurring in the soil the plant can take up its required nitrogen at the appropriate times investigation of nitrogen balance components in the root zone table 9 shows that the optimum fertilizer application scheduling reduced total losses of nitrate leaching and accumulation compared to two other scenarios also it causes to reduce the use of fertilizer up to 20 kg ha 1 and supply the nitrogen requirement by corn at appropriate times marinov and marinov 2014 indicated that in order to reach high yield of crop while reducing nitrate leaching in soil it is necessary to generate a balance between applied fertilizer and the required amount of nitrogen to the plant according to the results of the present research despite the reduction of the amount of the fertilizer used in the optimized fertigation scheduling the corn yield will be optimum due to adequate and on time uptake of nitrogen 4 conclusions to achieve food security besides environmental protection programs and suitable development it is necessary to use optimal fertigation management in different irrigation systems for this purpose a simulation optimization framework can be used for developing optimal irrigation and fertigation schedules in this research calibrated hydrus model was used to simulate water and nitrogen behavior in the soil nitrate has a very high leaching potential during the plant growth season and if it is accumulated in soil it will be able to leach and transfer to groundwater aquifers due to autumn precipitation after crop growth season therefore in order to optimize fertigation scheduling not only nitrate leaching in the growth season must be considered but also its accumulation in the soil profile must be avoided in the growth season by considering this point in this study an appropriate programing was done to optimize and manage fertigation in this regard two issues were considered including the reduction of the nitrate leaching from root zone region and supplying plant requirements for nitrogen in fact by applying the optimization program besides decreasing nitrate leaching in a fertigation irrigation cycle its accumulation during the growth season was reduced at first to minimize leaching losses in a fertigation cycle the irrigation flow rate discharge the fertilizer injection time and its start time were simultaneously optimized using the calibrated hydrus model then the fertilizer application amounts in each stage of fertigation were optimized in the growth season period by the best decision parameters combination in the previous stage in this research for the first time the two dimensional root growth of the plant was dynamically simulated in an optimization program to meet real conditions in the field it is recommended that the suggested two stage optimization program is to be considered for design and management of fertigation in different conditions of climate crop and soils achieving suitable crop yield and economic situation besides controlling environmental contaminations acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge prof j šimůnek of university of california riverside because of his valuable suggestions during the study period on the issues related to simulation with hydrus 2d 3d via email also we used his guidance in dynamically simulating root growth during this research 
11386,recently groundwater contamination has increased due to incorrect use of nitrogen fertilizers so that it has caused public concern to solve the problem the most appropriate approach is to manage on time and correct application of water and fertilizer the objective of this study was to provide an optimization program of drip irrigation and fertigation to maximize the nutrients uptake by plants and minimize water and solute losses in field by optimizing the design and management parameters of drip fertigation in this research the hydrus 2d 3d model was used to simulate water and nitrogen transport in soil for this purpose the requirement data for calibration and validation of the model were collected by carrying out corn field experiments and performing drip irrigation and fertigation then the calibrated model was used to simulate water and nitrogen behavior in soil and optimization process to optimize the design and management parameters of fertigation a two stage optimization program was considered in the first stage the amount of irrigation flow rate duration of fertilizer injection and the start time of the injection were simultaneously optimized with the aim of minimizing nitrate leaching in a fertigation cycle the results showed that by selecting the irrigation rate of 0 8 l h 1 and minimum duration of fertigation at the end of irrigation nitrate leaching was minimum in the period of fertigation in the second stage the amount of fertilizer injection at each stage of fertigation was optimized throughout the growth season using the optimum values of the previous step in fact in addition to supplying nitrogen requirement of the plant the amount of nitrate leaching and its accumulation at the end of each fertigation especially at the end of the growing season were also minimized to prevent leaching by post harvest rainfall keywords hydrus 2d 3d nitrate leaching nitrogen uptake particle swarm optimization pso simulation 1 introduction in recent years population growth and the need for producing more food have led to an increase in the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture however due to the lack of proper management in water and fertilizer consumption soil nutrient balance has been disturbed and many environmental problems have arisen nitrogen is a necessary nutrient for plants and nitrate a very mobile and leachable element is one of the most important forms of nitrogen found in soil alva et al 2008 studies have indicated that nitrate is the most common and widespread contaminant of groundwater in the world and can lead to health problems marinov and marinov 2014 best management practices that reduce the amount of water and nitrogen influx without decreasing the yield can decline the potential of nitrate pollution of groundwater shrestha et al 2010 this management should consider different soil moisture management strategies for nitrate transport and managing the application of nitrogen amount and time by considering the plant requirement for nitrogen shrestha et al 2010 inappropriate irrigation management causes water and nutrient losses from the root zone and as a result contaminates groundwater therefore optimal irrigation planning is important in improving the water and nutrient uptake efficiency alva et al 2006 overuse of fertilizers is another reason for nitrogen leaching with an increase in nitrogen application nitrate leaching rapidly increases zvomuya et al 2003 recent studies have emphasized that there is a positive correlation between the groundwater nitrate and the intensity of nitrate application in agriculture costa et al 2002 for example west bengal s villages have recorded high concentration of nitrate in their underground water because of using high levels of nitrogen fertilizer kundu and mandal 2009 on the other hand split application of fertilizer can play an important role in improving fertilizer uptake by plants and reduce fertilizer leaching and environmental contaminations some studies have reported the reduction in nitrate leaching and increase in yield with nitrogen split in sandy loam soils errebhi et al 1998 waddell et al 2000 silber et al 2003 showed that high fertigation frequency causes significant increase in performance mostly in low levels of nutrient concentration which is due to the increase in nutrient absorption in addition it is necessary to apply nitrogen fertilizer at the correct time and coordinate the time of fertigation and plant requirement zebarth and rosen 2007 it can be concluded that proper management of all effective factors in the water and solute transport in the soil is important to increase the efficiency of fertilizer usage and reduce its losses several researchers around the world have recognized the importance of this issue and various studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of various fertigation strategies on the movement and distribution of nitrogen in the soil some of these studies have been carried out in a short run and often in one irrigation cycle li et al 2003 2004 some other long term and seasonal studies have examined the impact of various fertigation strategies on the distribution of nitrate in the soil including different levels of water and fertilizer irrigation and fertigation intervals and injection times and concentration hou et al 2009 kumar et al 2016 rajput and patel 2006 in investigating the impact of different fertigation intervals daily alternate weekly and monthly on nitrate movement in the soil showed that a large amount of nitrate was leached in monthly fertigation in another study the nitrate leaching in the corn farm was investigated by gheysari et al 2009 in different rates of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization levels farneselli et al 2015 showed that the high frequency of fertigation and or irrigation could be a strategy to increase the nitrogen uptake efficiency in tomato fed with very high n and water supply which often exists in tomato production in recent decades many models have been developed for simulating water flow and solute transfer in soil these models are able to study different strategies by calibrating the simulation model rather than conducting various time consuming and costly field experiments simulation models are now recognized as an important tool for optimized planning of agricultural systems and have a significant and increasing role in modern methods of water resources conservation and sustainable agricultural production šimůnek and bradford 2008 one of the most advanced and widely used software packages is hydrus 1d and hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2011 which has the ability to simulate water and solute transport in soil by determining root distribution and water and nutrient uptake by the plant this model has been used to simulate the application of fertigation and the process of nitrogen species transport and different fertigation strategies in different researches some of the researches include short term simulations in the laboratory without the plants li et al 2005 zeng et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 despite the importance of these researches in the early understanding of water and solute movement in the soil new studies have also been carried out in investigating different fertigation strategies with the plant due to the effect of the plant on the absorption of solutes and its movement in soil phogat et al 2013 2014 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 gardenas et al 2005 investigated the effect of fertigation strategy and soil type on nitrate leaching potential for four different micro irrigation systems each associated with a typical crop and showed that fertigation at the end of irrigation cycle decreased nitrate leaching hanson et al 2006 following the previous work of gardenas et al 2005 modeled the distribution of soil nitrogen and nitrate leaching by considering various nutrient injection durations injection times and concentrations ajdary et al 2007 showed that nitrogen leaching can be minimized in shallow root crops by appropriate selection of emitter discharge irrigation duration and its frequency also in order to supply sugarcane requirement for nitrogen the amounts of nitrogen fertilizer application were scheduled by ravikumar et al 2011 using trial and error method and simulation in hydrus ramos et al 2012 in modeling water and nitrogen transport using hydrus 2d indicated that nitrogen movement outside the root zone depends on the amount of water flow and applied nitrogen nitrogen form in fertilizer its application time and number of fertigation events according to the results of their study high nitrate uptake occurred when the number of fertigation events was higher and the used amount was lower in each event in another study karandish and šimůnek 2017 evaluated the effects of different strategies including 11 irrigation levels and 8 nitrogen fertilization rates in two partial root zone drying and deficit irrigation scenarios on the water and nitrogen movement and the yield of corn in the researches discussed above fertigation strategies were compared in some limited scenarios in one irrigation event or in growth season using the experiment or a simulation model and the best scenario was selected despite the use of simulation models in determining the best fertigation strategies optimization methods along with simulation models can be useful tools in optimal managing of irrigation and fertigation in fact using an optimization algorithm a wide range of several design and management parameters can be simultaneously investigated and the best combination of parameters can be selected in the use of optimization tools along with simulation models for proper fertigation planning only a few studies in surface irrigation have been conducted to optimize the design and management parameters of furrow irrigation in an irrigation event ebrahimian et al 2013 and ebrahimian and playán 2014 designed an alternative and conventional furrow fertigation to optimally reduce nitrate losses they used the genetic algorithm and included inflow discharge irrigation cutoff and start times and duration of fertilizer injection as optimizing decision variables to maximize the two objective functions of water and nitrate application efficiency plus uniformity due to the high nitrate leaching potential inappropriate scheduling of fertilizer application not only causes its losses during the growing season but its accumulation at the end of the growing season in the soil profile has the potential for leaching and groundwater contamination by autumn rainfall after crop harvesting therefore optimization of the fertigation parameters based on the decreasing nitrate leaching in one event is not sufficient and proper application of fertigation during the growing season should be simultaneously considered optimum application of nutrients in the crop root zone ensures their optimum utilization higher crop yield and lesser nutrients losses thus optimization of fertigation has an important role in implementation of micro irrigation systems to gain better quality and quantity of agricultural productions without degradation of soil and groundwater the main objective of this study is to present a process to optimize the design and management parameters of drip fertigation so that the goals of this optimization include supplying corn requirement to nitrogen reducing the contaminant of nitrate leaching in the fertigation process and avoiding nitrogen accumulation in the soil at the end of growth season in fact using the results of this research a comprehensive plan for fertigation design and management and in different conditions of soil plant climate and irrigation system can be presented and applied 2 materials and methods 2 1 field study in the present research field experiments were conducted in the study area of urmia university 37 39 n 44 58 e and 1362 m above the sea level urmia university was located in urmia plain the coldest month in this plain is january with normal minimum temperature of 15 1 c and the warmest month is july with normal maximum temperature of 35 5 c the normal annual precipitation is 340 mm the data for calibration and validation phases was collected for modeling process for this purpose corn maxima variety was planted on june 24 2016 in a rectangular farm with dimensions of 20 m 30 m planting rows distance and plants space in a row were 75 and 30 cm respectively to achieve the soil physical properties soil samples were obtained from 5 layers up to a depth of 90 cm 0 10 10 30 30 50 50 70 and 70 90 cm in three repetition table 1 for this purpose undisturbed soil samples were collected from different layers to measure soil bulk density astm 2009 and water retention curve using the pressure plate apparatus on the other hand disturbed soil samples were collected from different mentioned soil layers for measuring soil texture also guelph permeameter method reynolds and elrick 1985 1986 1987 was used to determine the saturated hydraulic conductivity of surface layer of the soil 0 30 cm based on soil analysis and agricultural research center recommendations for local farmers 160 kg ha 1 triple superphosphate was added to the soil in land preparing process and 334 kg ha 1 ammonium nitrate was utilized with irrigation water during the growth season surface drip tape irrigation system with emitter discharge of 4 5 l h 1 and distance of 30 cm was selected before corn planting emitter flow rates were measured using catch cans at intervals of 90 cm christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1941 was calculated to assure the uniformity of drippers discharge the high uniformity coefficient about 97 was obtained for tested emitters the irrigation was conducted twice in a week by irrigation frequency of 4 and 3 days started on june 25 2016 for 14 weeks ammonium nitrate fertigation was carried out weekly in the first irrigation of the week this process was continued up to 10 weeks the fertilizer was given to the land in 10 equal splits for 10 min at the end of irrigation after fertigation the irrigation process was continued to avoid emitter clogging regular soil sampling was done 5 times in each week before the first irrigation 1 4 days after the first irrigation of each week to measure soil water content swc and soil nh4 n and no3 n concentration variations during the growth season in fact the fifth sampling was conducted before the second irrigation of each week this process was repeated for 14 weeks soil specimens were collected using an auger from 20 40 and 60 cm depths and with radial distance of 15 cm from dripper and plant fig 1 the moisture of the specimens was measured using the gravimetric method astm 2010 also the concentration of nh4 n and no3 n in specimens was determined by the kjeldhal method bremner and edwards 1965 bremner and keeney 1965 1966 in this method soil sample was shaken with 2 m kcl 1 5 soil solution ratio for 1 h and the obtained extract was analyzed using automatic steam distillation in the steam distillation method magnesium oxide was used for distillation of ammonium devarda alloy was utilized for reduction of nitrate and nitrite to ammonium and sulfamic acid was employed for destruction of nitrite the distillate was collected in saturated h3bo3 indicator solution and titrated to ph 5 0 with standardized 0 005 n h2so4 using digital burette and ph meter the crops were harvested on october 14 2016 after 16 weeks before harvesting last samples were gathered at three depths of soil so the number of samples were 213 during the experiments in the growth period weeds control was continuously conducted in order to avoid the nitrogen uptake by other plants 2 2 hydrus simulation model 2 2 1 governing equations in this study hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2011 was used to simulate water and solute transport in soil based on finite element numerical solutions of the water and solute transport equations this model has the capability to simulate two or three dimensional axially symmetric water flow and solute movement in soil with water and nutrient uptake by roots this model numerically solves the richards 1931 equation for variably saturated water movement in the soil and convection dispersion equation for solute transport also plant s roots uptake in the richards equation can be calculated using the macroscopic approach presented by feddes et al 1978 readers can refer to šimůnek et al šimůnek et al 2011 šimůnek and bradford 2008 and šimůnek and hopmans 2009 for more information in the richards equation determination of relationships between the soil hydraulic variables i e moisture pressure head and hydraulic conductivity is necessary there are different options in the hydrus to express the mentioned relationships such as van genuchten mualem function van genuchten 1980 in order to solve the richards equation in hydrus model soil hydraulic parameters of this function θr θs α n ks and l must be determined and presented to the model the process of calibrating the mentioned parameters in the hydrus model has been extensively discussed in section 2 2 3 for annual vegetation a root growth model is required to simulate the change in rooting depth with time recently a new computational module in hydrus 2d 3d hartmann et al 2018 is provided in which the user can consider time variable rooting depth values in a table or the program calculates the time variable rooting depth assuming that the actual root depth lr t is the product of the maximum rooting depth lm l and a root growth coefficient fr t šimůnek and suarez 1993 1 l r t l m f r t in the new mentioned module the classical verhulst pearl logistic growth function is used for the root growth coefficient fr t 2 f r t l 0 l 0 l m l 0 e x p r t where l 0 is the initial value of the rooting depth at the beginning of the growing season l and r is the growth rate t 1 the growth rate r is calculated either from the assumption that 50 of the rooting depth will be reached after 50 of the growing season has elapsed or from given data of root depth at a specified time when variable rooting depth is considered the spatial distribution of roots must be described using either the vrugt vrugt et al 2001a 2001b or hoffman and van genuchten hoffman and van genuchten 1983 functions in this research the roots spatial distribution of vrugt function was used in relation to the parameters of this function our observations indicated that the maximum rooting depth in vertical direction and maximum rooting length in horizontal direction were approximately 60 and 35 cm respectively also many researches have showed that most of the maize root was distributed in 0 60 cm layer of the soil gheysari et al 2009 wang et al 2014 based on the study of wang et al 2014 the parameters for defining the maximum intensity of roots in vertical and horizontal directions z and x were taken 10 and 0 cm respectively and the px and pz both were set to 1 0 in this research the mentioned new module was employed to describe horizontal and vertical root growth for this purpose following parameters were employed to describe the root dynamic growth initial time of the root growth period trmin 5 day time at the end of the root water uptake period trharv 112 day initial value of the rooting depth and radius at the beginning of the growth period recommended value 1 cm maximum rooting depth and radius 60 cm and 35 cm respectively and root depth measurement at a specified time in the growth season zt 32day 33 cm in simulation of solutes transport in hydrus using convection dispersion equation the sink term sc of this equation contains solute uptake by plant root and each type of nutrient source or sink term such as mineralization nitrification denitrification etc 3 s c s w c r o o t k μ w μ w θ c k μ s μ s ρ b s k γ w θ γ s ρ b where θ is volumetric water content l3 l 3 c and s are solute concentrations in the liquid phase m l 3 and solid phase m m 1 respectively subscript k represents chemical species in this study nh4 n and no3 n ρ b is the bulk density of the soil m l 3 s w is the sink term for water uptake by plant roots l3 l 3 t 1 croot is the solute concentration in the sink term m l 3 μ w and μ s are first order rate constants for solutes in the liquid and solid phases t 1 respectively μ w and μ s first order rate constants for solutes in the liquid and solid phases respectively providing connections between individual chain species γ w and γ s are zero order production constants for the liquid ml 3t 1 and solid t 1 phases respectively μ w and or μ s constants should be considered in the eq 3 as solutes losses from liquid and or solid phases in processes such as denitrification no3 transformation into n2 and n2o volatilization nh4 transformation into nh3 and immobilization conversion of inorganic compounds to organic compounds by micro organisms or plants however γ w and γ s constants are added to the equation when solute enter into the soil such as mineralization of crop residues or other organic wastes and soil humus fraction under anaerobic conditions since the soil is almost in saturated condition nitrate can be denitrified into nitrous oxide in the denitrification processes however in drip irrigation the process of denitrification can be neglected ravikumar et al 2011 furthermore the research farm had not been cultivated for several years and any fertilizer had not been added to the land in addition nitrification of ammonium to nitrate and also nitrate leaching from the soil profile as a result of rainfall in the autumn and spring occurred consequently the organic matter content 0 8 total nitrogen content nh4 n and no3 n concentration in the soil were low therefore mineralization and immobilization were ignored in this research similar to many other studies ajdary et al 2007 hanson et al 2006 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 in addition ammonia volatilization was ignored due to application of the fertilizer with irrigation water nitrogen transport and transformation and also considering differentiation between passive and active nutrient uptake by the roots are very complex therefore in order to avoid facing these complications in which the relative magnitude and relevance are yet to be determined this study assumes that root uptake of ammonium and nitrate is intensively passive and also the mentioned mechanisms are not occurring as mentioned assumptions were done in many other studies listed above since unlimited passive nutrient uptake was considered for nitrogen species the maximum concentration of water removed from the flow region by root water uptake cmax was set to a concentration value larger than the dissolved simulated concentrations c this process allows all dissolved nutrients to be taken up by plant roots such analysis was done by ramos et al 2012 for nitrogen species uptake by sorghum on the other hand μ s and μ w constants are considered when solutes transform to other forms of solutes since the used fertilizer in this research is ammonium nitrate the nitrification nh4 n transformation into n no2 and then further into no3 n was considered as the main process therefore μ s and μ w constants must be applied in the equation to consider the transformation of nh4 n to no3 n due to adsorption of ammonium by soil particles ammonium nh4 n adsorption to the solid phase was considered according to linear adsorption isotherm and distribution coefficient kd kd is zero in the nitrate no3 n form of nitrogen in the solute transport equation of hydrus the components of the dispersion tensor d are given by bear 1972 in which it is necessary to determine longitudinal and transversal dispersivities of soil εl and εt with molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute in free water it is noted that molecular diffusion coefficient of the solute in free water is negligible however dispersion coefficient of soil is considerable for this reason in this research molecular diffusion coefficient of the nh4 n and no3 n in free water were considered to be 0 064 and 0 068 cm2 h 1 respectively based on the values reported in the literature cote et al 2003 nakamura et al 2004 however εl and εt in addition to μ w μ s and kd were calibrated in the hydrus model calibration method has been extensively presented in section 2 2 3 2 2 2 transport domain boundary and initial conditions in the present research the two dimensional transport domain was defined as a rectangular with width and depth of 37 5 and 120 cm respectively and 2d vertical plane fig 1 a non uniform finite element mesh fem with a high nodal density was considered in the vicinity of the dripper and the low density of nodes far from the dripper was defined in the hydrus initial conditions of swc nh4 n and no3 n concentration were measured and obtained results were entered in the model also a uniform value throughout the soil profile was assumed at the left side of the soil surface where water and solutions were entering to the soil variable flux boundary condition was selected fig 1 in this research a constant width of saturation zone was considered on the basis of field observations during each irrigation wang et al 2014 the constant flux q in the mentioned boundary was defined as 4 q q a q 2 w l where q is the flow rate of an individual emitter 4 5 l h 1 l is the emitter spacing along the dripline 30 cm and w is the width of saturation zone in variable flux boundary 20 cm a free drainage boundary condition was assumed at the bottom of the soil profile a third type cauchy boundary condition was used along flux width at the top boundary to describe the concentration flux no flux boundary condition of water and nitrate was applied to residual boundary of the soil profile when there was no irrigation evaporation occurred from the wet soil surface therefore the evaporation rates were considered in the model as atmospheric boundary condition furthermore a special hydrus 2d option was used that allows the time variable flux boundary condition to be treated as the atmosphere boundary condition in this study in order to determine the potential evaporation from soil surface and potential transpiration via plant as inputs for the hydrus at first eto the reference crop evapotranspiration and etp the potential crop evapotranspiration were calculated using fao penman monteith equation and the dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 used parameters in dual crop coefficient method are presented in table 2 although the dual crop coefficient approach computes separately plant transpiration and soil evaporation based on this method a constant value is considered for the transpiration coefficient from planting date to approximately 10 ground cover kcb ini however the amount of transpiration gradually increases and this factor can cause an error in calculating the amount of transpiration therefore ritchie 1972 equation eqs 5 6 was used to separate potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp based on leaf area index kemp et al 1997 vrugt et al 2001a young et al 2009 jiang et al 2010 phogat et al 2010 li et al 2014 in fact plant transpiration changes are considered in this approach from planting date according to leaf area index fig 2 it is noted that after initial stage of plant growth the obtained values by fao and ritchie methods is very close to each other 5 e p e t p exp β l a i 6 t p e t p e p where β is the fixed light extinction coefficient and lai is the leaf area index l2l 2 the value of β which indicates radiation extinction by the crop canopy varies with the sun angle distribution of plants and the arrangement of crop leaves kemp et al 1997 for maize crop this coefficient is equal to 0 65 according to allen et al 1964 in the present research leaf area index was calculated using weekly measurements of leaf area these mesurments were conducted in three iterations the mentioned leaf area was determined by taking photographs of leaves and then processing with the digimizer image analysis software program gustafsson et al 2016 keramatlou et al 2015 ma et al 2016 to calculate evapotranspiration and irrigation water requirement a portable meteorological instrument was used in the vicinity of the research field for measuring meteorological parameters including temperature relative humidity wind speed and solar radiation the potential crop evapotranspiration was employed to determine water requirement depth and duration of irrigation in each irrigation event it is noted that the potential evapotranspiration was specified using the dual crop coefficient approach in the former period of each irrigation because of the very low rainfall values in the growth season 2 7 mm and its insignificant effect on the moisture content of the soil its amount was not considered in the hydrus 2 2 3 calibration and validation of the model parameters in this study inverse solution option in the hydrus model was not used to calibrate the parameters because this option does not have the capability to run with the new module of root growth simulation therefore particle swarm optimization pso method eberhart and kennedy 1995 kennedy and eberhart 1995 was employed to calibrate van genuchten mualem and solute transport equations parameters the optimization program with the mentioned module was run in the matlab program the flowchart of different stages of the optimization program was followed fig 3 the objective function for this program was considered as follows 7 m i n i m i z e o f b i 1 n q x z t i q x z t i b 2 where q x z t i and q x z t i b refer to the measured and predicted variable respectively at location of x z and time ti b is unknown vector soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters and n is number of measurements at first the program of the mentioned function was run to optimize soil hydraulic parameters θr θs α n and ks for the objective of minimizing the difference between measured and simulated soil moisture in different depths and times q θ in eq 7 initial estimation of soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by fitting retention curve data in retc table 1 and neural network prediction of pedotransfer function in rosetta software schaap et al 2001 and the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil layer using optimized soil hydraulic parameters in hydrus model eq 7 was run to achieve optimized solute transport parameters εl kd μ s and μ w with the objective of minimizing the difference between measured and simulated nh4 n and no3 n concentration of the soil in different depths and times q c in eq 7 initial estimations of mentioned solute transport parameters were selected according to previous studies ajdary et al 2007 doltra and munoz 2010 gardenas et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 hu et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 since after calibration no significant differences were observed between soil hydraulic properties and solute transport parameters of two soil layers of the study only one soil layer was defined in the hydrus model in this study 80 of the data was used for calibration stage and 20 of data was employed for validation to evaluate the model performance in simulating soil water content and solute transport the root mean square error rmse mean error me index of agreement d and nash sutcliffe efficiency e nash and sutcliffe 1970 were computed the index of agreement represents the degree of accuracy in estimation of observations khodaverdiloo et al 2011 in fact the d statistics was used to overcome certain problems of the commonly used coefficient of determination r2 the d statistics is indicator of model error free but r2 is a measure of correlation or association khodaverdiloo et al 2011 similar to r2 the nash sutcliffe is not very sensitive to systematic model over underprediction and the index of agreement was proposed to overcome the insensitivity of e and r2 to differences in the predicted and observed means and variances krause et al 2005 the mathematical equations of the mentioned statistics are as follows 8 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 9 m e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 10 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 11 e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi and pi are the observed and simulated values and n is the number of measurements the rmse measures estimations of absolute errors whereas the me shows the overestimation or underestimation of the model the obtained values from the rmse and me close to zero indicate the better performance of the model the range of e is between 1 0 perfect fit and if the predictions of a model are unbiased the e statistic will be in the interval from 0 to 1 mccuen et al 2006 the range of d lies between 0 and 1 2 3 optimization of fertigation management and design parameters the main objective of the present research is to use the hydrus calibrated model for optimizing design and management parameters of irrigation and fertigation the importance of the mentioned optimization is to reduce environmental pollution due to nitrate leaching in order to optimize design and management parameters of fertigation both nitrate leaching during the growing season and its accumulation at the end of the growing season in the soil profile should be prevented because nitrate accumulation has the capacity to leach and transfer to groundwater aquifers due to autumn precipitation after crop harvesting therefore in this study firstly irrigation flow rate duration of the fertilizer injection and the start time of fertigation was optimized for minimizing nitrate leaching in a fertigation cycle after determining the best combination of decision variables of this stage the fertilizer application amount was optimized in each stage of fertigation in the growth season based on the plant s requirement for nitrogen at different stages of growth accordingly besides supplying plant s nitrogen requirements nitrate accumulation was minimized in the end of each fertigation and especially growth season it is noted that in the second stage of optimization the values of optimized design and management parameters of the former stage were considered as injection program however duration of the fertilizer injection in each fertigation stage was selected based on the optimized injection duration of the first stage and the allowed minimum duration of injection to prevent irrigation water salinity eciw 3 ds m 1 nakayama and bucks 1986 in this process the amount of eciw in different fertilizer values was computed using the optimization program code when the amount of eciw at the optimized injection duration was more than 3 ds m 1 the duration of the injection was increased by the program this criterion was added to the constraints of the optimization model table 3 the irrigation and fertigation were conducted twice and once in a week respectively in the first optimization stage the optimization was carried out for a duration of one week with two irrigation events so that the fertigation was conducted in the first irrigation of the mentioned optimization stage in fact the effect of the next irrigation without fertigation was considered on nitrate leaching the second optimization program was exerted for the growth season period with similar irrigation and fertigation scheduling of the first optimization program i e for each week an irrigation with fertigation and the other without fertigation the flowchart of fig 3 is valid for these stages but decision variables and the objective function are different 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of the hydrus in this research pso optimization algorithm was used to calibrate water and solutes transport parameters of the model table 4 similar values of soil hydraulic parameters were reported by ajdary et al 2007 for a similar soil texture wide range values of the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient of solute transport in the soil has been reported in different researches 0 3 5 20 12 2 and 25 8 5 and 20 cm by ajdary et al 2007 hanson et al 2006 phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 respectively also in the mentioned researches transversal dispersivity coefficient of solute transport in the soil was taken equal to one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity coefficient the mentioned procedure was considered in the optimization program of the present research in this research the distribution coefficient and the rate coefficient for nitrification of ammonium to nitrate were located in the reported range by hanson et al 2006 i e 3 4 cm3 g 1 and 0 02 0 72 day 1 respectively in fact in this study the initial estimations of the distribution coefficient and the rate coefficient for nitrification of ammonium to nitrate were considered 3 5 cm3 g 1 and 0 2 day 1 respectively these values are similar to values in the research conducted by phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 and ravikumar et al 2011 the rmse values of the model in the simulation process of swc varied in the range of 0 011 0 024 cm3 cm 3 for different depths of soil in two calibration and validation phases table 5 ajdary et al 2007 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 and ramos et al 2012 reported that the rmse value in their soil water content simulation varied in the range of 0 017 0 015 0 045 0 011 and 0 033 0 028 cm3 cm 3 respectively the low values of me show good performance of the model table 5 the values of the d index have stayed in the range of 0 721 0 796 dimensionless in two calibration and verification phases at different depths of the soil also the nash sutcliffe efficiencies e with an average of 0 48 dimensionless were in the acceptable range of 0 1 at different depths of the soil it can be concluded that the error of simulation is low enough and therefore the performance of the model is acceptable the results of the model in the simulation of swc in the validation data showed that soil water content was increased by irrigation and then it was decreased due to the evaporation root water uptake deep percolation and drainage fig 4 the rmse values of the model in the simulation of nitrate concentration in the soil is less than 0 020 mg cm 3soil table 5 ramos et al 2012 reported that the rmse value in the simulation of nitrate concentration in soil was 3 078 mmol l 1 also karandish and šimůnek 2017 and wang et al 2014 stated that the rmse value in simulating nitrate concentration in their studied soil varied 0 39 10 9 mg l 1 and 2 6 8 9 mg kg 1 similar to swc the nash sutcliffe efficiencies e have been placed in the acceptable range of 0 1 with an average of 0 40 dimensionless at different depths of the soil table 5 furthermore the value of the d index is in the range of 0 826 0 945 dimensionless at different depths of the soil in two studied phases the validation results of the model in the simulation of the nitrate changes represent good agreement between measured and simulated solute concentration fig 5 it is necessary to explain that the amounts of ammonium measured in the three depths of the soil were negligible furthermore because of ammonium adsorption by the soil particles and its subsequent fast nitrification to nitrate simulated values of nh4 n in three depths of the soil were zero therefore its results were not shown according to simulation results with injecting the fertilizer the concentration of ammonium was high just at the injection spot low concentration of the nh4 n in different soil layers showed that ammonium adsorption by the soil particles and its transformation to nitrate occurred in the vicinity of the injection site therefore injected ammonium did not reach to the depth of 20 cm the trend of soil nitrate variation shows increasing trend after each fertigation event especially in surface layer of soil however after the leaching effects and uptaking by the plant the nitrate concentration decreased to the next fertigation the trend of soil nitrate variation is relatively constant in the 20 cm depth because of gradual transformation of ammonium to nitrate in the surface layer of soil in fact generated nitrate can be leached by the next irrigation the model error in simulating water and solute transport is greater in surface layer than deeper layers table 5 since the variation of soil moisture and solute concentration in deeper layers was less than in the upper layer the model error was low the differences between simulated and measured values can be due to field measurement errors and the errors related to model structure and inputs it can be concluded that the model has the capability to simulate water and solute transport in soil therefore the calibrated model was used to simulate and optimize the fertigation process other studies emphasize the appropriate performance of the hydrus model in different conditions of irrigation and plants hanson et al 2006 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 karandish and šimůnek 2017 ramos et al 2012 3 2 water and nitrogen balance in soil and leaching and deep percolation losses the calibrated hydrus model was employed to simulate water and solute transport in soil investigation of the nitrate distribution in the soil profile in different times during the growth season indicated that in the early weeks of the growth season since irrigation depth is low and its duration is short moisture advance front is short fig 6 this process can cause a shorter nitrate advance front however by increasing plant water requirement irrigation depth and its duration were increased and the nitrate could advance to the deeper layers with irrigation water the nitrate concentration in the root zone is considerably high before the 4th fertigation fig 6 b however its concentration is low before the 8th fertigation the reason of this issue can be explained by considering the equal amount of fertilizer splits in this research in fact in the early weeks of the growth season nitrate uptake by the roots was low because of the shorter roots and low water requirement therefore in the mentioned period the concentration of the nitrate was considerable in the root zone however in the last fertigations due to the higher nitrate uptake by the plant and higher amounts of irrigation and leaching less nitrate was observed in the soil surface before fertigation nitrate continuously moved downward until the end of the growth season the nitrate was not adsorbed and the denitrification was assumed negligible high nitrate concentration occurred near the dripper after fertigation due to nitrate injection and nitrification process then the nitrate concentration in the mentioned locations decreased because of plant uptake and dispersion process investigating the soil nitrate distribution in the harvest time fig 6 f indicated that a component of the nitrate was leached below the root zone during the growing season and accumulated in the soil profile at the end of the growing season the comparison of the nitrogen fertilizer requirement of corn during its different life stages on the basis of abendroth et al 2011 and okeeffe 2009 and the absorbed fertilizer by the roots indicated that nitrogen uptake in different stages of growth does not match with the plant requirement fig 7 fertilizer application scheduling in this research was based on the local recommendation 334 kg ha 1 in 10 equal splits simulated components of soil water balance in growth season showed that 26 38 and 63 45 percent of the irrigated water was specified to evaporation from soil surface and plant uptake respectively table 6 the potential transpiration was 324 mm in the growth season period so that about 87 of the potential transpiration was consumed by the plant on the basis of water accessibility in the soil and moisture stress condition also the results showed that the irrigation water cause an increase in soil moisture of about 0 5 percent during the simulation period and about 9 65 of irrigated water was deep percolation losses water balance components values were considered for the upper 65 cm or root zone by the model and the deep percolation amounts were calculated for below the root zone 65 cm low value of deep percolation relates to relatively heavy soil texture of the field in fact high uptake of the moisture by the plant can relate to soil texture which has low hydraulic conductivity this low hydraulic conductivity causes the irrigated water to remain in the root zone region ajdary et al 2007 reported low deep percolation in less permeable soils and trickle irrigation method also wang et al 2014 showed low deep percolation losses about 10 in drip irrigation approach and low precipitation condition simulation of nitrogen balance components in the root zone for growth season showed that most applied nh4 n fastly nitrified to no3 n about 99 and its uptake by the plant was very low table 7 furthermore there was no leaching of nh4 n from the root zone simulated distribution of nh4 n in the soil in different times of the growth season data not shown indicated that the ammonium remained in the vicinity of the dripper there was only slight movement of nh4 n because of soil adsorption and subsequent fast nitrification and roots uptake despite existing fertigation in each week total injected ammonium was transformed to nitrate until end of the week the reason of less uptake of ammonium by corn can be explained by paying attention to this point ramos et al 2012 showed non leachability of the ammonium to the deeper depths and lesser uptake by the plant simulation of nitrate balance components in the soil showed that 73 5 of total nitrate initial content in the soil nitrate injection and nitrification process was absorbed by the plant and 7 1 leached table 7 some studies have indicated more leaching of nitrate than ammonium and its relatively high uptake by the plant hanson et al 2006 ramos et al 2012 ravikumar et al 2011 wang et al 2014 reported 16 of nitrate leaching in dry condition of precipitation in drip irrigation the reason of low nitrate leaching in the present research compared to other studies can be related to the relatively heavy texture of the soil and its low deep percolation percentage therefore because of high concentration of nitrate in the root zone its uptake by plants in the present study was more than other similar studies furthermore the low leaching and high uptake of nitrate in our study can be explained by giving attention to the suitable amount and time of fertigation and number of its splits the research of farneselli et al 2015 showed that the high frequency of fertigation and or irrigation could be a strategy to increase the nitrogen uptake efficiency also ramos et al 2012 indicated that leaching of nitrate increased by decreasing the number of fertilizer splits in this research the accumulation of the nitrate in the root zone was considerable 19 4 as a result by considering the leaching and remained nitrate in the end of growth season the nitrate not taken up by plants was about 26 5 high concentrations of the nitrate in the root zone has the potential for leaching the remained nitrate during the autumn precipitation after crop harvesting especially in the regions with shallow groundwater level wang et al 2014 emphasized in their research that a considerable precipitation at the end of the season causes more drainage compared to even distribution of precipitation during the growth season therefore it is necessary to manage and control the nitrate leaching and its accumulation during the growth season 3 3 optimization results of fertigation design and management in this section of the research nitrate leaching and nitrogen uptake were investigated in two different fertilizer application scenarios in the calibrated model scenario 1 is fertilizer application in three splits which is implemented by local farmers i e 50 25 and 25 of n fertilizer application at the beginning of the growing season knee stage and tasselling stage respectively furthermore attentions have recently been paid to high fertilizer application frequency as a strategy to increase n uptake efficiency and crop yield farneselli et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 therefore in scenario 2 nitrate leaching and nitrogen uptake were investigated in weekly application of the fertilizer in the growth season fertilizer doses calculated in each fertigation event for two scenarios are shown in table 8 investigating the nitrogen fertilizer requirement of the plant and its uptake fig 8 a shows that in scenario 1 due to injection of high amount of fertilizer in each split and low nitrate leaching nitrate is often available in the root zone and its uptake is higher than the plant requirement in this scenario absorbed fertilizer is about 245 kg ha 1 and its leaching and accumulation at the end of the growing season are 29 95 and 64 25 kg ha 1 respectively table 9 however with weekly splits fig 8 b up to the 7th week the crop little requirements are provided then with root growth and need for water and nitrogen uptake the corn uptake is less than the plant requirement due to the equal amount of the fertilizer in each split despite the decrease in nitrate leaching this scenario increased its accumulation in the soil profile at the end of the growing season table 9 this process may cause gradually leaching of nitrate by following precipitations at the same time it reduced nitrogen uptake to 210 kg ha 1 therefore increasing the fertigation frequency cannot always be a suitable strategy for optimum fertilizer absorbing and reducing its losses appropriate fertigation planning is necessary for simultaneous reduction of nitrate leaching and accumulation in the soil profile and at the same time supply the nitrogen demand of the plant therefore fertigation management was optimized not only in each fertigation event but also in the growth season simultaneous optimization results of three parameters including irrigation flow rate duration of the fertilizer injection and start time of injection showed that nitrate leaching was minimum by selecting irrigation flow rate equal to 0 8 l h 1 minimum duration of the fertilizer injection 5 min in this optimization program and fertilizer injection before providing the opportunity to wash the pipes and emitters in the second stage of the optimization the amount of fertilizer application in different stages of the growth season was optimized since salinity problems can occur in the high amounts of fertilizers under optimized conditions of the first stage the salinity contrainst was considered in the second stage of the optimization procces in fact the fertigation duration was adjusted by considering the criteria of eciw 3 ds m 1 increasing the fertigation duration based on mentioned criteria cause injected salts to spread in the soil profile and prevent root water uptake reduction by increasing the osmotic potential in a surface soil layer in the vicinity of roots optimized values of the fertilizer application in the second stage of optimization are presented in table 8 in optimized scheduling of fertigation nitrogen uptake by the plant in each stage of growth was matched with the plant requirement fig 8 c in fact based on the amount of nitrogen present in the soil this optimization simulation model optimizes the amount of required fertilizer to be added to the soil at different time scales so after the interactions occurring in the soil the plant can take up its required nitrogen at the appropriate times investigation of nitrogen balance components in the root zone table 9 shows that the optimum fertilizer application scheduling reduced total losses of nitrate leaching and accumulation compared to two other scenarios also it causes to reduce the use of fertilizer up to 20 kg ha 1 and supply the nitrogen requirement by corn at appropriate times marinov and marinov 2014 indicated that in order to reach high yield of crop while reducing nitrate leaching in soil it is necessary to generate a balance between applied fertilizer and the required amount of nitrogen to the plant according to the results of the present research despite the reduction of the amount of the fertilizer used in the optimized fertigation scheduling the corn yield will be optimum due to adequate and on time uptake of nitrogen 4 conclusions to achieve food security besides environmental protection programs and suitable development it is necessary to use optimal fertigation management in different irrigation systems for this purpose a simulation optimization framework can be used for developing optimal irrigation and fertigation schedules in this research calibrated hydrus model was used to simulate water and nitrogen behavior in the soil nitrate has a very high leaching potential during the plant growth season and if it is accumulated in soil it will be able to leach and transfer to groundwater aquifers due to autumn precipitation after crop growth season therefore in order to optimize fertigation scheduling not only nitrate leaching in the growth season must be considered but also its accumulation in the soil profile must be avoided in the growth season by considering this point in this study an appropriate programing was done to optimize and manage fertigation in this regard two issues were considered including the reduction of the nitrate leaching from root zone region and supplying plant requirements for nitrogen in fact by applying the optimization program besides decreasing nitrate leaching in a fertigation irrigation cycle its accumulation during the growth season was reduced at first to minimize leaching losses in a fertigation cycle the irrigation flow rate discharge the fertilizer injection time and its start time were simultaneously optimized using the calibrated hydrus model then the fertilizer application amounts in each stage of fertigation were optimized in the growth season period by the best decision parameters combination in the previous stage in this research for the first time the two dimensional root growth of the plant was dynamically simulated in an optimization program to meet real conditions in the field it is recommended that the suggested two stage optimization program is to be considered for design and management of fertigation in different conditions of climate crop and soils achieving suitable crop yield and economic situation besides controlling environmental contaminations acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge prof j šimůnek of university of california riverside because of his valuable suggestions during the study period on the issues related to simulation with hydrus 2d 3d via email also we used his guidance in dynamically simulating root growth during this research 
11387,subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a micro irrigation system that could be adopted by producers in the semi arid regions around the world for efficient use of water yet several crop management issues related to sdi system need to be addressed to assess the feasibility of sdi one such issue is the impact of crop row placement on crop performance irrigation water use efficiency and yield under sdi a study was conducted in the southern u s great plains in which drip tape laterals were buried 30 cm deep at 153 cm spacing with two crop rows planted at 76 cm spacing and irrigated with one tape corn zea mays l and grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l rows were offset from equidistance from the drip tape by 0 8 15 23 and 38 cm using high precision guidance system real time kinematics this resulted in 5 treatments and 4 replications this treatment structure was imposed on three irrigation high medium and low regimes analysis of variance showed no interaction between offset treatments and irrigation or year in corn and grain sorghum yields the row offset did not impact the overall yield as the yield loss in row farther from the tape was compensated by the increased yield in row moved closer to the tape the yield distribution ranged from 50 in both rows for 0 cm offset to 59 in row closer to the tape for 38 cm offset the findings of this study suggests that while driver accuracy is important to maintain equal yields in neighboring crop rows the overall yields are affected more by irrigation and climatic conditions and not by the row offsets with respect to sdi tape this data suggests that sdi can be successful regardless of access to high precision guidance systems keywords subsurface drip irrigation corn grain sorghum lateral spacing offset semi arid 1 introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a micro irrigation method gaining popularity in arid and semi arid regions around the world in the united states of america u s a lamm et al 2012 reported that acreage under sdi systems increased from 164 000 to 260 000 ha from 2003 to 2008 ayars et al 2015 reported increase in use of sdi systems on commercial horticulture farms in california u s a following recent droughts similarly bordovsky and mustian 2010 reported increasing adoption of sdi systems for cotton production in the semi arid texas high plains region of the united states yield response of crops to sdi has also been encouraging in the semi arid regions for example lamm and trooien 2003 concluded from a 10 year research program conducted in semi arid conditions of kansas u s a that subsurface drip irrigation can reduce irrigation water requirement in corn zea mays l by 35 55 without compromising yields compared to center pivot spray irrigation systems ayars et al 2015 reported that the yields either increased or did not change in sdi systems in horticultural crops colaizzi and schneider 2005 reported highest grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l yields for sdi in comparison to center pivot lepa and spray irrigation systems under limited irrigation conditions the authors concluded that sdi system was best suited for limited irrigation conditions of semi arid southern great plains of the united states however crop management irrigation scheduling and irrigation rates are important to achieve the greater yield goals at lower water usage bresler 1978 bozkurt et al 2006 payero et al 2009 bordovsky and mustian 2010 therefore more agronomic research is required to perfect the sdi systems for individual crops lamm et al 2012 some of the direct advantages of sdi system include efficient supply of water by eliminating runoff and deep percolation sub surface fertilization reduced inter row weed pressure lower energy cost and automation lamm and camp 2007 conversely disadvantages of sdi system include smaller wetting pattern restricted root distribution water filtration issues rodent damage difficulty in monitoring of irrigation fewer tillage options and high initial costs lamm and camp 2007 in sdi water is applied underground and is seldom seen at the surface therefore row placement becomes important to ensure plant roots have easy access to water bozkurt et al 2006 bordovsky and mustian 2010 bordovsky and mustian 2010 noted that crop row placement relative to sdi drip tape can be difficult in a typical alternate row sdi drip tape installation bozkurt et al 2006 reported significant effect of row spacing across lateral tape on corn yield in sdi the authors reported increase in grain yield of corn as the rows were moved closer to the tape in this study yields were also proportional to the amount of irrigation supplied grabow et al 2006 reported dampening of soil moisture to the crop row as the distance of crop row increased from the drip tape an inadvertent shift in annual crop row relative to the drip tape could result in uneven distribution of water to neighboring crop rows due to smaller wetting patterns bordovsky and mustian 2010 visual observation for consistent row placement above the drip tape in sdi cannot be relied upon for consistency of optimum crop row placement this is important as the decision regarding spacing of drip tape has to be taken before planting and cannot be changed once the crop is growing initial research conducted in the u s high plains region by lamm 2001 used permanent raised beds to maintain accurate placements of the crop row however this requires the beds to be maintained through tillage and presents challenges for narrow row crop production such as wheat which is commonly irrigated in rotation with row crops issues regarding installation of drip tape as well as planting of crop rows can be overcome by real time kinematics rtk the common utilization of rtk guidance allows for precision return accuracy but there is limited data to determine if this level of precision is needed for corn and grain sorghum the main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of offset row placement on yield of corn and grain sorghum over sdi tape under different irrigation conditions the hypothesis of this research was that as the rows are moved from optimum placements yields would decline as a function of distances away from this equidistance placement the findings from this study will add to the understanding of corn and grain sorghum row spacing for sdi systems in similar agro climatic conditions around the world 2 materials and methods the experiment was conducted at oklahoma panhandle research and extension center 36 35 51 n 101 37 7 w oklahoma u s a the 30 year 1981 2010 mean annual temperature and rainfall is 13 4 c and 435 mm respectively us climate data website 2017 about 70 of the total rainfall is received from may to september which is also the main growing season in the region the elevation of this site from the mean sea level is about 1006 m the major soil type at the study site was gruver clay loam fine mixed superactive mesic aridic paleustoll which consists of a deep about 2 0 m soil profile the sdi system installed at the center was used for this study the sdi tape was buried 30 cm below the surface and spaced 153 cm apart such that each tape was supplying water to two crop rows when planted at 76 cm row spacing the tape contained emitters 60 cm apart along the length of the tape designed to supply 0 68 l per hour at 68 kpa allowing for 41 6 l per minute lpm being supplied to each zone which are 192 m long and 18 m wide 0 35 ha pressure was adjusted to 89 6 kpa at the inlet of each zone such that instantaneous flow rates of 53 lpm were achieved on each zone which allowed for application rates of 153 lpm ha 1 the instantaneous flow was evaluated periodically with manual observations of the flow meters model 36m251t netifimusa fresno ca u s a the flow meters were installed at the inlet of each zone and included totalizers which were used to determine the total water applied during the season the drip tape was installed using real time kinematic global positioning rtk gps guidance therefore all planting was conducted using this technology to place rows in desired locations relative to drip tape a total of 9 irrigation zones were involved in this study grain sorghum corn and wheat were rotated annually such that each crop was planted on three consecutive zones corn was planted into sorghum stubble sorghum was planted into wheat stubble and wheat was planted immediately after corn harvest this was done to allow for more successful no till management to minimize pest pressure however as mentioned earlier this study focused on corn and grain sorghum and the wheat crop simply served as a rotation crop the experimental design was a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates and 5 treatments the treatment structure was imposed in 3 zones planted to corn and 3 zones planted to grain sorghum the zones received irrigation at high medium and low irrigation rates because irrigation was not replicated it was treated as an experimental condition and not a treatment factor in anova analysis each plot was 4 57 m 6 rows wide and 9 15 m long the treatments consisted of crop row to drip lateral offsets of 0 8 15 23 and 38 cm fig 1 shows the crop row arrangement with respect to the drip tape normal row spacing where drip tape is in middle of two crops rows represent 0 cm offset the crop rows ran parallel to drip tape in east west direction therefore the north row was getting closer to the tape with increasing offset corn was planted on 5 may in 2014 21 april in 2015 and 15 april in 2016 in three zones corn hybrid pioneer 1768amx was planted in 2014 and 2015 whereas corn hybrid pioneer 1625 was planted in 2016 grain sorghum was planted on 6 june 2014 1 june 2015 and 8 june 2016 in 3 zones sorghum hybrid pioneer 84g62 was planted during all three years of study figs 2 and 3 show the irrigation applied rainfall received each month all corn plots received 8 cm of pre plant irrigation in 2014 and 2015 and 5 cm in 2016 post planting irrigation was initiated for the corn on 5 june 2014 4 june 2015 and 12 may 2016 irrigation in sorghum was initiated on 19 june in 2014 26 june in 2015 and 5 july in 2016 irrigation was terminated at the development of black layer for both crops therefore corn received the last irrigation of the season on 26 august 2014 25 august 2015 and 24 august 2016 the last irrigation event of the season for grain sorghum was on 11 september in 2014 28 september 2015 and 9 september 2016 in 2014 and 2015 evapotranspiration et was estimated by the aquaplanner amarillo tx u s a available at www aquaplanner net irrigation scheduling program the aquaplanner scheduling program utilizes a water balance approach to estimate soil water deficit and schedules irrigation events to minimize runoff and drainage while maintaining an allowable water deficient within the rooting zone if irrigation capacity is sufficient to do so although the details are proprietary the commercially available product utilizes an fao 56 et model soil hydraulic properties of the soil mapping unit as provided by ssurgo database and weather data from the u s national weather service in 2016 the mesonet oklahoma mesonet ok u s a irrigation scheduling tool was used in combination with adjustments made based on work conducted by gatlin 2014 the mesonet uses the asce penman monteith equation asce 2005 to calculate et the specific details of the mesonet et product description are provided by sutherland et al 2005 the minimum crop coefficient used by the mesonet during the initial growth phase for corn and sorghum is 0 48 and 0 36 respectively these values were reduced to 0 04 during the initial phase 30 days after planting because of the lack of surface wetting when using sdi in each year the high irrigation regime was irrigated to replace daily et or at a maximum irrigation rate of 1 0 cm per day in 2014 and 2015 and 0 9 cm in 2016 these maximum daily irrigation rates were used because irrigation capacities in the region are seldom above these daily rates during the initial phase of the crop production period irrigation was applied when the soil water deficit was greater than 0 5 cm since the last irrigation event the remaining two zones in each crop received irrigation equal to 75 medium and 50 low of the maximum daily rate irrigation was delayed when rainfall was anticipated to allow for optimum rainfall capture prior to the growing season 3 soil cores were collected from each irrigation zone to assess soil water status and pre irrigation water was applied to insure field capacity in the surface 100 cm prior to planting both corn and sorghum received starter fertilizer of 3 3 l ha 1 of ammonium phosphate 10 34 0 in row at planting every year year 2014 did not receive in season nitrogen applications because soil test no3 n plus nh4 n in the surface 30 cm of soil was 200 kg n ha 1 both crops received in season fertilization in 2015 and 2016 corn received 34 kg n ha 1 as urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 liquid fertilizer injected into the irrigation system weekly for 8 weeks starting on 15 june sorghum received 34 kg n ha 1 as uan liquid fertilizer injected into the irrigation system weekly for 6 weeks starting on 8 july total seasonal application of n was 269 kg n ha 1 in corn and 202 kg n ha 1 in sorghum in 2016 weekly fertigation of corn was initiated on 10 june and was applied for 8 weeks and fertigation in grain sorghum was initiated on 30 june and applied for 6 weeks corn and sorghum both received pesticide applications to control weeds and insects in accordance with oklahoma cooperative extension service guidelines corn grain yield was collected at maturity on 8 october 2014 1 october 2015 and 5 october 2016 sorghum yields were collected at maturity on 15 october 2014 14 october 2015 and 29 october 2016 harvesting was done using a kincaid 8 xp small plot combine in 2014 the combined harvest the center 2 rows simultaneously from each plot in 2015 and 2016 the rows were harvested as individual rows such that the distribution of yield between rows could be utilized therefore data presented allows us to look at the average yield for the two rows as effected by their place over the tape in each year of the study however the distribution of yield between the two rows can only be evaluated in 2015 and 2016 irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated by dividing grain yield with total irrigation supplied for the growing season analysis of variance anova to evaluate treatment effects of whole plot yield and the distribution of yield to the northern row row moving closer to tape as a function of offset was conducted using sas proc glimmix sas institute 2008 3 results and discussion analysis of variation for whole plot corn yield showed no interaction between the offset treatment and the irrigation regime or year therefore offset treatment effects were analyzed across year and irrigation regime this analysis showed no significant impact of offset on yield fig 4 shows the treatment yields averaged across years for each irrigation regime the lack of significant difference among treatments demonstrates that row placement is not critical consideration when growing corn on sdi although irrigation was not a replicated treatment factor its impact on yield in each year is presented in fig 5 which shows that in 2014 yields increased with increasing irrigation from low to high this is similar to data reported by payero et al 2006 who found that more water yields larger biomass and larger biomass yields higher et rates in contrast in 2015 and 2016 there was little or no difference between the high and medium irrigation treatments the above average rainfall in 2015 fig 2 resulted in similar yet excellent corn yields especially at the medium and high regimes fig 4 in 2016 rainfall was only slightly above average fig 2 however et during reproductive growth of corn was above average as a result the corn yields were suppressed relative to the water available during this year from irrigation and rainfall the similarity in yields for the medium and high regimes are likely explained by observation made by traore et al 2000 who found that the harvest index of corn is affected by water stress when the stress occurred at flowering and that yields are significantly reduced specifically in 2016 the high irrigated treatment developed a large canopy under well watered conditions prior to reproductive growth this was followed by an increase in et beyond the irrigation rate limit set for this treatment which caused excessive stress on corn growing in this irrigation regime in contrast the corn grown in the medium irrigation regime endured water stress during vegetative growth and therefore had a visibly small canopy which caused this crop to be more efficient at utilizing available water for grain production analysis of variance for the grain sorghum yields resulted in no interaction between offset treatment year and irrigation regime furthermore as was found in the corn data no significant difference among offset treatments were observed fig 6 shows the treatment means for each irrigation regime when averaged across years although the irrigation regimes in this study were not replicated and served simply to provide alternative experimental conditions it is noteworthy to mention similarities in grain sorghum yields among the regimes fig 7 shows that the yields were often similar among the irrigation regimes in 2014 the low treatment produced average yields that were 17 less than those produced by the medium irrigation regime in 2015 and 2016 yields were similar among all irrigation regimes this was certainly due to the above average rainfall in 2015 however in 2016 the lack of yield response was in part due to greater bird damage in the high irrigation which was delayed in reaching physiological maturity it is also likely due to its ability to more rapidly recover from water stress after rainfall or irrigation as well as its ability to scavenge soil moisture from greater depths under limited irrigation conditions gatlin 2014 specifically early season water stress in the limited irrigation regimes low and medium allowed for more effective rooting and subsoil water extraction this combined with timely rainfall allowed for comparable yields to the fully irrigated regime the offset treatments influenced the distribution of corn yield between the two rows harvested the anova analyses showed no interaction between offset treatment and irrigation regime but there was an interaction between offset treatment and year therefore means presented in table 1 are separated by year for corn at 0 cm offsets both north and south row with respect to tape contributed similar amount 50 to total yield in both years however as the north corn row moved closer to the tape the percentage of yield it produced increased to 59 in 2016 significant differences were not observed in 2015 presumably because the above average rainfall reduced the importance of row placement in controlling water distribution in the soil anova analysis of grain sorghum data found no interaction among offset treatment and year or irrigation however offset treatment did significantly impact the distribution of yield between the two rows when averaged across year and irrigation regime the percentage of yield distributed to the northern grain sorghum rows increased as it moved closer to the tape table 1 this is similar to the observations made by bordovsky and mustian 2010 when irrigating cotton gossypium hirsutum l with rows offset from the tape they found that cotton rows moved closer to the tape showed an increase in yield while the rows moving further away produced a declining yield although soil moisture distribution data was not collected in this study previous studies conducted on soil moisture distribution along sdi tape have reported decline in soil moisture distribution with increasing distance from tape and that the decline was prominent with reducing irrigation supply grabow et al 2006 badr and abuarab 2013 therefore the yield declines from the crop rows as they move away from the drip tape were expected irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated by dividing yield with irrigation supplied fig 8 shows the average iwue of different offset treatments for each irrigation regime across the years irrigation water use efficiency in our study was lower than what reported for corn in the great plains region of the united states for example payero et al 2009 reported iwue efficiency of 7 09 kg m 3 for corn in nebraska u s a in contrast the iwue values calculated for grain sorghum under the low and medium irrigation were greater than those previously reported in fact colaizzi and schneider 2005 reported iwue of 2 48 kg m 3 for grain sorghum under sdi systems in the southern great plains of the united states higher iwue in nebraska could be attributed to lower et demands in higher latitude region of the united states besides iwue for corn in this study was higher than those reported in other semi arid areas of the world for example el hendawy et al 2008 reported iwue ranging from 1 2 kg m 3 for high irrigation to 0 73 kg m 3 in 60 et irrigation treatment in egypt bozkurt et al 2006 reported iwue for corn ranging from 1 12 to 1 41 kg m 3 in semi arid region of turkey vories et al 2009 reported iwue for corn ranging from 1 0 to 1 5 kg m 3 the mid south arkansas region of the united states 4 conclusions the study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different row offsets with respect to drip tape position under different irrigation regimes the results of this study show that row placement does not significantly influence corn or grain sorghum yield regardless of irrigation rate harvest of individual row yield found that as the rows were moved the yield in rows moved closer to the tape would increase thereby offsetting the yield loss in the rows moved away from the tape overall this study suggests that while driver accuracy is important to maintain equal yields in neighboring crop rows the overall yields are affected more by irrigation and climatic conditions and not by the row offsets with

introduction subsurface drip irrigation sdi is a micro irrigation method gaining popularity in arid and semi arid regions around the world in the united states of america u s a lamm et al 2012 reported that acreage under sdi systems increased from 164 000 to 260 000 ha from 2003 to 2008 ayars et al 2015 reported increase in use of sdi systems on commercial horticulture farms in california u

comparison to center pivot lepa and spray irrigation systems under limited irrigation conditions the authors concluded that sdi system was best suited for limited irrigation conditions of semi arid southern great plains of the united states however crop management irrigation scheduling and irrigation rates are important to achieve the greater yield goals at lower water usage bresler 1978 bozkurt et al 2006 payero et al 2009 bordovsky and mustian 2010 therefore more agronomic research is required to perfect the sdi systems for individual crops lamm et al 2012 some of the direct advantages of sdi system include efficient supply of water by eliminating runoff and deep percolation sub surface fertilization reduced inter row weed pressure lower energy cost and automation lamm and camp 2007 conversely disadvantages of sdi system include smaller wetting pattern restricted root distribution water filtration issues rodent damage difficulty in monitoring of irrigation fewer tillage options and high initial costs lamm and camp 2007 in sdi water is applied underground and is seldom seen at the surface therefore row placement becomes important to ensure plant roots have easy access to water bozkurt et al 2006 bordovsky and mustian 2010 bordovsky and mustian 2010 noted that crop row placement relative to sdi drip tape can be difficult in a typical alternate row sdi drip tape installation bozkurt et al 2006 reported significant effect of row spacing across lateral tape on corn yield in sdi the authors reported increase in grain yield of corn as the rows were moved closer to the tape in this study yields were also proportional to the amount of irrigation supplied grabow et al 2006 reported dampening of soil moisture to the crop row as the distance of crop row increased from the drip tape an inadvertent shift in annual crop row relative to the drip tape could result in uneven distribution of water to neighboring crop rows due to smaller wetting patterns bordovsky and mustian 2010 visual observation for consistent row placement above the drip tape in sdi cannot be relied upon for consistency of optimum crop row placement this is important as the decision regarding spacing of drip tape has to be taken before planting and cannot be changed once the crop is growing initial research conducted in the u s high plains region by lamm 2001 used permanent raised beds to maintain accurate placements of the crop row however this requires the beds to be maintained through tillage and presents challenges for narrow row crop production such as wheat which is commonly irrigated in rotation with row crops issues regarding installation of drip tape as well as planting of crop rows can be overcome by real time kinematics rtk the common utilization of rtk guidance allows for precision return accuracy but there is limited data to determine if this level of precision is needed for corn and grain sorghum the main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of offset row placement on yield of corn and grain sorghum over sdi tape under different irrigation conditions the hypothesis of this research was that as the rows are moved from optimum placements yields would decline as a function of distances away from this equidistance placement the findings from this study will add to the understanding of corn and grain sorghum row spacing for sdi systems in similar agro climatic conditions around the world 2 materials and methods the experiment was conducted at oklahoma panhandle research and extension center 36 35 51 n 101 37 7 w oklahoma u s a the 30 year 1981 2010 mean annual temperature and rainfall is 13 4 c and 435 mm respectively us climate data website 2017 about 70 of the total rainfall is received from may to september which is also the main growing season in the region the elevation of this site from the mean sea level is about 1006 m the major soil type at the study site was gruver clay loam fine mixed superactive mesic aridic paleustoll which consists of a deep about 2 0 m soil profile the sdi system installed at the center was used for this study the sdi tape was buried 30 cm below the surface and spaced 153 cm apart such that each tape was supplying water to two crop rows when planted at 76 cm row spacing the tape contained emitters 60 cm apart along the length of the tape designed to supply 0 68 l per hour at 68 kpa allowing for 41 6 l per minute lpm being supplied to each zone which are 192 m long and 18 m wide 0 35 ha pressure was adjusted to 89 6 kpa at the inlet of each zone such that instantaneous flow rates of 53 lpm were achieved on each zone which allowed for application rates of 153 lpm ha 1 the instantaneous flow was evaluated periodically with manual observations of the flow meters model 36m251t netifimusa fresno ca u s a the flow meters were installed at the inlet of each zone and included totalizers which were used to determine the total water applied during the season the drip tape was installed using real time kinematic global positioning rtk gps guidance therefore all planting was conducted using this technology to place rows in desired locations relative to drip tape a total of 9 irrigation zones were involved in this study grain sorghum corn and wheat were rotated annually such that each crop was planted on three consecutive zones corn was planted into sorghum stubble sorghum was planted into wheat stubble and wheat was planted immediately after corn harvest this was done to allow for more successful no till management to minimize pest pressure however as mentioned earlier this study focused on corn and grain sorghum and the wheat crop simply served as a rotation crop the experimental design was a randomized complete block design with 4 replicates and 5 treatments the treatment structure was imposed in 3 zones planted to corn and 3 zones planted to grain sorghum the zones received irrigation at high medium and low irrigation rates because irrigation was not replicated it was treated as an experimental condition and not a treatment factor in anova analysis each plot was 4 57 m 6 rows wide and 9 15 m long the treatments consisted of crop row to drip lateral offsets of 0 8 15 23 and 38 cm fig 1 shows the crop row arrangement with respect to the drip tape normal row spacing where drip tape is in middle of two crops rows represent 0 cm offset the crop rows ran parallel to drip tape in east west direction therefore the north row was getting closer to the tape with increasing offset corn was planted on 5 may in 2014 21 april in 2015 and 15 april in 2016 in three zones corn hybrid pioneer 1768amx was planted in 2014 and 2015 whereas corn hybrid pioneer 1625 was planted in 2016 grain sorghum was planted on 6 june 2014 1 june 2015 and 8 june 2016 in 3 zones sorghum hybrid pioneer 84g62 was planted during all three years of study figs 2 and 3 show the irrigation applied rainfall received each month all corn plots received 8 cm of pre plant irrigation in 2014 and 2015 and 5 cm in 2016 post planting irrigation was initiated for the corn on 5 june 2014 4 june 2015 and 12 may 2016 irrigation in sorghum was initiated on 19 june in 2014 26 june in 2015 and 5 july in 2016 irrigation was terminated at the development of black layer for both crops therefore corn received the last irrigation of the season on 26 august 2014 25 august 2015 and 24 august 2016 the last irrigation event of the season for grain sorghum was on 11 september in 2014 28 september 2015 and 9 september 2016 in 2014 and 2015 evapotranspiration et was estimated by the aquaplanner amarillo tx u s a available at www aquaplanner net irrigation scheduling program the aquaplanner scheduling program utilizes a water balance approach to estimate soil water deficit and schedules irrigation events to minimize runoff and drainage while maintaining an allowable water deficient within the rooting zone if irrigation capacity is sufficient to do so although the details are proprietary the commercially available product utilizes an fao 56 et model soil hydraulic properties of the soil mapping unit as provided by ssurgo database and weather data from the u s national weather service in 2016 the mesonet oklahoma mesonet ok u s a irrigation scheduling tool was used in combination with adjustments made based on work conducted by gatlin 2014 the mesonet uses the asce penman monteith equation asce 2005 to calculate et the specific details of the mesonet et product description are provided by sutherland et al 2005 the minimum crop coefficient used by the mesonet during the initial growth phase for corn and sorghum is 0 48 and 0 36 respectively these values were reduced to 0 04 during the initial phase 30 days after planting because of the lack of surface wetting when using sdi in each year the high irrigation regime was irrigated to replace daily et or at a maximum irrigation rate of 1 0 cm per day in 2014 and 2015 and 0 9 cm in 2016 these maximum daily irrigation rates were used because irrigation capacities in the region are seldom above these daily rates during the initial phase of the crop production period irrigation was applied when the soil water deficit was greater than 0 5 cm since the last irrigation event the remaining two zones in each crop received irrigation equal to 75 medium and 50 low of the maximum daily rate irrigation was delayed when rainfall was anticipated to allow for optimum rainfall capture prior to the growing season 3 soil cores were collected from each irrigation zone to assess soil water status and pre irrigation water was applied to insure field capacity in the surface 100 cm prior to planting both corn and sorghum received starter fertilizer of 3 3 l ha 1 of ammonium phosphate 10 34 0 in row at planting every year year 2014 did not receive in season nitrogen applications because soil test no3 n plus nh4 n in the surface 30 cm of soil was 200 kg n ha 1 both crops received in season fertilization in 2015 and 2016 corn received 34 kg n ha 1 as urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 liquid fertilizer injected into the irrigation system weekly for 8 weeks starting on 15 june sorghum received 34 kg n ha 1 as uan liquid fertilizer injected into the irrigation system weekly for 6 weeks starting on 8 july total seasonal application of n was 269 kg n ha 1 in corn and 202 kg n ha 1 in sorghum in 2016 weekly fertigation of corn was initiated on 10 june and was applied for 8 weeks and fertigation in grain sorghum was initiated on 30 june and applied for 6 weeks corn and sorghum both received pesticide applications to control weeds and insects in accordance with oklahoma cooperative extension service guidelines corn grain yield was collected at maturity on 8 october 2014 1 october 2015 and 5 october 2016 sorghum yields were collected at maturity on 15 october 2014 14 october 2015 and 29 october 2016 harvesting was done using a kincaid 8 xp small plot combine in 2014 the combined harvest the center 2 rows simultaneously from each plot in 2015 and 2016 the rows were harvested as individual rows such that the distribution of yield between rows could be utilized therefore data presented allows us to look at the average yield for the two rows as effected by their place over the tape in each year of the study however the distribution of yield between the two rows can only be evaluated in 2015 and 2016 irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated by dividing grain yield with total irrigation supplied for the growing season analysis of variance anova to evaluate treatment effects of whole plot yield and the distribution of yield to the northern row row moving closer to tape as a function of offset was conducted using sas proc glimmix sas institute 2008 3 results and discussion analysis of variation for whole plot corn yield showed no interaction between the offset treatment and the irrigation regime or year therefore offset treatment effects were analyzed across year and irrigation regime this analysis showed no significant impact of offset on yield fig 4 shows the treatment yields averaged across years for each irrigation regime the lack of significant difference among treatments demonstrates that row placement is not critical consideration when growing corn on sdi although irrigation was not a replicated treatment factor its impact on yield in each year is presented in fig 5 which shows that in 2014 yields increased with increasing irrigation from low to high this is similar to data reported by payero et al 2006 who found that more water yields larger biomass and larger biomass yields higher et rates in contrast in 2015 and 2016 there was little or no difference between the high and medium irrigation treatments the above average rainfall in 2015 fig 2 resulted in similar yet excellent corn yields especially at the medium and high regimes fig 4 in 2016 rainfall was only slightly above average fig 2 however et during reproductive growth of corn was above average as a result the corn yields were suppressed relative to the water available during this year from irrigation and rainfall the similarity in yields for the medium and high regimes are likely explained by observation made by traore et al 2000 who found that the harvest index of corn is affected by water stress when the stress occurred at flowering and that yields are significantly reduced specifically in 2016 the high irrigated treatment developed a large canopy under well watered conditions prior to reproductive growth this was followed by an increase in et beyond the irrigation rate limit set for this treatment which caused excessive stress on corn growing in this irrigation regime in contrast the corn grown in the medium irrigation regime endured water stress during vegetative growth and therefore had a visibly small canopy which caused this crop to be more efficient at utilizing available water for grain production analysis of variance for the grain sorghum yields resulted in no interaction between offset treatment year and irrigation regime furthermore as was found in the corn data no significant difference among offset treatments were observed fig 6 shows the treatment means for each irrigation regime when averaged across years although the irrigation regimes in this study were not replicated and served simply to provide alternative experimental conditions it is noteworthy to mention similarities in grain sorghum yields among the regimes fig 7 shows that the yields were often similar among the irrigation regimes in 2014 the low treatment produced average yields that were 17 less than those produced by the medium irrigation regime in 2015 and 2016 yields were similar among all irrigation regimes this was certainly due to the above average rainfall in 2015 however in 2016 the lack of yield response was in part due to greater bird damage in the high irrigation which was delayed in reaching physiological maturity it is also likely due to its ability to more rapidly recover from water stress after rainfall or irrigation as well as its ability to scavenge soil moisture from greater depths under limited irrigation conditions gatlin 2014 specifically early season water stress in the limited irrigation regimes low and medium allowed for more effective rooting and subsoil water extraction this combined with timely rainfall allowed for comparable yields to the fully irrigated regime the offset treatments influenced the distribution of corn yield between the two rows harvested the anova analyses showed no interaction between offset treatment and irrigation regime but there was an interaction between offset treatment and year therefore means presented in table 1 are separated by year for corn at 0 cm offsets both north and south row with respect to tape contributed similar amount 50 to total yield in both years however as the north corn row moved closer to the tape the percentage of yield it produced increased to 59 in 2016 significant differences were not observed in 2015 presumably because the above average rainfall reduced the importance of row placement in controlling water distribution in the soil anova analysis of grain sorghum data found no interaction among offset treatment and year or irrigation however offset treatment did significantly impact the distribution of yield between the two rows when averaged across year and irrigation regime the percentage of yield distributed to the northern grain sorghum rows increased as it moved closer to the tape table 1 this is similar to the observations made by bordovsky and mustian 2010 when irrigating cotton gossypium hirsutum l with rows offset from the tape they found that cotton rows moved closer to the tape showed an increase in yield while the rows moving further away produced a declining yield although soil moisture distribution data was not collected in this study previous studies conducted on soil moisture distribution along sdi tape have reported decline in soil moisture distribution with increasing distance from tape and that the decline was prominent with reducing irrigation supply grabow et al 2006 badr and abuarab 2013 therefore the yield declines from the crop rows as they move away from the drip tape were expected irrigation water use efficiency iwue was calculated by dividing yield with irrigation supplied fig 8 shows the average iwue of different offset treatments for each irrigation regime across the years irrigation water use efficiency in our study was lower than what reported for corn in the great plains region of the united states for example payero et al 2009 reported iwue efficiency of 7 09 kg m 3 for corn in nebraska u s a in contrast the iwue values calculated for grain sorghum under the low and medium irrigation were greater than those previously reported in fact colaizzi and schneider 2005 reported iwue of 2 48 kg m 3 for grain sorghum under sdi systems in the southern great plains of the united states higher iwue in nebraska could be attributed to lower et demands in higher latitude region of the united states besides iwue for corn in this study was higher than those reported in other semi arid areas of the world for example el hendawy et al 2008 reported iwue ranging from 1 2 kg m 3 for high irrigation to 0 73 kg m 3 in 60 et irrigation treatment in egypt bozkurt et al 2006 reported iwue for corn ranging from 1 12 to 1 41 kg m 3 in semi arid region of turkey vories et al 2009 reported iwue for corn ranging from 1 0 to 1 5 kg m 3 the mid south arkansas region of the united states 4 conclusions the study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different row offsets with respect to drip tape position under different irrigation regimes the results of this study show that row placement does not significantly influence corn or grain sorghum yield regardless of irrigation rate harvest of individual row yield found that as the rows were moved the yield in rows moved closer to the tape would increase thereby offsetting the yield loss in the rows moved away from the tape overall this study suggests that while driver accuracy is important to maintain equal yields in neighboring crop rows the overall yields are affected more by irrigation and climatic conditions and not by the row offsets with

11388,as part of conjunctive water resource management on farm reservoirs have been constructed to address declines in the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer the primary source of irrigation for most of the row crops grown in eastern arkansas these reservoirs and their associated infrastructure represent significant investments in financial and natural resources and may cause producers to incur costs associated with foregone crop production and long term maintenance a better understanding of past trends in reservoir construction can allow for more efficient resource allocation towards future adoption of this practice thus an analysis of reservoir construction trends in the grand prairie gp critical groundwater area and cache river cr critical groundwater area was conducted between 1996 and 2015 on average 16 5 and 4 1 reservoirs were constructed per year corresponding to cumulative new reservoir surface areas of 161 49 and 60 18 ha yr 1 for gp and cr respectively in terms of reservoir locations relative to aquifer status after 1996 84 5 of 309 reservoirs constructed in gp and 91 0 of 78 in cr were located in areas with remaining saturated aquifer thicknesses of 50 or less the majority of new reservoirs 74 in gp and 63 in cr were constructed on previously productive cropland the next most common land use representing 11 and 15 of new reservoirs constructed in gp and cr respectively was the combination of a field edge and a ditch stream or other low lying area less than 10 of post 1996 reservoirs were constructed on predominately low lying land and the use of this land cover decreased in both critical groundwater areas during the past 20 years a reservoir footprint analysis indicated that 85 of the typical reservoir system consists of the reservoir pond itself with the remaining 15 of land area consisting of tailwater recovery ditches and other associated features the disparities in reservoir construction rates locations and prior land uses between the two critical groundwater areas is likely due to groundwater declines being first observed in gp as well as the existence of two large scale river diversion projects under construction in gp that feature on farm storage as a means to offset groundwater use results of this analysis can be used in the development of targeted resource allocation initiatives and conservation efforts in critical groundwater areas and other similarly water scarce regions keywords aquifer depletion irrigation on farm reservoirs surface water land use change 1 introduction in the u s the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa as part of the mississippi embayment me aquifer system is the second most utilized aquifer in terms of irrigation withdrawals and the most utilized aquifer in terms of international virtual water transfer marston et al 2015 the lower mississippi river valley lmrv the region overlaying the me has over four million ha of irrigated cropland that depends mainly on the mrvaa for water supply massey et al 2017 within the lmrv in the state of arkansas there are two million ha of irrigated cropland nearly 80 of which is comprised of a rice soybean rotation usda nass 2014 thus agricultural water resource management in the lmrv impacts not only the u s but the many nations that receive rice exported from the region groundwater based irrigation has been a part of the agricultural landscape in east central arkansas since the early 20th century because of the discovery that rice was ideally suited to the soils of the region due to a shallow clay layer that held water at the surface and prevented percolation to deeper layers vories and evett 2014 gates 2005 in spite of the more than 1000 mm yr 1 average annual precipitation in this region only half occurred during the growing season evett et al 2003 henry et al 2016 furthermore unlike upland crops such as corn or soybean rice required flooded fields throughout the growing season so that irrigation was necessary for successful cultivation evett et al 2003 gates 2005 this early adoption and subsequent extensive development of irrigation in eastern arkansas vories and evett 2010 was facilitated by the easily accessible mrvaa which underlies most of the area fig 1 the mrvaa is a sand and gravel aquifer overlain in most parts by a confining clay layer of varying thickness hart et al 2008 renken 1998 the hydrologic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 60 to 75 m day 1 west of the crowley s ridge outcrop fig 1 and decreases to the southwest where it ranges from 30 to 60 m day 1 the thickness of the mrvaa is spatially variable ranging from about 23 46 m in the north to 15 46 m in the west central area and becoming thinner in the south at 15 23 m renken 1998 the confining unit also varies in thickness throughout eastern arkansas being thinner in the northeast 3 12 m and thicker in the southwest 9 21 m because of this confining layer recharge from surface water and precipitation to the arkansas portion of the mrvaa is limited occurring mainly where the layer itself is not present or where larger rivers have incised the confining layer renken 1998 the lower arkansas river fig 1 and the lower white river which forms the eastern boundary of arkansas county fig 1 both provide recharge to the aquifer in this way water quality in the mrvaa is fairly good relative to drinking water standards although hardness and higher concentrations of iron etc limit domestic and industrial use but generally do not adversely affect irrigation use kresse et al 2014 from the initial 405 ha of rice harvested in 1905 rice cultivation in arkansas quickly expanded reaching 50 000 ha by 1916 and exceeding 100 000 ha by 1942 usda nass 2018 as early as 1915 the us army corps of engineers usace noted that groundwater withdrawals from the mrvaa in portions of eastern arkansas exceeded recharge to the aquifer gates 2005 this was recognized officially by the arkansas state planning board in 1939 vories and evett 2014 in spite of these early signs of aquifer depletion irrigated agriculture continued to expand so that by 1979 there were 658 000 ha of irrigated land in arkansas representing 35 of the total cropland in the state u s dept of commerce 1982 of this irrigated area 94 was comprised of rice and about 19 of the soybean now grown in rotation with rice tacker et al 2010 in 1980 1981 the southern us experienced severe drought andreadis et al 2005 resulting in previously non irrigated crops in eastern arkansas such as soybean becoming increasingly irrigated tacker et al 2010 between 1984 and 1998 there were two periods of rapid expansion of both farmland and irrigation in arkansas fig 2 with irrigated area increasing 47 between 1984 and 1988 and 42 between 1994 and 1998 while rice area showed small increases 15 and 17 during these two periods irrigated soybean area increased 66 and 55 respectively fig 2 this rapid expansion of irrigated crops in the mrvaa region coincided with noticeable declines in groundwater czarnecki and schrader 2013 tacker et al 2010 so that in 1998 the grand prairie area in east central arkansas which includes lonoke prairie and arkansas counties fig 1 was designated a critical groundwater area cga anrc 2014 later as another cone of depression deepened north and east of the grand prairie the cache river area which includes craighead poinsett cross and st francis counties received the same critical designation in 2009 fig 1 as noted previously agriculture in the mrvaa region has been comprised mainly of rice and soybean and has relied heavily on groundwater based irrigation clark et al 2011 marston et al 2015 unlike the dry climate agricultural areas in the western u s where large scale irrigation projects are common formal irrigation districts in arkansas did not appear until recently vories and evett 2014 as a result the development and expansion of irrigation in arkansas both from groundwater and surface sources has been primarily driven by crop producers in 1984 the white river irrigation district wrid was formed by farmers in the grand prairie region to gain assistance in dealing with worsening groundwater conditions tacker et al 2010 efforts to conjunctively manage water resources in these cgas have been led by state and federal agencies such as the arkansas natural resources commission anrc and the usda natural resources conservation service usda nrcs these efforts have included the development and storage of surface water resources gates 2005 prince czarnecki et al 2016 conservation practices to improve irrigation efficiency young et al 2004 as well as cost sharing programs to assist producers with construction and implementation usda nrcs 2011 development of surface water resources for irrigation has occurred mainly in the grand prairie cga hereafter gp which is bordered by the lower reaches of the arkansas and white rivers two large scale surface water diversion projects have been planned for this region anrc 2014 and are being implemented in two parts construction of on farm reservoirs and expansion of the existing watershed drainage network to connect them and construction of two pumping stations to divert excess flow from the rivers to the supply network robinson et al 2003 tacker et al 2010 although neither pumping station has been completed an estimated 243 new on farm reservoirs were built in the wrid area in anticipation of this surface water supply with plans for over 300 more to be constructed usace 2014 the bayou meto water management project will divert water from the arkansas river and deliver it to western parts of prairie lonoke and arkansas counties the grand prairie area demonstration project will divert water from the white river and deliver it to the eastern parts of the same counties hill et al 2006 in the cache river cga hereafter cr no large scale diversion projects have been planned because the two major rivers in that region the cache and the l anguille lack the excess streamflow to support such projects anrc 2014 aside from the gp reservoirs built in anticipation of surface water deliveries reservoir construction has largely been driven by producers both with and without cost share assistance from state and federal agencies prince czarnecki et al 2016 usda nrcs 2011 to better understand the current status of reservoir construction a remote sensing inventory was conducted in both cgas by yaeger et al 2017 as of 2015 there were 632 on farm irrigation reservoirs located in gp and 143 reservoirs in cr although gp had a smaller proportion of potentially irrigated cropland relative to the total study area than cr there were 4 5 times as many reservoirs and reservoir surface area in gp than in cr because aquifer depletion has been an issue for producers in gp for longer than their counterparts in cr the need for alternatives to groundwater based irrigation in gp has also had a longer history this in addition to the planned surface water diversion projects in gp could explain some of the differences in the numbers of on farm reservoirs between the two cgas depending on the prior land use reservoir construction may result in significant losses in terms of foregone crop production given the available financial incentive programs usda nrcs 2011 and benefits from surface water use anrc 2014 losses from crop production could have contributed to the relatively small number of reservoirs that were present overall in 2015 this explanation has been explored theoretically by several research groups two studies on the economic feasibility of irrigation reservoirs examined the costs of irrigating with surface water vs pumped groundwater in the grand prairie region harper et al 1989 shulstad et al 1985 they considered local yields construction operating costs and grain prices at the time but they did not account for cost sharing or other financial incentives it was found that on highly productive land with high grain prices only the larger 36 ha 1 2 5 m deep reservoirs were economically feasible water from small reservoirs 12 ha 1 m deep never cost less than groundwater even at lower yields and lower grain prices harper et al 1989 more recently another study in the arkansas mrvaa region found that the addition of cost sharing tax credits and environmental financial incentives to the cost benefit analysis of surface vs groundwater irrigation greatly improved the economic feasibility of using reservoir irrigation systems even for large values of foregone production bouldin et al 2004 studies using the arkansas specific marora economic model suggested that with limited groundwater availability use of on farm reservoirs and tailwater recovery systems for irrigation could improve profitability popp et al 2003 however when groundwater was plentiful financial incentives were needed to make these surface water irrigation sources economically feasible hill et al 2006 young et al 2004 solutions for alleviating aquifer depletion such as on farm irrigation reservoirs represent a significant outlay of both financial and physical resources knowing what worked in the past may allow for more efficient resource allocation efforts in the future with a better understanding of why where and to what extent the practice of on farm irrigation reservoir construction has been previously adopted in critical regions water resource managers government agencies etc may better direct their available resources to foster future adoption a first step towards this goal would be to examine the trends and patterns of reservoir development over the past 20 years comparing and contrasting between these two arkansas cgas with different levels of need saturated aquifer thickness remaining and incentives available surface water resources the overall aim of this work is to derive insights from the trends and patterns seen in past efforts which could then be used to assist decision making in future efforts the specific objectives of this study were 1 to identify patterns of reservoir construction over time in each cga and relate these to prior land use land cover 2 to quantify these patterns of reservoir construction in each cga in relation to their respective cones of depression and the expansion thereof 3 to estimate the total cropland taken out of production in each cga through analysis of the total reservoir footprint 2 data and methods a remote sensing inventory was carried out to obtain estimates of the number and surface area of reservoirs present in years of available data prior to 2015 then the depth to groundwater and saturated aquifer thickness were determined for all reservoirs along with prior land use land cover for those reservoirs constructed after 1996 the first available year of imagery lastly the total footprints of reservoirs constructed completely on productive cropland was determined and used to estimate the total land area taken out of production 2 1 data description this study utilized county scale national agricultural imagery program naip digital aerial orthoimagery from the usda geospatial data gateway direct data naip download https gdg sc egov usda gov gdghome directdownload aspx this full color imagery was available as geo referenced compressed county mosaics ccm and was only taken during the growing season may july of years 2015 2013 2010 2009 and 2006 the usda aerial photography field office apfo that maintains this data has specific standards for all naip images ensuring that they were acquired at a 1 m ground sample distance with a horizontal accuracy within 6 m of ground control points for 1996 the first year in the study apfo ccm orthoimagery of similar specifications to the naip orthoimagery was used these ccms were in black and white and not generally taken during the growing season but provided enough detail to differentiate water bodies from field and forest and were therefore deemed sufficient to determine whether or not a reservoir was present in a given location since the gap between the oldest aerial orthoimagery 1996 and the next oldest 2006 was larger than the gaps between other available years the historical imagery function in google earth was employed adding the year 2000 to the years of available imagery google earth utilized data from multiple sources including high resolution pan sharpened images from landsat 8 and digitalglobe satellites as well as geo referenced aerial imagery from the usgs and usda google earth imagery resolution varied from 15 m to 15 cm per pixel depending on the source the historical coverage for 2000 combined different sources and resolutions depending on the location was in black and white and not necessarily taken during the growing season but like the afpo ccms from 1996 was also deemed sufficient to determine reservoir presence interpolated groundwater surface maps were created from historical usgs well data available from the national water information system website http waterdata usgs gov ar nwis uv referred module gw for consistency all wells chosen to create the historical surfaces were from the mrvaa and had measurements taken for the same years during the 1996 2015 study to avoid influence of seasonal pumping on well data the depth measurements used were from february to june only anrc 2016 of the over 1000 available well locations 238 wells had available data in the years 2015 2012 2008 2004 2000 and 1996 the discrete measurements for each year were interpolated into six separate groundwater surface maps using the natural neighbor method in arcgis v 10 4 esri 2016 precipitation data for the past 20 years as well as the most recent 30 year normal precipitation for both cgas was obtained from the interpolated grid maps available from oregon state university s prism climate group http prism oregonstate edu the 30 year normal precipitation comprised the years 1981 2010 and was available at both annual and monthly timescales annual total precipitation was obtained for the study years 1996 2015 growing season precipitation was obtained by summing the monthly values of april through september in each year averaged precipitation for each cga over each timescale growing season and annual was then obtained for each of the four individual periods described in the next section 2 2 analysis of reservoir construction over time starting with 2015 the arcgis polygon reservoir layer of that year was renamed for and then superimposed on the orthoimagery of the previous available year for example a copy of the 2015 reservoir polygon layer was made designated as 2013 superimposed on the orthoimagery for 2013 and then edited as follows a systematic determination was made for each reservoir in the layer as to whether or not it was present in the year of interest if not the reservoir polygon was deleted and the year in which it would appear recorded in the database this year appeared designation was used instead of year of construction due to the time gaps between images in this way seven reservoir polygon shapefiles were created one for each year of available imagery 2015 2013 2010 2009 2006 2000 and 1996 the latitude and longitude of the centroid of each reservoir polygon was also recorded in each database table associated with the polygon shapefiles for use later in the comparison with depth to groundwater because the historical orthoimagery was not distributed evenly in time reservoir construction over the 20 study years was presented as an average rate per year between image years as well as a number of new reservoirs in each image year similarly total new reservoir area in each image year is also presented as an average value per year for each of the periods between one image and the next furthermore because the time between the more recent orthoimagery 2009 2015 was shorter 1 3 years than that between older 1996 2006 images 4 6 years the last four image years were combined into two periods so that reservoir rates and totals were calculated over the years 1996 2000 2000 2006 2006 2010 and 2010 2015 respectively 2 3 analysis of reservoirs in relation to the cone of depression modeled aquifer thickness estimates hart et al 2008 were obtained from the anrc for 220 wells within the mrvaa these were then interpolated into a continuous surface map of aquifer thickness using the same natural neighbor method as previously described the aforementioned 238 well locations were overlaid on this interpolated surface to obtain estimates of aquifer thickness at each location depth to groundwater measurements from each available year were subtracted from the aquifer thickness to obtain estimates of saturated thickness the ratio of saturated thickness to aquifer thickness is then the saturated percent of aquifer thickness the resulting discrete estimates of saturated percent of aquifer thickness were then interpolated into six continuous surface maps using the natural neighbor method these surfaces were then clipped to the shape of the two study areas and a pixel count was made for 30 and 20 saturated aquifer thickness given that the resolution of the surface maps was 30 m each pixel represented 0 9 ha allowing the pixel counts to be converted to areas to compare with reservoir area increases average rates of increase ha yr 1 for these areas in each cone of depression were also computed although the depth to groundwater sample periods were more evenly distributed through time than the reservoir imagery to determine the depth to groundwater and therefore saturated aquifer thickness at each reservoir location in the year that it appeared the reservoir centroid points for each image year were superimposed on the depth to groundwater map of the same year because the years for which depth to groundwater was available were roughly four years apart and reservoir imagery was available at irregular intervals this was only the case for the years 2000 and 2015 for the other years in the study reservoir image years were paired with the closest groundwater data year so that reservoirs appearing in years 2006 2009 2010 and 2013 were paired with depth to groundwater data for years 2004 2008 2008 and 2012 respectively 2 4 analysis of reservoirs in relation to land use change to determine the prior land use land cover for each new reservoir the individual reservoir shapefiles for each year of imagery were superimposed on the previous image year and the land use noted in the attribute table of that reservoir layer for example the year 2000 reservoir shapefile with only the reservoir perimeter visible was superimposed on the year 1996 imagery reservoirs appearing in 2000 were highlighted and the previous land use visible through the reservoir outline was noted this process was repeated until all reservoirs appearing after 1996 had a prior land use designation which was then compiled with the full reservoir database for each cga prior land uses included cropland edge of field cropland strips wooded low lying land or some combination thereof because there was often more than one land use land cover in place prior to reservoir construction land use designations were divided into four general categories cropland only cropland combination field edge combination and low lying land the cropland combination was defined as consisting of field portions 10 50 cropland and some other non agricultural land use the field edge combination was defined as consisting of field edge strips 10 cropland and an adjoining stream or ditch 2 5 analysis of reservoir area footprint a reservoir area footprint analysis was conducted on a random sampling of all new reservoirs where the prior land use was 100 cropland to avoid biasing the footprint analysis towards reservoirs which were constructed along with a corresponding tailwater recovery ditch as opposed to those reservoirs which utilized an existing drainage network for tailwater recovery each cropland designated reservoir was assigned a random number id and the list of ids was then sorted by associated reservoir size for this analysis the reservoir areas were binned according to the histograms presented in yaeger et al 2017 and then 15 of the reservoirs in each size category 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 30 60 60 100 and 100 ha were selected a polygon was drawn around each reservoir chosen encompassing both the tailwater recovery ditch and levees to represent the total land area taken out of production to construct that reservoir the process was repeated for both cgas as a first estimate of this area footprint only ditches etc in the immediate vicinity of generally parallel to the reservoir were included in this polygon reservoir area was then plotted against total land taken out of production for that reservoir and a linear regression was fitted for each cga the equations of these lines fig 3 were then used to estimate the total land area taken out of production in each cga 3 results 3 1 trends in reservoir construction over time between 1996 and 2015 309 new reservoirs were constructed in gp and 78 new reservoirs were constructed in cr this represents roughly half of the total numbers of reservoirs present in 2015 the majority of these new reservoirs 66 in gp and 62 in cr were built during the first 10 years of the 20 year study 1996 2006 in gp there was a noticeable increase in reservoir construction between 2000 and 2006 where an average of 23 reservoirs per year were built table 1 in contrast a steady average of five reservoirs per year were constructed over the first 10 years of the study in cr table 2 in both cgas reservoir construction rates declined in the second 10 years compared to the first 10 although in cr a slight increase was observed in the most recent period of the study table 2 in terms of new reservoir area the periods with the highest average rates of reservoir construction also coincided with the highest average rates of new reservoir area per year for gp table 1 this was not the case in cr where large reservoirs that appeared in 2013 brought the average rate for 2010 2015 to 75 ha per year when only 4 reservoirs per year were constructed on average during that time period earlier reservoirs in cr showed more consistency in size as was seen in gp from 1996 to 2000 73 ha per year of new reservoir area was added corresponding to the highest average rate of construction table 2 about half the total number of new reservoirs in each cga appeared after 1996 in gp this represents about one third of the total reservoir area while in cr it represents over one half of the 2015 total trends in precipitation both mean annual total and growing season are also presented in tables 1 and 2 average rainfall amounts differed little between the cgas with gp receiving slightly more annual rainfall and slightly less growing season precipitation than cr the 30 year normal for annual rainfall was 1259 mm yr 1 for gp and 1242 mm yr 1 for cr for growing season precipitation it was 566 mm and 576 mm respectively average rainfall over the 20 year study was close to the 30 year normal with gp receiving 1252 mm yr 1 of precipitation and 573 mm over the growing season while cr received 1241 mm yr 1 and 590 mm respectively in both cgas the first 10 years were drier than the second 10 years both annually and during the growing season however a similar trend was not observed in reservoir sizes in gp the average new reservoir surface areas were consistent over the last 20 years showing little variation within or between periods table 1 in cr the average new reservoir sizes were larger than those in gp and varied more between and within periods table 2 reservoir sizes in cr were largest and varied the most within the earliest and the most recent periods in the middle two periods from 2000 to 2010 reservoir sizes were smaller and more consistently sized similar to the ones constructed during all periods in gp 3 2 trends in reservoir construction in relation to the cone of depression fig 4 shows the areal expansion of the two cones of depression in terms of saturated percent of aquifer thickness along with the expansion of reservoir construction over the 20 year study the deepest portions of the cones of depression spanned multiple counties in both cgas in 1996 fig 4a but were more concentrated across the three counties in gp by 2015 the deepest portions in gp were centered in prairie and lonoke counties only in cr however the deepest portions of the cone had expanded to cover large sections of craighead poinsett and cross counties fig 4c the large increase in reservoirs constructed from 2000 to 2006 in gp was for the most part evenly distributed over areas where only 20 40 of the aquifer thickness was still saturated in the last 10 years 2006 2015 there was a slight shift in reservoir construction towards regions where the saturated percent of aquifer thickness had shrunk to 10 30 although new reservoirs still appeared in areas where the saturated aquifer thickness was 40 table 3 in cr this shift in recent reservoir construction toward areas with less aquifer saturation was more clearly evident reservoirs appearing in cr in the first 10 years 1996 2006 covered a wide range of aquifer saturation 10 80 while the most recent 2010 2015 reservoirs appeared in regions where the saturated aquifer thickness was 40 or less table 4 a comparison of the cumulative area expansion of the total area 30 and 20 of saturated aquifer thickness with that of new reservoir area is presented next fig 5 in gp where aquifer drawdown has occurred over a longer historical period the area of 30 saturated aquifer thickness approximately doubled from 46 500 ha to 98 100 ha between 1996 and 2008 the increase in area then leveled off ending at 111 000 ha in 2015 fig 5a in cr the same area of that cone of depression tripled from 26 600 ha to 82 400 ha between 1996 and 2008 then as in gp the area increase leveled off ending at 99 000 ha in 2015 fig 5b the pattern for the areas of most severe depletion where 20 of the aquifer thickness was still saturated was slightly different but the general trends remained the same in both cgas growth of the center area of the cone of depression was rapid at first and leveled off in the last measurement period 2012 2015 in gp this growth started later 2000 than it did in cr 1996 and did not cover as large an area even by the end of the 20 years fig 5a and b the cumulative reservoir area expansion in gp mirrored the expansion of the area where 30 of the aquifer thickness is saturated while the difference between the beginning value 6235 ha and ending 9336 ha was not as large the pattern of rapid growth in the first 10 years followed by a leveling off in growth was similar to that of the cone of depression fig 5a this was not the case in cr where reservoir surface area doubled between 1996 in 2015 going from 884 ha to 2019 ha respectively furthermore there was a slight increase in reservoir area expansion between 2010 and 2015 fig 5b this is more clearly illustrated by the rates of area expansion which is described next after comparing cumulative area expansion trends in the rates of area expansion of both the cones of depression and reservoir surface were examined fig 6 in gp the rate of expansion of area with 30 of saturated aquifer thickness showed a stepped decrease over time fig 6a while in cr this rate increased at first then showed a stepped decrease fig 6b the patterns for the rates of expansion of the most severely depleted areas where 20 of the aquifer remained saturated were similar in both cgas increasing until 2012 then decreasing thereafter the patterns for reservoir area expansion rates however were noticeably different in gp rates of reservoir area expansion increased in the first half of the study years peaking at 213 ha yr 1 in the 2000 2006 period and then declined in the second half fig 6a in contrast reservoir area expansion rates in cr declined from an initial 73 ha yr 1 for the 1996 2000 period to a low of 37 ha yr 1 from 2006 to 2010 then doubled in the 2010 2015 period to 75 ha yr 1 fig 6b 3 3 trends in reservoir construction in relation to prior land use and land cover the majority of new reservoirs in both cgas were constructed completely on land removed from crop production tables 5 and 6 in gp this was nearly 75 of the new reservoirs while in cr about 63 of new reservoirs were constructed on land taken out of production another 20 of new reservoirs in gp and 27 in cr utilized natural features such as streams ditches and low lying wooded or ponded areas in combination with either edge of field cropland strips or larger portions of crop fields lastly only a small portion of new reservoirs in both cgas were created from the flooding of low lying areas although this was less common in gp at 6 of new reservoirs than in cr at 10 these were mainly the oldest new reservoirs which appeared between 1996 and 2006 after 2006 this prior land cover was rarely seen tables 5 and 6 for reservoirs constructed entirely on cropland tables 5 and 6 the number of new reservoirs and the amount of new reservoir area added were in the same range for all time periods in both cgas except for the 2000 2006 period in gp where these were more than double that of the three other time periods the overall trend for both combination categories cropland and edge of field cropland strips was different than that of the cropland only category of new reservoirs in gp the number of new reservoirs partially constructed on productive farmland was highest in the first time period 1996 2000 and decreased thereafter table 5 in cr however this number doubled in the 2000 2006 period then declined in subsequent time periods table 6 lastly in both cgas the second 10 years of the study showed the smallest number of new reservoirs constructed either fully or partially on non agricultural land compared to the first 10 years 3 4 trends in reservoir area footprints total land taken out of production because cropland was the prior land use for most of the new reservoirs in the two cgas an analysis of the total area footprint of reservoirs constructed completely on productive farmland provided a first pass estimate of the total land area taken out of production this represented 2676 ha in gp and 855 ha in cr in both cgas reservoir surface area made up about 85 of the total area footprint the patterns seen in these total values were also reflected in the trends in general the average area footprint did not vary much between time periods which mirrored the consistency seen previously in the prior land use trends for cropland only reservoirs tables 5 and 6 in gp the average area footprints were both smaller and varied less between time periods than those in cr within each time period in gp the average area footprint size was fairly consistent table 5 although in the last 10 years it was slightly larger 12 ha than in the first 10 11 ha in cr the average area footprint sizes were more varied within each time period table 6 in both cgas however the variability around the average footprint size was the same order of magnitude as the average tables 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of broad trends in reservoir construction the patterns of reservoir construction where how many and the average rates of construction differed between the two cgas there were four times as many new reservoirs built in gp over the last 20 years than in cr one explanation for this disparity is that the large surface water diversion projects planned and under construction in gp provided an added incentive to producers beyond cost sharing and may have helped overcome land owner producer reluctance to take land out of crop production reservoir construction related to these diversion projects mainly occurred between 2000 and 2006 tony stevenson usda nrcs personal communication 2016 this coincided with the time period where the most new reservoirs appeared and new reservoir area was added per year in gp while the same economic incentive programs such as the nrcs environmental quality incentives program usda nrcs 2011 were available to producers in both cgas no surface water diversion projects are planned for cr owing to the lack of large rivers with enough excess streamflow for irrigation supply anrc 2014 another explanation for these differences may be that in some parts of gp surface water may be the only viable source of irrigation water since aquifer declines there have occurred for a much longer time the slight increase in reservoir construction and large increase in average size that was observed in recent years in cr but not in gp may be an indication of the effects of aquifer declines in this cga being experienced more commonly this was corroborated by the new reservoir location and land use data which showed more of the newest reservoirs in cr being constructed on productive cropland in areas of greatest decline than were older new reservoirs further analysis of the trends in reservoir placement in both cgas also suggested that the effects of aquifer depletion have been experienced in gp for some time but only recently in cr in gp in all four time periods most reservoirs were constructed in places where 10 40 of the aquifer remained saturated but with most construction occurring between the years 2000 and 2006 the timing of this construction corresponded to the expectation of supplemental irrigation water from large diversion projects designed to provide surface water to areas of most aquifer depletion there was a different pattern in cr for the first 10 years reservoirs were constructed over a wide range of saturated aquifer thicknesses in the last 10 years however there was a discernible shift to regions where the aquifer was less saturated 40 this suggested that reservoir construction here may likely be motivated by recent aquifer declines and the resulting difficulty obtaining groundwater the smaller number of reservoirs built in the last 10 years compared to the first 10 could indicate possible reluctance to take land out of production unless an extreme need for irrigation water necessitated it in the discussion of reservoir construction in relation to the cones of depression it must be noted that the cones of depression themselves have been expanding along with reservoir surface area over the past 20 years however closer examination showed that the expansion in the cones of depression both the cumulative area and the rate of area expansion has leveled off in recent years some explanation for this is that groundwater usage may have declined since 2000 due to implementation of conservation measures such as tailwater recovery reservoirs and polytubing irrigation as well as reduced transmissivity to wells from loss of aquifer saturated thickness czarnecki and schrader 2013 groundwater usage may also have decreased due to higher than average rainfall during the growing season from 2006 through 2015 tables 3 and 4 which would have reduced the need for supplemental irrigation an increase in groundwater levels observed in usgs monitoring wells in the region during this period czarnecki and schrader 2013 would also explain some of the slowing of the expansion of the cones of depression the rates of reservoir area expansion have leveled off in gp but not in cr instead there was a slight increase in total reservoir area due to a recent spate of construction including a very large 100 ha reservoir in the northern reaches of the present cr cone of depression where more than 10 of aquifer saturation has been lost since 2004 4 2 cropland taken out of production reservoir area footprints the reservoir footprint and prior land use analyses showed that while the majority of new reservoirs were built on cropland producers tended to minimize this by utilizing existing infrastructure and natural hydrologic features where possible in both cgas about half of the reservoirs present in 2015 were also present prior to 1996 as a result most of the available low lying land suitable for reservoir construction had been already been used especially in gp furthermore environmental conservation policies enacted in the latter part of the 20th century likely restricted the utilization of low lying land for irrigation water storage still after cropland only the next most common prior land use for new reservoirs was some combination of cropland or edge of field cropland and a hydrologic feature such as a stream ditch or low lying area in proximity to the agricultural land for reservoirs constructed completely on cropland reservoir surface area was approximately 85 of the total reservoir footprint with reservoir levees tailwater recovery ditches pumping plant and other associated infrastructure making up the remaining 15 as noted previously this area footprint analysis only took into account ditches etc immediately around the reservoir which was the case for the majority of sampled reservoirs however in a few cases the reservoir was associated with an extensive network of tailwater recovery ditches that bordered both the reservoir and several nearby fields this land area technically is part of the reservoir system and so the estimates of total land taken out of production presented in this paper may be slightly lower than was actual nevertheless the majority of reservoirs even those built on cropland taken out of production utilized existing drainage networks both natural and constructed thus minimizing where possible foregone crop production for perspective in 2015 the amount of potentially irrigated cropland in gp was 293 394 ha and in cr was 192 953 ha yaeger et al 2017 the total land taken out of production in the construction of these cropland only reservoirs represented 0 9 of potentially irrigated land in gp and 0 4 of it in cr 4 3 implications for conjunctive water management the construction of on farm irrigation reservoirs is an important aspect of the on going efforts to conjunctively manage water resources in these two cgas while on farm reservoirs provide the benefits of capture and storage of off season rainfall field runoff and local streamflow they also represent large costs in terms of construction maintenance and foregone production with construction cost sharing opportunities and other financial incentives equally available between the two cgas on farm irrigation reservoirs were more readily adopted with the promise of a guaranteed supply of surface water throughout the growing season via large river diversions this suggests that in critical areas without excess surface water resources different financial incentives some combination of land and water conservation programs or different conjunctive use projects such as in stream weirs may be needed in order to alleviate aquifer depletion specifically for this study the results of this work show that conjunctive water resource management will need to be implemented differently in the two cgas and suggest the need in cr for a more comprehensive water resource assessment 5 conclusions in the context of conjunctive water management the broad trends outlined in this study are a first step towards a better understanding of why and to what extent the construction of on farm reservoirs has been adopted in a region of aquifer depletion using remote sensing data and usgs historical groundwater measurements it was found that in both cgas approximately half of the reservoirs appearing by 2015 were constructed since 1996 and the majority of the new reservoirs in each cga were constructed between 1996 and 2006 in gp the fastest rate of reservoir area expansion occurred between 2000 and 2006 with 23 reservoirs per year on average constructed for 213 ha yr 1 reservoir surface area this was driven largely by the expected supply of surface water from nearby diversion projects under construction in cr the fastest rate of construction occurred over the entire first half of the study where on average 5 reservoirs per year were constructed for 61 ha yr 1 surface area in this cga there was also a slight increase in construction between 2010 and 2015 likely due to the effects of the expansion of the aquifer cone of depression affecting groundwater pumping as had already been experienced in gp most new reservoirs 74 in gp and 63 in cr were constructed on cropland and for those reservoirs the reservoir surface area was about 85 of the total land area taken out of production results of the analyses suggest that in the absence of great need i e the lack of a viable groundwater source large incentives such as plans for delivery of a guaranteed surface water supply appear to be necessary to overcome reluctance to take land out of production to build a new reservoir if further development of surface water storage is desired especially in locations experiencing issues similar to cr then a more in depth assessment of the availability and location of possible surface water resources is needed and if possible modification of existing financial incentive programs the insights gained from these analyses will aid water resource planners and funding agencies to more efficiently target resource allocation and conservation efforts especially in areas where physical or financial resources may be limiting funding this work was supported by a specific cooperative agreement between the usda ars and arkansas state university acknowledgements the authors wish to thank d

11388,as part of conjunctive water resource management on farm reservoirs have been constructed to address declines in the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer the primary source of irrigation for most of the row crops grown in eastern arkansas these reservoirs and their associated infrastructure represent significant investments in financial and natural resources and may cause producers to incur costs associated with foregone crop production and long term maintenance a better understanding of past trends in reservoir construction can allow for more efficient resource allocation towards future adoption of this practice thus an analysis of reservoir construction trends in the grand prairie gp critical groundwater area and cache river cr critical groundwater area was conducted between 1996 and 2015 on average 16 5 and 4 1 reservoirs were constructed per year corresponding to cumulative new reservoir surface areas of 161 49 and 60 18 ha yr 1 for gp and cr respectively in terms of reservoir locations relative to aquifer status after 1996 84 5 of 309 reservoirs constructed in gp and 91 0 of 78 in cr were located in areas with remaining saturated aquifer thicknesses of 50 or less the majority of new reservoirs 74 in gp and 63 in cr were constructed on previously productive cropland the next most common land use representing 11 and 15 of new reservoirs constructed in gp and cr respectively was the combination of a field edge and a ditch stream or other low lying area less than 10 of post 1996 reservoirs were constructed on predominately low lying land and the use of this land cover decreased in both critical groundwater areas during the past 20 years a reservoir footprint analysis indicated that 85 of the typical reservoir system consists of the reservoir pond itself with the remaining 15 of land area consisting of tailwater recovery ditches and other associated features the disparities in reservoir construction rates locations and prior land uses between the two critical groundwater areas is likely due to groundwater declines being first observed in gp as well as the existence of two large scale river diversion projects under construction in gp that feature on farm storage as a means to offset groundwater use results of this analysis can be used in the development of targeted resource allocation initiatives and conservation efforts in critical groundwater areas and other similarly water scarce regions keywords aquifer depletion irrigation on farm reservoirs surface water land use change 1 introduction in the u s the mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa as part of the mississippi embayment me aquifer system is the second most utilized aquifer in terms of irrigation withdrawals and the most utilized aquifer in terms of international virtual water transfer marston et al 2015 the lower mississippi river valley lmrv the region overlaying the me has over four million ha of irrigated cropland that depends mainly on the mrvaa for water supply massey et al 2017 within the lmrv in the state of arkansas there are two million ha of irrigated cropland nearly 80 of which is comprised of a rice soybean rotation usda nass 2014 thus agricultural water resource management in the lmrv impacts not only the u s but the many nations that receive rice exported from the region groundwater based irrigation has been a part of the agricultural landscape in east central arkansas since the early 20th century because of the discovery that rice was ideally suited to the soils of the region due to a shallow clay layer that held water at the surface and prevented percolation to deeper layers vories and evett 2014 gates 2005 in spite of the more than 1000 mm yr 1 average annual precipitation in this region only half occurred during the growing season evett et al 2003 henry et al 2016 furthermore unlike upland crops such as corn or soybean rice required flooded fields throughout the growing season so that irrigation was necessary for successful cultivation evett et al 2003 gates 2005 this early adoption and subsequent extensive development of irrigation in eastern arkansas vories and evett 2010 was facilitated by the easily accessible mrvaa which underlies most of the area fig 1 the mrvaa is a sand and gravel aquifer overlain in most parts by a confining clay layer of varying thickness hart et al 2008 renken 1998 the hydrologic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 60 to 75 m day 1 west of the crowley s ridge outcrop fig 1 and decreases to the southwest where it ranges from 30 to 60 m day 1 the thickness of the mrvaa is spatially variable ranging from about 23 46 m in the north to 15 46 m in the west central area and becoming thinner in the south at 15 23 m renken 1998 the confining unit also varies in thickness throughout eastern arkansas being thinner in the northeast 3 12 m and thicker in the southwest 9 21 m because of this confining layer recharge from surface water and precipitation to the arkansas portion of the mrvaa is limited occurring mainly where the layer itself is not present or where larger rivers have incised the confining layer renken 1998 the lower arkansas river fig 1 and the lower white river which forms the eastern boundary of arkansas county fig 1 both provide recharge to the aquifer in this way water quality in the mrvaa is fairly good relative to drinking water standards although hardness and higher concentrations of iron etc limit domestic and industrial use but generally do not adversely affect irrigation use kresse et al 2014 from the initial 405 ha of rice harvested in 1905 rice cultivation in arkansas quickly expanded reaching 50 000 ha by 1916 and exceeding 100 000 ha by 1942 usda nass 2018 as early as 1915 the us army corps of engineers usace noted that groundwater withdrawals from the mrvaa in portions of eastern arkansas exceeded recharge to the aquifer gates 2005 this was recognized officially by the arkansas state planning board in 1939 vories and evett 2014 in spite of these early signs of aquifer depletion irrigated agriculture continued to expand so that by 1979 there were 658 000 ha of irrigated land in arkansas representing 35 of the total cropland in the state u s dept of commerce 1982 of this irrigated area 94 was comprised of rice and about 19 of the soybean now grown in rotation with rice tacker et al 2010 in 1980 1981 the southern us experienced severe drought andreadis et al 2005 resulting in previously non irrigated crops in eastern arkansas such as soybean becoming increasingly irrigated tacker et al 2010 between 1984 and 1998 there were two periods of rapid expansion of both farmland and irrigation in arkansas fig 2 with irrigated area increasing 47 between 1984 and 1988 and 42 between 1994 and 1998 while rice area showed small increases 15 and 17 during these two periods irrigated soybean area increased 66 and 55 respectively fig 2 this rapid expansion of irrigated crops in the mrvaa region coincided with noticeable declines in groundwater czarnecki and schrader 2013 tacker et al 2010 so that in 1998 the grand prairie area in east central arkansas which includes lonoke prairie and arkansas counties fig 1 was designated a critical groundwater area cga anrc 2014 later as another cone of depression deepened north and east of the grand prairie the cache river area which includes craighead poinsett cross and st francis counties received the same critical designation in 2009 fig 1 as noted previously agriculture in the mrvaa region has been comprised mainly of rice and soybean and has relied heavily on groundwater based irrigation clark et al 2011 marston et al 2015 unlike the dry climate agricultural areas in the western u s where large scale irrigation projects are common formal irrigation districts in arkansas did not appear until recently vories and evett 2014 as a result the development and expansion of irrigation in arkansas both from groundwater and surface sources has been primarily driven by crop producers in 1984 the white river irrigation district wrid was formed by farmers in the grand prairie region to gain assistance in dealing with worsening groundwater conditions tacker et al 2010 efforts to conjunctively manage water resources in these cgas have been led by state and federal agencies such as the arkansas natural resources commission anrc and the usda natural resources conservation service usda nrcs these efforts have included the development and storage of surface water resources gates 2005 prince czarnecki et al 2016 conservation practices to improve irrigation efficiency young et al 2004 as well as cost sharing programs to assist producers with construction and implementation usda nrcs 2011 development of surface water resources for irrigation has occurred mainly in the grand prairie cga hereafter gp which is bordered by the lower reaches of the arkansas and white rivers two large scale surface water diversion projects have been planned for this region anrc 2014 and are being implemented in two parts construction of on farm reservoirs and expansion of the existing watershed drainage network to connect them and construction of two pumping stations to divert excess flow from the rivers to the supply network robinson et al 2003 tacker et al 2010 although neither pumping station has been completed an estimated 243 new on farm reservoirs were built in the wrid area in anticipation of this surface water supply with plans for over 300 more to be constructed usace 2014 the bayou meto water management project will divert water from the arkansas river and deliver it to western parts of prairie lonoke and arkansas counties the grand prairie area demonstration project will divert water from the white river and deliver it to the eastern parts of the same counties hill et al 2006 in the cache river cga hereafter cr no large scale diversion projects have been planned because the two major rivers in that region the cache and the l anguille lack the excess streamflow to support such projects anrc 2014 aside from the gp reservoirs built in anticipation of surface water deliveries reservoir construction has largely been driven by producers both with and without cost share assistance from state and federal agencies prince czarnecki et al 2016 usda nrcs 2011 to better understand the current status of reservoir construction a remote sensing inventory was conducted in both cgas by yaeger et al 2017 as of 2015 there were 632 on farm irrigation reservoirs located in gp and 143 reservoirs in cr although gp had a smaller proportion of potentially irrigated cropland relative to the total study area than cr there were 4 5 times as many reservoirs and reservoir surface area in gp than in cr because aquifer depletion has been an issue for producers in gp for longer than their counterparts in cr the need for alternatives to groundwater based irrigation in gp has also had a longer history this in addition to the planned surface water diversion projects in gp could explain some of the differences in the numbers of on farm reservoirs between the two cgas depending on the prior land use reservoir construction may result in significant losses in terms of foregone crop production given the available financial incentive programs usda nrcs 2011 and benefits from surface water use anrc 2014 losses from crop production could have contributed to the relatively small number of reservoirs that were present overall in 2015 this explanation has been explored theoretically by several research groups two studies on the economic feasibility of irrigation reservoirs examined the costs of irrigating with surface water vs pumped groundwater in the grand prairie region harper et al 1989 shulstad et al 1985 they considered local yields construction operating costs and grain prices at the time but they did not account for cost sharing or other financial incentives it was found that on highly productive land with high grain prices only the larger 36 ha 1 2 5 m deep reservoirs were economically feasible water from small reservoirs 12 ha 1 m deep never cost less than groundwater even at lower yields and lower grain prices harper et al 1989 more recently another study in the arkansas mrvaa region found that the addition of cost sharing tax credits and environmental financial incentives to the cost benefit analysis of surface vs groundwater irrigation greatly improved the economic feasibility of using reservoir irrigation systems even for large values of foregone production bouldin et al 2004 studies using the arkansas specific marora economic model suggested that with limited groundwater availability use of on farm reservoirs and tailwater recovery systems for irrigation could improve profitability popp et al 2003 however when groundwater was plentiful financial incentives were needed to make these surface water irrigation sources economically feasible hill et al 2006 young et al 2004 solutions for alleviating aquifer depletion such as on farm irrigation reservoirs represent a significant outlay of both financial and physical resources knowing what worked in the past may allow for more efficient resource allocation efforts in the future with a better understanding of why where and to what extent the practice of on farm irrigation reservoir construction has been previously adopted in critical regions water resource managers government agencies etc may better direct their available resources to foster future adoption a first step towards this goal would be to examine the trends and patterns of reservoir development over the past 20 years comparing and contrasting between these two arkansas cgas with different levels of need saturated aquifer thickness remaining and incentives available surface water resources the overall aim of this work is to derive insights from the trends and patterns seen in past efforts which could then be used to assist decision making in future efforts the specific objectives of this study were 1 to identify patterns of reservoir construction over time in each cga and relate these to prior land use land cover 2 to quantify these patterns of reservoir construction in each cga in relation to their respective cones of depression and the expansion thereof 3 to estimate the total cropland taken out of production in each cga through analysis of the total reservoir footprint 2 data and methods a remote sensing inventory was carried out to obtain estimates of the number and surface area of reservoirs present in years of available data prior to 2015 then the depth to groundwater and saturated aquifer thickness were determined for all reservoirs along with prior land use land cover for those reservoirs constructed after 1996 the first available year of imagery lastly the total footprints of reservoirs constructed completely on productive cropland was determined and used to estimate the total land area taken out of production 2 1 data description this study utilized county scale national agricultural imagery program naip digital aerial orthoimagery from the usda geospatial data gateway direct data naip download https gdg sc egov usda gov gdghome directdownload aspx this full color imagery was available as geo referenced compressed county mosaics ccm and was only taken during the growing season may july of years 2015 2013 2010 2009 and 2006 the usda aerial photography field office apfo that maintains this data has specific standards for all naip images ensuring that they were acquired at a 1 m ground sample distance with a horizontal accuracy within 6 m of ground control points for 1996 the first year in the study apfo ccm orthoimagery of similar specifications to the naip orthoimagery was used these ccms were in black and white and not generally taken during the growing season but provided enough detail to differentiate water bodies from field and forest and were therefore deemed sufficient to determine whether or not a reservoir was present in a given location since the gap between the oldest aerial orthoimagery 1996 and the next oldest 2006 was larger than the gaps between other available years the historical imagery function in google earth was employed adding the year 2000 to the years of available imagery google earth utilized data from multiple sources including high resolution pan sharpened images from landsat 8 and digitalglobe satellites as well as geo referenced aerial imagery from the usgs and usda google earth imagery resolution varied from 15 m to 15 cm per pixel depending on the source the historical coverage for 2000 combined different sources and resolutions depending on the location was in black and white and not necessarily taken during the growing season but like the afpo ccms from 1996 was also deemed sufficient to determine reservoir presence interpolated groundwater surface maps were created from historical usgs well data available from the national water information system website http waterdata usgs gov ar nwis uv referred module gw for consistency all wells chosen to create the historical surfaces were from the mrvaa and had measurements taken for the same years during the 1996 2015 study to avoid influence of seasonal pumping on well data the depth measurements used were from february to june only anrc 2016 of the over 1000 available well locations 238 wells had available data in the years 2015 2012 2008 2004 2000 and 1996 the discrete measurements for each year were interpolated into six separate groundwater surface maps using the natural neighbor method in arcgis v 10 4 esri 2016 precipitation data for the past 20 years as well as the most recent 30 year normal precipitation for both cgas was obtained from the interpolated grid maps available from oregon state university s prism climate group http prism oregonstate edu the 30 year normal precipitation comprised the years 1981 2010 and was available at both annual and monthly timescales annual total precipitation was obtained for the study years 1996 2015 growing season precipitation was obtained by summing the monthly values of april through september in each year averaged precipitation for each cga over each timescale growing season and annual was then obtained for each of the four individual periods described in the next section 2 2 analysis of reservoir construction over time starting with 2015 the arcgis polygon reservoir layer of that year was renamed for and then superimposed on the orthoimagery of the previous available year for example a copy of the 2015 reservoir polygon layer was made designated as 2013 superimposed on the orthoimagery for 2013 and then edited as follows a systematic determination was made for each reservoir in the layer as to whether or not it was present in the year of interest if not the reservoir polygon was deleted and the year in which it would appear recorded in the database this year appeared designation was used instead of year of construction due to the time gaps between images in this way seven reservoir polygon shapefiles were created one for each year of available imagery 2015 2013 2010 2009 2006 2000 and 1996 the latitude and longitude of the centroid of each reservoir polygon was also recorded in each database table associated with the polygon shapefiles for use later in the comparison with depth to groundwater because the historical orthoimagery was not distributed evenly in time reservoir construction over the 20 study years was presented as an average rate per year between image years as well as a number of new reservoirs in each image year similarly total new reservoir area in each image year is also presented as an average value per year for each of the periods between one image and the next furthermore because the time between the more recent orthoimagery 2009 2015 was shorter 1 3 years than that between older 1996 2006 images 4 6 years the last four image years were combined into two periods so that reservoir rates and totals were calculated over the years 1996 2000 2000 2006 2006 2010 and 2010 2015 respectively 2 3 analysis of reservoirs in relation to the cone of depression modeled aquifer thickness estimates hart et al 2008 were obtained from the anrc for 220 wells within the mrvaa these were then interpolated into a continuous surface map of aquifer thickness using the same natural neighbor method as previously described the aforementioned 238 well locations were overlaid on this interpolated surface to obtain estimates of aquifer thickness at each location depth to groundwater measurements from each available year were subtracted from the aquifer thickness to obtain estimates of saturated thickness the ratio of saturated thickness to aquifer thickness is then the saturated percent of aquifer thickness the resulting discrete estimates of saturated percent of aquifer thickness were then interpolated into six continuous surface maps using the natural neighbor method these surfaces were then clipped to the shape of the two study areas and a pixel count was made for 30 and 20 saturated aquifer thickness given that the resolution of the surface maps was 30 m each pixel represented 0 9 ha allowing the pixel counts to be converted to areas to compare with reservoir area increases average rates of increase ha yr 1 for these areas in each cone of depression were also computed although the depth to groundwater sample periods were more evenly distributed through time than the reservoir imagery to determine the depth to groundwater and therefore saturated aquifer thickness at each reservoir location in the year that it appeared the reservoir centroid points for each image year were superimposed on the depth to groundwater map of the same year because the years for which depth to groundwater was available were roughly four years apart and reservoir imagery was available at irregular intervals this was only the case for the years 2000 and 2015 for the other years in the study reservoir image years were paired with the closest groundwater data year so that reservoirs appearing in years 2006 2009 2010 and 2013 were paired with depth to groundwater data for years 2004 2008 2008 and 2012 respectively 2 4 analysis of reservoirs in relation to land use change to determine the prior land use land cover for each new reservoir the individual reservoir shapefiles for each year of imagery were superimposed on the previous image year and the land use noted in the attribute table of that reservoir layer for example the year 2000 reservoir shapefile with only the reservoir perimeter visible was superimposed on the year 1996 imagery reservoirs appearing in 2000 were highlighted and the previous land use visible through the reservoir outline was noted this process was repeated until all reservoirs appearing after 1996 had a prior land use designation which was then compiled with the full reservoir database for each cga prior land uses included cropland edge of field cropland strips wooded low lying land or some combination thereof because there was often more than one land use land cover in place prior to reservoir construction land use designations were divided into four general categories cropland only cropland combination field edge combination and low lying land the cropland combination was defined as consisting of field portions 10 50 cropland and some other non agricultural land use the field edge combination was defined as consisting of field edge strips 10 cropland and an adjoining stream or ditch 2 5 analysis of reservoir area footprint a reservoir area footprint analysis was conducted on a random sampling of all new reservoirs where the prior land use was 100 cropland to avoid biasing the footprint analysis towards reservoirs which were constructed along with a corresponding tailwater recovery ditch as opposed to those reservoirs which utilized an existing drainage network for tailwater recovery each cropland designated reservoir was assigned a random number id and the list of ids was then sorted by associated reservoir size for this analysis the reservoir areas were binned according to the histograms presented in yaeger et al 2017 and then 15 of the reservoirs in each size category 5 5 10 10 20 20 30 30 60 60 100 and 100 ha were selected a polygon was drawn around each reservoir chosen encompassing both the tailwater recovery ditch and levees to represent the total land area taken out of production to construct that reservoir the process was repeated for both cgas as a first estimate of this area footprint only ditches etc in the immediate vicinity of generally parallel to the reservoir were included in this polygon reservoir area was then plotted against total land taken out of production for that reservoir and a linear regression was fitted for each cga the equations of these lines fig 3 were then used to estimate the total land area taken out of production in each cga 3 results 3 1 trends in reservoir construction over time between 1996 and 2015 309 new reservoirs were constructed in gp and 78 new reservoirs were constructed in cr this represents roughly half of the total numbers of reservoirs present in 2015 the majority of these new reservoirs 66 in gp and 62 in cr were built during the first 10 years of the 20 year study 1996 2006 in gp there was a noticeable increase in reservoir construction between 2000 and 2006 where an average of 23 reservoirs per year were built table 1 in contrast a steady average of five reservoirs per year were constructed over the first 10 years of the study in cr table 2 in both cgas reservoir construction rates declined in the second 10 years compared to the first 10 although in cr a slight increase was observed in the most recent period of the study table 2 in terms of new reservoir area the periods with the highest average rates of reservoir construction also coincided with the highest average rates of new reservoir area per year for gp table 1 this was not the case in cr where large reservoirs that appeared in 2013 brought the average rate for 2010 2015 to 75 ha per year when only 4 reservoirs per year were constructed on average during that time period earlier reservoirs in cr showed more consistency in size as was seen in gp from 1996 to 2000 73 ha per year of new reservoir area was added corresponding to the highest average rate of construction table 2 about half the total number of new reservoirs in each cga appeared after 1996 in gp this represents about one third of the total reservoir area while in cr it represents over one half of the 2015 total trends in precipitation both mean annual total and growing season are also presented in tables 1 and 2 average rainfall amounts differed little between the cgas with gp receiving slightly more annual rainfall and slightly less growing season precipitation than cr the 30 year normal for annual rainfall was 1259 mm yr 1 for gp and 1242 mm yr 1 for cr for growing season precipitation it was 566 mm and 576 mm respectively average rainfall over the 20 year study was close to the 30 year normal with gp receiving 1252 mm yr 1 of precipitation and 573 mm over the growing season while cr received 1241 mm yr 1 and 590 mm respectively in both cgas the first 10 years were drier than the second 10 years both annually and during the growing season however a similar trend was not observed in reservoir sizes in gp the average new reservoir surface areas were consistent over the last 20 years showing little variation within or between periods table 1 in cr the average new reservoir sizes were larger than those in gp and varied more between and within periods table 2 reservoir sizes in cr were largest and varied the most within the earliest and the most recent periods in the middle two periods from 2000 to 2010 reservoir sizes were smaller and more consistently sized similar to the ones constructed during all periods in gp 3 2 trends in reservoir construction in relation to the cone of depression fig 4 shows the areal expansion of the two cones of depression in terms of saturated percent of aquifer thickness along with the expansion of reservoir construction over the 20 year study the deepest portions of the cones of depression spanned multiple counties in both cgas in 1996 fig 4a but were more concentrated across the three counties in gp by 2015 the deepest portions in gp were centered in prairie and lonoke counties only in cr however the deepest portions of the cone had expanded to cover large sections of craighead poinsett and cross counties fig 4c the large increase in reservoirs constructed from 2000 to 2006 in gp was for the most part evenly distributed over areas where only 20 40 of the aquifer thickness was still saturated in the last 10 years 2006 2015 there was a slight shift in reservoir construction towards regions where the saturated percent of aquifer thickness had shrunk to 10 30 although new reservoirs still appeared in areas where the saturated aquifer thickness was 40 table 3 in cr this shift in recent reservoir construction toward areas with less aquifer saturation was more clearly evident reservoirs appearing in cr in the first 10 years 1996 2006 covered a wide range of aquifer saturation 10 80 while the most recent 2010 2015 reservoirs appeared in regions where the saturated aquifer thickness was 40 or less table 4 a comparison of the cumulative area expansion of the total area 30 and 20 of saturated aquifer thickness with that of new reservoir area is presented next fig 5 in gp where aquifer drawdown has occurred over a longer historical period the area of 30 saturated aquifer thickness approximately doubled from 46 500 ha to 98 100 ha between 1996 and 2008 the increase in area then leveled off ending at 111 000 ha in 2015 fig 5a in cr the same area of that cone of depression tripled from 26 600 ha to 82 400 ha between 1996 and 2008 then as in gp the area increase leveled off ending at 99 000 ha in 2015 fig 5b the pattern for the areas of most severe depletion where 20 of the aquifer thickness was still saturated was slightly different but the general trends remained the same in both cgas growth of the center area of the cone of depression was rapid at first and leveled off in the last measurement period 2012 2015 in gp this growth started later 2000 than it did in cr 1996 and did not cover as large an area even by the end of the 20 years fig 5a and b the cumulative reservoir area expansion in gp mirrored the expansion of the area where 30 of the aquifer thickness is saturated while the difference between the beginning value 6235 ha and ending 9336 ha was not as large the pattern of rapid growth in the first 10 years followed by a leveling off in growth was similar to that of the cone of depression fig 5a this was not the case in cr where reservoir surface area doubled between 1996 in 2015 going from 884 ha to 2019 ha respectively furthermore there was a slight increase in reservoir area expansion between 2010 and 2015 fig 5b this is more clearly illustrated by the rates of area expansion which is described next after comparing cumulative area expansion trends in the rates of area expansion of both the cones of depression and reservoir surface were examined fig 6 in gp the rate of expansion of area with 30 of saturated aquifer thickness showed a stepped decrease over time fig 6a while in cr this rate increased at first then showed a stepped decrease fig 6b the patterns for the rates of expansion of the most severely depleted areas where 20 of the aquifer remained saturated were similar in both cgas increasing until 2012 then decreasing thereafter the patterns for reservoir area expansion rates however were noticeably different in gp rates of reservoir area expansion increased in the first half of the study years peaking at 213 ha yr 1 in the 2000 2006 period and then declined in the second half fig 6a in contrast reservoir area expansion rates in cr declined from an initial 73 ha yr 1 for the 1996 2000 period to a low of 37 ha yr 1 from 2006 to 2010 then doubled in the 2010 2015 period to 75 ha yr 1 fig 6b 3 3 trends in reservoir construction in relation to prior land use and land cover the majority of new reservoirs in both cgas were constructed completely on land removed from crop production tables 5 and 6 in gp this was nearly 75 of the new reservoirs while in cr about 63 of new reservoirs were constructed on land taken out of production another 20 of new reservoirs in gp and 27 in cr utilized natural features such as streams ditches and low lying wooded or ponded areas in combination with either edge of field cropland strips or larger portions of crop fields lastly only a small portion of new reservoirs in both cgas were created from the flooding of low lying areas although this was less common in gp at 6 of new reservoirs than in cr at 10 these were mainly the oldest new reservoirs which appeared between 1996 and 2006 after 2006 this prior land cover was rarely seen tables 5 and 6 for reservoirs constructed entirely on cropland tables 5 and 6 the number of new reservoirs and the amount of new reservoir area added were in the same range for all time periods in both cgas except for the 2000 2006 period in gp where these were more than double that of the three other time periods the overall trend for both combination categories cropland and edge of field cropland strips was different than that of the cropland only category of new reservoirs in gp the number of new reservoirs partially constructed on productive farmland was highest in the first time period 1996 2000 and decreased thereafter table 5 in cr however this number doubled in the 2000 2006 period then declined in subsequent time periods table 6 lastly in both cgas the second 10 years of the study showed the smallest number of new reservoirs constructed either fully or partially on non agricultural land compared to the first 10 years 3 4 trends in reservoir area footprints total land taken out of production because cropland was the prior land use for most of the new reservoirs in the two cgas an analysis of the total area footprint of reservoirs constructed completely on productive farmland provided a first pass estimate of the total land area taken out of production this represented 2676 ha in gp and 855 ha in cr in both cgas reservoir surface area made up about 85 of the total area footprint the patterns seen in these total values were also reflected in the trends in general the average area footprint did not vary much between time periods which mirrored the consistency seen previously in the prior land use trends for cropland only reservoirs tables 5 and 6 in gp the average area footprints were both smaller and varied less between time periods than those in cr within each time period in gp the average area footprint size was fairly consistent table 5 although in the last 10 years it was slightly larger 12 ha than in the first 10 11 ha in cr the average area footprint sizes were more varied within each time period table 6 in both cgas however the variability around the average footprint size was the same order of magnitude as the average tables 5 and 6 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of broad trends in reservoir construction the patterns of reservoir construction where how many and the average rates of construction differed between the two cgas there were four times as many new reservoirs built in gp over the last 20 years than in cr one explanation for this disparity is that the large surface water diversion projects planned and under construction in gp provided an added incentive to producers beyond cost sharing and may have helped overcome land owner producer reluctance to take land out of crop production reservoir construction related to these diversion projects mainly occurred between 2000 and 2006 tony stevenson usda nrcs personal communication 2016 this coincided with the time period where the most new reservoirs appeared and new reservoir area was added per year in gp while the same economic incentive programs such as the nrcs environmental quality incentives program usda nrcs 2011 were available to producers in both cgas no surface water diversion projects are planned for cr owing to the lack of large rivers with enough excess streamflow for irrigation supply anrc 2014 another explanation for these differences may be that in some parts of gp surface water may be the only viable source of irrigation water since aquifer declines there have occurred for a much longer time the slight increase in reservoir construction and large increase in average size that was observed in recent years in cr but not in gp may be an indication of the effects of aquifer declines in this cga being experienced more commonly this was corroborated by the new reservoir location and land use data which showed more of the newest reservoirs in cr being constructed on productive cropland in areas of greatest decline than were older new reservoirs further analysis of the trends in reservoir placement in both cgas also suggested that the effects of aquifer depletion have been experienced in gp for some time but only recently in cr in gp in all four time periods most reservoirs were constructed in places where 10 40 of the aquifer remained saturated but with most construction occurring between the years 2000 and 2006 the timing of this construction corresponded to the expectation of supplemental irrigation water from large diversion projects designed to provide surface water to areas of most aquifer depletion there was a different pattern in cr for the first 10 years reservoirs were constructed over a wide range of saturated aquifer thicknesses in the last 10 years however there was a discernible shift to regions where the aquifer was less saturated 40 this suggested that reservoir construction here may likely be motivated by recent aquifer declines and the resulting difficulty obtaining groundwater the smaller number of reservoirs built in the last 10 years compared to the first 10 could indicate possible reluctance to take land out of production unless an extreme need for irrigation water necessitated it in the discussion of reservoir construction in relation to the cones of depression it must be noted that the cones of depression themselves have been expanding along with reservoir surface area over the past 20 years however closer examination showed that the expansion in the cones of depression both the cumulative area and the rate of area expansion has leveled off in recent years some explanation for this is that groundwater usage may have declined since 2000 due to implementation of conservation measures such as tailwater recovery reservoirs and polytubing irrigation as well as reduced transmissivity to wells from loss of aquifer saturated thickness czarnecki and schrader 2013 groundwater usage may also have decreased due to higher than average rainfall during the growing season from 2006 through 2015 tables 3 and 4 which would have reduced the need for supplemental irrigation an increase in groundwater levels observed in usgs monitoring wells in the region during this period czarnecki and schrader 2013 would also explain some of the slowing of the expansion of the cones of depression the rates of reservoir area expansion have leveled off in gp but not in cr instead there was a slight increase in total reservoir area due to a recent spate of construction including a very large 100 ha reservoir in the northern reaches of the present cr cone of depression where more than 10 of aquifer saturation has been lost since 2004 4 2 cropland taken out of production reservoir area footprints the reservoir footprint and prior land use analyses showed that while the majority of new reservoirs were built on cropland producers tended to minimize this by utilizing existing infrastructure and natural hydrologic features where possible in both cgas about half of the reservoirs present in 2015 were also present prior to 1996 as a result most of the available low lying land suitable for reservoir construction had been already been used especially in gp furthermore environmental conservation policies enacted in the latter part of the 20th century likely restricted the utilization of low lying land for irrigation water storage still after cropland only the next most common prior land use for new reservoirs was some combination of cropland or edge of field cropland and a hydrologic feature such as a stream ditch or low lying area in proximity to the agricultural land for reservoirs constructed completely on cropland reservoir surface area was approximately 85 of the total reservoir footprint with reservoir levees tailwater recovery ditches pumping plant and other associated infrastructure making up the remaining 15 as noted previously this area footprint analysis only took into account ditches etc immediately around the reservoir which was the case for the majority of sampled reservoirs however in a few cases the reservoir was associated with an extensive network of tailwater recovery ditches that bordered both the reservoir and several nearby fields this land area technically is part of the reservoir system and so the estimates of total land taken out of production presented in this paper may be slightly lower than was actual nevertheless the majority of reservoirs even those built on cropland taken out of production utilized existing drainage networks both natural and constructed thus minimizing where possible foregone crop production for perspective in 2015 the amount of potentially irrigated cropland in gp was 293 394 ha and in cr was 192 953 ha yaeger et al 2017 the total land taken out of production in the construction of these cropland only reservoirs represented 0 9 of potentially irrigated land in gp and 0 4 of it in cr 4 3 implications for conjunctive water management the construction of on farm irrigation reservoirs is an important aspect of the on going efforts to conjunctively manage water resources in these two cgas while on farm reservoirs provide the benefits of capture and storage of off season rainfall field runoff and local streamflow they also represent large costs in terms of construction maintenance and foregone production with construction cost sharing opportunities and other financial incentives equally available between the two cgas on farm irrigation reservoirs were more readily adopted with the promise of a guaranteed supply of surface water throughout the growing season via large river diversions this suggests that in critical areas without excess surface water resources different financial incentives some combination of land and water conservation programs or different conjunctive use projects such as in stream weirs may be needed in order to alleviate aquifer depletion specifically for this study the results of this work show that conjunctive water resource management will need to be implemented differently in the two cgas and suggest the need in cr for a more comprehensive water resource assessment 5 conclusions in the context of conjunctive water management the broad trends outlined in this study are a first step towards a better understanding of why and to what extent the construction of on farm reservoirs has been adopted in a region of aquifer depletion using remote sensing data and usgs historical groundwater measurements it was found that in both cgas approximately half of the reservoirs appearing by 2015 were constructed since 1996 and the majority of the new reservoirs in each cga were constructed between 1996 and 2006 in gp the fastest rate of reservoir area expansion occurred between 2000 and 2006 with 23 reservoirs per year on average constructed for 213 ha yr 1 reservoir surface area this was driven largely by the expected supply of surface water from nearby diversion projects under construction in cr the fastest rate of construction occurred over the entire first half of the study where on average 5 reservoirs per year were constructed for 61 ha yr 1 surface area in this cga there was also a slight increase in construction between 2010 and 2015 likely due to the effects of the expansion of the aquifer cone of depression affecting groundwater pumping as had already been experienced in gp most new reservoirs 74 in gp and 63 in cr were constructed on cropland and for those reservoirs the reservoir surface area was about 85 of the total land area taken out of production results of the analyses suggest that in the absence of great need i e the lack of a viable groundwater source large incentives such as plans for delivery of a guaranteed surface water supply appear to be necessary to overcome reluctance to take land out of production to build a new reservoir if further development of surface water storage is desired especially in locations experiencing issues similar to cr then a more in depth assessment of the availability and location of possible surface water resources is needed and if possible modification of existing financial incentive programs the insights gained from these analyses will aid water resource planners and funding agencies to more efficiently target resource allocation and conservation efforts especially in areas where physical or financial resources may be limiting funding this work was supported by a specific cooperative agreement between the usda ars and arkansas state university acknowledgements the authors wish to thank d

aquic soil in a wheat triticum aestivuml maize zea mays l cropping system in the north china plain the treatments included no n fertilizer pk chemical n p k fertilizers npk npk plus 22 5 t ha 1 swine manure npkm and npk plus 33 75 t ha 1 swine manure npkm compared with npk and pk both npkm and npkm significantly increased crop yields with no significant difference between npkm and npkm npkm and npkm treatments had a lower n use efficiency nue than npk through the whole period and the average nue were 30 1 14 8 and 12 3 in npk npkm and npkm treatments respectively compared with the initial value of 17 2 17 4 mg c ha 1 and 2 01 2 07 mg n ha 1 soc and tn stocks in npkm and npkm increased by 94 7 114 2 and 83 0 98 0 over the 22 experimental years respectively without any indication of c or n saturation in the soil furthermore tn stock was positively correlated to soc stock p 0 01 added with manure indicating the significance of more organic c input from manure to build up tn pool in conclusion long term application of organic manure in combination with conventional chemical fertilization could increase crop yield and soil c and n stocks in the wheat maize cropping system of the north china plain but it should be noted that large amounts of manure n could also lead to elevated risk of environmental n losses keywords manure chemical fertilizer soil organic carbon stocks total nitrogen stocks long term experiment 1 introduction soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn stocks have attracted wide attention in the desire to mitigate increasing global atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions sainju et al 2008 macbean and peylin 2014 storing c in soils can benefit c trading and decrease co2 emissions and increasing soc and tn stocks can also improve soil quality an increase in soc typically benefits crop production through provision of an energy source for microbial nutrient cycling and improvement of soil physical and chemical properties in turn increased crop net primary production provides more plant residues returning to the soil benefiting soc sequestration in agro ecosystems pan et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 increased in soc stock could increase crop nutrient uptake thus leaded to a great soil n use efficiency duan et al 2014 increasing soil n use efficiency can also reduce the application rate and farmers expenses on fertilizers and protect the environment from the negative effects of n loss compared to natural ecosystems soc and tn stocks in agro ecosystems are more complex dynamic and difficult to capture due to often intensive and repeated disturbances associated with management practices such as fertilizer applications qiu et al 2016 cao et al 2016 ren et al 2017 in this context long term field experiments provide unique opportunities to evaluate impacts of management practices on dynamics of soc and tn stocks over years fertilizer application has become a conventional agronomic practice to increase soc and tn stocks in agro ecosystems depending on the availability of nutrient sources common fertilization practices include application of chemical fertilizer such as n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers organic fertilizers such as animal manures and crop residuals or combinations of chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers while chemical fertilizers often have high nutrient bioavailability repeated applications of chemical fertilizers may lead to soc decline when the c input to the soil from crop materials is less than the amount of c decomposed by microbes jiang et al 2014 in contrast application of livestock manure can supply substantial amounts of c n and other nutrients to soils he et al 2015 liu et al 2016 thus this practice is widely recommended to maintain or improve soc and tn stocks watts et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 however previous studies demonstrated that application of manure at high rates could lead to n pollution to the environment liu et al 2017 however there is still a lack of understanding of the extent to which different long term fertilization practices affect soc and tn stocks obviously temporal trends of soc and tn stocks greatly depend on the balance between input and output of c and n in the cropping system in agro ecosystems rhizodeposition residues of crop root and stubble and organic fertilizers are the main c inputs to the soil while emission of co2 through mineralization and respiration are the main c outputs stock of soc is largely related to organic c input to the soil for instance an increase of organic c input associated with high crop yields resulted in an increase of the soc stocks by 32 87 zhang et al 2016 a number of field experiments reported that soc stocks increased under practices of balanced fertilization and organic amendments li and han 2016 mi et al 2016 mujuru et al 2016 however the response of soc stock to fertilization also depends on the saturation status of soc stock gulde et al 2008 stewart et al 2009 indeed several long term experiments showed that soc increased sharply as a function of increasing organic c inputs when soc was far less saturated but changed slightly or tended to level out after soc reached certain levels six et al 2002 kundu et al 2007 tong et al 2009 in general trends of soil tn follow dynamics of soc because both n and c are bound to organic compounds manzoni and porporato 2009 in a study on fluvo aquic soil of north china gao et al 2015 reported that both soc and tn contents gradually increased and did not reach the saturation during the 33 year field experiment in a wheat maize rotation system however a different pattern was found over an even longer time frame in a swedish long term experiment kätterer et al 2011 found that soc continuously increased after 54 years of manure applications in the rothamsted long term experiment johnston et al 2009 reported that soc would even continue to increase after the 150 years of manure applications over a short or medium term losses or gains of soc and tn and their resulting changes in soil quality are difficult to assess due to spatial and temporal variabilities hassink 1997 in contrast analysis of long time data series can provide more insights on the potential enhancement of soc and tn by fertilization north china plain is one of the major dryland cereal production regions in china however crop yield in a large area of the region is limited by poor soil fertility related to low soc and tn stocks despite previous reports on enhancement of soc and tn stocks by long term fertilization practices in china cong et al 2012 meng et al 2014 there is still a lack of understanding on the potential of high input fertilization to increase soc and tn stocks in the low fertility soils in the north china plain based on a long term fertilization experiment in the north china plain this study aimed to 1 quantify the 22 year effects of manure and chemical fertilizer application on crop yield and n use efficiency and 2 investigate the long term change rates of soc and tn stocks and c n interactions in response to fertilization practices the results will provide scientific basis for increasing crop yield through improving nutrient management in north china plain and elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the long term fertilizer experiment was established in 1991 at the changping haplic luvisol soil experimental station 40 13 n 116 14 e of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences the station is located in beijing fig 1 in the north china plain as monitored at the station the average annual precipitation is 600 mm and the annual average temperature is 11 c the long term experimental field has a fluvo aquic soil with light loam texture 10 2 clay with a particle size 0 002 mm this type of soil is widely distributed in the north china plain the soil is classified as typic haplustalf soil by u s soil classification baseline soil physical and chemical properties of 0 20 cm soil layer at the start of the experiment in 1991 were bulk density 1 6 g cm 3 ph 8 2 soc 7 1 g kg 1 tn 0 8 g kg 1 c n 9 0 and tp 0 6 g kg 1 the field experiment employed a wheat and maize double cropping system typical in the north china plain wheat triticum aestivuml zhongmai 12 was planted in early october and harvested in early june next year and maize zea mays l jingdan 28 was planted in mid june and harvested in late september the same wheat and maize cultivar was used all over the experimental duration a randomized block design with four fertilizer treatments and three replicated blocks field plot size 20 m 10 m was used fig 1 specifically the treatments were 1 chemical p and k fertilizers but no n pk 2 chemical n p and k fertilizers npk 3 22 5 t ha 1 swine manure plus npk npkm and 4 33 75 t ha 1 swine manure plus npk npkm in both npkm and npkm swine manure was annually applied after harvesting maize in fall the manure contained 30 g c kg 1 and 15 4 g n kg 1 on a dry weight basis the same below all manure was applied as basal fertilizer at a rate of 22 5 t ha 1 year 1 in the npkm treatment and 33 75 t ha 1 year 1 in npkm the same rates of chemical fertilizers urea for n calcium superphosphate for p and potassium chloride for k were applied to wheat and maize before sowing in october and june respectively for both wheat and maize 2 3 of the chemical n and all p and k fertilizers were applied as basal fertilizer and 1 3 of the chemical n fertilizer as topdressing both chemical and manure basal fertilizers were uniformly broadcast on the soil surface and immediately incorporated into soil 0 20 cm depth by plowing before sowing the detailed fertilizer rates in each treatment are listed in table 1 2 2 soil and plant sampling and analysis before the start of the field experiment in 1991 soil samples were collected from the plow layer 0 20 cm across the field from 1991 to 2012 soil samples were collected annually from each field plot approximately 15 d after harvesting maize specifically three replicate soil cores were taken randomly from each plot using a 5 cm internal diameter auger and the samples were mixed together in a plastic bag to produce a composite sample after removing roots and stones the soil was air dried ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve prior to determining soc and tn contents concentration of soc was analyzed with dichromate oxidation and tn was determined by using the kjeldahl digestion method kdy 9830 beijing soil ph was measured with deionized water 1 5 soil water soil tp was determined by using the molybdate ascorbic acid method perkinelmer uv 25 after oxidative digestion of the soil with h2so4 hclo4 the analytical methods were described in details by gai et al 2016 for each plot maize and wheat plants were harvested manually close to the ground with sickles and all harvested materials were removed from the field thus only roots and shed leaf litter were returned to the soil for each plot five plant samples were collected from the harvested plants separated for grain and straws and then air dried threshed and oven dried at 70 c to constant dry weight for further analyses of nutrient concentrations plant tn concentration was determined after digesting the samples with h2so4 h2o2 using the micro kjeldahl method page and miller 1982 grain yields were determined based on the oven dried samples for each plot 2 3 estimation of soc and tn stocks and c n inputs into soil the stocks of soc and tn were calculated as follows s c bd h 10 1 where sis stock of soc t ha 1 or tn t ha 1 c is concentration of soc g kg 1 or tn g kg 1 bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 h is the soil sampling depth cm in studies where bd was not determined directly it was estimated using following equation song et al 2005 bd 0 0048 lnsoc 1 377 where soc is soil organic carbon content g c kg 1 the c inputs to the soil included c from both manure and crop residues we assumed that the amount of crop residues roots exudation and dead materials were equivalent to 30 of the aboveground dry matter production kundu et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 and that 75 of wheat root biomass and 85 of maize root biomass were distributed in the top 20 cm of the soil jiang et al 2014 the n inputs to the soil included fertilizer n crop biomass n and atmospheric n deposition the fertilizer n input was calculated as nf nc yom nom where nf is the n input in each fertilization treatment kg n ha 1 year 1 nc is the n input from chemical n fertilizers kg n ha 1 year 1 yom is the amount of manure applied kg ha 1 year 1 and nom is the content of n in the manure applied crop biomass n refers to the amount of n in crop roots and crop residues that was returned to soil after harvesting the crop the crop biomass n was estimated separately for maize and wheat residue biomass of both maize and wheat was calculated based on a residue straw ratio of 0 3 kundu et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 the roots of crops were collected and dried to constant weight at 80 and the n content of root biomass was determined by kjeldahl methods the atmospheric n deposition fluxused in the budget was 32 5 kg n ha 1 year 1 an averaged value across beijing zhang et al 2006 the n use efficiency nue has important agronomic and environmental implications on the n utilization and its fate in the environment for both wheat and maize nue is defined as the crop uptake of n from fertilization divided by the total n applied n u e n u n 0 n a 100 where nu kg n ha 1 is the total n uptake by crop grain plus straw in treatments applied with chemical and or manure n n0 kg n ha 1 is the crop n uptake in the unfertilized treatment i e the pk treatment and na is the total n applied in the fertilizer treatment as a norm the n in the roots was not included in the calculation 2 4 data analysis the results were expressed as mean standard deviation figures were plotted with the microsoft office excel 2013 statistical analysis was performed by using the statistical analysis system sas version 9 1 treatment effects on response variables were tested with one way analysis of variance anova by comparing the treatment means using duncan s multiple range test the correlation between variables was analyzed at p 0 05 using sas a significant level of p 0 05 was used in all the tests 3 results 3 1 crop yields and n use efficiency long term effects of fertilization on crop yields and nue were evaluated for which the averaged yield and nue were presented by periods 1 from 1991 to 1995 1 5 yr 2 1996 to 2000 6 10 yr 3 2001 to 2005 11 15 yr and 4 2006 to 2012 16 22 yr all fertilizer treatments increased both wheat and maize yields over long term especially after 10 years of fertilization with different rates of increase among the treatments fig 2 the pk treatment had the smallest increase from 862 kg wheat ha 1yr 1and 2191 kg maize ha 1yr 1 during 1 10 yrto 1604 kg wheat ha 1yr 1and 3083 kg maize ha 1yr 1during 11 22 yr during the same time intervals average wheat yield in npk npkm and npkm increased from 2530 3228 and 3131 to 3063 4060 and 4334 kg ha 1yr 1 and maize yield increased from 2915 4302 and 3999 to 4515 5995 and 6124 kg ha 1yr 1 respectively on average of 22 years npkm and npkm had significantly higher crop yields than other treatments p 0 05 wheat yields in npkm and npkm were 30 8 and 35 3 higher than the yield in npk respectively and maize yields were 37 1 and 36 1 higher table s1 however no significant difference in crop yield was found between npkm and npkm even though the yields in npkm and npkm tended to differ general trends of nue differed between the treatments and also at different experimental periods on average nue in npk npkm and npkm were 32 3 15 7 and 13 8 respectively during 2006 to 2012 all with an obvious increase from 28 2 14 1 and 10 5 of the years 1991 to 1995 notably npkm had a relatively low nue compared to npk during the whole experiment period treatment ranking npk npkm npkm the npkm treatment had relatively lower nue than npkm possibly because the larger amount of n applied in npkm appeared to be surplus over the entire 22 experimental years nue averaged 30 1 in npk 14 8 in npkm and 12 3 in npkm and significant difference was detected between the treatments table s2 additional manure amendment on the basis of existing n fertilizer application rate decreased nue by 50 8 59 1 relative to npk 3 2 c inputs and soc stocks averaged crop biomass c inputs of every five experimental years and manure c inputs throughout the long term experiment are shown for different treatments in table 2 compared to the c inputs from crop biomass 280 3 447 6 kg c ha 1 yr 1 manure was the main c source in npkm 4725 kg c ha 1 yr 1 and npkm 7875 kg c ha 1 yr 1 in contrast all c inputs in pk and npk were sourced from crop biomass and the c input in npk was two fold more than that in pk consistent with the trends of crop yields the input of c from crop biomass during 2001 2012 was significantly higher than that during 1991 2000 in all fertilization treatments except pk while the c input in the pk treatment decreased from 111 2 1 5 yr to 80 4 kg c ha 1 yr 1 16 22 yr the c input in npk npkm and npkm all increased by about 37 1 53 4 and 59 7 respectively for the same time periods furthermore the c input from crop biomass in npk was lower than that with the application of manure over the 22 years however there were no statistical differences among those treatments soc stock in all the treatments trended to increase with time compared with the initial values of 16 6 18 1 17 2 and 17 4 mg c ha 1 in pk npk npkm and npkm treatments soc stock increased by 14 8 23 7 94 7 and 114 2 over the 22 years respectively fig 4a while soc stocks in pk and npk that had slight soc increase over years were poorly related to the experimental years r2 of regression were only 0 14 and 0 19 respectively soc stocks in npkm and npkm increased with time r2 were 0 85 and 0 82 respectively these results indicated that soc stocks in agricultural fields would increase with the prolonging time of manure applications on average of the 22 years soc stocks in npkm and npkm significantly increased by 20 3 and 34 4 respectively as compared to npk table s3 for npkm and npkm the increment rates of soc stocks in the initial 10 years 0 50 and 0 49 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively were much lower than that during 2001 2012 0 99 and 1 17 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig 5a in contrast the increment rates of soc stocks in the initial 10 years 0 31 and 0 41 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively were much higher than that during 2001 2012 0 22 and 0 25 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively for the pk and npk treatments fig 5a meanwhile a higher increasing rate of soc stocks was obtained with higher manure application rate 3 3 n inputs and tn stocks the average annual n inputs from chemical fertilizer manure n deposition and roots and crop residues under different treatments are shown in table 3 fertilizer and manure were the main sources of n in the npk npkm and npkm treatments the total n inputs in npkm and npkm were about 1 7 2 1 times more than the n input in npk owing to the contribution of the manure n given the same level of n deposition flux in this region 32 5 kg n ha 1 n input from roots and crop residues followed npkm and npkm 11 2 kg n ha 1 npk 5 5 kg n ha 1 pk 2 9 kg n ha 1 table 3 similar to soc stocks tn stocks in npkm and npkm considerably increased from 2 0 mg n ha 1 at the start of the experiment to 3 7 4 1 mg n ha 1in 2012 increased by 83 0 98 0 fitted with an function of time r2 of regression were 0 71 and 0 84 respectively in contrast tn stocks in pk stabilized at the level of 1 7 2 0 mg n ha 1 and in the npk treatment tn stocks fluctuated between 1 7 and 2 4 mg n ha 1 throughout the study period overall long term fertilization regimes significantly increased tn stocks with increasing manure application rate and the treatment effects ranked as npkm npkm npk pk fig 4b over the 22 experimental years combined application of chemical fertilizers and animal manure significantly increased tn stocks by 26 2 in npkm to 40 4 in npkm compared to npk table s3 with a similar trend to soc stocks the increment rate of tn stocks in npkm and npkm during the initial 10 years 0 08 0 07 mg ha 1 yr 1 were much lower than that during 2001 2012 0 15 0 16 mg ha 1 yr 1 fig 5b in pk and npk however the increasing rate of tn stocks did not change over the two experimental periods fig 5b meanwhile a higher increasing rate of tn stocks was obtained when higher rate of manure was applied as for soc results suggest that soil n sequestration ability improve along with the increase of tn stocks by amendment of manure 3 4 relationships between soc and tn regression analysis showed that soil tn content was linearly correlated with soc especially for the npkm and npkm treatments table 4 the two regressions were significant p 0 01 with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 70 and 0 80 respectively however soil c n ratios in the four fertilization treatments fluctuated markedly between years from 8 2 to 12 3 which might be due to the annual variation in the c inputs as well as the different dynamics of soc and tn contents fig 6 the c n ratio firstly increased after the experiment started peaked in 1995 and then decreased slowly to a steady level of 9 2 to 10 3 soil c n ratio remained similar between pk npk npkm and npkm during the initial five experimental years whereas the ratio in the pk and npk treatments became much greater as compared to that in the npkm and npkm treatments during 1996 2012 over all treatments and years the highest c n ratio was observed in pk on average of the 22 experimental years the c n ratios in npkm and npkm were 2 9 and 4 9 significantly lower than the ratio in npk respectively table s3 4 discussion 4 1 long term fertilization effects on crop yields and n use efficiency our study showed significantly higher crop yields in the treatments receiving both manure and chemical fertilizers than those in the chemical solely treatments for most of the experimental years 2001 2012 results supported the previous finding by wei et al 2016 who found that application of organic plus chemical fertilizers significantly increased yields of wheat maize and rice by an average increment rate of 29 as compared to organic fertilizer only and 8 compared to chemical fertilizer only han et al 2004 and singh et al 2009 also observed higher yields following combined applications of manure and chemical fertilizers and they attributed the positive effects to improved plant nutrient uptake efficiency despite the balanced chemical npk fertilizers also significantly increased crop yields compared to pk the beneficial effect degraded over a long term so npk treatment was not recommend to adopted in a long term period in particular our npkm and npkm treatments presented more pronounced benefits on yields of both wheat and maize after 10 years of manure application fig 2 elsewhere kato and yamagishi 2011 and rathod et al 2013 also found that increase in yield production by manure application compared to chemical fertilizer application was greater over long term than over short term it would be valuable to see the accumulative wheat yield was 90 mg ha 1 and maize yield was 130 mg ha 1 gained corresponding to the total input of 104 mg manure c in npkm treatment over this period in npkm treatment higher manure c input but little additional accumulative wheat 94 mg ha 1 and maize yield 131 mg ha 1 were gained that was to say a greater turnover rate of input c to crop yields in npkm treatment than npkm treatment therefore manure application should be practiced in addition to fertilizer application to achieve long term yield benefits in the north china plain on average of the 22 experimental years nue ranged from 12 3 in npkm to 30 1 in npk and 14 8 in npkm and the nue values were significant between npk and manure treatments fig 3 the considerably lower nue induced by surplus manure application in npkm compared to npkm suggests little agronomic benefits of over using manure indeed npkm even resulted in lower crop yields than npkm providing surplus n application leads to lower nue but elevated risk of n losses to the environment ju et al 2009 over use of manures should be avoided to achieve long term agronomic and environmental sustainability 4 2 long term fertilization effects on soc stocks over 22 years of manure applications soc stocks in the npkm and npkm treatments were significantly enhanced by 20 3 and 34 4 respectively compared to the npk treatment incorporation of manure 23 1 25 8 mg c ha 1 along with npk sequestered significantly higher c as compared to the application of npk fertilizers alone 19 2 mg c ha 1 the rate of carbon sequestration improved with the incorporation of manure 0 49 0 50 mg c ha 1 yr 1 along with npk as compared to the application of npk 0 41 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the initial 10 years while the results presented 0 99 1 17 vs 0 25 mg ha 1 yr 1 during 2001 2012 similar results were reported by chaudhary et al 2017 who found that repeated applications of farm yard manure in combination with chemical fertilizers for 15 years sequestered 50 more c than chemical fertilizer alone on one hand a higher rates of soc sequestration towards the later years of the study are a result of the higher soc stocks on the other hand the manure treatments are also likely to have elevated soil n and other nutrients thus the higher rates of sequestration towards the later years may be driven by nutrients supporting crop growth as well as greater microbial processing into more stable soc forms the increase in soc associated with manure application results partly from the direct inputs of organic matter to the soil and further from the additional inputs of c in crop residues benefited from the fertilization effects of manure nutrients jalali and ranjbar 2009 the considerable increase in soc stocks supports the current recommendation of combining application of chemical fertilizers with animal manures to achieve long term benefits of soil fertility and crop production across china even though soc increased substantially in both npkm and npkm over the 22 years soc in both treatments have not reached equilibrium or saturation a number of studies have attempted to estimate the saturation stage of soc for example wang et al 2018 reported that soc was nearing equilibrium under combined chemical fertilizer and manure applications through a 33 year field experiment in a fluvo aquic sandy loam soil however han et al 2016 estimated that the c sequestration duration following combined application of chemical fertilizer and manure in chinese soils would range from 26 to 117 years they attributed the high variability in the c sequestration duration to the large range of climatic regions moreover the duration of c saturation can be greatly influenced by soil characteristics and mainly fine soil mineral particles and agricultural management practices including fertilization and tillage six et al 2002 stewart et al 2009 hassink 1997 so results of the current study suggest that the fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain have a high potential to sequestrate c and that more manure be applied to build up soc pool across the region it would be valuable to see the temporal patterns of plant biomass production alongside the soc data for example the total input of manure at 4 7 mg c per year as manure in npkm treatment then 104 mg manure c was input over 22 years to gain 33 4 mg soc stocks that is to say the turnover efficiency of manure c to soc was 32 in npkm treatment it included 173 mg manure c input over 22 years yet little additional soc gain 40 4 mg soc stocks and a low turnover efficiency was observed 23 the results indicated that the excessive manure applied in npkm was not agronomical profitable compared to npkm 4 3 long term fertilization effects on tn stocks combined application of chemical fertilizer and manure npkm and npkm significantly increased tn stocks than npk by an average of 26 2 and 40 4 respectively table s3 similar results were reported for other long term fertilizer experiments with experimental durations ranging from 10 to 100 years giacometti et al 2013 purakayastha et al 2008 the manure treatments produced more crop biomass the more extensive root systems may have increased soil organic n pool also the positive balance of soil tn was likely partially due to the release of n from manure bhandari et al 2002 kundu et al 2007 similar to the trends of soc stocks tn stocks in all the treatments showed an increasing trend over the experimental duration in the npk treatment tn stock increased from 1 7 to 2 4 mg n ha 1 confirming the positive effect of chemical fertilizers on tn pool an even greater increase in tn stock was found in the manure treatments from 2 0 mg n ha 1 to 3 7 4 1 mg n ha 1 without any indication of reaching equilibrium the increase in tn was attributed to the continuously greater n inputs through manure or fertilizer and partly due to an enhancement of net n immobilization following the application of manure li et al 2016 elsewhere gao et al 2015 found that tn stocks in the plow layer of fluvo aquic soil of north china increased for a period of up to 33 years without reaching equilibrium hassink 1997 showed that the decrease in clay and silt associated c and n upon cultivation of soils was generally less than the decrease in c and n in the particle size fraction 20 μm confirms that clay and sift particles protect c against microbial degradation according to this opinion the amounts of in the particle size fraction 20 μm might be very high and vulnerable to microbial degradation in the present study thus could not reached an equilibrium and saturation level findings of our study indicated that the fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain has the potentials to further sequestrate n 4 4 relationship between soc pool and tn pool a significant positive relationship was observed between soc and tn table 4 indicating greater fixation of n applied to soils as a function of increasing soil organic c it is worth noting that the higher sequestration of n in the 0 20 cm soil depth in npkm and npkm than in npk was associated with the greater amount of annual c added with manure in npkm and npkm regarding temporal dynamics effects of manure incorporation on promoted growth rate of soc pool occurred earlier than that of tn pool these findings indicated the significance of applying more organic c with manure to build up tn pool in the fluvo aquic soil combined application of chemical fertilizer and manure seems necessary for increasing crop production and soil fertility in unfertile fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain the changes in soil c n ratio can reflect the capacity of n retention by microbial communities mooshammer et al 2014 and also reflects the interaction of soc and n cycling and the stability of soil organic matter tong et al 2009 the c and n application source and rate can affect soil c n ratio for example large amounts of active c and n in manures are responsible for the increase in n immobilization in the npkm and npkm treatments chemical fertilizer n can promote soil mineralization malhi and lemke 2007 but the mineralized nutrients cannot be re immobilized immediately under conditions limited by c source in line with this our results showed that the addition of organic manure plus chemical fertilizers reduced the c n ratio compared to the npk treatment which indicated a larger n mineralization rate in the soil with manure applied the low soil c n ratio indicates insufficient c in the cropping system which may limit n immobilization by soil microorganisms accoe et al 2004 and lead to high n losses gundersen et al 1998 therefore it is crucial to improve soil organic matter content and enhancing the potential of soil n immobilization through optimal manure management in addition to agronomic considerations our study sheds light on environmental nutrient management previous studies showed that nh3 volatilization was the major n loss pathway in the wheat maize cropping system on fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain ju et al 2009 across the region n losses are dominated by excessive fertilizer n applications therefore recommendations are made to substitute part or all of the fertilizer n with manure n qiu et al 2016 application of manure can influence soil n turnover by regulating soc improvement of soc can help to increase the potential of n immobilization and reduce n losses ren et al 2014 it was confirmed by the lower c n after manure added relative to npk fig 6 indeed our experiment demonstrated a linearly correlation between soil tn and soc table 4 in this study the soil was not saturated with soc and tn despite high rates of manure were applied to the fluvo aquic soil for 22 years results point to potentially positive effects of applying manure to even further enhance soil c and n sequestration however previous studies demonstrated that application of manure at high rates could lead to n pollution to the environment liu et al 2017 gai et al 2018 in our study the manure n rate increased from 242 6 to 363 8 kg ha 1 with a total n rate from 586 3 to 707 5 kg ha 1 mnpk and 1 5mnpk treatments table 3 and the optimum n rate is about 286 388 kg ha 1 in this region ju et al 2009 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 obviously this resulted a surplus nitrogen supply relative to expected plant demand in this context integrating manure application in fertilizer recommendations is an essential strategy to improve soil productivity in north china plain however one should keep in mind that over use of manure can lead to pollution of the environment e g n leaching loss nh3 volatilization nitrogen oxides emission etc 5 conclusions this study demonstrated positive effects of long term manure applications on crop yields soc and tn stocks in north china plain compared to chemical fertilizer application combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers increased crop yields and soc and tn stocks throughout the experimental period especially during 2001 2012 notably nue was ranked npk npkm npkm during the whole experiment period after 22 years of fertilization soc and tn did not reach equilibrium indicating a further potential for soc and tn sequestration moreover the significantly positive correlation between soc and tn emphasized the importance of increasing organic c input to build up soil tn pool clearly combining application of manure at 15 22 5 t ha 1 with conventional chemical n application of 150 kg n ha 1could increase crop yield and soil c and n stocks over long term in the north china plain however it should be noted that over use of manure can also lead to elevated risk

11389,application of manure is reported to effectively improve agricultural soil fertility however the potential of annual manure applications to increase stocks of soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn needs to be better understood in this study we evaluated the long term 1991 2012 effects of various fertilization regimes on crop yield and soc and tn in the topsoil 0 20 cm of a fluvo aquic soil in a wheat triticum aestivuml maize zea mays l cropping system in the north china plain the treatments included no n fertilizer pk chemical n p k fertilizers npk npk plus 22 5 t ha 1 swine manure npkm and npk plus 33 75 t ha 1 swine manure npkm compared with npk and pk both npkm and npkm significantly increased crop yields with no significant difference between npkm and npkm npkm and npkm treatments had a lower n use efficiency nue than npk through the whole period and the average nue were 30 1 14 8 and 12 3 in npk npkm and npkm treatments respectively compared with the initial value of 17 2 17 4 mg c ha 1 and 2 01 2 07 mg n ha 1 soc and tn stocks in npkm and npkm increased by 94 7 114 2 and 83 0 98 0 over the 22 experimental years respectively without any indication of c or n saturation in the soil furthermore tn stock was positively correlated to soc stock p 0 01 added with manure indicating the significance of more organic c input from manure to build up tn pool in conclusion long term application of organic manure in combination with conventional chemical fertilization could increase crop yield and soil c and n stocks in the wheat maize cropping system of the north china plain but it should be noted that large amounts of manure n could also lead to elevated risk of environmental n losses keywords manure chemical fertilizer soil organic carbon stocks total nitrogen stocks long term experiment 1 introduction soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn stocks have attracted wide attention in the desire to mitigate increasing global atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions sainju et al 2008 macbean and peylin 2014 storing c in soils can benefit c trading and decrease co2 emissions and increasing soc and tn stocks can also improve soil quality an increase in soc typically benefits crop production through provision of an energy source for microbial nutrient cycling and improvement of soil physical and chemical properties in turn increased crop net primary production provides more plant residues returning to the soil benefiting soc sequestration in agro ecosystems pan et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 increased in soc stock could increase crop nutrient uptake thus leaded to a great soil n use efficiency duan et al 2014 increasing soil n use efficiency can also reduce the application rate and farmers expenses on fertilizers and protect the environment from the negative effects of n loss compared to natural ecosystems soc and tn stocks in agro ecosystems are more complex dynamic and difficult to capture due to often intensive and repeated disturbances associated with management practices such as fertilizer applications qiu et al 2016 cao et al 2016 ren et al 2017 in this context long term field experiments provide unique opportunities to evaluate impacts of management practices on dynamics of soc and tn stocks over years fertilizer application has become a conventional agronomic practice to increase soc and tn stocks in agro ecosystems depending on the availability of nutrient sources common fertilization practices include application of chemical fertilizer such as n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers organic fertilizers such as animal manures and crop residuals or combinations of chemical fertilizers and organic fertilizers while chemical fertilizers often have high nutrient bioavailability repeated applications of chemical fertilizers may lead to soc decline when the c input to the soil from crop materials is less than the amount of c decomposed by microbes jiang et al 2014 in contrast application of livestock manure can supply substantial amounts of c n and other nutrients to soils he et al 2015 liu et al 2016 thus this practice is widely recommended to maintain or improve soc and tn stocks watts et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 however previous studies demonstrated that application of manure at high rates could lead to n pollution to the environment liu et al 2017 however there is still a lack of understanding of the extent to which different long term fertilization practices affect soc and tn stocks obviously temporal trends of soc and tn stocks greatly depend on the balance between input and output of c and n in the cropping system in agro ecosystems rhizodeposition residues of crop root and stubble and organic fertilizers are the main c inputs to the soil while emission of co2 through mineralization and respiration are the main c outputs stock of soc is largely related to organic c input to the soil for instance an increase of organic c input associated with high crop yields resulted in an increase of the soc stocks by 32 87 zhang et al 2016 a number of field experiments reported that soc stocks increased under practices of balanced fertilization and organic amendments li and han 2016 mi et al 2016 mujuru et al 2016 however the response of soc stock to fertilization also depends on the saturation status of soc stock gulde et al 2008 stewart et al 2009 indeed several long term experiments showed that soc increased sharply as a function of increasing organic c inputs when soc was far less saturated but changed slightly or tended to level out after soc reached certain levels six et al 2002 kundu et al 2007 tong et al 2009 in general trends of soil tn follow dynamics of soc because both n and c are bound to organic compounds manzoni and porporato 2009 in a study on fluvo aquic soil of north china gao et al 2015 reported that both soc and tn contents gradually increased and did not reach the saturation during the 33 year field experiment in a wheat maize rotation system however a different pattern was found over an even longer time frame in a swedish long term experiment kätterer et al 2011 found that soc continuously increased after 54 years of manure applications in the rothamsted long term experiment johnston et al 2009 reported that soc would even continue to increase after the 150 years of manure applications over a short or medium term losses or gains of soc and tn and their resulting changes in soil quality are difficult to assess due to spatial and temporal variabilities hassink 1997 in contrast analysis of long time data series can provide more insights on the potential enhancement of soc and tn by fertilization north china plain is one of the major dryland cereal production regions in china however crop yield in a large area of the region is limited by poor soil fertility related to low soc and tn stocks despite previous reports on enhancement of soc and tn stocks by long term fertilization practices in china cong et al 2012 meng et al 2014 there is still a lack of understanding on the potential of high input fertilization to increase soc and tn stocks in the low fertility soils in the north china plain based on a long term fertilization experiment in the north china plain this study aimed to 1 quantify the 22 year effects of manure and chemical fertilizer application on crop yield and n use efficiency and 2 investigate the long term change rates of soc and tn stocks and c n interactions in response to fertilization practices the results will provide scientific basis for increasing crop yield through improving nutrient management in north china plain and elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the long term fertilizer experiment was established in 1991 at the changping haplic luvisol soil experimental station 40 13 n 116 14 e of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences the station is located in beijing fig 1 in the north china plain as monitored at the station the average annual precipitation is 600 mm and the annual average temperature is 11 c the long term experimental field has a fluvo aquic soil with light loam texture 10 2 clay with a particle size 0 002 mm this type of soil is widely distributed in the north china plain the soil is classified as typic haplustalf soil by u s soil classification baseline soil physical and chemical properties of 0 20 cm soil layer at the start of the experiment in 1991 were bulk density 1 6 g cm 3 ph 8 2 soc 7 1 g kg 1 tn 0 8 g kg 1 c n 9 0 and tp 0 6 g kg 1 the field experiment employed a wheat and maize double cropping system typical in the north china plain wheat triticum aestivuml zhongmai 12 was planted in early october and harvested in early june next year and maize zea mays l jingdan 28 was planted in mid june and harvested in late september the same wheat and maize cultivar was used all over the experimental duration a randomized block design with four fertilizer treatments and three replicated blocks field plot size 20 m 10 m was used fig 1 specifically the treatments were 1 chemical p and k fertilizers but no n pk 2 chemical n p and k fertilizers npk 3 22 5 t ha 1 swine manure plus npk npkm and 4 33 75 t ha 1 swine manure plus npk npkm in both npkm and npkm swine manure was annually applied after harvesting maize in fall the manure contained 30 g c kg 1 and 15 4 g n kg 1 on a dry weight basis the same below all manure was applied as basal fertilizer at a rate of 22 5 t ha 1 year 1 in the npkm treatment and 33 75 t ha 1 year 1 in npkm the same rates of chemical fertilizers urea for n calcium superphosphate for p and potassium chloride for k were applied to wheat and maize before sowing in october and june respectively for both wheat and maize 2 3 of the chemical n and all p and k fertilizers were applied as basal fertilizer and 1 3 of the chemical n fertilizer as topdressing both chemical and manure basal fertilizers were uniformly broadcast on the soil surface and immediately incorporated into soil 0 20 cm depth by plowing before sowing the detailed fertilizer rates in each treatment are listed in table 1 2 2 soil and plant sampling and analysis before the start of the field experiment in 1991 soil samples were collected from the plow layer 0 20 cm across the field from 1991 to 2012 soil samples were collected annually from each field plot approximately 15 d after harvesting maize specifically three replicate soil cores were taken randomly from each plot using a 5 cm internal diameter auger and the samples were mixed together in a plastic bag to produce a composite sample after removing roots and stones the soil was air dried ground and passed through a 1 mm sieve prior to determining soc and tn contents concentration of soc was analyzed with dichromate oxidation and tn was determined by using the kjeldahl digestion method kdy 9830 beijing soil ph was measured with deionized water 1 5 soil water soil tp was determined by using the molybdate ascorbic acid method perkinelmer uv 25 after oxidative digestion of the soil with h2so4 hclo4 the analytical methods were described in details by gai et al 2016 for each plot maize and wheat plants were harvested manually close to the ground with sickles and all harvested materials were removed from the field thus only roots and shed leaf litter were returned to the soil for each plot five plant samples were collected from the harvested plants separated for grain and straws and then air dried threshed and oven dried at 70 c to constant dry weight for further analyses of nutrient concentrations plant tn concentration was determined after digesting the samples with h2so4 h2o2 using the micro kjeldahl method page and miller 1982 grain yields were determined based on the oven dried samples for each plot 2 3 estimation of soc and tn stocks and c n inputs into soil the stocks of soc and tn were calculated as follows s c bd h 10 1 where sis stock of soc t ha 1 or tn t ha 1 c is concentration of soc g kg 1 or tn g kg 1 bd is the soil bulk density g cm 3 h is the soil sampling depth cm in studies where bd was not determined directly it was estimated using following equation song et al 2005 bd 0 0048 lnsoc 1 377 where soc is soil organic carbon content g c kg 1 the c inputs to the soil included c from both manure and crop residues we assumed that the amount of crop residues roots exudation and dead materials were equivalent to 30 of the aboveground dry matter production kundu et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 and that 75 of wheat root biomass and 85 of maize root biomass were distributed in the top 20 cm of the soil jiang et al 2014 the n inputs to the soil included fertilizer n crop biomass n and atmospheric n deposition the fertilizer n input was calculated as nf nc yom nom where nf is the n input in each fertilization treatment kg n ha 1 year 1 nc is the n input from chemical n fertilizers kg n ha 1 year 1 yom is the amount of manure applied kg ha 1 year 1 and nom is the content of n in the manure applied crop biomass n refers to the amount of n in crop roots and crop residues that was returned to soil after harvesting the crop the crop biomass n was estimated separately for maize and wheat residue biomass of both maize and wheat was calculated based on a residue straw ratio of 0 3 kundu et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 the roots of crops were collected and dried to constant weight at 80 and the n content of root biomass was determined by kjeldahl methods the atmospheric n deposition fluxused in the budget was 32 5 kg n ha 1 year 1 an averaged value across beijing zhang et al 2006 the n use efficiency nue has important agronomic and environmental implications on the n utilization and its fate in the environment for both wheat and maize nue is defined as the crop uptake of n from fertilization divided by the total n applied n u e n u n 0 n a 100 where nu kg n ha 1 is the total n uptake by crop grain plus straw in treatments applied with chemical and or manure n n0 kg n ha 1 is the crop n uptake in the unfertilized treatment i e the pk treatment and na is the total n applied in the fertilizer treatment as a norm the n in the roots was not included in the calculation 2 4 data analysis the results were expressed as mean standard deviation figures were plotted with the microsoft office excel 2013 statistical analysis was performed by using the statistical analysis system sas version 9 1 treatment effects on response variables were tested with one way analysis of variance anova by comparing the treatment means using duncan s multiple range test the correlation between variables was analyzed at p 0 05 using sas a significant level of p 0 05 was used in all the tests 3 results 3 1 crop yields and n use efficiency long term effects of fertilization on crop yields and nue were evaluated for which the averaged yield and nue were presented by periods 1 from 1991 to 1995 1 5 yr 2 1996 to 2000 6 10 yr 3 2001 to 2005 11 15 yr and 4 2006 to 2012 16 22 yr all fertilizer treatments increased both wheat and maize yields over long term especially after 10 years of fertilization with different rates of increase among the treatments fig 2 the pk treatment had the smallest increase from 862 kg wheat ha 1yr 1and 2191 kg maize ha 1yr 1 during 1 10 yrto 1604 kg wheat ha 1yr 1and 3083 kg maize ha 1yr 1during 11 22 yr during the same time intervals average wheat yield in npk npkm and npkm increased from 2530 3228 and 3131 to 3063 4060 and 4334 kg ha 1yr 1 and maize yield increased from 2915 4302 and 3999 to 4515 5995 and 6124 kg ha 1yr 1 respectively on average of 22 years npkm and npkm had significantly higher crop yields than other treatments p 0 05 wheat yields in npkm and npkm were 30 8 and 35 3 higher than the yield in npk respectively and maize yields were 37 1 and 36 1 higher table s1 however no significant difference in crop yield was found between npkm and npkm even though the yields in npkm and npkm tended to differ general trends of nue differed between the treatments and also at different experimental periods on average nue in npk npkm and npkm were 32 3 15 7 and 13 8 respectively during 2006 to 2012 all with an obvious increase from 28 2 14 1 and 10 5 of the years 1991 to 1995 notably npkm had a relatively low nue compared to npk during the whole experiment period treatment ranking npk npkm npkm the npkm treatment had relatively lower nue than npkm possibly because the larger amount of n applied in npkm appeared to be surplus over the entire 22 experimental years nue averaged 30 1 in npk 14 8 in npkm and 12 3 in npkm and significant difference was detected between the treatments table s2 additional manure amendment on the basis of existing n fertilizer application rate decreased nue by 50 8 59 1 relative to npk 3 2 c inputs and soc stocks averaged crop biomass c inputs of every five experimental years and manure c inputs throughout the long term experiment are shown for different treatments in table 2 compared to the c inputs from crop biomass 280 3 447 6 kg c ha 1 yr 1 manure was the main c source in npkm 4725 kg c ha 1 yr 1 and npkm 7875 kg c ha 1 yr 1 in contrast all c inputs in pk and npk were sourced from crop biomass and the c input in npk was two fold more than that in pk consistent with the trends of crop yields the input of c from crop biomass during 2001 2012 was significantly higher than that during 1991 2000 in all fertilization treatments except pk while the c input in the pk treatment decreased from 111 2 1 5 yr to 80 4 kg c ha 1 yr 1 16 22 yr the c input in npk npkm and npkm all increased by about 37 1 53 4 and 59 7 respectively for the same time periods furthermore the c input from crop biomass in npk was lower than that with the application of manure over the 22 years however there were no statistical differences among those treatments soc stock in all the treatments trended to increase with time compared with the initial values of 16 6 18 1 17 2 and 17 4 mg c ha 1 in pk npk npkm and npkm treatments soc stock increased by 14 8 23 7 94 7 and 114 2 over the 22 years respectively fig 4a while soc stocks in pk and npk that had slight soc increase over years were poorly related to the experimental years r2 of regression were only 0 14 and 0 19 respectively soc stocks in npkm and npkm increased with time r2 were 0 85 and 0 82 respectively these results indicated that soc stocks in agricultural fields would increase with the prolonging time of manure applications on average of the 22 years soc stocks in npkm and npkm significantly increased by 20 3 and 34 4 respectively as compared to npk table s3 for npkm and npkm the increment rates of soc stocks in the initial 10 years 0 50 and 0 49 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively were much lower than that during 2001 2012 0 99 and 1 17 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively fig 5a in contrast the increment rates of soc stocks in the initial 10 years 0 31 and 0 41 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively were much higher than that during 2001 2012 0 22 and 0 25 mg ha 1 yr 1 respectively for the pk and npk treatments fig 5a meanwhile a higher increasing rate of soc stocks was obtained with higher manure application rate 3 3 n inputs and tn stocks the average annual n inputs from chemical fertilizer manure n deposition and roots and crop residues under different treatments are shown in table 3 fertilizer and manure were the main sources of n in the npk npkm and npkm treatments the total n inputs in npkm and npkm were about 1 7 2 1 times more than the n input in npk owing to the contribution of the manure n given the same level of n deposition flux in this region 32 5 kg n ha 1 n input from roots and crop residues followed npkm and npkm 11 2 kg n ha 1 npk 5 5 kg n ha 1 pk 2 9 kg n ha 1 table 3 similar to soc stocks tn stocks in npkm and npkm considerably increased from 2 0 mg n ha 1 at the start of the experiment to 3 7 4 1 mg n ha 1in 2012 increased by 83 0 98 0 fitted with an function of time r2 of regression were 0 71 and 0 84 respectively in contrast tn stocks in pk stabilized at the level of 1 7 2 0 mg n ha 1 and in the npk treatment tn stocks fluctuated between 1 7 and 2 4 mg n ha 1 throughout the study period overall long term fertilization regimes significantly increased tn stocks with increasing manure application rate and the treatment effects ranked as npkm npkm npk pk fig 4b over the 22 experimental years combined application of chemical fertilizers and animal manure significantly increased tn stocks by 26 2 in npkm to 40 4 in npkm compared to npk table s3 with a similar trend to soc stocks the increment rate of tn stocks in npkm and npkm during the initial 10 years 0 08 0 07 mg ha 1 yr 1 were much lower than that during 2001 2012 0 15 0 16 mg ha 1 yr 1 fig 5b in pk and npk however the increasing rate of tn stocks did not change over the two experimental periods fig 5b meanwhile a higher increasing rate of tn stocks was obtained when higher rate of manure was applied as for soc results suggest that soil n sequestration ability improve along with the increase of tn stocks by amendment of manure 3 4 relationships between soc and tn regression analysis showed that soil tn content was linearly correlated with soc especially for the npkm and npkm treatments table 4 the two regressions were significant p 0 01 with correlation coefficients r2 of 0 70 and 0 80 respectively however soil c n ratios in the four fertilization treatments fluctuated markedly between years from 8 2 to 12 3 which might be due to the annual variation in the c inputs as well as the different dynamics of soc and tn contents fig 6 the c n ratio firstly increased after the experiment started peaked in 1995 and then decreased slowly to a steady level of 9 2 to 10 3 soil c n ratio remained similar between pk npk npkm and npkm during the initial five experimental years whereas the ratio in the pk and npk treatments became much greater as compared to that in the npkm and npkm treatments during 1996 2012 over all treatments and years the highest c n ratio was observed in pk on average of the 22 experimental years the c n ratios in npkm and npkm were 2 9 and 4 9 significantly lower than the ratio in npk respectively table s3 4 discussion 4 1 long term fertilization effects on crop yields and n use efficiency our study showed significantly higher crop yields in the treatments receiving both manure and chemical fertilizers than those in the chemical solely treatments for most of the experimental years 2001 2012 results supported the previous finding by wei et al 2016 who found that application of organic plus chemical fertilizers significantly increased yields of wheat maize and rice by an average increment rate of 29 as compared to organic fertilizer only and 8 compared to chemical fertilizer only han et al 2004 and singh et al 2009 also observed higher yields following combined applications of manure and chemical fertilizers and they attributed the positive effects to improved plant nutrient uptake efficiency despite the balanced chemical npk fertilizers also significantly increased crop yields compared to pk the beneficial effect degraded over a long term so npk treatment was not recommend to adopted in a long term period in particular our npkm and npkm treatments presented more pronounced benefits on yields of both wheat and maize after 10 years of manure application fig 2 elsewhere kato and yamagishi 2011 and rathod et al 2013 also found that increase in yield production by manure application compared to chemical fertilizer application was greater over long term than over short term it would be valuable to see the accumulative wheat yield was 90 mg ha 1 and maize yield was 130 mg ha 1 gained corresponding to the total input of 104 mg manure c in npkm treatment over this period in npkm treatment higher manure c input but little additional accumulative wheat 94 mg ha 1 and maize yield 131 mg ha 1 were gained that was to say a greater turnover rate of input c to crop yields in npkm treatment than npkm treatment therefore manure application should be practiced in addition to fertilizer application to achieve long term yield benefits in the north china plain on average of the 22 experimental years nue ranged from 12 3 in npkm to 30 1 in npk and 14 8 in npkm and the nue values were significant between npk and manure treatments fig 3 the considerably lower nue induced by surplus manure application in npkm compared to npkm suggests little agronomic benefits of over using manure indeed npkm even resulted in lower crop yields than npkm providing surplus n application leads to lower nue but elevated risk of n losses to the environment ju et al 2009 over use of manures should be avoided to achieve long term agronomic and environmental sustainability 4 2 long term fertilization effects on soc stocks over 22 years of manure applications soc stocks in the npkm and npkm treatments were significantly enhanced by 20 3 and 34 4 respectively compared to the npk treatment incorporation of manure 23 1 25 8 mg c ha 1 along with npk sequestered significantly higher c as compared to the application of npk fertilizers alone 19 2 mg c ha 1 the rate of carbon sequestration improved with the incorporation of manure 0 49 0 50 mg c ha 1 yr 1 along with npk as compared to the application of npk 0 41 mg c ha 1 yr 1 in the initial 10 years while the results presented 0 99 1 17 vs 0 25 mg ha 1 yr 1 during 2001 2012 similar results were reported by chaudhary et al 2017 who found that repeated applications of farm yard manure in combination with chemical fertilizers for 15 years sequestered 50 more c than chemical fertilizer alone on one hand a higher rates of soc sequestration towards the later years of the study are a result of the higher soc stocks on the other hand the manure treatments are also likely to have elevated soil n and other nutrients thus the higher rates of sequestration towards the later years may be driven by nutrients supporting crop growth as well as greater microbial processing into more stable soc forms the increase in soc associated with manure application results partly from the direct inputs of organic matter to the soil and further from the additional inputs of c in crop residues benefited from the fertilization effects of manure nutrients jalali and ranjbar 2009 the considerable increase in soc stocks supports the current recommendation of combining application of chemical fertilizers with animal manures to achieve long term benefits of soil fertility and crop production across china even though soc increased substantially in both npkm and npkm over the 22 years soc in both treatments have not reached equilibrium or saturation a number of studies have attempted to estimate the saturation stage of soc for example wang et al 2018 reported that soc was nearing equilibrium under combined chemical fertilizer and manure applications through a 33 year field experiment in a fluvo aquic sandy loam soil however han et al 2016 estimated that the c sequestration duration following combined application of chemical fertilizer and manure in chinese soils would range from 26 to 117 years they attributed the high variability in the c sequestration duration to the large range of climatic regions moreover the duration of c saturation can be greatly influenced by soil characteristics and mainly fine soil mineral particles and agricultural management practices including fertilization and tillage six et al 2002 stewart et al 2009 hassink 1997 so results of the current study suggest that the fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain have a high potential to sequestrate c and that more manure be applied to build up soc pool across the region it would be valuable to see the temporal patterns of plant biomass production alongside the soc data for example the total input of manure at 4 7 mg c per year as manure in npkm treatment then 104 mg manure c was input over 22 years to gain 33 4 mg soc stocks that is to say the turnover efficiency of manure c to soc was 32 in npkm treatment it included 173 mg manure c input over 22 years yet little additional soc gain 40 4 mg soc stocks and a low turnover efficiency was observed 23 the results indicated that the excessive manure applied in npkm was not agronomical profitable compared to npkm 4 3 long term fertilization effects on tn stocks combined application of chemical fertilizer and manure npkm and npkm significantly increased tn stocks than npk by an average of 26 2 and 40 4 respectively table s3 similar results were reported for other long term fertilizer experiments with experimental durations ranging from 10 to 100 years giacometti et al 2013 purakayastha et al 2008 the manure treatments produced more crop biomass the more extensive root systems may have increased soil organic n pool also the positive balance of soil tn was likely partially due to the release of n from manure bhandari et al 2002 kundu et al 2007 similar to the trends of soc stocks tn stocks in all the treatments showed an increasing trend over the experimental duration in the npk treatment tn stock increased from 1 7 to 2 4 mg n ha 1 confirming the positive effect of chemical fertilizers on tn pool an even greater increase in tn stock was found in the manure treatments from 2 0 mg n ha 1 to 3 7 4 1 mg n ha 1 without any indication of reaching equilibrium the increase in tn was attributed to the continuously greater n inputs through manure or fertilizer and partly due to an enhancement of net n immobilization following the application of manure li et al 2016 elsewhere gao et al 2015 found that tn stocks in the plow layer of fluvo aquic soil of north china increased for a period of up to 33 years without reaching equilibrium hassink 1997 showed that the decrease in clay and silt associated c and n upon cultivation of soils was generally less than the decrease in c and n in the particle size fraction 20 μm confirms that clay and sift particles protect c against microbial degradation according to this opinion the amounts of in the particle size fraction 20 μm might be very high and vulnerable to microbial degradation in the present study thus could not reached an equilibrium and saturation level findings of our study indicated that the fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain has the potentials to further sequestrate n 4 4 relationship between soc pool and tn pool a significant positive relationship was observed between soc and tn table 4 indicating greater fixation of n applied to soils as a function of increasing soil organic c it is worth noting that the higher sequestration of n in the 0 20 cm soil depth in npkm and npkm than in npk was associated with the greater amount of annual c added with manure in npkm and npkm regarding temporal dynamics effects of manure incorporation on promoted growth rate of soc pool occurred earlier than that of tn pool these findings indicated the significance of applying more organic c with manure to build up tn pool in the fluvo aquic soil combined application of chemical fertilizer and manure seems necessary for increasing crop production and soil fertility in unfertile fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain the changes in soil c n ratio can reflect the capacity of n retention by microbial communities mooshammer et al 2014 and also reflects the interaction of soc and n cycling and the stability of soil organic matter tong et al 2009 the c and n application source and rate can affect soil c n ratio for example large amounts of active c and n in manures are responsible for the increase in n immobilization in the npkm and npkm treatments chemical fertilizer n can promote soil mineralization malhi and lemke 2007 but the mineralized nutrients cannot be re immobilized immediately under conditions limited by c source in line with this our results showed that the addition of organic manure plus chemical fertilizers reduced the c n ratio compared to the npk treatment which indicated a larger n mineralization rate in the soil with manure applied the low soil c n ratio indicates insufficient c in the cropping system which may limit n immobilization by soil microorganisms accoe et al 2004 and lead to high n losses gundersen et al 1998 therefore it is crucial to improve soil organic matter content and enhancing the potential of soil n immobilization through optimal manure management in addition to agronomic considerations our study sheds light on environmental nutrient management previous studies showed that nh3 volatilization was the major n loss pathway in the wheat maize cropping system on fluvo aquic soil in the north china plain ju et al 2009 across the region n losses are dominated by excessive fertilizer n applications therefore recommendations are made to substitute part or all of the fertilizer n with manure n qiu et al 2016 application of manure can influence soil n turnover by regulating soc improvement of soc can help to increase the potential of n immobilization and reduce n losses ren et al 2014 it was confirmed by the lower c n after manure added relative to npk fig 6 indeed our experiment demonstrated a linearly correlation between soil tn and soc table 4 in this study the soil was not saturated with soc and tn despite high rates of manure were applied to the fluvo aquic soil for 22 years results point to potentially positive effects of applying manure to even further enhance soil c and n sequestration however previous studies demonstrated that application of manure at high rates could lead to n pollution to the environment liu et al 2017 gai et al 2018 in our study the manure n rate increased from 242 6 to 363 8 kg ha 1 with a total n rate from 586 3 to 707 5 kg ha 1 mnpk and 1 5mnpk treatments table 3 and the optimum n rate is about 286 388 kg ha 1 in this region ju et al 2009 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 obviously this resulted a surplus nitrogen supply relative to expected plant demand in this context integrating manure application in fertilizer recommendations is an essential strategy to improve soil productivity in north china plain however one should keep in mind that over use of manure can lead to pollution of the environment e g n leaching loss nh3 volatilization nitrogen oxides emission etc 5 conclusions this study demonstrated positive effects of long term manure applications on crop yields soc and tn stocks in north china plain compared to chemical fertilizer application combined application of manure and chemical fertilizers increased crop yields and soc and tn stocks throughout the experimental period especially during 2001 2012 notably nue was ranked npk npkm npkm during the whole experiment period after 22 years of fertilization soc and tn did not reach equilibrium indicating a further potential for soc and tn sequestration moreover the significantly positive correlation between soc and tn emphasized the importance of increasing organic c input to build up soil tn pool clearly combining application of manure at 15 22 5 t ha 1 with conventional chemical n application of 150 kg n ha 1could increase crop yield and soil c and n stocks over long term in the north china plain however it should be noted that over use of manure can also lead to elevated risk
