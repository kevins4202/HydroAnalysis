10615,guanzhong plain is one of the most critical maize production areas in northwest china it is essential to study the maize irrigation requirement and improve water use efficiency in this area there is a lack of knowledge about the evaporation portioning and irrigation requirements of crops grown in this region based on evapotranspiration observed in a maize cropland using the eddy covariance ec technique during four growing seasons 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 the seasonal variation of evapotranspiration components and the crop coefficients kc for summer maize in a dry semi arid area were determined energy partitioning has an obvious seasonal variation during growing seasons the pattern of evapotranspiration partitioning has a clear seasonal variation with the development of the canopy the pattern of the ratio of transpiration t to evapotranspiration et is consistent with the canopy development for four growing seasons on a seasonal basis the ratios of t to et and e to et were comparable in addition the locally developed crop coefficients were 0 57 1 01 and 0 50 for the initial mid and late stages respectively the single crop coefficient derived from local datasets can provide a good prediction of et the kc values reported in this paper were consistent with previous studies conducted in other regions using ec systems but were generally lower than the kc values derived from et data measured by lysimeters the bowen ratio energy balance system and the soil water balance method this indicates that the variability of the locally developed crop coefficient caused by measurement methods is higher than the variability caused by climate keywords evapotranspiration partitioning energy fluxes crop coefficient eddy covariance 1 introduction evapotranspiration plays an important role in the balance of water and energy in agricultural ecosystems wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 in areas where water resources are scarce an in depth study of evapotranspiration is essential for optimal water use and management to predict crop water requirements it is essential to calculate the crop evapotranspiration etc allen et al 2011 sun et al 2012 the most widely used practical method for predicting etc is the single crop coefficient method which was reported by allen et al 1998 in the fao 56 document this method is mainly used for irrigation management and it has been applied in different agroecosystems all over the world however many studies have evidenced that the fao provided crop coefficient values for different regions are unreasonable so it is necessary to develop crop coefficients based on local datasets facchi et al 2013 gong et al 2017 kang et al 2003 li et al 2008 2003 parkes et al 2005 piccinni et al 2009 s√°nchez et al 2014 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2016 although the weighing lysimeter is widely used to measure et and calculate kc its representative area is too small rana and katerji 2000 alfieri et al 2012 another common method is eddy covariance ec which can be used to accurately measure et in a short time interval e g 30 min and its representative area is much larger than that of a lysimeter baldocchi 2003 however there are few studies on the determination of summer maize crop coefficient and et partitioning using the ec method in guanzhong plain northwest china the guanzhong plain is an important food production area of china which accounts for about two thirds of the total crop yield in shannxi province zhao et al 2018 and summer maize zea mays l is one of the most planted crops in this region li et al 2016 although some previous studies have reported the crop coefficient of summer maize in this area they were all based on et data measured by lysimeter or water balance methods kang et al 2003 parkes et al 2005 since june 2013 long term observations of et as well as meteorological and biological factors have been carried out in a summer maize field in guanzhong plain in this study water and energy fluxes were observed based on eddy covariance techniques in a maize cropland ecosystem in the dry semi humid region of northwestern china the objectives of our study were 1 to examine the reliability of the eddy covariance technique to measure et 2 to study the diurnal and seasonal variations of energy fluxes and the seasonal variations of evapotranspiration partitioning in maize fields and 3 to determine the local kc curve and study its controlling factors and then predict crop water requirements for maize in guanzhong plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and site information this experiment was conducted at the experiment field of northwest a f university 34 17 n 108 04 e 521 m a s l during june 2013 to june 2018 fig 1 the experiment field was approximately 200 m north to south by 250 m east to west the soil in the study area was silty clay loam the field capacity was 0 42 m3 m 3 the permanent wilting point was 0 0875 m3 m 3 and the bulk density was 1 35 g cm 3 the depth of groundwater through capillary action level was more than 55 m thus the water supplied by groundwater was assumed to be equal to zero the mean annual temperature was 12 9 c and the mean annual precipitation was 630 mm yu et al 2016 2018 the mean annual precipitation was 599 mm during the period of observation the wetter years were 2016 and 2017 the drier years were 2013 and 2015 and 2014 was a relatively normal precipitation year table 1 the cultivar of maize was wuke no 2 and the maximum crop height was about 190 cm in the summer maize season the schedule of management activities is shown in table 2 the field management schedule i e application of fertilizer weed control and irrigation was based on the local standard management schedule table 2 nitrogen n was applied as a urea ammonium nitrate solution and typically 180 kg n ha was applied before sowing the summer maize flood irrigation was implemented when the crops were under slight water stress i e when the soil moisture was less than 50 of plant available water and the amount of irrigation was determined by the evapotranspiration and precipitation measured by ec tower after the last irrigation yu et al 2016 2018 2 2 field measurements the ec system was installed on a height adjustable tripod the sensors were positioned 3 m above the soil surface during the maize growing season the ec system included a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific logan ut usa pointed toward the prevailing wind direction an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500a li cor lincoln ne usa and a data logger li7550 10 hz li cor lincoln ne usa the objective of this system was to measure both water and carbon fluxes between ecosystem and atmosphere net radiation was measured by a four component net radiometer installed 2 5 m above the soil surface the boundary layer meteorological measurements including wind speed and wind direction were measured with propeller anemometers r m young model 03002 5 available from campbell scientific and the air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a humidity and temperature probe model hmp60 vaisala finland all signals were logged by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific and recorded at 30 min intervals soil temperature and soil volumetric water content observations were taken at three depths 20 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface using a model 5tm dielectric permittivity meter meter environment pullman wa usa rainfall was measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge model te525mm l available from campbell scientific snowfall was measured by a weighing type precipitation gauge model ott pluvio dusseldorf germany and soil heat flux g was measured with a self tuning heat flux plate model hfp01sc l50 hukseflux delft the netherlands at 8 cm below the soil surface all sensors were calibrated and validated before installation 2 3 flux data processing eddypro software https www licor com env products eddy covariance software html was used to process observed data into 30 min interval turbulent latent le and sensible heat fluxes h post processing of ec data included 1 spike detection 2 time lag correction of h2o co2 3 frequency response correction and 4 coordinate rotation using the planar fit method presented by wilczak et al 2001 additionally during the calculation of flux data density correction was based on the method presented by webb et al 1980 the processed 30 min flux data and meteorological data were screened for anomalous or spurious values caused by system malfunction power failure and bad atmospheric conditions and those data were excluded zhang et al 2016 based on the quality analysis by eddypro software approximately 23 1 of the flux data recorded from 2013 to 2018 were deleted data gaps shorter than two hours were filled using linear interpolation and data gaps longer than two hours were filled using the average daily variation method falge et al 2001 as the low quality data usually occurred in the evening the systematic bias of filled data had limited effects on the water and energy flux analysis furthermore regression analysis between the daily available energy rn g and the sum of sensible heat and latent heat h le was carried out since this method has been widely used to evaluate the energy balance closure and the quality of ec data in previous studies to overcome the energy imbalance issue the bowen ratio method was applied to correct the measured et twine et al 2000 2 4 adjustment of kc values according to local conditions to improve accuracy when using the single kc method in a specific region fao 56 suggests using the observed durations of crop growth stages rather than the reference values fao 56 also provides equations to adjust the standard kc ini kc mid and kc lat values according to local meteorological conditions soil irrigation and management practices the adjustment of kc ini is based on the time interval between wetting events the evaporation demand of the atmosphere and the soil texture the equation for the adjustment of kc mid is as follows 1 k c m i d k c m i d t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where rh min is the mean value of the daily minimum relative humidity during the mid season growth stage u2 is the mean value for the daily wind speed at a height of 2 m over the grass during the mid season growth stage m s 1 and h is the mean crop height during the mid stage m allen et al 1998 the adjustment for kc lat is the same as for kc mid 2 5 calculations of parameters the calculation of the crop coefficient kc was as follows 2 k c e t c e t 0 where etc is the crop evapotranspiration measured by the ec system the equation used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was as follows asce ewri

interannual variability in et we calculated the canopy conductance 4 g c Œ≥ Œª e t g a Œ¥ r n g œÅ c p v p d l e Œ¥ Œ≥ the aerodynamic conductance ga was calculated using the equation proposed by monteith and unsworth 2007 5 g a u u 2 6 2 u 2 3 1 where u is the average wind speed and u is the friction velocity 2 6 evapotranspiration partitioning unlike many previous studies using sap flow combined with micro lysimeter we selected a simple and practical method to separate e and t proposed by zhou et al 2016 although the behavior of stomatal is influenced by environmental factors the potential water use efficiency uwuep at a stomatal scale in an ecosystem with a homogeneous underlying surface is assumed to be nearly constant medlyn et al 2011 and variations of actual water use efficiency uwue can be attributed to the soil evaporation zhou et al 2016 thus the method can be used to estimate t with the measured et actual uwue and estimated uwuep another assumption of this method is that the ecosystem t is equal to et at some growth stages so uwuep can be estimated using the upper bound of the ratio of gpp vpd 0 5 to et where gpp is the gross primary production and vpd is the vapor pressure deficit here we used the method reported by zhou et al 2016 which uses the 95th quantile regression between gpp vpd 0 5 and et to estimate uwuep zhou et al 2016 demonstrated that the 95th quantile regression for uwuep at flux tower sites was consistent with the uwue derived at the leaf scale for different ecosystems in addition the variability of seasonal and interannual uwuep was relatively small for a homogeneous canopy therefore t can be estimated using eq 6 6 t e t u w u e u w u e p the calculation of vpd was based on tair and rh data and the method of gap filling was the marginal distribution sampling mds method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 to calculate gpp the complete series of net ecosystem exchange nee was partitioned into gpp and respiration re using the method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 finally et was calculated using the latent heat flux and air temperature based on gpp et and vpd data t can be calculated using the method proposed by zhou et al 2016 2 7 statistical analysis the statistics we used to evaluate the performance of this method were 1 root mean squared deviation rmsd 2 relative rmsd rrmsd and 3 mean deviation md they can be calculated as follows 6 r m s d 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 7 r r m s d r m s d o a v e r a g e 8 m d 1 n p i o i where pi is the ith predicted value oi is the ith observed value oaverage is the average of the observed values and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions and energy balance the variations of climate conditions soil moisture and biological factors during the maize growth seasons over four years are shown in fig 2 and the average values of these factors for each growth stage are shown in table 1 as fig 1 a shows the daily average air temperature ranged from 7 81 c to 33 30 c the daily maximum temperature varied from 11 65 c to 42 19 c and the daily minimum temperature ranged from 5 08 c to 26 80 c considering different growth stages the average air temperatures in the initial and development stages were usually higher than in the mid and late stages fig 2 b shows the seasonal variation of rn and vpd during maize growing seasons the seasonal pattern of rn was similar to vpd during maize growing seasons daily averaged rn values were relatively high from early june to august and peak values of daily average net radiation were about 200 w m 2 due to the decrease of global radiation rn decreased in september october fig 1 c exhibits the change of canopy conductance in four maize growing seasons although we only have the observation of soil moisture at shallow surface it can reflect the root zone moisture as well daily averaged soil water content swc was maintained at a high level and the summer maize rarely suffered water stress during the four year observation period gc ranged from 0 to 2 mm s 1 during the initial stages with the development of the canopy gc reached up to 6 10 mm s 1 in the mid stage and it decreased to 5 mm s 1 in the late stage because of the senescence of the canopy fig 3 shows the linear fitting between rn g and h le for 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 the slopes were 0 73 0 85 0 71 and 0 63 the intercepts were 19 92 w m 2 14 49 w m 2 20 15 w m 2 and 25 68 w m 2 and the coefficients of determination r2 were 0 799 0 88 0 77 and 0 69 respectively the energy balance closure statistics at this area were acceptable compared with the results reported by wilson et al 2002 li 2005 and foken 2008 to overcome the problem of energy imbalance the bowen ratio method was applied to correct the measured le based on the corrected long term reliable observation data we can calculate kc and other parameters 3 2 diurnal variation of energy fluxes fig 4 shows the daily variation of rn le h and g during the four growing seasons 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 the monthly and seasonally averaged energy fluxes exhibited a single peak pattern during a day the rn was less than zero and rapidly increased in the morning reaching peak values at 12 30 p m to 13 30 p m le and h varied with rn and the peak values of le were always higher than the peak values of h during the four growing seasons the average rn le h and g ranged from 100 4 w m 2 to 120 0 w m 2 72 6 w m 2 to 87 2 w m 2 32 8 w m 2 to 43 1 w m 2 and 1 3 w m 2 to 4 0 w m 2 respectively this indicates that in the maize agroecosystem there was a larger proportion of rn transfer to le and a relatively small proportion of rn was absorbed by h the peak of g had obvious hysteresis compared to other flux components and the maximum values occurred at 14 30 p m to 15 30 p m the results were consistent with the study conducted by facchi et al 2013 at a maize cropland in italy fig 5 shows the monthly averaged diurnal variation of energy fluxes rn le h and g during four growing seasons the variation of energy partitioning shows a clear seasonal pattern the peak value of rn 524 2 w m 2 occurred in july whereas the peak value of le 342 4 w m 2 occurred in august when the leaf area index lai reached the maximum value g accounted for a low proportion compared to the other energy components during the whole growing season h was relatively high in june and july because of the low lai and high net radiation with the canopy developing more net radiation was partitioned into le rather than h and h increased slightly when the maize was harvested 3 3 seasonal variation of evapotranspiration soil evaporation and transpiration table 1 shows the mean values of meteorological factors and water fluxes in different growth stages since the vpd and lai were relatively high the average daily et was 2 22 3 45 mm day 1 in the development stage which was the highest among the four growth stages the ratio of t to et ranged from 0 11 to 0 81 during the maize growing seasons the highest values of t et usually occurred in the mid stage and the lowest values occurred in the initial or late stages fig 6 shows the seasonal patterns of daily et t and e during the maize growing seasons in 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 seasonal variations of et t and e showed similar patterns in the observations across four years at the beginning of the maize growing season the daily values of t were about 0 1 mm day 1 with the lai increasing at the development stage daily values of t increased from 1 to 4 mm day 1 due to the decrease of solar radiation and the senescence of maize in the late stage daily values of t decreased to less than 1 mm day 1 the daily values of e had a contrasting pattern with the daily values of t when lai was low a large proportion of solar radiation could transfer through the canopy to the soil surface so the soil evaporation was large compared to the transpiration with the lai increasing more radiation was intercepted by the canopy so the daily values of e decreased from around 3 mm day 1 to less than 1 mm day 1 soil evaporation especially in the initial stage had large variability after precipitation or irrigation in the initial stage soil evaporation accounted for 78 85 of et with the development of the canopy the proportion of soil evaporation in et decreased gradually in the development stage in the mid growing stage the soil evaporation was very small and the transpiration accounted for 54 81 of et when the maize entered the late stage the variation in soil evaporation was large and the ratio of e to et ranged from 39 to 89 et totals in 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 were 262 6 mm 232 9 mm 296 4 mm and 291 0 mm respectively the ratios of t to et t et were 50 3 52 4 51 3 and 53 5 for 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 respectively these values indicate that plant transpiration and soil evaporation account for a comparable proportion of evapotranspiration the ratios of e to et observed in this study were slightly higher than the ratios 36 47 2 observed by gong et al 2017 in conventional flat cultivation without mulching 3 4 single and dual crop coefficients the reference duration of the growth stages for summer maize proposed by fao 56 and the actual lengths of growth stages during the observation period are shown in table 1 the lengths of stages in the standard curves referred to the values provided by fao56 while the lengths of stages in the adjusted curves and locally developed curves were observed in the field missing data in the daily kc datasets were caused by instruments malfunctioning and bad weather conditions as fig 5 shows the daily soil evaporation in the initial stage sharply increased after rainfall or irrigation events these unreliable values were removed when calculating kc ini other daily kc values were used when calculating kc curves although irrigation and intense precipitation also caused changes in kc due to high soil evaporation fig 7 shows the daily kc values calculated using observed data black dots the fao 56 reference curve the short dot line the fao 56 adjusted curve the dashed line the locally developed kc curves using one year of data the solid lines and the locally developed kc curves using four years of data the dash dot lines with the lai increasing the daily kc increased from 0 57 to 1 01 the daily kc stayed at 1 01 in the mid stage and decreased gradually in the late stage because of the senescence of maize based on the daily kc calculated by the ratio of etc to et 0 we developed local kc curves to accurately estimate the crop water requirement the locally derived kc values in the initial stage 0 49 0 64 were generally higher than the values 0 35 provided by fao56 and consistent with the adjusted kc 0 56 based on the local climate for the kc in the mid stage the locally derived kc was lower than the standard values and the adjusted value in fao56 the variability of kc in the late stage was very large the locally derived kc in the late stage using one year data ranged from 0 48 to 0 82 depending on the soil moisture and the grain moisture when harvested the variability of the locally derived kc mid based on the one year dataset was small and the kc values derived from the one year dataset were comparable with the kc mid values derived from the four year dataset table 3 fig 8 shows the seasonal variation of estimated and measured et as well as the linear regression analysis between measured et eta and estimated et ete for four growing seasons the rmsd ranged from 0 45 mm to 0 68 mm the rrmsd ranged from 18 9 to 26 4 the md ranged from 0 04 mm to 0 25 mm and the r2 ranged from 79 9 to 88 in total the estimated et was slightly greater than the observed value except in 2013 this indicates that the crop coefficient method can provide a good prediction of daily et therefore we can use the locally derived kc curve to guide the irrigation strategy the highest differences between estimated et and measured et usually occurred before the mid stage which was related to the variation of soil evaporation after precipitation or irrigation moreover the kc curve cannot characterize the et in the initial and development stages as accurately as in the mid and late stages fig 9 shows the basal crop coefficient kcb ks and soil evaporation ke of maize the basal crop coefficient kcb ks of summer maize showed a similar pattern as kc and plant transpiration but the magnitudes of kcb ks were lower than kc kcb ks values ranged from nearly 0 to 0 9 the maximum values usually occurred around 60 days after emergence dae 60 in the early and rapid growth stages kcb ks gradually increased from 0 5 to 0 9 as the canopy developed in the mid stage kcb ks ranged with great variability from 0 4 to 0 9 which was lower than the values reported in other literature reported mid season kcb values of maize were 1 05 rosa et al 2012 1 10 zhao et al 2013 1 12 martins et al 2013 and 1 15 zhang et al 2013 in the late stage kcb ks linearly decreased from 0 5 to 0 2 the four year averaged soil evaporation coefficient ke of summer maize decreased with increasing lai and land cover from dae 0 to dae 75 fig 8 peak values of ke decreased from around 0 7 to around 0 2 with increasing dae with the maize approaching maturity ke increased from around 0 2 to around 0 7 the variability of ke was greater than kcb ks the reason is that soil evaporation is more sensitive to surface moisture than plant transpiration maize growth and senescence rates vary with maize variety weather soil nutrition level and field management practice the most vital aspect of developing appropriate crop coefficient values is the phenology the largest seasonal weather effect on plant growth in temperate climates is during the early season when low air and soil temperatures may delay crop growth by several days therefore developing kcb values based on growing degree day gdd rather than dae would further improve kcb estimates 4 discussion 4 1 effects of physiological and meteorology factors on kc fig 10 displays the nonlinear curve fitting between kc and canopy conductance gc the relationships between kc and gc were statistically significant during four seasons the determination coefficients were 0 63 0 92 0 82 and 0 75 kc increased rapidly when gc increased from 0 to 6 mm 1 indicating that the biological factor is the primary factor in determining the crop coefficient but kc was insensitive when gc exceeded 6 mm 1 ding et al 2015 reported a similar relationship between gc and kc for a spring maize field in northwest china in addition we analyzed the relationship between kc and lai but the lai cannot explain as much variability in et as gc this finding contrasts with some studies which found that lai can explain more variability of kc than gc because the variability of soil evaporation was high the relationship between lai and kc was not as significant as gc xu et al 2018 also reported that the canopy size can significantly affect the crop coefficient with larger canopy sizes leading to higher crop coefficients 4 2 variation of the maize kc in different regions a review of locally developed kc mid of maize in other regions the location of the study area climate type and the instrument used to measure et are included in table 4 most of the kc mid values calculated using the data measured by lysimeter are higher than those calculated using the data measured by ec systems due to a limited representative area lysimeters are prone to overestimating et compared with other instruments rana and katerji 2000 alfieri et al 2012 although ec systems may underestimate et because of flaws with their energy balance closure ec systems can accurately capture et information over short term periods in large areas the calculated kc mid of this study was consistent with the kc mid reported in shouyang shanxi gong et al 2017 nebraska usa suyker and verma 2009 and landriano italy facchi et al 2013 and was slightly higher than the kc mid of maize planted at hexi corridor ji et al 2017 however the kc mid in this area was much lower than the results reported by li et al 2008 in wuwei china and by payero and irmak 2011 in north platte nebraska usa using ec systems it was also slightly lower than the kc mid reported by zhao et al 2010 in pingchuan china using the bowen ratio energy balance breb system although parkes et al 2005 and kang et al 2003 proposed a kc value of maize in this area they used the lysimeter method to measure the actual et moreover due to the variety of updated and improved farming practices and climate change it is necessary to use a more precise method to determine the crop coefficient using the eddy covariance method the calculated kc was significantly lower than the results reported by parkes et al 2005 and kang et al 2003 it was also lower than the kc values in studies conducted in uvalde tx usa piccinni et al 2009 luancheng china liu et al 2002 naiman china li et al 2003 beijing china xu et al 2018 fars iran shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 bushland tx usa howell et al 2006 and karnal india tyagi et al 2003 which used lysimeter et data to derive kc in addition using the soil water balance method djaman irmak reported that the locally developed kc mid in north platte was 1 08 1 26 according to the discussion the calculated kc not only varies with the climate but is also affected by the et measurement method sometimes the variability caused by the method of et measurement is more significant than the variability caused by climate conditions 5 conclusion based on a four year observation period using an ec system we derived the local crop coefficient curve and studied evapotranspiration partitioning in a summer maize cropland due to the imbalance of energy we corrected le data before we calculated the actual et both energy partitioning and evapotranspiration partitioning have significant seasonal variability rn was mainly consumed by h during the initial and late stages whereas rn was mainly absorbed by water vapor and transferred into latent heat during the development and mid stages in the initial stage soil evaporation accounted for 78 85 of the et with the development of the canopy the proportion of soil evaporation in et decreased gradually in the mid growing stage the soil evaporation was very small and the transpiration accounted for 54 81 of the et the crop coefficients derived by local datasets were 0 57 1 01 and 0 50 in the initial mid and late stages respectively the locally developed kc curve can provide a good prediction of the crop water requirement the variability in crop coefficient at different regions was high which was attributed to the differences in climate and measurement methods different measurement methods can result in great variability of the crop coefficient the kc calculated using et datasets from lysimeter measurements ranged from 1 20 to 1 53 which was significantly higher than the kc calculated using ec datasets although lysimeters are widely used as a standard method to measure et lysimeters commonly overestimate kc and crop evapotranspiration

10615,guanzhong plain is one of the most critical maize production areas in northwest china it is essential to study the maize irrigation requirement and improve water use efficiency in this area there is a lack of knowledge about the evaporation portioning and irrigation requirements of crops grown in this region based on evapotranspiration observed in a maize cropland using the eddy covariance ec technique during four growing seasons 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 the seasonal variation of evapotranspiration components and the crop coefficients kc for summer maize in a dry semi arid area were determined energy partitioning has an obvious seasonal variation during growing seasons the pattern of evapotranspiration partitioning has a clear seasonal variation with the development of the canopy the pattern of the ratio of transpiration t to evapotranspiration et is consistent with the canopy development for four growing seasons on a seasonal basis the ratios of t to et and e to et were comparable in addition the locally developed crop coefficients were 0 57 1 01 and 0 50 for the initial mid and late stages respectively the single crop coefficient derived from local datasets can provide a good prediction of et the kc values reported in this paper were consistent with previous studies conducted in other regions using ec systems but were generally lower than the kc values derived from et data measured by lysimeters the bowen ratio energy balance system and the soil water balance method this indicates that the variability of the locally developed crop coefficient caused by measurement methods is higher than the variability caused by climate keywords evapotranspiration partitioning energy fluxes crop coefficient eddy covariance 1 introduction evapotranspiration plays an important role in the balance of water and energy in agricultural ecosystems wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 in areas where water resources are scarce an in depth study of evapotranspiration is essential for optimal water use and management to predict crop water requirements it is essential to calculate the crop evapotranspiration etc allen et al 2011 sun et al 2012 the most widely used practical method for predicting etc is the single crop coefficient method which was reported by allen et al 1998 in the fao 56 document this method is mainly used for irrigation management and it has been applied in different agroecosystems all over the world however many studies have evidenced that the fao provided crop coefficient values for different regions are unreasonable so it is necessary to develop crop coefficients based on local datasets facchi et al 2013 gong et al 2017 kang et al 2003 li et al 2008 2003 parkes et al 2005 piccinni et al 2009 s√°nchez et al 2014 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2018 yang et al 2016 although the weighing lysimeter is widely used to measure et and calculate kc its representative area is too small rana and katerji 2000 alfieri et al 2012 another common method is eddy covariance ec which can be used to accurately measure et in a short time interval e g 30 min and its representative area is much larger than that of a lysimeter baldocchi 2003 however there are few studies on the determination of summer maize crop coefficient and et partitioning using the ec method in guanzhong plain northwest china the guanzhong plain is an important food production area of china which accounts for about two thirds of the total crop yield in shannxi province zhao et al 2018 and summer maize zea mays l is one of the most planted crops in this region li et al 2016 although some previous studies have reported the crop coefficient of summer maize in this area they were all based on et data measured by lysimeter or water balance methods kang et al 2003 parkes et al 2005 since june 2013 long term observations of et as well as meteorological and biological factors have been carried out in a summer maize field in guanzhong plain in this study water and energy fluxes were observed based on eddy covariance techniques in a maize cropland ecosystem in the dry semi humid region of northwestern china the objectives of our study were 1 to examine the reliability of the eddy covariance technique to measure et 2 to study the diurnal and seasonal variations of energy fluxes and the seasonal variations of evapotranspiration partitioning in maize fields and 3 to determine the local kc curve and study its controlling factors and then predict crop water requirements for maize in guanzhong plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and site information this experiment was conducted at the experiment field of northwest a f university 34 17 n 108 04 e 521 m a s l during june 2013 to june 2018 fig 1 the experiment field was approximately 200 m north to south by 250 m east to west the soil in the study area was silty clay loam the field capacity was 0 42 m3 m 3 the permanent wilting point was 0 0875 m3 m 3 and the bulk density was 1 35 g cm 3 the depth of groundwater through capillary action level was more than 55 m thus the water supplied by groundwater was assumed to be equal to zero the mean annual temperature was 12 9 c and the mean annual precipitation was 630 mm yu et al 2016 2018 the mean annual precipitation was 599 mm during the period of observation the wetter years were 2016 and 2017 the drier years were 2013 and 2015 and 2014 was a relatively normal precipitation year table 1 the cultivar of maize was wuke no 2 and the maximum crop height was about 190 cm in the summer maize season the schedule of management activities is shown in table 2 the field management schedule i e application of fertilizer weed control and irrigation was based on the local standard management schedule table 2 nitrogen n was applied as a urea ammonium nitrate solution and typically 180 kg n ha was applied before sowing the summer maize flood irrigation was implemented when the crops were under slight water stress i e when the soil moisture was less than 50 of plant available water and the amount of irrigation was determined by the evapotranspiration and precipitation measured by ec tower after the last irrigation yu et al 2016 2018 2 2 field measurements the ec system was installed on a height adjustable tripod the sensors were positioned 3 m above the soil surface during the maize growing season the ec system included a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific logan ut usa pointed toward the prevailing wind direction an open path infrared gas analyzer li 7500a li cor lincoln ne usa and a data logger li7550 10 hz li cor lincoln ne usa the objective of this system was to measure both water and carbon fluxes between ecosystem and atmosphere net radiation was measured by a four component net radiometer installed 2 5 m above the soil surface the boundary layer meteorological measurements including wind speed and wind direction were measured with propeller anemometers r m young model 03002 5 available from campbell scientific and the air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a humidity and temperature probe model hmp60 vaisala finland all signals were logged by a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific and recorded at 30 min intervals soil temperature and soil volumetric water content observations were taken at three depths 20 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface using a model 5tm dielectric permittivity meter meter environment pullman wa usa rainfall was measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge model te525mm l available from campbell scientific snowfall was measured by a weighing type precipitation gauge model ott pluvio dusseldorf germany and soil heat flux g was measured with a self tuning heat flux plate model hfp01sc l50 hukseflux delft the netherlands at 8 cm below the soil surface all sensors were calibrated and validated before installation 2 3 flux data processing eddypro software https www licor com env products eddy covariance software html was used to process observed data into 30 min interval turbulent latent le and sensible heat fluxes h post processing of ec data included 1 spike detection 2 time lag correction of h2o co2 3 frequency response correction and 4 coordinate rotation using the planar fit method presented by wilczak et al 2001 additionally during the calculation of flux data density correction was based on the method presented by webb et al 1980 the processed 30 min flux data and meteorological data were screened for anomalous or spurious values caused by system malfunction power failure and bad atmospheric conditions and those data were excluded zhang et al 2016 based on the quality analysis by eddypro software approximately 23 1 of the flux data recorded from 2013 to 2018 were deleted data gaps shorter than two hours were filled using linear interpolation and data gaps longer than two hours were filled using the average daily variation method falge et al 2001 as the low quality data usually occurred in the evening the systematic bias of filled data had limited effects on the water and energy flux analysis furthermore regression analysis between the daily available energy rn g and the sum of sensible heat and latent heat h le was carried out since this method has been widely used to evaluate the energy balance closure and the quality of ec data in previous studies to overcome the energy imbalance issue the bowen ratio method was applied to correct the measured et twine et al 2000 2 4 adjustment of kc values according to local conditions to improve accuracy when using the single kc method in a specific region fao 56 suggests using the observed durations of crop growth stages rather than the reference values fao 56 also provides equations to adjust the standard kc ini kc mid and kc lat values according to local meteorological conditions soil irrigation and management practices the adjustment of kc ini is based on the time interval between wetting events the evaporation demand of the atmosphere and the soil texture the equation for the adjustment of kc mid is as follows 1 k c m i d k c m i d t a b 0 04 u 2 2 0 004 r h m i n 45 h 3 0 3 where rh min is the mean value of the daily minimum relative humidity during the mid season growth stage u2 is the mean value for the daily wind speed at a height of 2 m over the grass during the mid season growth stage m s 1 and h is the mean crop height during the mid stage m allen et al 1998 the adjustment for kc lat is the same as for kc mid 2 5 calculations of parameters the calculation of the crop coefficient kc was as follows 2 k c e t c e t 0 where etc is the crop evapotranspiration measured by the ec system the equation used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration et 0 was as follows asce ewri

combined with micro lysimeter we selected a simple and practical method to separate e and t proposed by zhou et al 2016 although the behavior of stomatal is influenced by environmental factors the potential water use efficiency uwuep at a stomatal scale in an ecosystem with a homogeneous underlying surface is assumed to be nearly constant medlyn et al 2011 and variations of actual water use efficiency uwue can be attributed to the soil evaporation zhou et al 2016 thus the method can be used to estimate t with the measured et actual uwue and estimated uwuep another assumption of this method is that the ecosystem t is equal to et at some growth stages so uwuep can be estimated using the upper bound of the ratio of gpp vpd 0 5 to et where gpp is the gross primary production and vpd is the vapor pressure deficit here we used the method reported by zhou et al 2016 which uses the 95th quantile regression between gpp vpd 0 5 and et to estimate uwuep zhou et al 2016 demonstrated that the 95th quantile regression for uwuep at flux tower sites was consistent with the uwue derived at the leaf scale for different ecosystems in addition the variability of seasonal and interannual uwuep was relatively small for a homogeneous canopy therefore t can be estimated using eq 6 6 t e t u w u e u w u e p the calculation of vpd was based on tair and rh data and the method of gap filling was the marginal distribution sampling mds method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 to calculate gpp the complete series of net ecosystem exchange nee was partitioned into gpp and respiration re using the method proposed by reichstein et al 2005 finally et was calculated using the latent heat flux and air temperature based on gpp et and vpd data t can be calculated using the method proposed by zhou et al 2016 2 7 statistical analysis the statistics we used to evaluate the performance of this method were 1 root mean squared deviation rmsd 2 relative rmsd rrmsd and 3 mean deviation md they can be calculated as follows 6 r m s d 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 7 r r m s d r m s d o a v e r a g e 8 m d 1 n p i o i where pi is the ith predicted value oi is the ith observed value oaverage is the average of the observed values and n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions and energy balance the variations of climate conditions soil moisture and biological factors during the maize growth seasons over four years are shown in fig 2 and the average values of these factors for each growth stage are shown in table 1 as fig 1 a shows the daily average air temperature ranged from 7 81 c to 33 30 c the daily maximum temperature varied from 11 65 c to 42 19 c and the daily minimum temperature ranged from 5 08 c to 26 80 c considering different growth stages the average air temperatures in the initial and development stages were usually higher than in the mid and late stages fig 2 b shows the seasonal variation of rn and vpd during maize growing seasons the seasonal pattern of rn was similar to vpd during maize growing seasons daily averaged rn values were relatively high from early june to august and peak values of daily average net radiation were about 200 w m 2 due to the decrease of global radiation rn decreased in september october fig 1 c exhibits the change of canopy conductance in four maize growing seasons although we only have the observation of soil moisture at shallow surface it can reflect the root zone moisture as well daily averaged soil water content swc was maintained at a high level and the summer maize rarely suffered water stress during the four year observation period gc ranged from 0 to 2 mm s 1 during the initial stages with the development of the canopy gc reached up to 6 10 mm s 1 in the mid stage and it decreased to 5 mm s 1 in the late stage because of the senescence of the canopy fig 3 shows the linear fitting between rn g and h le for 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 the slopes were 0 73 0 85 0 71 and 0 63 the intercepts were 19 92 w m 2 14 49 w m 2 20 15 w m 2 and 25 68 w m 2 and the coefficients of determination r2 were 0 799 0 88 0 77 and 0 69 respectively the energy balance closure statistics at this area were acceptable compared with the results reported by wilson et al 2002 li 2005 and foken 2008 to overcome the problem of energy imbalance the bowen ratio method was applied to correct the measured le based on the corrected long term reliable observation data we can calculate kc and other parameters 3 2 diurnal variation of energy fluxes fig 4 shows the daily variation of rn le h and g during the four growing seasons 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 the monthly and seasonally averaged energy fluxes exhibited a single peak pattern during a day the rn was less than zero and rapidly increased in the morning reaching peak values at 12 30 p m to 13 30 p m le and h varied with rn and the peak values of le were always higher than the peak values of h during the four growing seasons the average rn le h and g ranged from 100 4 w m 2 to 120 0 w m 2 72 6 w m 2 to 87 2 w m 2 32 8 w m 2 to 43 1 w m 2 and 1 3 w m 2 to 4 0 w m 2 respectively this indicates that in the maize agroecosystem there was a larger proportion of rn transfer to le and a relatively small proportion of rn was absorbed by h the peak of g had obvious hysteresis compared to other flux components and the maximum values occurred at 14 30 p m to 15 30 p m the results were consistent with the study conducted by facchi et al 2013 at a maize cropland in italy fig 5 shows the monthly averaged diurnal variation of energy fluxes rn le h and g during four growing seasons the variation of energy partitioning shows a clear seasonal pattern the peak value of rn 524 2 w m 2 occurred in july whereas the peak value of le 342 4 w m 2 occurred in august when the leaf area index lai reached the maximum value g accounted for a low proportion compared to the other energy components during the whole growing season h was relatively high in june and july because of the low lai and high net radiation with the canopy developing more net radiation was partitioned into le rather than h and h increased slightly when the maize was harvested 3 3 seasonal variation of evapotranspiration soil evaporation and transpiration table 1 shows the mean values of meteorological factors and water fluxes in different growth stages since the vpd and lai were relatively high the average daily et was 2 22 3 45 mm day 1 in the development stage which was the highest among the four growth stages the ratio of t to et ranged from 0 11 to 0 81 during the maize growing seasons the highest values of t et usually occurred in the mid stage and the lowest values occurred in the initial or late stages fig 6 shows the seasonal patterns of daily et t and e during the maize growing seasons in 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 seasonal variations of et t and e showed similar patterns in the observations across four years at the beginning of the maize growing season the daily values of t were about 0 1 mm day 1 with the lai increasing at the development stage daily values of t increased from 1 to 4 mm day 1 due to the decrease of solar radiation and the senescence of maize in the late stage daily values of t decreased to less than 1 mm day 1 the daily values of e had a contrasting pattern with the daily values of t when lai was low a large proportion of solar radiation could transfer through the canopy to the soil surface so the soil evaporation was large compared to the transpiration with the lai increasing more radiation was intercepted by the canopy so the daily values of e decreased from around 3 mm day 1 to less than 1 mm day 1 soil evaporation especially in the initial stage had large variability after precipitation or irrigation in the initial stage soil evaporation accounted for 78 85 of et with the development of the canopy the proportion of soil evaporation in et decreased gradually in the development stage in the mid growing stage the soil evaporation was very small and the transpiration accounted for 54 81 of et when the maize entered the late stage the variation in soil evaporation was large and the ratio of e to et ranged from 39 to 89 et totals in 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 were 262 6 mm 232 9 mm 296 4 mm and 291 0 mm respectively the ratios of t to et t et were 50 3 52 4 51 3 and 53 5 for 2013 2014 2015 and 2017 respectively these values indicate that plant transpiration and soil evaporation account for a comparable proportion of evapotranspiration the ratios of e to et observed in this study were slightly higher than the ratios 36 47 2 observed by gong et al 2017 in conventional flat cultivation without mulching 3 4 single and dual crop coefficients the reference duration of the growth stages for summer maize proposed by fao 56 and the actual lengths of growth stages during the observation period are shown in table 1 the lengths of stages in the standard curves referred to the values provided by fao56 while the lengths of stages in the adjusted curves and locally developed curves were observed in the field missing data in the daily kc datasets were caused by instruments malfunctioning and bad weather conditions as fig 5 shows the daily soil evaporation in the initial stage sharply increased after rainfall or irrigation events these unreliable values were removed when calculating kc ini other daily kc values were used when calculating kc curves although irrigation and intense precipitation also caused changes in kc due to high soil evaporation fig 7 shows the daily kc values calculated using observed data black dots the fao 56 reference curve the short dot line the fao 56 adjusted curve the dashed line the locally developed kc curves using one year of data the solid lines and the locally developed kc curves using four years of data the dash dot lines with the lai increasing the daily kc increased from 0 57 to 1 01 the daily kc stayed at 1 01 in the mid stage and decreased gradually in the late stage because of the senescence of maize based on the daily kc calculated by the ratio of etc to et 0 we developed local kc curves to accurately estimate the crop water requirement the locally derived kc values in the initial stage 0 49 0 64 were generally higher than the values 0 35 provided by fao56 and consistent with the adjusted kc 0 56 based on the local climate for the kc in the mid stage the locally derived kc was lower than the standard values and the adjusted value in fao56 the variability of kc in the late stage was very large the locally derived kc in the late stage using one year data ranged from 0 48 to 0 82 depending on the soil moisture and the grain moisture when harvested the variability of the locally derived kc mid based on the one year dataset was small and the kc values derived from the one year dataset were comparable with the kc mid values derived from the four year dataset table 3 fig 8 shows the seasonal variation of estimated and measured et as well as the linear regression analysis between measured et eta and estimated et ete for four growing seasons the rmsd ranged from 0 45 mm to 0 68 mm the rrmsd ranged from 18 9 to 26 4 the md ranged from 0 04 mm to 0 25 mm and the r2 ranged from 79 9 to 88 in total the estimated et was slightly greater than the observed value except in 2013 this indicates that the crop coefficient method can provide a good prediction of daily et therefore we can use the locally derived kc curve to guide the irrigation strategy the highest differences between estimated et and measured et usually occurred before the mid stage which was related to the variation of soil evaporation after precipitation or irrigation moreover the kc curve cannot characterize the et in the initial and development stages as accurately as in the mid and late stages fig 9 shows the basal crop coefficient kcb ks and soil evaporation ke of maize the basal crop coefficient kcb ks of summer maize showed a similar pattern as kc and plant transpiration but the magnitudes of kcb ks were lower than kc kcb ks values ranged from nearly 0 to 0 9 the maximum values usually occurred around 60 days after emergence dae 60 in the early and rapid growth stages kcb ks gradually increased from 0 5 to 0 9 as the canopy developed in the mid stage kcb ks ranged with great variability from 0 4 to 0 9 which was lower than the values reported in other literature reported mid season kcb values of maize were 1 05 rosa et al 2012 1 10 zhao et al 2013 1 12 martins et al 2013 and 1 15 zhang et al 2013 in the late stage kcb ks linearly decreased from 0 5 to 0 2 the four year averaged soil evaporation coefficient ke of summer maize decreased with increasing lai and land cover from dae 0 to dae 75 fig 8 peak values of ke decreased from around 0 7 to around 0 2 with increasing dae with the maize approaching maturity ke increased from around 0 2 to around 0 7 the variability of ke was greater than kcb ks the reason is that soil evaporation is more sensitive to surface moisture than plant transpiration maize growth and senescence rates vary with maize variety weather soil nutrition level and field management practice the most vital aspect of developing appropriate crop coefficient values is the phenology the largest seasonal weather effect on plant growth in temperate climates is during the early season when low air and soil temperatures may delay crop growth by several days therefore developing kcb values based on growing degree day gdd rather than dae would further improve kcb estimates 4 discussion 4 1 effects of physiological and meteorology factors on kc fig 10 displays the nonlinear curve fitting between kc and canopy conductance gc the relationships between kc and gc were statistically significant during four seasons the determination coefficients were 0 63 0 92 0 82 and 0 75 kc increased rapidly when gc increased from 0 to 6 mm 1 indicating that the biological factor is the primary factor in determining the crop coefficient but kc was insensitive when gc exceeded 6 mm 1 ding et al 2015 reported a similar relationship between gc and kc for a spring maize field in northwest china in addition we analyzed the relationship between kc and lai but the lai cannot explain as much variability in et as gc this finding contrasts with some studies which found that lai can explain more variability of kc than gc because the variability of soil evaporation was high the relationship between lai and kc was not as significant as gc xu et al 2018 also reported that the canopy size can significantly affect the crop coefficient with larger canopy sizes leading to higher crop coefficients 4 2 variation of the maize kc in different regions a review of locally developed kc mid of maize in other regions the location of the study area climate type and the instrument used to measure et are included in table 4 most of the kc mid values calculated using the data measured by lysimeter are higher than those calculated using the data measured by ec systems due to a limited representative area lysimeters are prone to overestimating et compared with other instruments rana and katerji 2000 alfieri et al 2012 although ec systems may underestimate et because of flaws with their energy balance closure ec systems can accurately capture et information over short term periods in large areas the calculated kc mid of this study was consistent with the kc mid reported in shouyang shanxi gong et al 2017 nebraska usa suyker and verma 2009 and landriano italy facchi et al 2013 and was slightly higher than the kc mid of maize planted at hexi corridor ji et al 2017 however the kc mid in this area was much lower than the results reported by li et al 2008 in wuwei china and by payero and irmak 2011 in north platte nebraska usa using ec systems it was also slightly lower than the kc mid reported by zhao et al 2010 in pingchuan china using the bowen ratio energy balance breb system although parkes et al 2005 and kang et al 2003 proposed a kc value of maize in this area they used the lysimeter method to measure the actual et moreover due to the variety of updated and improved farming practices and climate change it is necessary to use a more precise method to determine the crop coefficient using the eddy covariance method the calculated kc was significantly lower than the results reported by parkes et al 2005 and kang et al 2003 it was also lower than the kc values in studies conducted in uvalde tx usa piccinni et al 2009 luancheng china liu et al 2002 naiman china li et al 2003 beijing china xu et al 2018 fars iran shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 bushland tx usa howell et al 2006 and karnal india tyagi et al 2003 which used lysimeter et data to derive kc in addition using the soil water balance method djaman irmak reported that the locally developed kc mid in north platte was 1 08 1 26 according to the discussion the calculated kc not only varies with the climate but is also affected by the et measurement method sometimes the variability caused by the method of et measurement is more significant than the variability caused by climate conditions 5 conclusion based on a four year observation period using an ec system we derived the local crop coefficient curve and studied evapotranspiration partitioning in a summer maize cropland due to the imbalance of energy we corrected le data before we calculated the actual et both energy partitioning and evapotranspiration partitioning have significant seasonal variability rn was mainly consumed by h during the initial and late stages whereas rn was mainly absorbed by water vapor and transferred into latent heat during the development and mid stages in the initial stage soil evaporation accounted for 78 85 of the et with the development of the canopy the proportion of soil evaporation in et decreased gradually in the mid growing stage the soil evaporation was very small and the transpiration accounted for 54 81 of the et the crop coefficients derived by local datasets were 0 57 1 01 and 0 50 in the initial mid and late stages respectively the locally developed kc curve can provide a good prediction of the crop water requirement the variability in crop coefficient at different regions was high which was attributed to the differences in climate and measurement methods different measurement methods can result in great variability of the crop coefficient the kc calculated using et datasets from lysimeter measurements ranged from 1 20 to 1 53 which was significantly higher than the kc calculated using ec datasets although lysimeters are widely used as a standard method to measure et lysimeters commonly overestimate kc and crop evapotranspiration

10616,the present work aimed to study the effect of using treated wastewater tww to irrigate chemlali olive trees on the quality characteristics and chemical composition of olive oils this research was conducted in orchards cultivated in the center of tunisia where olive trees were subjected to different irrigation treatments during two consecutive years ct 0 etc t1 20 etc and t2 40 etc results showed that irrigation with tww whatever the level didn t significantly affect oil standard quality indices free acidity k232 k270 and peroxide value and pigment contents furthermore Œ± tocopherol amount was maintained stable which may explain the preservation of fatty acids against oxidation after tww irrigation moreover this last did not induce phenolic compounds contents variation a decrease of some volatile compounds giving oil undesirable attributes octanal and acetic acid and a maintain of those offering good characteristics like the fruity odor were observed keywords dairy treated wastewater reuse of wastewater olive oil characterization phenolic volatile metabolites 1 introduction around the world fresh water scarcity and quality deterioration have become significant problems in these last years in fact conventional water has been highly consumed by agricultural activities ever growing populations moreover increased evapotranspiration with shorter duration of rainfall led to groundwater depletion konikow and eloise 2005 in another side among food industries and regardless to its large water consumption associated with the generation of large volumes of wastewater dairy industry is the most polluting in volume vourch et al 2008 prakash kushwaha et al 2010 from environment and water requirement for dairy industry point of view wastewater reuse has become a necessity following treatment which is a very important step according to prakash kushwaha et al 2010 treated wastewater tww reuse can be practiced for horticultural crops irrigation which didn t affect flowers quality as well as for agronomic crops irrigation such as olive orchards lopez et al 2006 bernstein et al 2006 burun et al 2006 recently there has been an increase in olive growing areas in the north of africa in fact apart from the increase of olive oil prices olive oil trees were cultivated for their capacity to enhance landscape hydrogeological safeguarding of mountains and hills and climate mitigation actions brunori et al 2017 worldwide the majority of olive oil production is concentrated in mediterranean countries international olive council ioc 2018 olive oil represents one of the economic stability factors in tunisia 60 of tunisia s oil production is contributed by chemlali cultivar which is grown in the north and the center of tunisia khlif et al 2002 in tunisia oleiculture is mostly maintained in rainfed conditions however particularly arid and semi arid regions of this country suffer from serious water scarcity problems tekaya et al 2016 consequently the reuse of wastewater seems to be fundamental to preserve water for human consumption and reduce the discharge of this effluent into the environment with regard to climatic conditions and to considerable oil nutritional values the suggestion of suitable agronomic practices is substantial tekaya et al 2016 as agronomic factor irrigation strongly affects oil volatile fraction influencing its flavor and taste romero et al 2015 till today studies in tunisia are scarce and little information is known about the incidence of dairy treated wastewater on oil quality thus in this paper we studied the changes in oil quality indices after two tww levels application at first step then we proposed to examine oil chemical composition by determining pigment phenolic compounds fatty acids Œ± tocopherol metals and volatile contents 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the experimental field studied is located in dkhila province of mahdia tunisia 35 31n 10 58e 7 m above sea level it is beside a dairy industry source of tested wastewater the total water requirement for olive trees was estimated by standard methods as described by lodolini et al 2014 based on two cropping seasons 2016 and 2017 weather data for dkhila region the region is characterized by a mediterranean climate with a mean annual rainfall of 348 mm an average temperature of 19 80 c fig 1 a an evapotranspiration etc of 1270 mm and a sandy clay soil experiment was carried out during two crop seasons 2016 2017 where dry period was ranged from june to august 2016 and from april to september 2017 fig 1 b during the experiment period crop evapotranspiration were 3800 and 3850 m3 ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively taken to account the rainfall occurred in 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons the estimated water requirements were 1770 and 3100 m3 ha 1 in 2016 and 2017 respectively 2 2 plant material and water irrigation approximately one hundred sixty years old chemlali olive trees olea europaea l planted at a density of 14 m 14 m tree density is 51 tree ha 1 were selected for this study trees have not been neither fertilized nor treated with pesticides during the last years in this olive orchard complementary water irrigation was applied using treated waste water tww table 1 shows the physico chemical characteristics of tww used water was monthly delivered from march to may to avoid inflorescences fall and every fifteen days from june to october for each year of study according to the water irrigation schedule showed in table 2 chemlali olive oil was evaluated following the application of two irrigation levels a randomized block designed with three blocks and three treatments were used every block was for each treatment with five replicates two irrigation treatments were applied trees grown under rainfed condition control treatment ct and trees receiving tww with a seasonal water irrigation amount equivalent to 20 and 40 etc t1 and t2 respectively etc was calculated using experimental field data from national institute of meteorology by the perman monteith fao method allen et al 1998 etc kr kc et0 et0 was estimated using the software cropwat 8 fig 1 c the single crop coefficient kc and the coverage coefficient kr were 0 6 and 0 5 respectively this last coefficient was calculated from the mean diameter of the canopy projected area of each tree at solar noon orgaz and fereres 1997 2 3 olive oil extraction and analytical methods 2 3 1 olive oil extraction for each treatment olive fruits were hand harvested at the industrial optimum ripening stage

ioc 2018 in addition tww irrigation did not induce oil acidity variation statistical analysis demonstrated that k270 k232 and peroxide values did not vary following tww irrigation in fact they were within limits 3 2 tww irrigation and olive oil composition a particular attention has been paid to oil antioxidant compounds total phenols chlorophylls and √ü carotene in fact t1 and t2 application did not significantly influence its amounts considerable Œ± tocopherol amount decrease was marked when the irrigation treatment was performed using 20 etc t2 application did not cause significant Œ± tocopherol content variation comparing with ct application phenolic compounds results reported in table 4 demonstrated that pinoresinol contents were 1 57 2 55 and 1 77 mg kg 1 following tc t1 and t2 respectively values were not significantly affected by tww treatments the same trend was observed in acetoxypinoresinol then in major phenols decarboxymethyloleuropein aglycon and oleuropein aglycon values reported in table 4 showed that all phenolic compounds followed the same trend and maintained unchanged between treatments table 5 revealed fatty acid compounds in olive oils obtained after tww application results showed levels within the limit established by eu regulation for extra virgin olive oils focusing on the major fatty acid compounds palmitic acid oleic acid and linoleic acid contents did not recorded significant differences among ct t1 and t2 the results of gc ms analysis of volatile compounds are given in table 6 similar effect without any significant variation among treatments was demonstrated on e 2 hexenal hexanal 1 hexanol z 3 hexenyl acetate and 1 penten 3 one contents tww application showed a significant decrease on octanal and acetic acid especially for acetic acid content following t1 from 0 29 in control oil to 0 24 mg kg 1 treatment data presented in fig 2 demonstrated that aldehydes esters alcohols and ketones contents remained unchanged following treatments whereas carboxylic acids decreased significantly in response to t1 treatment it can be seen from table 7 that the minerals na mg p k ca mn fe concentrations of oils obtained from olive trees irrigated with tww were lower than contents registered at control oils particular attention can be attributed to fe concentration in fact this last was decreased significantly by tww s use to reach a value of 2 08 mg kg 1 which was below the limits established for characterizing oil as extra virgin international olive council ioc 2018 following tww application 20 etc and 40 etc oil metals concentration behaved differently indeed cu v and as concentrations decreased statistically after tww application in this study the observed zn co cd and hg contents didn t show any significant differences between treatments following all treatments it was observed in the table 7 that cr and pb contents exceeded the tunisian limits 4 discussion under both irrigation water levels t1 and t2 free acidity k270 k232 and peroxide value were within the range for characterizing the oil as extra virgin this data was not in line with results obtained by benincasa et al 2012 showing that as result of tww application oil quality was decreased which was characterized as lampante in the present work the unchanged k232 can be confirmed by a constant amount of phenolic compounds in fact g√≥mez rico et al 2007 believed that an increase of the water applied leads to decrease phenolic compounds amount which affects spectrophotometric absorption characteristics by absorbing in the uv region furthermore zaanouni et al 2018 found a positive correlation between the copper content of tww applied on olive trees acidity and extinction indicating that copper does not have an adverse effect on the oil quality being as virgin oils with respect to rainfed conditions bedbabis et al 2015 observed that well water or treated wastewater irrigation causes a decrement of virgin olive oil total phenols content in fact this last decreases resulting from irrigation negative effect on l phenylalanine ammonia lyase pal activity the key enzyme in phenolic biosynthesis when the amount of supplied water increases tovar et al 2002 on the other hand tww irrigation levels applied in the present study did not exert any influence on total phenols amount we can point out that compared with that of control oil oil coming from tww irrigated trees presented an invariable total phenols content contributing to oil stability and antioxidant activity nieto et al 2010 these lasts were maintained by pigments oxidation under certain conditions minguez mosquera et al 1990 in our case chlorophylls and carotenoids contents did not vary significantly when removed from rainfed to tww irrigation conditions it is inconsistent with data recorded by tekaya et al 2016 indicating that wastewater irrigation decreases pigment content of chemlali olive oil to contribute to its stability and antioxidant activity in a previous research of bedbabis et al 2015 the increase of carotenoids content of virgin olive oil induced by tww irrigation was explained by a faster maturation of fruits treated with saline tww this result is not in agreement with our data since this parameter was maintained constant after tww treatment it may reflect a good tww applied quality the Œ± tocopherol content did not enhance under tww treatment it may explain the maintained polyunsaturated fatty acids amounts in fact to protect oil polyunsaturated fatty acids against oxidation Œ± tocopherol content increases morell√≥ et al 2004 in the present study irrigation with tww whatever the level applied did not induce variation in phenolic compounds concentrations in contrast the finding obtained by romero et al 2015 indicated higher contents in orchards treated with lower irrigation amounts under tww treatment pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol concentrations did not show significant changes when removed from t1 to t2 these results confirmed those of dabbou et al 2011 indicating that pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol levels were generally unaffected by irrigation regime it could probably be attributed to the activity of hydrolytic enzymes on the complex phenols thanks to its unchanged oleic acid content among ct t1 and t2 olive oil tested kept its characteristic to prevent cardiovascular diseases and high blood pressure d imperio et al 2007 oleic acid was not transformed to linoleic confirmed by unchanged oleic linoleic ratio of oils coming from ct t1 and t2 sanchez and harwood 2002 reported that this transformation was insured by the oleate desaturase activity stimulated by tww probably tww tested in our research remained this enzyme activity unaffected results of the current study proved that tww application doesn t have any effect on palmitic acid among t1 and t2 treatments this finding is not in accordance with data obtained by ben brahim et al 2016 showing a significant reduction on palmitic acid content comparing tww treatments with control according to chehab et al 2013 e 2 hexenal hexanal and z 3 hexenyl acetate are the most affected by olive tree water status the present results suggested that although the transition from rainfed conditions to wastewater irrigation with two water levels e 2 hexenal content did not statistically vary gomez rico et al 2006 reported that the increase of applied water amount induces an enhancement of this compound content in cornicabra olive oil cultivated in molina this inconsistency in e 2 hexenal content which gives the typical green note to extra virgin olive oil can be explained by the geographic zone and cultivar differences romero et al 2015 the c6 compounds produced by lipoxygenase pathway e 2 hexenal hexanal and 1 hexanol morales et al 2013 did not differ markedly in content among different applied treatments it may be explained by unaffected lipoxygenase pathway when removed from rainfed conditions to wastewater irrigation the behavior of 1 penten 3 one maintained unchanged following ct t1 and t2 application in fact it is one of the major compounds in the volatile fraction which gives the fruity odor notes of extra virgin olive oil garrido delgado et al 2015 it can be asserted that wastewater use preserves this desirable attribute of olive oil in this study octanal content decreased significantly in response to wastewater irrigation the same behavior was marked in acetic acid content following t1 in fact these volatile compounds give oil undesirable attributes it can be concluded that wastewater seems to reflect olive oil quality improvement indeed the finding of garrido delgado et al 2015 associates octanal with mustiness humidity fustiness and rancidity mendil et al 2009 reported that mn mg ca fe and cu contribute to increasing oil oxidation rate furthermore the international olive oil council fixed a maximum residue limit for the content of cu 0 1 mg kg 1 and fe 3 mg kg 1 in olive oil international olive council ioc 2018 in the light of these results data from the present work indicate that tww application may improve olive oil quality in fact contents decreased significantly following t1 and t2 dairy treated wastewater used in this study was characterized by high concentrations of p and ca sdiri et al 2018 these lasts decreased in oils when tww level increased to 40 etc compared with oils obtained from olive trees treated with 20 etc these data may be explained by a selective uptake established by olive tree in the case of high availability of these nutrients in soil after t2 40 etc application k content didn t increase in oils resulting from tww irrigation compared with control oils it may explain the unchanged total phenols concentration bedbabis et al 2010 reported that an increase of k supplemented by tww in olive fruits leads to oil total phenols amount decrease caused by earlier change of fruit color from green to black in our study the fruit unchanged maturation stage following treatments can be confirmed by an unchanged hydroxytyrosol concentration in fact this maturation indicator reacts as antioxidant and possesses an anticancer effect simidou and oskou 2002 bendini et al 2007 tww applied in this study presented high na content but oils produced by trees irrigated with this type of water didn t mark an enhancement in this mineral concentration compared with control oils this data suggest that olive trees probably kept this salt ion concentrated in the root zone because of its spread through blood cd is a very toxic trace metal which interacts with zn odeh et al 2015 it can be assured that the applied treatment didn t lead to this health risk in fact the cd and zn concentrations in oils coming from tww irrigated trees were below those registered in control oils tww metals analysis reported by sdiri et al 2018 showed that cr and pb concentrations are within the limits for crop irrigation in fact their oil amounts following all treatments exceeded the critical values recommended by ioc 2018 this data can be the result of high cr and pb contents in water added during the oil extraction operation in addition it may come from the soil specially cr which is dissolved in the soil solution then tranferred to plant aerial part at the root level zaanouni et al 2018 5 conclusion chemlali olive oil analysis showed that quality indices are preserved following wastewater irrigation compared with control treatment in fact main values were bellow the limits established by the ioc 2018 for extra virgin olive oil moreover tww irrigation levels did not exert any influence on carotenoids and phenolic compounds contents the finding obtained in the present study showed the ability of tww used in irrigation to maintain phenolic compounds and polyunsaturated fatty acids contents this treatment remained desirable attributes aromatic compounds unaffected furthermore it leads to decrease some volatiles which give undesirable olive oil characteristics this study has pointed out that tww irrigation didn t contribute to enhance oil heavy metals contents such as zn co cd and hg this finding can be accomplished by olive pomological and biochemical characteristics monitoring following tww irrigation furthermore soil physico chemical properties and trace elements status can be evaluated declaration of competing interest the authors have declared no conflict of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online

10616,the present work aimed to study the effect of using treated wastewater tww to irrigate chemlali olive trees on the quality characteristics and chemical composition of olive oils this research was conducted in orchards cultivated in the center of tunisia where olive trees were subjected to different irrigation treatments during two consecutive years ct 0 etc t1 20 etc and t2 40 etc results showed that irrigation with tww whatever the level didn t significantly affect oil standard quality indices free acidity k232 k270 and peroxide value and pigment contents furthermore Œ± tocopherol amount was maintained stable which may explain the preservation of fatty acids against oxidation after tww irrigation moreover this last did not induce phenolic compounds contents variation a decrease of some volatile compounds giving oil undesirable attributes octanal and acetic acid and a maintain of those offering good characteristics like the fruity odor were observed keywords dairy treated wastewater reuse of wastewater olive oil characterization phenolic volatile metabolites 1 introduction around the world fresh water scarcity and quality deterioration have become significant problems in these last years in fact conventional water has been highly consumed by agricultural activities ever growing populations moreover increased evapotranspiration with shorter duration of rainfall led to groundwater depletion konikow and eloise 2005 in another side among food industries and regardless to its large water consumption associated with the generation of large volumes of wastewater dairy industry is the most polluting in volume vourch et al 2008 prakash kushwaha et al 2010 from environment and water requirement for dairy industry point of view wastewater reuse has become a necessity following treatment which is a very important step according to prakash kushwaha et al 2010 treated wastewater tww reuse can be practiced for horticultural crops irrigation which didn t affect flowers quality as well as for agronomic crops irrigation such as olive orchards lopez et al 2006 bernstein et al 2006 burun et al 2006 recently there has been an increase in olive growing areas in the north of africa in fact apart from the increase of olive oil prices olive oil trees were cultivated for their capacity to enhance landscape hydrogeological safeguarding of mountains and hills and climate mitigation actions brunori et al 2017 worldwide the majority of olive oil production is concentrated in mediterranean countries international olive council ioc 2018 olive oil represents one of the economic stability factors in tunisia 60 of tunisia s oil production is contributed by chemlali cultivar which is grown in the north and the center of tunisia khlif et al 2002 in tunisia oleiculture is mostly maintained in rainfed conditions however particularly arid and semi arid regions of this country suffer from serious water scarcity problems tekaya et al 2016 consequently the reuse of wastewater seems to be fundamental to preserve water for human consumption and reduce the discharge of this effluent into the environment with regard to climatic conditions and to considerable oil nutritional values the suggestion of suitable agronomic practices is substantial tekaya et al 2016 as agronomic factor irrigation strongly affects oil volatile fraction influencing its flavor and taste romero et al 2015 till today studies in tunisia are scarce and little information is known about the incidence of dairy treated wastewater on oil quality thus in this paper we studied the changes in oil quality indices after two tww levels application at first step then we proposed to examine oil chemical composition by determining pigment phenolic compounds fatty acids Œ± tocopherol metals and volatile contents 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental field the experimental field studied is located in dkhila province of mahdia tunisia 35 31n 10 58e 7 m above sea level it is

and antioxidant activity in a previous research of bedbabis et al 2015 the increase of carotenoids content of virgin olive oil induced by tww irrigation was explained by a faster maturation of fruits treated with saline tww this result is not in agreement with our data since this parameter was maintained constant after tww treatment it may reflect a good tww applied quality the Œ± tocopherol content did not enhance under tww treatment it may explain the maintained polyunsaturated fatty acids amounts in fact to protect oil polyunsaturated fatty acids against oxidation Œ± tocopherol content increases morell√≥ et al 2004 in the present study irrigation with tww whatever the level applied did not induce variation in phenolic compounds concentrations in contrast the finding obtained by romero et al 2015 indicated higher contents in orchards treated with lower irrigation amounts under tww treatment pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol concentrations did not show significant changes when removed from t1 to t2 these results confirmed those of dabbou et al 2011 indicating that pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol levels were generally unaffected by irrigation regime it could probably be attributed to the activity of hydrolytic enzymes on the complex phenols thanks to its unchanged oleic acid content among ct t1 and t2 olive oil tested kept its characteristic to prevent cardiovascular diseases and high blood pressure d imperio et al 2007 oleic acid was not transformed to linoleic confirmed by unchanged oleic linoleic ratio of oils coming from ct t1 and t2 sanchez and harwood 2002 reported that this transformation was insured by the oleate desaturase activity stimulated by tww probably tww tested in our research remained this enzyme activity unaffected results of the current study proved that tww application doesn t have any effect on palmitic acid among t1 and t2 treatments this finding is not in accordance with data obtained by ben brahim et al 2016 showing a significant reduction on palmitic acid content comparing tww treatments with control according to chehab et al 2013 e 2 hexenal hexanal and z 3 hexenyl acetate are the most affected by olive tree water status the present results suggested that although the transition from rainfed conditions to wastewater irrigation with two water levels e 2 hexenal content did not statistically vary gomez rico et al 2006 reported that the increase of applied water amount induces an enhancement of this compound content in cornicabra olive oil cultivated in molina this inconsistency in e 2 hexenal content which gives the typical green note to extra virgin olive oil can be explained by the geographic zone and cultivar differences romero et al 2015 the c6 compounds produced by lipoxygenase pathway e 2 hexenal hexanal and 1 hexanol morales et al 2013 did not differ markedly in content among different applied treatments it may be explained by unaffected lipoxygenase pathway when removed from rainfed conditions to wastewater irrigation the behavior of 1 penten 3 one maintained unchanged following ct t1 and t2 application in fact it is one of the major compounds in the volatile fraction which gives the fruity odor notes of extra virgin olive oil garrido delgado et al 2015 it can be asserted that wastewater use preserves this desirable attribute of olive oil in this study octanal content decreased significantly in response to wastewater irrigation the same behavior was marked in acetic acid content following t1 in fact these volatile compounds give oil undesirable attributes it can be concluded that wastewater seems to reflect olive oil quality improvement indeed the finding of garrido delgado et al 2015 associates octanal with mustiness humidity fustiness and rancidity mendil et al 2009 reported that mn mg ca fe and cu contribute to increasing oil oxidation rate furthermore the international olive oil council fixed a maximum residue limit for the content of cu 0 1 mg kg 1 and fe 3 mg kg 1 in olive oil international olive council ioc 2018 in the light of these results data from the present work indicate that tww application may improve olive oil quality in fact contents decreased significantly following t1 and t2 dairy treated wastewater used in this study was characterized by high concentrations of p and ca sdiri et al 2018 these lasts decreased in oils when tww level increased to 40 etc compared with oils obtained from olive trees treated with 20 etc these data may be explained by a selective uptake established by olive tree in the case of high availability of these nutrients in soil after t2 40 etc application k content didn t increase in oils resulting from tww irrigation compared with control oils it may explain the unchanged total phenols concentration bedbabis et al 2010 reported that an increase of k supplemented by tww in olive fruits leads to oil total phenols amount decrease caused by earlier change of fruit color from green to black in our study the fruit unchanged maturation stage following treatments can be confirmed by an unchanged hydroxytyrosol concentration in fact this maturation indicator reacts as antioxidant and possesses an anticancer effect simidou and oskou 2002 bendini et al 2007 tww applied in this study presented high na content but oils produced by trees irrigated with this type of water didn t mark an enhancement in this mineral concentration compared with control oils this data suggest that olive trees probably kept this salt ion concentrated in the root zone because of its spread through blood cd is a very toxic trace metal which interacts with zn odeh et al 2015 it can be assured that the applied treatment didn t lead to this health risk in fact the cd and zn concentrations in oils coming from tww irrigated trees were below those registered in control oils tww metals analysis reported by sdiri et al 2018 showed that cr and pb concentrations are within the limits for crop irrigation in fact their oil amounts following all treatments exceeded the critical values recommended by ioc 2018 this data can be the result of high cr and pb contents in water added during the oil extraction operation in addition it may come from the soil specially cr which is dissolved in the soil solution then tranferred to plant aerial part at the root level zaanouni et al 2018 5 conclusion chemlali olive oil analysis showed that quality indices are preserved following wastewater irrigation compared with control treatment in fact main values were bellow the limits established by the ioc 2018 for extra virgin olive oil moreover tww irrigation levels did not exert any influence on carotenoids and phenolic compounds contents the finding obtained in the present study showed the ability of tww used in irrigation to maintain phenolic compounds and polyunsaturated fatty acids contents this treatment remained desirable attributes aromatic compounds unaffected furthermore it leads to decrease some volatiles which give undesirable olive oil characteristics this study has pointed out that tww irrigation didn t contribute to enhance oil heavy metals contents such as zn co cd and hg this finding can be accomplished by olive pomological and biochemical characteristics monitoring following tww irrigation furthermore soil physico chemical properties and trace elements status can be evaluated declaration of competing interest the authors have declared no conflict of interest appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online

10617,this paper examines the adoption of irrigation technologies and the underlying diversity in terms of intensity of adoption in 2 irrigated valleys in central chile results show a low and narrow range of adoption with only 30 of farmers adopting technologies through a latent class analysis 2 types of farmers were identified a small group comprising moderate to intensive users and a second one consisting of the majority of farmers mostly constrained in natural capital furthermore the econometric analysis indicates that education diversification continuous access to water and perception of water reliability increase the adoption conversely higher water land ratios presence of community reservoirs and earthen canals reduce the uptake overall the dominance of fruit and horticulture production access to agricultural credits and full irrigation of the farm are the main drivers of adoption the latter is a critical factor indicating a relative abundance of water resources which alongside contextual characteristics discourages farmers from implementing technologies the low adoption rate as well as the hindering factors will challenge public and private organizations to design and implement policies aiming to improve water reliability and management to generate incentives and increase awareness on the scarcity of the resource in the light of the predicted reductions in water availability because of climate change will be crucial as well keywords irrigation technologies adoption level water management central chile 1 introduction water availability and management have become a limiting factor and a challenge in various parts of the world especially in countries with more scarce water resources the agricultural sector is responsible for more than 70 of water withdrawals for consumptive use grafton et al 2018 siebert et al 2010 and irrigation constitutes an essential practice for agricultural production levidow et al 2014 given population growth and the increasing demand for fiber and food the agricultural water usage is foreseen to increase mancosu et al 2015 irrigation technologies it 1 1 although there are a variety of technologies at on farm and off farm level in this paper irrigation technologies refer to those technologies intended to improve water delivery at the on farm level perry 2017 allowing for improvements in water efficiency and economic benefits as well as reducing environmental burdens levidow et al 2014 bring a series of benefits allowing a better agricultural and water management especially in water resource scarce areas levidow et al 2014 improvements in water use efficiency increases in agricultural productivity and shifts to more profitable crops adeyemi et al 2017 perry et al 2017 taylor and zilberman 2017 farmers often apply or combine more than one technology according to the expected profits foster and rosenzweig 2010 green et al 1996 easiness of use or low maintenance requirements pokhrel et al 2018 because of the benefits of it their adoption has been a matter of study especially in identifying determinants of adoption among these are environmental or producers characteristics fleischer et al 2011 green et al 1996 their effect on production risk and uncertainty foudi and erdlenbruch 2012 koundouri et al 2006 their water saving capacity jara rojas et al 2012 molle and tanouti 2017 zhang et al 2019 and water use efficiency chaudhry 2018 speelman et al 2008 more recently research also has been focusing on the role of irrigation as a climate change adaptation strategy bryan et al 2013 deressa et al 2009 iglesias and garrote 2015 mendelsohn 2012 smit and skinner 2002 varela ortega et al 2016 besides the literature on it adoption reveals multiple factors influencing the decision to adopt it socioeconomics characteristics of farmers such as age education family size and experience as well as factors like financial constraints access to credits and information are found to affect this decision bjornlund et al 2009 caswell and zilberman 1985 engler et al 2016 wang et al 2016 likewise adoption of it is determined by farm attributes i e farm size location land or soil quality growing crops and environmental characteristics precipitation temperature caswell and zilberman 1985 green et al 1996 furthermore policy interventions such as support services subsidies provision of information and pricing have shown to affect the adoption of it caswell et al 1990 green et al 1996 zhang et al 2019 despite the benefits of it and the extensive literature regarding adoption in different irrigation settings most of the research on this topic has focused either on specific technologies e g on the decision to irrigate or the application of drip or sprinkler irrigation other linked choices are often omitted huang et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2018 nowadays complementary technologies and practices such as land leveling irrigation scheduling soil moisture monitoring or tailwater recovery systems strengthen water management thereby improving the performance of the irrigation systems huang et al 2017 montoro et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 moreover even though there are scholars who have studied the intensity of adoption of technologies such as precision agriculture technologies barnes et al 2019 isgin et al 2008 paxton et al 2011 or modern rice technologies mariano et al 2012 the evidence on it is still scanty with some exceptions jara rojas et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 wang et al 2016 on the other hand irrigation decisions may be influenced by either collective arrangements or because of neighbors decisions especially in irrigation systems with poor control withdrawal infrastructure and conveyance as members of an irrigation system farmers share some environmental context as well as socioeconomic and infrastructural characteristics such as reservoirs or watercourses chaudhry 2018 system characteristics receive an increasing interest considering their effects on agricultural production manero et al 2019 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 adaptation to climate change tang et al 2016 as well as input usage and irrigation efficiency chaudhry 2018 understanding the drivers shaping this technology adoption is required for further planning and strategic dissemination of farm technologies mariano et al 2012 allowing policymakers and water managers to know the extent of policy interventions wang et al 2016 in this regard aiming to contribute to the literature of technology adoption in irrigated agriculture the present article considers 2 irrigated valleys in central chile irrigation in chile holds a long tradition with private water users associations established since colonial times meza et al 2012 and roughly 1 1 million hectares of irrigated lands jara rojas et al 2012 due to climate characteristics irrigation is a central factor in agricultural production oyarz√∫n et al 2008 moreover the region in central chile under consideration currently suffers the most extensive period of water shortage ever recorded garreaud et al 2017 garreaud et al 2019 because of this setting of relative scarcity chile has set irrigation as a primordial matter in the agricultural policy over the past 4 decades 2 2 irrigation became more relevant since 1985 when the chilean state promulgated law 18 450 of irrigation and drainage this act states a clear focus on increasing the irrigated land areas rather than water saving purposes martin and saavedra 2018 following a mostly hard path approach through improvements in on and off farm efficiency as well as in infrastructure for water storage clarvis and allan 2014 meza et al 2008 vicuna et al 2014 despite this long standing irrigation history the stimulus and support for adoption of it evidence concerning farmers decisions in irrigation adoption is relatively new with few exceptions engler et al 2016 jara rojas et al 2012 roco et al 2016 salazar and rand 2016 thus in order to better understand the adoption of it this article has two objectives first and foremost the research aims to estimate the level of adoption of it in central chile and examine the drivers of such adoption the second goal based on it consists in identifying and classifying farmers according to their adoption decisions in order to do so the article continues as follows the next section introduces and describes the study area the survey conducted and provides an outline of the methods employed subsequently the main results are analyzed and discussed finally a conclusion and a policy implications section will conclude the research 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area in chile irrigation water management as well as water management of other productive sectors is governed through the water code of 1981 wc81 the wc81 declares water as an economic good based principally on a complete separation of water from land and defines private and permanent property rights on water wr allowing the free transferability of this resource another central feature of wc81 is the orientation towards private management thereby reducing the capacity of regulation and intervention by the state vergara and rivera 2018 in terms of irrigation the code states that owners of wr are responsible for water management through three different levels of organization at natural source level management is organized by the vigilance committees juntas de vigilancia jv for artificial sources wr owners gather either in comunidades de agua water communities wc which are in charge of secondary infrastructure canals or asociacion de canalistas canal users associations ca responsible for the administration of main infrastructure such as reservoirs and primary canals martin and saavedra 2018 vald√©s pineda et al 2014 these different water associations have some common responsibilities such as conveying and delivering water to users according to wr ownership conflict resolution and collection and management of water fees donoso 2014 this research considers two sub watersheds of the maule river basin in central chile the ancoa and the achibueno river valleys fig 1 central chile has a mediterranean climate with a heterogeneous distribution of water availability throughout the year most of the rain occurs in periods in which agricultural production is less intensive with lower demand for irrigation determining an imbalance between water demand and supply and a relative scarcity for agricultural production vicuna et al 2014 world bank 2011 the region receives on average 870 mm of rainfall with june and july as the rainiest and coldest months whereas january february and december are the driest and warmest months with median temperatures around 18 c agrimed 2017 the study area consists of the valleys irrigated by the ancoa and the achibueno rivers which are managed by the ancoa and achibueno jv s under each jv there are a series of autonomous wc in this case 31 wc s are part of ancoa holding 7 418 0 l s 1 providing water to circa 10 000 ha cnr 2013 on the other hand 22 wc s are under jv achibueno administrating 20 767 2 l s 1 and irrigating 25 000 ha cnr 2013 moreover since 2014 the area benefits from a header reservoir with a storage capacity of 78 3 hm 3 allowing storage and better distribution of the water rights and with the adverse effects of the drought affecting central chile since 2010 garreaud et al 2017 garreaud et al 2019 this part of chile is appropriate for a multiplicity of crops and in the region cash crops coexist with self consumption agriculture thereby all farm sizes are found as well fern√°ndez et al 2019 jara rojas et al 2012 specifically corn rice blueberries raspberries and perennials such as apple and cherry trees are the main crops cultivated jara rojas et al 2012 2 2 data collection the data were gathered in the chilean summer between december and february of 2018 19 the primary source of information utilized to select the sample comes from the ancoa and achibueno jv s each jv keeps a list of farmers and their water shares because they pay annual fees for conveyance from the primary canal to the water intake point 3 3 although each canal keeps an updated list for fees collection some wc s have delegated this action to jv s hands facilitating farmers payments to both jv and wc as well as preventing high levels of indebtedness unfortunately the jv s and the wc s do not maintain detailed and updated records about their members in most of the cases they have lists of farmers and their water shares yet lack the spatial location of water withdrawals and farms as well as telephone numbers in terms of agricultural policy regarding the sampled farmers chilean farms are divided into 3 main categories small medium and large farms mart√≠nez et al 2014 oecd 2008 which define the type of subsidies and the technical support they receive 4 4 in chile small farms are distinct in two aspects they own less than 12 hectares of irrigation units hbu and their income must come primarily from agricultural production this research entails information on the whole spectrum of farms the sole requirement being a member of a wc in total 335 farmers of 26 wc s from both jv s were surveyed the sampling followed a 2stage strategy centered on water rights first farmers were divided into two groups jv according to the number of individuals of each jv afterwards irrigators of main canals of each jv were selected through a proportional sampling keeping the weight of each canal in the area the data comprises personal social and farm characteristics as well as info on natural capital land and water shares it practices and crops and some physical and contextual characteristics of the canals in order to register the applied it a prior selection was made based on the existing literature bjornlund et al 2009 huang et al 2017 levidow et al 2014 perry et al 2017 and previous studies carried out in chile and neighboring areas engler et al 2016 jara rojas et al 2012 roco et al 2014 2016 taking into account the technologies funded by the government cnr 2013 and in consultation with the members of jv s and some wc s after a pre test period where a low adoption range and rate of it were found farmers were required to enumerate and describe their it classified into 9 technologies an important remark is that this study focuses on technologies and techniques that allow farmers to improve irrigation but practices routinely applied to receive water rights such as weed control in on farm canals withdrawal works etc were excluded in addition in order to characterize farmers context and environment within each canal self reported data on their location and physical infrastructure characteristics were also gathered 2 3 methods to meet the objectives of the article a methodological approach consisting of 2 parts is applied in the first part the determinants affecting the number of irrigation technologies adopted is estimated the second part is oriented towards disentangling the most applied combinations of it implemented at the field level 2 3 1 econometric analysis regression analysis is utilized to model and estimate determinants influencing technology adoption since the variable of interest is a non negative count the most appropriate approach is a count data model the usual way to deal with count data is assuming that y follows a poisson distribution with a probability density function long and freese 2006 wooldridge 2010 1 pr y y x e Œº Œº y y w i t h y 0 1 m a n d i 1 n and 2 v a r y x e y x Œº e x Œ≤ with Œº expected mean variance y x where y is the count data variable and xand Œ≤ are vectors of independent variables and parameters to estimate respectively the poisson model prm accounts for observed heterogeneity observed differences among sample members by specifying the rate y as a function of observed x s however in practice the prm seldom fits well due to two issues overdispersion underdispersion and the presence of an excess of zeros wooldridge 2010 overdispersion 5 5 underdispersion goes on the opposite way that is the variance is lower than the conditional mean means the variance exceeds the mean i e var yi e yi 1 violating the poisson assumption eq 2 implying that prm underestimates the dispersion of the outcome cameron and trivedi 2010 long and freese 2006 if overdispersion exists and is ignored prm estimates will be consistent but inefficient with standard errors biased downward although the model might include the correct variables to overcome this problem a negative binomial regression model nbrm can be used instead isgin et al 2008 loeys et al 2012 long and freese 2006 in that case the probability mass function of nb is 3 pr y y Œº Œ± Œ≥ y Œ± 1 y Œ≥ Œ± 1 Œ± 1 Œ± 1 Œº Œ± 1 Œº Œ± 1 Œº y where Œ≥ is gamma distribution Œ± is the variance parameter of the gamma distribution and Œº is the intensity or rate parameter cameron and trivedi 2010 paxton et al 2011 the second issue is the excess of zeros in the data set in many empirical cases the poisson model or nb fails to estimate zeros as an alternative a zero inflated model zi allows dealing with both overdispersion and the excess of zeros zi s are mixture models with two separate components representing the outcome distribution the first modeling the probability of excess of zeros false or not always zeros and the second accounting for the non excess of zeros true or always zeros and non zero counts barnes et al 2019 isgin et al 2008 loeys et al 2012 bearing this in mind a prm was run as the initial model testing for overdispersion and excess of zeros this was done by simultaneously running an nbrm model the variance of an nbrm is 4 v a r y x e y x Œº Œ± Œº 2 where Œ± is the dispersion parameter and with eq 3 reducing to eq 2 when Œ± 0 overdispersion was tested by the generalized likelihood ratio test llr and if it exists Œ± 0 the nbrm model must be selected cameron and trivedi 2010 long and freese 2006 the excess of zeros in the sample is tested by the modified versions of the vuong test corrected by the aikake information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic desmarais and harden 2013 wilson 2015 a explicatory variables this section gives details on the dependent and explicatory variables the conceptual model is 5 y f x r c p where y is the number of it implemented by irrigator i with y 1 n x is a vector of farmers characteristics and r comprises natural resources variables c is a vector containing farmer contextual and physical variables within a wc and finally p is a set of perceptual variables given that irrigators apply a total of 9 different technologies table 2 3 different specifications of the dependent variable were constructed table 1 first y1 represents the total number of it considering each different technology for y2 those technologies related to scheduling namely scheduling meteorological stations and programming tools are grouped in a single category finally as some farmers use the same it for irrigating more than one crop this peculiarity is captured by y3 accumulating the total number it including the totality of efficient irrigation systems the explanatory variables include a set of regressors usually applied in the agricultural technology adoption literature caswell and zilberman 1985 green et al 1996 isgin et al 2008 jara rojas et al 2012 mariano et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 tang et al 2016 table 1 of annex 1 in the supplemental material provides a complete explanation as well as descriptive statistics for the full set of variables regarding households characteristics hh age corresponds to the age of the hh head gender refers to the sex of the respondent 0 if female and 1 if male education corresponds to the level of schooling years of the hh head and experience denotes the years of farming and irrigation by the hh head for farm variables owner refers to whether the farmer owns the plot 0 if yes 1 if other social capital states if the farmer participates in social organizations 1 if yes 0 otherwise non farm income na income indicates whether a farmer gets income from non agricultural activities or not and agricultural advisor considers whether a farmer receives recommendations from external people either public or private the last variable of this subset is access to agricultural credits credits taking 1 if a farmer states that he is subject to apply for credits for agricultural activities purchase of inputs irrigation infrastructure etc the subset of natural capital includes farm size ha water shares ws and a diversification index the land size and water shares represent proxies of farmers wealth one ws in ancoa is equivalent to 1 and in achibueno it is 1 5 l s 1 to get a standard measurement the ws in achibueno were therefore multiplied with 1 5 crop diversification is measured through the herfindahl index hi index roco et al 2017 wuepper et al 2017 6 h i n 1 n x n 2 where xn is the proportion of area for the n th crop respecting the total area under production the index is a continuous measure of diversification ranging from 0 complete diversification to 1 whole specialization for a better understanding of the level of diversification a variant of the index 1 hi yielding the opposite results is applied meaning 1 for a fully diversified farmer roco et al 2017 moreover a set of binary variables capturing the productive emphasis of each farmer is introduced according to the predominant crop thus 5 variables cereals c fruit f annual crops c vegetable v and forage production fo were included contextual or environmental characteristics capture the fact that farmers share some characteristics in certain settings such as socioeconomic and infrastructure context chaudhry 2018 wang et al 2018 in irrigation systems farmers may share a watercourse a water delivery system or reservoirs from the set of characteristics that members could share this article focuses on infrastructure variables intended to increase the reliability and certainty with which farmers receive their water shares this article uses lining location presence of a water community reservoir organization for water withdrawal water fees and canal extension as contextual variables when lining water conveyance is improved water losses are reduced farmers were asked about the canal lining in the section close to their water intake hence lining is a binary variable taking the value of 1 if a farmer reports a section fully or partially lined and 0 if it is an earthen canal tang et al 2016 the variable water community reservoir wcr describes if a wc owns an off farm reservoir receiving a value of 1 if affirmative and 0 otherwise although such infrastructure does not produce extra water it allows for storage and use when required the organization of water withdrawal ww refers to irrigator s access to water ww is a dummy variable 1 if withdrawal is continuous and permanent and 0 if it is organized in turns 6 6 although water rights are defined as continuous and permanent by the chilean water code of 1981 some canals apply turn systems for some particular reasons like land subdivision and subsequently the water rights type of canal canal captures the position or location of a farmer in the canal network within a particular waterway canal is 1 if a farmer gets water from the central canal and 0 if he gets it from a secondary or tertiary level canal annual fees is a binary variable with the value of 1 if a farmer pays more than average annual fees across the 26 canals and 0 otherwise when having to pay expensive fees farmers might take care of their water using it more efficiently canal extension extension is a variable that considers the length of each primary canal canal extension takes 1 if the extension surpasses the average length for the 26 canals km and 0 otherwise also wua is a dummy variable referring to the jv with 0 for ancoa and 1 for achibueno this variable is capturing the distinctive features of each wua such as governance or operation rules finally since 2010 central chile has endured the most extensive drought ever recorded aldunce et al 2017 garreaud et al 2019 encompassing most of the territory where irrigated agriculture thrives recent research in adjacent areas has shown that farmers perceive changes in rainfall decreasing and temperatures increasing as well as more frequent drought periods roco et al 2015 given the connection between climate and water supply for irrigation 4 perception questions related to the availability and struggles for water use during the agricultural season were asked these questions were listed as follows a how do you qualify your access to water rights accessibility b does your water withdrawal enable you to irrigate your farm fully full irrigation c how do you value your irrigation skills se irrigation and d do you have any problems with getting your water problems the variables were measured on a 5 point likert scale ranging from 1 very negative to 5 no negative no problem perception for each question 4 dummy variables were set taking 1 if the answer was over the average and 0 otherwise 2 3 2 latent class analysis the second objective of the paper is to analyze the underlying diversity of it within the sample and to determine types of farmers in the study area to that end the it forming the dependent variables in the regression analysis are used as the inputs variables for segmenting irrigators thus this research assigns farmers in homogeneous classes of technologies instead of grouping them according to the characteristics of the observations to accomplish the former a latent class analysis approach lca was employed a method applied extensively in social sciences but not much in agricultural research with some exceptions such as the adoption of improved agro technologies bizimungu and kabunga 2018 and perception of farmers to climate change arbuckle et al 2014 barnes et al 2013 lca is a method which by a statistical procedure identifies class membership probabilities for a set of observations by using the responses of a set of observed or manifest variables barnes et al 2013 linzer and lewis 2011 the goal is to determine the smallest number of latent classes sufficiently explaining the unobserved associations among the set of manifest variables magidson and vermunt 2004 the key characteristic of this method is that both the latent and the observed variables are categorical linzer and lewis 2011 skrondal and rabe hesketh 2007 an lca is a model based clustering technique similar to cluster analysis given the fact that both methods group individuals into homogenous classes vermunt and magidson 2002 however lca shows some advantages since it is based on a statistical model the selection of the number of clusters classes is defined based on statistical tests and techniques to handle missing data are also available arbuckle et al 2014 kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 vermunt and magidson 2002 formally lca is fitted as follows first let yijk denote the observed value of the j manifest observed variable for individual i who gives the k th response to the j th variable in this case j are the irrigation technologies and k the possible outcome is binary thus yijk can take values of 1 or 0 in addition œÄ j r k is the class conditional probability that an observation i belongs to a class r with r 1 r yielding the k th outcome for the j th variable within each class 6 k 1 k j œÄ j r k 1 according to linzer and lewis 2011 and assuming mutual independence of responses within each class the probability that an individual i in a specific class r yields a particular j set of outcomes is the product of 7 f y i œÄ r j 1 j k 1 k j œÄ j r k y i j k the probability density function across the classes is the weighted sum 8 p y i œÄ p r 1 r p r j 1 j k 1 k j œÄ j r k y i j k thus the model parameters p r and œÄ j r k are estimated by the latent class model the posterior probability p ÀÜ r i y i for an individual belonging to a specific class is estimated by bayes theorem as follows 9 p ÀÜ r i y i p ÀÜ r f y i œÄ ÀÜ q q 1 q p ÀÜ r f y i œÄ ÀÜ q where p ÀÜ r and œÄ ÀÜ q are the estimates of p r and œÄ j r k by the expectation maximization algorithm em which proceeds in an iterative way firstly the e step creates a function for the expectation of the log likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters p r and œÄ j r k then the m step computes parameters maximizing the expected log likelihood found on the e step the estimates for p r and œÄ j r k are used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next e step finally the model selection is based on the bayesian information criterion bic and the aikake information criteria aic opting for the model that minimizes the values of aic and bic barnes et al 2013 linzer and lewis 2011 3 results 3 1 the technological level of adoption of irrigation technologies fig 2 shows the total number of it implemented by irrigators in the study area in the sample 70 of farmers have not implemented any technology intended to manage their water rights and only around 11 have put in place 2 or more practices in terms of area 26 of the production land is irrigated by an efficient irrigation system eis at the farm level eis is the most utilized it representing 39 of those farmers implementing at least one practice but only reaching 18 of the sample table 2 eis constitutes 47 for farmers adopting 1 it and 39 from those applying 2 it wells are behind eis with 15 of adoption moreover wells constitute 43 for a single technology and jointly with eis both represent 90 and 65 of 1 and 2 adopted it respectively on the other hand scheduling is marginally adopted with only 3 3 of the farmers within the sample using it in addition it is always adopted jointly with other it humidity retention techniques are also minimally implemented by only 9 2 6 of the farmers regarding the adoption level of the set of it currently in use the results show a low extent of adoption for each it when comparing with adoption rates in chile the results are higher than those found by roco et al 2016 who in nearby areas detected rates of adoption of the on farm infrastructure of 3 the results differ however with adoption rates in more scarce regions in chile such as the findings of engler et al 2016 who found an adoption rate of 43 for drip irrigation and 23 of scheduling instruments for wine producers they also differ with the findings of molinos senante et al 2016 in the semi arid north of chile where the adoption rate of eis was 94 finally the results differ with adoption rates in other countries where some technologies have been supported such as spain alcon et al 2011 and the u s pokhrel et al 2018 sears et al 2018 taylor and zilberman 2017 3 2 determinants of the intensity of adoption of irrigation technologies the second part of the analysis looks for factors influencing the adoption of it utilizing a count data modeling approach first of all for the set of variables included in the regression analysis both pairwise correlations and variance inflation factors vif were tested to make sure there was no severe multicollinearity the results for the correlations and vif s no higher than 5 determine no problems of collinearity o brien 2007 statacorp 2017 see table 2 and 3 in supplementary data for more details the count data models were estimated for the 3 dependent variables defined in 3 3 1 at first overdispersion and zero inflation were tested these tests indicate that for specifications y1 and y2 the prm is preferred and for y3 the nbrm is a more appropriate model see table 4 in annex 2 in supplemental material once decided that prm and nbrm models yield better results the second step was to select the model with the best fit to facilitate the interpretation the specification y2 shows the best goodness of fit measures minimizing the values for aic and bic 532 82 and 612 92 12 each and getting the highest pseudor2 0 224 table 5 in a supplementary data material displays the results for the 6 remaining specifications table 3 displays the results for 3 prm models with y2 as dependent variable see table 6 in supplementary data for more details prm1 depicts the results including land size and ws as regressors whereas the second and the third use the variable wl ratio prm2 and pmr3 incorporating the series of perceptual variables wl ratio is derived from the ws and land size quotient taking a 1 if the ratio exceeds the mean for the sample and 0 otherwise to get a better understanding and interpretation regression coefficients are depicted and analyzed as incidence risk ratios irr 7 7 irr are also called factor change for their estimation each Œ≤i is exponented so irr Œ≤i e Œ≤i the irr s coefficient tells how a change in an x affects the rate at which y occurs while the average marginal effects determinines the impact of any covariate on the number of technologies and the average marginal effects long and freese 2006 mariano et al 2012 for the hh variables none except for education impact the number of it for any specification of the dependent variable these findings are not consistent with the technology adoption literature analyzed by count data models like the results on precision agriculture barnes et al 2019 isgin et al 2008 and on it jara rojas et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 education is highly and positively significant increasing the adoption by almost 10 in terms of irr but it results in only a slight increase in the number of technologies farms with more educated heads tend to increase it perhaps because they are exposed to more information thereby internalizing the benefits and costs of these technologies this finding is in line with adoption literature which states a positive relationship between human capital and the decisions to adopt modern technologies bjornlund et al 2009 koundouri et al 2006 access to technical support has a positive yet not significant impact on the range of specifications for ownership being a renter reduces the rate though not significantly likewise non agricultural income has no impact on farmers decisions to adopt technologies having extra resources and a more favorable financial capacity could lead to a more considerable utilization of these types of technologies on the other hand credits is the variable with the most significant impact of the hh characteristics on the rate of it adoption the incremental change is roughly 150 0 41 technologies according to marginal effects compared to those who do not have access this is consistent with the results of jara rojas et al 2012 it is noteworthy that in chile access to credits implies a more robust financial backing as well as access to a broader range of agricultural services mostly offered by private agents regarding ws and land size the results are depicted in two ways as independent variables and as the wl ratio in prm1 it is shown that ws has a negative but non significant impact on technologies while land size slightly increases the rate to acquire an irrigation technology 0 5 being consistent with the findings of green et al 1996 isgin et al 2008 engler et al 2016 and feike et al 2017 the wl ratio a sign of water availability per unit of land ha causes a significant but negative effect on it reducing on average with 33 the rate of adoption this translates according to the average marginal effects discrete change in 0 19 fewer technologies for more efficient water management the diversification index has a positive and significant impact increasing the percentage to apply technologies it s enable farmers to a more diversified agricultural production hussain and hanjra 2004 both valleys cover a wide range of agricultural production hence requiring customized water management for the set of dummies capturing the specificity of agriculture production farms focused on fruit and horticulture have higher rates of technology usage compared to those cultivating annual crops the coefficients irr along with credits are the largest for the set of variables around 2 43 for fruit and 2 58 for horticulture translated to number of technologies these variables determine an increase in the number of technologies adopted of 0 36 and 0 39 this positive impact is consistent with the findings of feike et al 2017 who studied the adoption of wells and drip irrigation in china and it is also in line with research on water management practices in arkansas us huang et al 2017 for the contextual variables characterizing watercourses infrastructure and water withdrawals the models illustrate that canal extension and wua are not significant but wcr ww lining and fees yield significant impacts on the adoption of technologies these results suggest that both proxies of location with the plausible gains on certainty on water rights for farmers located in a primary or a shorter canal are not triggering decisions to adopt it that confirms findings by zhang et al 2013 who did not find an effect of canal length on water productivity in china regarding location manero et al 2019 working in small irrigation schemes in tanzania found a significant yet negative effect on agricultural production and income for farmers located in secondary canals on the other hand wcr produces a negative effect reducing the rate of adoption of technologies between 35 and 52 in terms of irr and 0 2 in the form of marginal effects the stabilization of water supply produced by community reservoirs affects farmers decisions concerning irrigation negatively rather than generating incentives coinciding with the findings of zilberman et al 2011 on the contrary ww positively influences it usage continuous access to water increases the rate of adoption by 50 0 18 technologies compared to the turn system allowing a full exercise of their water rights and thus to conduct investments oriented towards better management furthermore fees produces a positive effect on two of the three model specifications rounding an increase in the rate of 50 irr if farmers pay higher fees this can either be due to more expensive fees clp l s 1 to the use of larger volumes of water or both bearing that in mind it is possible to infer that higher water costs trigger the adoption of it significant higher fees were also found significant by jara rojas et al 2012 working in neighboring areas but focusing on water conservation technologies finally lining is also impacting the level of adoption but not as expected irr below 1 a better infrastructure reduces conveying losses providing farmers a more reliable environment for receiving their water shares and conditions for investments however the effect of lining goes in the opposite direction somehow disincentivizing farmers taking action in terms of irrigation investments although not expected these results are somehow similar to those found by tang et al 2016 in china who state that it seems as though good canal infrastructure is sufficient as a water saving technology furthermore when introducing the perceptual variables on prm3 accessibility and full irrigation are significant but se irrigation and problems are not table 3 the irr s for the rest of the variables retain the significance and magnitude with the same interpretation as described before insignificance for se irrigation points out that regardless of other personal characteristics irrigation skills are rated similarly with 63 of farmers rating themselves as good irrigators however most of the farmers 98 know neither total irrigation requirements nor the volume applied to crops each irrigation time a more reliable water supply is positively impacting farmers to implement technologies compared to those who perceive a more deficient availability a similar effect but not significant of reliability of water on technology adoption was found by adeoti 2008 in ghana on the other hand manero et al 2019 found a positive impact of water reliability on yields in tanzania conversely full irrigation significantly decreases the rate of it implementation by 50 on average although in terms of irr ww gets a bigger rate change full irrigation yields the most significant effect on the number of technologies according to the average marginal effects examining the marginal effects more closely credits full irrigation and accessibility have the highest impacts for the personal and the contextual and perceptual variables respectively while access to agricultural credits increases the number of technologies by 0 4 full irrigation reduces them by 0 33 accessibility on the other hand increases the number by 0 32 these variables in some way represent the availability or lack of financial and natural resources and the incentives for farmers to adopt it as these variables are binary interactions among these 3 variables are introduced to prm3 yielding relevant results table 5 firstly for the credits full irrigation combination the irr s are below 1 meaning that each combination reduces the rate to implement practices relative to the base category however only the interaction no credit irrigation is significant depicting the largest reduction in proportion 80 and number 0 78 of technologies compared to the base no credit no irrigation suggesting that irrigating the full land perception has a dominant effect which represents the perception of sufficient water to irrigate secondly the interaction full irrigation accessibility unexpectedly produces no significant results since both variables have opposite effects it seems that the variables cancel out each other s individual effects finally in terms of the last interaction between credits and accessibility the figures show that both variables complement each other increasing the irr s with positive marginal effects however only credit accessibility is significant with a factor change of 0 47 more technologies as it was stated before it seems that the statement of full irrigation generates a dominant effect on the adoption of technologies which may be interpreted as a relative abundance of the resource according to the data half of the farmers hold less than 1 3 l s 1 and 75 of them are under the sample mean 1 86 when turned into a water land ratio however only 28 of farmers in the sample have less than 1 l s 1 ha 1 therefore full irrigation could be explained by either capturing larger water applications respecting the water shares they own given the poor infrastructure and lack of control of water withdrawals or due to possible internal arrangements within each canal this positive perception in terms of irrigation is strengthened by the head reservoir which allows for stabilization and better resource distribution and reducing farmers exposure to water shortages discouraging farmers adoption of it this decreasing need for adopting risk reducing measures due to improvements in water supply by dams coincides with those described by biswo et al 2018 3 3 latent class analysis results complementing the econometric analysis an lca was performed to identify the underlying diversity of it in the study area despite the figures showing a low rate of adoption table 2 depicts that the most utilized technology is eis 18 followed by wells 15 conversely humidity sensors and solar panels are the least used practices to classify farmers 4 lca models were run increasing the number of lc from 1 to 4 selecting the model that best disaggregates the data in homogenous classes while minimizing the aic and bic criteria the results show that the model with 2 classes gets the best fit 8 8 see table 9 in annex 3 for the goodness of fit of each latent class model in this lca membership classes make up 88 c1 and 12 c2 c1 is the non technological and c2 the technological class table 6 depicts the average probability distribution of belonging to each class for each technology the non technological class comprises the vast majority of farmers n 295 the main feature of this group of farmers is that they have no technologies this implies that the bulk of the farmers are technologically precarious if they apply 59 it is only 1 technology either eis or wells but with a low probability around 9 in figures for this group 28 irrigators use eis 26 utilize wells and only 3 hold a reservoir though not jointly as a result there is a clear preference for infrastructure technologies among farmers in this group these 59 farmers overlap with the technological irrigators class n 40 containing farmers with the highest item responses for the set of technologies and practices fig 3 c2 is distinct because farmers have installed eis 32 and wells 23 but in addition to these technologies c2 contains the totality of irrigators making use of irrigation programming tools c1 entails 80 236 of farmers with no technologies implying water applications by surface irrigation methods such as flood and furrow by contrast c2 comprises irrigators applying at least one technology ranging from 1 to 5 with 2 67 5 and 3 17 5 the most applied for those farmers using 2 technologies n 27 the most common packages are eis and a well n 11 or an eis plus a programming tool n 4 differences in characteristics conforming the two groups were tested through statistical analysis table 10 in supplementary data class 1 is less educated and has more farming experience while group2 receives more technical support and has a higher percentage of farmers with access to agricultural credits significant at 10 and 1 respectively in terms of natural resources capital group1 holds smaller plots lower water rights dotation and less area using eis all significant at 1 however they have a higher water land ratio 1 90 vs 1 54 for c2 table 7 these figures contribute to explain the low rate of adoption confirming the regression analysis results i e access to credits and larger water land ratios generate disincentives to invest in terms of agricultural production both clusters entail irrigators growing the 4 main crop categories more specifically c2 is dominated by fruit production with 68 growing either raspberries blackberries blueberries and apples and cereals as the second largest type of crop 8 farmers 20 in c1 annual crops and fruit are the dominant crops both comprising 88 of the agricultural land under production for this class 38 3 and 49 each one relevant issue makes up fruit production which consists of 2 sub segments class 1 focuses on small scale production based on berries raspberry and blackberry meanwhile class 2 grows more extensive areas with apple cherry tree or blueberries out of the 431 plots cultivated in class 1 402 93 are watered by flood or furrow for class 2 52 3 of crops are being cultivated using eis out of which 63 makes up fruit and 44 horticulture both significant at 1 pastures and forage are irrigated by surface irrigation in both classes regarding contextual and infrastructural characteristics c1 contains 40 of irrigators who have access to water by turns whereas 22 in c2 do out of 126 irrigators declaring being on a turn regime 93 are in the non technological class likewise in c1 a higher proportion of irrigators is located at a secondary canal level 46 and pay fewer annual fees with 85 of farmers payments below average both significant at 1 finally in terms of perception the only distinctive difference is related to the perceived water availability at 1 with class1 giving a lower valuation 0 54 vs 0 8 for class2 despite the difference in grouping farmers the classes detected for the lca the non technological and technological types present some similarities with other clustering studies for instance takeshima 2016 found out that in nigeria for the less technological cluster a minority 33 of farmers use irrigation to some extent robert et al 2017 working in india grouped farms into 3 groups defining one group as the technological and more diversified lastly maton et al 2005 in france found 2 types of irrigation strategies according to irrigation practices intensive and extensive irrigators the results of the econometric and latent class analysis jointly allow for a better understanding of the low rate of adoption of it leading to a series of considerations for further developments regarding technology adoption and on farm irrigation water management not only in this study area but for the wider agricultural irrigation in chile as well as in similar environments for farmers adopting it there is a clear preference and tendency for the adoption of infrastructural technologies to the detriment of improved it such as scheduling or programming tools despite the well known benefits of these techniques the precise timing and amount of water applied bjornlund et al 2009 montoro et al 2011 and reducing the overall application and potential gains in efficiency and yields gleick 2003 the results show a minimal usage of scheduling being only applied in fruit production which is the most profitable crop in the study area however these results in terms of extent and type of adoption of it are somehow expectable since they match with technologies subsidized by public programs mostly through the act ley 18 450 de fomento a la inversion privada en obras de riego y drenaje which aims to foster the implementation of on farm and off farm irrigation infrastructure such as efficient irrigation systems and reservoirs excluded in this law are management techniques such as scheduling engler et al 2016 the promotion of these type of technologies has been common in other countries such as the us spain garc√≠a moll√° et al 2019 india bahinipati and viswanathan 2019 malik et al 2018 australia grafton and wheeler 2018 and china zhang et al 2019 where programs have a water conservation focus and some of them also incentivize the adoption and implementation of scheduling sears et al 2018 the chilean program differs in explicitly orienting towards an expansion of the irrigated land engler et al 2016 and improving the transparency and legal security of the water rights clarvis and allan 2014 however recent research has shown that the implementation of eis drip irrigation increases the adoption of scheduling claiming for the inclusion of management tools to the current set of subsidized technologies engler et al 2016 it may be argued that the adoption of it depends on means and incentives levidow et al 2014 according to the results of our case study credits and full irrigation are the main drivers influencing the adoption of it where the former may represent the availability lack of financial resources or means demonstrated to influence the adoption of it alcon et al 2011 and full irrigation the availability of water giving incentives disincentives to adopt it out of these incentives disincentives water availability scarcity has been shown to be a driver of the adoption of technologies olen et al 2015 taylor and zilberman 2017 conversely the relative abundance of surface water disincentives farmers to invest and adopt it and reduce water usage mendelsohn and dinar 2003 nevertheless in addition to these factors it is possible to introduce a set of elements hindering the adoption of it some institutional and policy factors have demonstrated to trigger the adoption of irrigation technologies in this setting policy instruments like water pricing have shown to boost the adoption of it alcon et al 2011 berbel and g√≥mez lim√≥n 2000 zilberman et al 2011 in this regard the relative water abundance in the study area next to some distinctive features of the allocation process and the characteristics of irrigation water rights no cost for initial allocation the full and permanent ownership on a certain amount of resources l s 1 poor conveyance and control infrastructure at canal level the current focus of the irrigation programs and the presence of a head reservoir shape an unsuitable scenario to apply policies to increase willingness to adopt such as pricing and as a result do not generate enough incentives to adopt it however for a better understanding of it adoption and irrigation management in the study area deeper comprehension of this stated relative abundance water is needed especially given the divergence between this relative abundance and the manifest water shortage scenario of central chile in the last decade garreaud et al 2019 4 conclusions and policy implications this article examines the adoption of irrigation technologies and the underlying diversity in terms of intensity of adoption in 2 irrigated valleys of the maule region in central chile where a mixture of farming coexists the results show a low level and range of technology adoption with only 30 of farmers adopting technologies and efficient irrigation systems and wells as more widespread practices this conforms to the subsidies provided by the chilean government over the past 4 decades this low level of adoption was disaggregated in 2 groups by a latent class analysis a small group was comprised of moderate to intensive users of technologies while the second group gathered the majority of non adopters most of them restricted in terms of natural capital and financial barriers econometric analyses showed that the adoption of technologies depends on a series of factors particularly education diversification and the dominance of fruit or horticultural production positively impact the number of technologies conversely higher water land rates community reservoirs and unlined canals reduce adoption the relative abundance of water and accessing financial capital are the main factors influencing the adoption of technologies although the results are case study specific to these two irrigated valleys they allow addressing some policy implications to both the public sector and private agents to date the irrigation policy in chile focuses on improvements in efficiency and on and off farm infrastructure aiming at increments of agricultural productivity and favoring projects with the largest increases in irrigated land this policy does not incorporate technical support and it is restricted to a limited type of technologies therefore if the goal is to increase the rate of adoption widening and facilitating access to public subsidies and relaxing entry barriers for those with limited resources creating irrigation extension programs to support and spread the range of subsidized irrigation technologies including management techniques is required given the low rate of adoption programs incentivizing the implementation of irrigation technologies are still needed nevertheless it is also crucial to consider a few other elements the results show that contextual characteristics are hindering adoption rates challenging the correct design of policy and programs moreover efficiency oriented policies can raise the pressure over water resources leading to incremental water consumption and irrigated areas instead of water savings if control on water resources is absent perry et al 2017 sears et al 2018 switching from less to more efficient irrigation causes changes in the demand of water and such improvements may also be a source of adverse spillover effects for those placed downstream grafton et al 2018 vicuna et al 2014 moreover those improvements do not uniquely depend on individual efforts but demand collective decisions in many situations requiring financial and technical capacity as well as a suitable environment and governance at both canal and basin level finally irrigation technologies are considered essential in dealing with water shortages as well as in developing long term adaptation strategies in light of climate change reductions in water availability are expected for central chile challenging public and private organizations to design suitable policies and programs increasing reliability generating

10617,this paper examines the adoption of irrigation technologies and the underlying diversity in terms of intensity of adoption in 2 irrigated valleys in central chile results show a low and narrow range of adoption with only 30 of farmers adopting technologies through a latent class analysis 2 types of farmers were identified a small group comprising moderate to intensive users and a second one consisting of the majority of farmers mostly constrained in natural capital furthermore the econometric analysis indicates that education diversification continuous access to water and perception of water reliability increase the adoption conversely higher water land ratios presence of community reservoirs and earthen canals reduce the uptake overall the dominance of fruit and horticulture production access to agricultural credits and full irrigation of the farm are the main drivers of adoption the latter is a critical factor indicating a relative abundance of water resources which alongside contextual characteristics discourages farmers from implementing technologies the low adoption rate as well as the hindering factors will challenge public and private organizations to design and implement policies aiming to improve water reliability and management to generate incentives and increase awareness on the scarcity of the resource in the light of the predicted reductions in water availability because of climate change will be crucial as well keywords irrigation technologies adoption level water management central chile 1 introduction water availability and management have become a limiting factor and a challenge in various parts of the world especially in countries with more scarce water resources the agricultural sector is responsible for more than 70 of water withdrawals for consumptive use grafton et al 2018 siebert et al 2010 and irrigation constitutes an essential practice for agricultural production levidow et al 2014 given population growth and the increasing demand for fiber and food the agricultural water usage is foreseen to increase mancosu et al 2015 irrigation technologies it 1 1 although there are a variety of technologies at on farm and off farm level in this paper irrigation technologies refer to those technologies intended to improve water delivery at the on farm level perry 2017 allowing for improvements in water efficiency and economic benefits as well as reducing environmental burdens levidow et al 2014 bring a series of benefits allowing a better agricultural and water management especially in water resource scarce areas levidow et al 2014 improvements in water use efficiency increases in agricultural productivity and shifts to more profitable crops adeyemi et al 2017 perry et al 2017 taylor and zilberman 2017 farmers often apply or combine more than one technology according to the expected profits foster and rosenzweig 2010 green et al 1996 easiness of use or low maintenance requirements pokhrel et al 2018 because of the benefits of it their adoption has been a matter of study especially in identifying determinants of adoption among these are environmental or producers characteristics fleischer et al 2011 green et al 1996 their effect on production risk and uncertainty foudi and erdlenbruch 2012 koundouri et al 2006 their water saving capacity jara rojas et al 2012 molle and tanouti 2017 zhang et al 2019 and water use efficiency chaudhry 2018 speelman et al 2008 more recently research also has been focusing on the role of irrigation as a climate change adaptation strategy bryan et al 2013 deressa et al 2009 iglesias and garrote 2015 mendelsohn 2012 smit and skinner 2002 varela ortega et al 2016 besides the literature on it adoption reveals multiple factors influencing the decision to adopt it socioeconomics characteristics of farmers such as age education family size and experience as well as factors like financial constraints access to credits and information are found to affect this decision bjornlund et al 2009 caswell and zilberman 1985 engler et al 2016 wang et al 2016 likewise adoption of it is determined by farm attributes i e farm size location land or soil quality growing crops and environmental characteristics precipitation temperature caswell and zilberman 1985 green et al 1996 furthermore policy interventions such as support services subsidies provision of information and pricing have shown to affect the adoption of it caswell et al 1990 green et al 1996 zhang et al 2019 despite the benefits of it and the extensive literature regarding adoption in different irrigation settings most of the research on this topic has focused either on specific technologies e g on the decision to irrigate or the application of drip or sprinkler irrigation other linked choices are often omitted huang et al 2017 pokhrel et al 2018 nowadays complementary technologies and practices such as land leveling irrigation scheduling soil moisture monitoring or tailwater recovery systems strengthen water management thereby improving the performance of the irrigation systems huang et al 2017 montoro et al 2011 pokhrel et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 moreover even though there are scholars who have studied the intensity of adoption of technologies such as precision agriculture technologies barnes et al 2019 isgin et al 2008 paxton et al 2011 or modern rice technologies mariano et al 2012 the evidence on it is still scanty with some exceptions jara rojas et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 wang et al 2016 on the other hand irrigation decisions may be influenced by either collective arrangements or because of neighbors decisions especially in irrigation systems with poor control withdrawal infrastructure and conveyance as members of an irrigation system farmers share some environmental context as well as socioeconomic and infrastructural characteristics such as reservoirs or watercourses chaudhry 2018 system characteristics receive an increasing interest considering their effects on agricultural production manero et al 2019 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2013 adaptation to climate change tang et al 2016 as well as input usage and irrigation efficiency chaudhry 2018 understanding the drivers shaping this technology adoption is required for further planning and strategic dissemination of farm technologies mariano et al 2012 allowing policymakers and water managers to know the extent of policy interventions wang et al 2016 in this regard aiming to contribute to the literature of technology adoption in irrigated agriculture the present article considers 2 irrigated valleys in central chile irrigation in chile holds a long tradition with private water users associations established since colonial times meza et al 2012 and roughly 1 1 million hectares of irrigated lands jara rojas et al 2012 due to climate characteristics irrigation is a central factor in agricultural production oyarz√∫n et al 2008 moreover the region in central chile under consideration currently suffers the most extensive period of water shortage ever recorded garreaud et al 2017 garreaud et al 2019 because of this setting of relative scarcity chile has set irrigation as a primordial matter in the agricultural policy over the past 4 decades 2 2 irrigation became more relevant since 1985 when the chilean state promulgated law 18 450 of irrigation and drainage this act states a clear focus on increasing the irrigated land areas rather than water saving purposes martin and saavedra 2018 following a mostly hard path approach through improvements in on and off farm efficiency as well as in infrastructure for water storage clarvis and allan 2014 meza et al 2008 vicuna et al 2014 despite this long standing irrigation history the stimulus and support for adoption of it evidence concerning farmers decisions in irrigation adoption is relatively new with few exceptions engler et al 2016 jara rojas et al 2012 roco et al 2016 salazar and rand 2016 thus in order to better understand the adoption of it this article has two objectives first and foremost the research aims to estimate the level of adoption of it in central chile and examine the drivers of such adoption the second goal based on it consists in identifying and classifying farmers according to their adoption decisions in order to do so the article continues as follows the next section introduces and describes the study area the survey conducted and provides an outline of the methods employed subsequently the main results are analyzed and discussed finally a conclusion and a policy implications section will conclude the research 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area in chile irrigation water management as well as water management of other productive sectors is governed through the water code of 1981 wc81 the wc81 declares water as an economic good based principally on a complete separation of water from land and defines private and permanent property rights on water wr allowing the free transferability of this resource another central feature of wc81 is the orientation towards private management thereby reducing the capacity of regulation and intervention by the state vergara and rivera 2018 in terms of irrigation the code states that owners of wr are responsible for water management through three different levels of organization at natural source level management is organized by the vigilance committees juntas de vigilancia jv for artificial sources wr owners gather either in comunidades de agua water communities wc which are in charge of secondary infrastructure canals or asociacion de canalistas canal users associations ca responsible for the administration of main infrastructure such as reservoirs and primary canals martin and saavedra 2018 vald√©s pineda et al 2014 these different water associations have some common responsibilities such as conveying and delivering water to users according to wr ownership conflict resolution and collection and management of water fees donoso 2014 this research considers two sub watersheds of the maule river basin in central chile the ancoa and the achibueno river valleys fig 1 central chile has a mediterranean climate with a heterogeneous distribution of water availability throughout the year most of the rain occurs in periods in which agricultural production is less intensive with lower demand for irrigation determining an imbalance between water demand and supply and a relative scarcity for agricultural production vicuna et al 2014 world bank 2011 the region receives on average 870 mm of rainfall with june and july as the rainiest and coldest months whereas january february and december are the driest and warmest months with median temperatures around 18 c agrimed 2017 the study area consists of the valleys irrigated by the ancoa and the achibueno rivers which are managed by the ancoa and achibueno jv s under each jv there are a series of autonomous wc in this case 31 wc s are part of ancoa holding 7 418 0 l s 1 providing water to circa 10 000 ha cnr 2013 on the other hand 22 wc s are under jv achibueno administrating 20 767 2 l s 1 and irrigating 25 000 ha cnr 2013 moreover since 2014 the area benefits from a header reservoir with a storage capacity of 78 3 hm 3 allowing storage and better distribution of the water rights and with the adverse effects of the drought affecting central chile since 2010 garreaud et al 2017 garreaud et al 2019 this part of chile is appropriate for a multiplicity of crops and in the region cash crops coexist with self consumption agriculture thereby all farm sizes are found as well fern√°ndez et al 2019 jara rojas et al 2012 specifically corn rice blueberries raspberries and perennials such as apple and cherry trees are the main crops cultivated jara rojas et al 2012 2 2 data collection the data were gathered in the chilean summer between december and february of 2018 19 the primary source of information utilized to select the sample comes from the ancoa and achibueno jv s each jv keeps a list of farmers and their water shares because they pay annual fees for conveyance from the primary canal to the water intake point 3 3 although each canal keeps an updated list for fees collection some wc s have delegated this action to jv s hands facilitating farmers payments to both jv and wc as well as preventing high levels of indebtedness unfortunately the jv s and the wc s do not maintain detailed and updated records about their members in most of the cases they have lists of farmers and their water shares yet lack the spatial location of water withdrawals and farms as well as telephone numbers in terms of agricultural policy regarding the sampled farmers chilean farms are divided into 3 main categories small medium and large farms mart√≠nez et al 2014 oecd 2008 which define the type of subsidies and the technical support they receive 4 4 in chile small farms are distinct in two aspects they own less than 12 hectares of irrigation units hbu and their income must come primarily from agricultural production this research entails information on the whole spectrum of farms the sole requirement being a member of a wc in total 335 farmers of 26 wc s from both jv s were surveyed the sampling followed a 2stage strategy centered on water rights first farmers were divided into two groups jv according to the number of individuals of each jv afterwards irrigators of main canals of each jv were selected through a proportional sampling keeping the weight of each canal in the area the data comprises personal social and farm characteristics as well as info on natural capital land and water shares it practices and crops and some physical and contextual characteristics of the canals in order to register the applied it a prior selection was made based on the existing literature bjornlund et al 2009 huang et al 2017 levidow et al 2014 perry et al 2017 and previous studies carried out in chile and neighboring areas engler et al 2016 jara rojas et al 2012 roco et al 2014 2016 taking into account the technologies funded by the government cnr 2013 and in consultation with the members of jv s and some wc s after a pre test period where a low adoption range and rate of it were found farmers were required to enumerate and describe their it classified into 9 technologies an important remark is that this study focuses on technologies and techniques that allow farmers to improve irrigation but practices routinely applied to receive water rights such as weed control in on farm canals withdrawal works etc were excluded in addition in order to characterize farmers context and environment within each canal self reported data on their location and physical infrastructure characteristics were also gathered 2 3 methods to meet the objectives of the article a methodological approach consisting of 2 parts is applied in the first part the determinants affecting the number of irrigation technologies adopted is estimated the second part is oriented towards disentangling the most applied combinations of it implemented at the field level 2 3 1 econometric analysis regression analysis is utilized to model and estimate determinants influencing technology adoption since the variable of interest is a non negative count the most appropriate approach is a count data model the usual way to deal with count data is assuming that y follows a poisson distribution with a probability density function long and freese 2006 wooldridge 2010 1 pr y y x e Œº Œº y y w i t h y 0 1 m a n d i 1 n and 2 v a r y x e y x Œº e x Œ≤ with Œº expected mean variance y x where y is the count data variable and xand Œ≤ are vectors of independent variables and parameters to estimate respectively the poisson model prm accounts for observed heterogeneity observed differences among sample members by specifying the rate y as a function of observed x s however in practice the prm seldom fits well due to two issues overdispersion underdispersion and the presence of an excess of zeros wooldridge 2010 overdispersion 5 5 underdispersion goes on the opposite way that is the variance is lower than the conditional mean means the variance exceeds the mean i e var yi e yi 1 violating the poisson assumption eq 2 implying that prm underestimates the dispersion of the outcome cameron and trivedi 2010 long and freese 2006 if overdispersion exists and is ignored prm estimates will be consistent but inefficient with standard errors biased downward although the model might include the correct variables to overcome this problem a negative binomial regression model nbrm can be used instead isgin et al 2008 loeys et al 2012 long and freese 2006 in that case the probability mass function of nb is 3 pr y y Œº Œ± Œ≥ y Œ± 1 y Œ≥ Œ± 1 Œ± 1 Œ± 1 Œº Œ± 1 Œº Œ± 1 Œº y where Œ≥ is gamma distribution Œ± is the variance parameter of the gamma distribution and Œº is the intensity or rate parameter cameron and trivedi 2010 paxton et al 2011 the second issue is the excess of zeros in the data set in many empirical cases the poisson model or nb fails to estimate zeros as an alternative a zero inflated model zi allows dealing with both overdispersion and the excess of zeros zi s are mixture models with two separate components representing the outcome distribution the first modeling the probability of excess of zeros false or not always zeros and the second accounting for the non excess of zeros true or always zeros and non zero counts barnes et al 2019 isgin et al 2008 loeys et al 2012 bearing this in mind a prm was run as the initial model testing for overdispersion and excess of zeros this was done by simultaneously running an nbrm model the variance of an nbrm is 4 v a r y x e y x Œº Œ± Œº 2 where Œ± is the dispersion parameter and with eq 3 reducing to eq 2 when Œ± 0 overdispersion was tested by the generalized likelihood ratio test llr and if it exists Œ± 0 the nbrm model must be selected cameron and trivedi 2010 long and freese 2006 the excess of zeros in the sample is tested by the modified versions of the vuong test corrected by the aikake information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic desmarais and harden 2013 wilson 2015 a explicatory variables this section gives details on the dependent and explicatory variables the conceptual model is 5 y f x r c p where y is the number of it implemented by irrigator i with y 1 n x is a vector of farmers characteristics and r comprises natural resources variables c is a vector containing farmer contextual and physical variables within a wc and finally p is a set of perceptual variables given that irrigators apply a total of 9 different technologies table 2 3 different specifications of the dependent variable were constructed table 1 first y1 represents the total number of it considering each different technology for y2 those technologies related to scheduling namely scheduling meteorological stations and programming tools are grouped in a single category finally as some farmers use the same it for irrigating more than one crop this peculiarity is captured by y3 accumulating the total number it including the totality of efficient irrigation systems the explanatory variables include a set of regressors usually applied in the agricultural technology adoption literature caswell and zilberman 1985 green et al 1996 isgin et al 2008 jara rojas et al 2012 mariano et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 tang et al 2016 table 1 of annex 1 in the supplemental material provides a complete explanation as well as descriptive statistics for the full set of variables regarding households characteristics hh age corresponds to the age of the hh head gender refers to the sex of the respondent 0 if female and 1 if male education corresponds to the level of schooling years of the hh head and experience denotes the years of farming and irrigation by the hh head for farm variables owner refers to whether the farmer owns the plot 0 if yes 1 if other social capital states if the farmer participates in social organizations 1 if yes 0 otherwise non farm income na income indicates whether a farmer gets income from non agricultural activities or not and agricultural advisor considers whether a farmer receives recommendations from external people either public or private the last variable of this subset is access to agricultural credits credits taking 1 if a farmer states that he is subject to apply for credits for agricultural activities purchase of inputs irrigation infrastructure etc the subset of natural capital includes farm size ha water shares ws and a diversification index the land size and water shares represent proxies of farmers wealth one ws in ancoa is equivalent to 1 and in achibueno it is 1 5 l s 1 to get a standard measurement the ws in achibueno were therefore multiplied with 1 5 crop diversification is measured through the herfindahl index hi index roco et al 2017 wuepper et al 2017 6 h i n 1 n x n 2 where xn is the proportion of area for the n th crop respecting the total area under production the index is a continuous measure of diversification ranging from 0 complete diversification to 1 whole specialization for a better understanding of the level of diversification a variant of the index 1 hi yielding the opposite results is applied meaning 1 for a fully diversified farmer roco et al 2017 moreover a set of binary variables capturing the productive emphasis of each farmer is introduced according to the predominant crop thus 5 variables cereals c fruit f annual crops c vegetable v and forage production fo were included contextual or environmental characteristics capture the fact that farmers share some characteristics in certain settings such as socioeconomic and infrastructure context chaudhry 2018 wang et al 2018 in irrigation systems farmers may share a watercourse a water delivery system or reservoirs from the set of characteristics that members could share this article focuses on infrastructure variables intended to increase the reliability and certainty with which farmers receive their water shares this article uses lining location presence of a water community reservoir organization for water withdrawal water fees and canal extension as contextual variables when lining water conveyance is improved water losses are reduced farmers were asked about the canal lining in the section close to their water intake hence lining is a binary variable taking the value of 1 if a farmer reports a section fully or partially lined and 0 if it is an earthen canal tang et al 2016 the variable water community reservoir wcr describes if a wc owns an off farm reservoir receiving a value of 1 if affirmative and 0 otherwise although such infrastructure does not produce extra water it allows for storage and use when required the organization of water withdrawal ww refers to irrigator s access to water ww is a dummy variable 1 if withdrawal is continuous and permanent and 0 if it is organized in turns 6 6 although water rights are defined as continuous and permanent by the chilean water code of 1981 some canals apply turn systems for some particular reasons like land subdivision and subsequently the water rights type of canal canal captures the position or location of a farmer in the canal network within a particular waterway canal is 1 if a farmer gets water from the central canal and 0 if he gets it from a secondary or tertiary level canal annual fees is a binary variable with the value of 1 if a farmer pays more than average annual fees across the 26 canals and 0 otherwise when having to pay expensive fees farmers might take care of their water using it more efficiently canal extension extension is a variable that considers the length of each primary canal canal extension takes 1 if the extension surpasses the average length for the 26 canals km and 0 otherwise also wua is a dummy variable referring to the jv with 0 for ancoa and 1 for achibueno this variable is capturing the distinctive features of each wua such as governance or operation rules finally since 2010 central chile has endured the most extensive drought ever recorded aldunce et al 2017 garreaud et al 2019 encompassing most of the territory where irrigated agriculture thrives recent research in adjacent areas has shown that farmers perceive changes in rainfall decreasing and temperatures increasing as well as more frequent drought periods roco et al 2015 given the connection between climate and water supply for irrigation 4 perception questions related to the availability and struggles for water use during the agricultural season were asked these questions were listed as follows a how do you qualify your access to water rights accessibility b does your water withdrawal enable you to irrigate your farm fully full irrigation c how do you value your irrigation skills se irrigation and d do you have any problems with getting your water problems the variables were measured on a 5 point likert scale ranging from 1 very negative to 5 no negative no problem perception for each question 4 dummy variables were set taking 1 if the answer was over the average and 0 otherwise 2 3 2 latent class analysis the second objective of the paper is to analyze the underlying diversity of it within the sample and to determine types of farmers in the study area to that end the it forming the dependent variables in the regression analysis are used as the inputs variables for segmenting irrigators thus this research assigns farmers in homogeneous classes of technologies instead of grouping them according to the characteristics of the observations to accomplish the former a latent class analysis approach lca was employed a method applied extensively in social sciences but not much in agricultural research with some exceptions such as the adoption of improved agro technologies bizimungu and kabunga 2018 and perception of farmers to climate change arbuckle et al 2014 barnes et al 2013 lca is a method which by a statistical procedure identifies class membership probabilities for a set of observations by using the responses of a set of observed or manifest variables barnes et al 2013 linzer and lewis 2011 the goal is to determine the smallest number of latent classes sufficiently explaining the unobserved associations among the set of manifest variables magidson and vermunt 2004 the key characteristic of this method is that both the latent and the observed variables are categorical linzer and lewis 2011 skrondal and rabe hesketh 2007 an lca is a model based clustering technique similar to cluster analysis given the fact that both methods group individuals into homogenous classes vermunt and magidson 2002 however lca shows some advantages since it is based on a statistical model the selection of the number of clusters classes is defined based on statistical tests and techniques to handle missing data are also available arbuckle et al 2014 kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 vermunt and magidson 2002 formally lca is fitted as follows first let yijk denote the observed value of the j manifest observed variable for individual i who gives the k th response to the j th variable in this case j are the irrigation technologies and k the possible outcome is binary thus yijk can take values of 1 or 0 in addition œÄ j r k is the class conditional probability that an observation i belongs to a class r with r 1 r yielding the k th outcome for the j th variable within each class 6 k 1 k j œÄ j r k 1 according to linzer and lewis 2011 and assuming mutual independence of responses within each class the probability that an individual i in a specific class r yields a particular j set of outcomes is the product of 7 f y i œÄ r j 1 j k 1 k j œÄ j r k y i j k the probability density function across the classes is the weighted sum 8 p y i œÄ p r 1 r p r j 1 j k 1 k j œÄ j r k y i j k thus the model parameters p r and œÄ j r k are estimated by the latent class model the posterior probability p ÀÜ r i y i for an individual belonging to a specific class is estimated by bayes theorem as follows 9 p ÀÜ r i y i p ÀÜ r f y i œÄ ÀÜ q q 1 q p ÀÜ r f y i œÄ ÀÜ q where p ÀÜ r and œÄ ÀÜ q are the estimates of p r and œÄ j r k by the expectation maximization algorithm em which proceeds in an iterative way firstly the e step creates a function for the expectation of the log likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters p r and œÄ j r k then the m step computes parameters maximizing the expected log likelihood found on the e step the estimates for p r and œÄ j r k are used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next e step finally the model selection is based on the bayesian information criterion bic and the aikake information criteria aic opting for the model that minimizes the values of aic and bic barnes et al 2013 linzer and lewis 2011 3 results 3 1 the technological level of adoption of irrigation technologies fig 2 shows the total number of it implemented by irrigators in the study area in the sample 70 of farmers have not implemented any technology intended to manage their water rights and only around 11 have put in place 2 or more practices in terms of area 26 of the production land is irrigated by an efficient irrigation system eis at the farm level eis is the most utilized it representing 39 of those farmers implementing at least one practice but only reaching 18 of the sample table 2 eis constitutes 47 for farmers adopting 1 it and 39 from those applying 2 it wells are behind eis with 15 of adoption moreover wells constitute 43 for a single technology and jointly with eis both represent 90 and 65 of 1 and 2 adopted it respectively on the other hand scheduling is marginally adopted with only 3 3 of the farmers within the sample using it in addition it is always adopted jointly with other it humidity retention techniques are also minimally implemented by only 9 2 6 of the farmers regarding the adoption level of the set of it currently in use the results show a low extent of adoption for each it when comparing with adoption rates in chile the results are higher than those found by roco et al 2016 who in nearby areas detected rates of adoption of the on farm infrastructure of 3 the results differ however with adoption rates in more scarce regions in chile such as the findings of engler et al 2016 who found an adoption rate of 43 for drip irrigation and 23 of scheduling instruments for wine producers they also differ with the findings of molinos senante et al 2016 in the semi arid north of chile where the adoption rate of eis was 94 finally the results differ with adoption rates in other countries where some technologies have been supported such as spain alcon et al 2011 and the u s pokhrel et al 2018 sears et al 2018 taylor and zilberman 2017 3 2 determinants of the intensity of adoption of irrigation technologies the second part of the analysis looks for factors influencing the adoption of it utilizing a count data modeling approach first of all for the set of variables included in the regression analysis both pairwise correlations and variance inflation factors vif were tested to make sure there was no severe multicollinearity the results for the correlations and vif s no higher than 5 determine no problems of collinearity o brien 2007 statacorp 2017 see table 2 and 3 in supplementary data for more details the count data models were estimated for the 3 dependent variables defined in 3 3 1 at first overdispersion and zero inflation were tested these tests indicate that for specifications y1 and y2 the prm is preferred and for y3 the nbrm is a more appropriate model see table 4 in annex 2 in supplemental material once decided that prm and nbrm models yield better results the second step was to select the model with the best fit to facilitate the interpretation the specification y2 shows the best goodness of fit measures minimizing the values for aic and bic 532 82 and 612 92 12 each and getting the highest pseudor2 0 224 table 5 in a supplementary data material displays the results for the 6 remaining specifications table 3 displays the results for 3 prm models with y2 as dependent variable see table 6 in supplementary data for more details prm1 depicts the results including land size and ws as regressors whereas the second and the third use the variable wl ratio prm2 and pmr3 incorporating the series of perceptual variables wl ratio is derived from the ws and land size quotient taking a 1 if the ratio exceeds the mean for the sample and 0 otherwise to get a better understanding and interpretation regression coefficients are depicted and analyzed as incidence risk ratios irr 7 7 irr are also called factor change for their estimation each Œ≤i is exponented so irr Œ≤i e Œ≤i the irr s coefficient tells how a change in an x affects the rate at which y occurs while the average marginal effects determinines the impact of any covariate on the number of technologies and the average marginal effects long and freese 2006 mariano et al 2012 for the hh variables none except for education impact the number of it for any specification of the dependent variable these findings are not consistent with the technology adoption literature analyzed by count data models like the results on precision agriculture barnes et al 2019 isgin et al 2008 and on it jara rojas et al 2012 pokhrel et al 2018 education is highly and positively significant increasing the adoption by almost 10 in terms of irr but it results in only a slight increase in the number of technologies farms with more educated heads tend to increase it perhaps because they are exposed to more information thereby internalizing the benefits and costs of these technologies this finding is in line with adoption literature which states a positive relationship between human capital and the decisions to adopt modern technologies bjornlund et al 2009 koundouri et al 2006 access to technical support has a positive yet not significant impact on the range of specifications for ownership being a renter reduces the rate though not significantly likewise non agricultural income has no impact on farmers decisions to adopt technologies having extra resources and a more favorable financial capacity could lead to a more considerable utilization of these types of technologies on the other hand credits is the variable with the most significant impact of the hh characteristics on the rate of it adoption the incremental change is roughly 150 0 41 technologies according to marginal effects compared to those who do not have access this is consistent with the results of jara rojas et al 2012 it is noteworthy that in chile access to credits implies a more robust financial backing as well as access to a broader range of agricultural services mostly offered by private agents regarding ws and land size the results are depicted in two ways as independent variables and as the wl ratio in prm1 it is shown that ws has a negative but non significant impact on technologies while land size slightly increases the rate to acquire an irrigation technology 0 5 being consistent with the findings of green et al 1996 isgin et al 2008 engler et al 2016 and feike et al 2017 the wl ratio a sign of water availability per unit of land ha causes a significant but negative effect on it reducing on average with 33 the rate of adoption this translates according to the average marginal effects discrete change in 0 19 fewer technologies for more efficient water management the diversification index has a positive and significant impact increasing the percentage to apply technologies it s enable farmers to a more diversified agricultural production hussain and hanjra 2004 both valleys cover a wide range of agricultural production hence requiring customized water management for the set of dummies capturing the specificity of agriculture production farms focused on fruit and horticulture have higher rates of technology usage compared to those cultivating annual crops the coefficients irr along with credits are the largest for the set of variables around 2 43 for fruit and 2 58 for horticulture translated to number of technologies these variables determine an increase in the number of technologies adopted of 0 36 and 0 39 this positive impact is consistent with the findings of feike et al 2017 who studied the adoption of wells and drip irrigation in china and it is also in line with research on water management practices in arkansas us huang et al 2017 for the contextual variables characterizing watercourses infrastructure and water withdrawals the models illustrate that canal extension and wua are not significant but wcr ww lining and fees yield significant impacts on the adoption of technologies these results suggest that both proxies of location with the plausible gains on certainty on water rights for farmers located in a primary or a shorter canal are not triggering decisions to adopt it that confirms findings by zhang et al 2013 who did not find an effect of canal length on water productivity in china regarding location manero et al 2019 working in small irrigation schemes in tanzania found a significant yet negative effect on agricultural production and income for farmers located in secondary canals on the other hand wcr produces a negative effect reducing the rate of adoption of technologies between 35 and 52 in terms of irr and 0 2 in the form of marginal effects the stabilization of water supply produced by community reservoirs affects farmers decisions concerning irrigation negatively rather than generating incentives coinciding with the findings of zilberman et al 2011 on the contrary ww positively influences it usage continuous access to water increases the rate of adoption by 50 0 18 technologies compared to the turn system allowing a full exercise of their water rights and thus to conduct investments oriented towards better management furthermore fees produces a positive effect on two of the three model specifications rounding an increase in the rate of 50 irr if farmers pay higher fees this can either be due to more expensive fees clp l s 1 to the use of larger volumes of water or both bearing that in mind it is possible to infer that higher water costs trigger the adoption of it significant higher fees were also found significant by jara rojas et al 2012 working in neighboring areas but focusing on water conservation technologies finally lining is also impacting the level of adoption but not as expected irr below 1 a better infrastructure reduces conveying losses providing farmers a more reliable environment for receiving their water shares and conditions for investments however the effect of lining goes in the opposite direction somehow disincentivizing farmers taking action in terms of irrigation investments although not expected these results are somehow similar to those found by tang et al 2016 in china who state that it seems as though good canal infrastructure is sufficient as a water saving technology furthermore when introducing the perceptual variables on prm3 accessibility and full irrigation are significant but se irrigation and problems are not table 3 the irr s for the rest of the variables retain the significance and magnitude with the same interpretation as described before insignificance for se irrigation points out that regardless of other personal characteristics irrigation skills are rated similarly with 63 of farmers rating themselves as good irrigators however most of the farmers 98 know neither total irrigation requirements nor the volume applied to crops each irrigation time a more reliable water supply is positively impacting farmers to implement technologies compared to those who perceive a more deficient availability a similar effect but not significant of reliability of water on technology adoption was found by adeoti 2008 in ghana on the other hand manero et al 2019 found a positive impact of water reliability on yields in tanzania conversely full irrigation significantly decreases the rate of it implementation by 50 on average although in terms of irr ww gets a bigger rate change full irrigation yields the most significant effect on the number of technologies according to the average marginal effects examining the marginal effects more closely credits full irrigation and accessibility have the highest impacts for the personal and the contextual and perceptual variables respectively while access to agricultural credits increases the number of technologies by 0 4 full irrigation reduces them by 0 33 accessibility on the other hand increases the number by 0 32 these variables in some way represent the availability or lack of financial and natural resources and the incentives for farmers to adopt it as these variables are binary interactions among these 3 variables are introduced to prm3 yielding relevant results table 5 firstly for the credits full irrigation combination the irr s are below 1 meaning that each combination reduces the rate to implement practices relative to the base category however only the interaction no credit irrigation is significant depicting the largest reduction in proportion 80 and number 0 78 of technologies compared to the base no credit no irrigation suggesting that irrigating the full land perception has a dominant effect which represents the perception of sufficient water to irrigate secondly the interaction full irrigation accessibility unexpectedly produces no significant results since both variables have opposite effects it seems that the variables cancel out each other s individual effects finally in terms of the last interaction between credits and accessibility the figures show that both variables complement each other increasing the irr s with positive marginal effects however only credit accessibility is significant with a factor change of 0 47 more technologies as it was stated before it seems that the statement of full irrigation generates a dominant effect on the adoption of technologies which may be interpreted as a relative abundance of the resource according to the data half of the farmers hold less than 1 3 l s 1 and 75 of them are under the sample mean 1 86 when turned into a water land ratio however only 28 of farmers in the sample have less than 1 l s 1 ha 1 therefore full irrigation could be explained by either capturing larger water applications respecting the water shares they own given the poor infrastructure and lack of control of water withdrawals or due to possible internal arrangements within each canal this positive perception in terms of irrigation is strengthened by the head reservoir which allows for stabilization and better resource distribution and reducing farmers exposure to water shortages discouraging farmers adoption of it this decreasing need for adopting risk reducing measures due to improvements in water supply by dams coincides with those described by biswo et al 2018 3 3 latent class analysis results complementing the econometric analysis an lca was performed to identify the underlying diversity of it in the study area despite the figures showing a low rate of adoption table 2 depicts that the most utilized technology is eis 18 followed by wells 15 conversely humidity sensors and solar panels are the least used practices to classify farmers 4 lca models were run increasing the number of lc from 1 to 4 selecting the model that best disaggregates the data in homogenous classes while minimizing the aic and bic criteria the results show that the model with 2 classes gets the best fit 8 8 see table 9 in annex 3 for the goodness of fit of each latent class model in this lca membership classes make up 88 c1 and 12 c2 c1 is the non technological and c2 the technological class table 6 depicts the average probability distribution of belonging to each class for each technology the non technological class comprises the vast majority of farmers n 295 the main feature of this group of farmers is that they have no technologies this implies that the bulk of the farmers are technologically precarious if they apply 59 it is only 1 technology either eis or wells but with a low probability around 9 in figures for this group 28 irrigators use eis 26 utilize wells and only 3 hold a reservoir though not jointly as a result there is a clear preference for infrastructure technologies among farmers in this group these 59 farmers overlap with the technological irrigators class n 40 containing farmers with the highest item responses for the set of technologies and practices fig 3 c2 is distinct because farmers have installed eis 32 and wells 23 but in addition to these technologies c2 contains the totality of irrigators making use of irrigation programming tools c1 entails 80 236 of farmers with no technologies implying water applications by surface irrigation methods such as flood and furrow by contrast c2 comprises irrigators applying at least one technology ranging from 1 to 5 with 2 67 5 and 3 17 5 the most applied for those farmers using 2 technologies n 27 the most common packages are eis and a well n 11 or an eis plus a programming tool n 4 differences in characteristics conforming the two groups were tested through statistical analysis table 10 in supplementary data class 1 is less educated and has more farming experience while group2 receives more technical support and has a higher percentage of farmers with access to agricultural credits significant at 10 and 1 respectively in terms of natural resources capital group1 holds smaller plots lower water rights dotation and less area using eis all significant at 1 however they have a higher water land ratio 1 90 vs 1 54 for c2 table 7 these figures contribute to explain the low rate of adoption confirming the regression analysis results i e access to credits and larger water land ratios generate disincentives to invest in terms of agricultural production both clusters entail irrigators growing the 4 main crop categories more specifically c2 is dominated by fruit production with 68 growing either raspberries blackberries blueberries and apples and cereals as the second largest type of crop 8 farmers 20 in c1 annual crops and fruit are the dominant crops both comprising 88 of the agricultural land under production for this class 38 3 and 49 each one relevant issue makes up fruit production which consists of 2 sub segments class 1 focuses on small scale production based on berries raspberry and blackberry meanwhile class 2 grows more extensive areas with apple cherry tree or blueberries out of the 431 plots cultivated in class 1 402 93 are watered by flood or furrow for class 2 52 3 of crops are being cultivated using eis out of which 63 makes up fruit and 44 horticulture both significant at 1 pastures and forage are irrigated by surface irrigation in both classes regarding contextual and infrastructural characteristics c1 contains 40 of irrigators who have access to water by turns whereas 22 in c2 do out of 126 irrigators declaring being on a turn regime 93 are in the non technological class likewise in c1 a higher proportion of irrigators is located at a secondary canal level 46 and pay fewer annual fees with 85 of farmers payments below average both significant at 1 finally in terms of perception the only distinctive difference is related to the perceived water availability at 1 with class1 giving a lower valuation 0 54 vs 0 8 for class2 despite the difference in grouping farmers the classes detected for the lca the non technological and technological types present some similarities with other clustering studies for instance takeshima 2016 found out that in nigeria for the less technological cluster a minority 33 of farmers use irrigation to some extent robert et al 2017 working in india grouped farms into 3 groups defining one group as the technological and more diversified lastly maton et al 2005 in france found 2 types of irrigation strategies according to irrigation practices intensive and extensive irrigators the results of the econometric and latent class analysis jointly allow for a better understanding of the low rate of adoption of it leading to a series of considerations for further developments regarding technology adoption and on farm irrigation water management not only in this study area but for the wider agricultural irrigation in chile as well as in similar environments for farmers adopting it there is a clear preference and tendency for the adoption of infrastructural technologies to the detriment of improved it such as scheduling or programming tools despite the well known benefits of these techniques the precise timing and amount of water applied bjornlund et al 2009 montoro et al 2011 and reducing the overall application and potential gains in efficiency and yields gleick 2003 the results show a minimal usage of scheduling being only applied in fruit production which is the most profitable crop in the study area however these results in terms of extent and type of adoption of it are somehow expectable since they match with technologies subsidized by public programs mostly through the act ley 18 450 de fomento a la inversion privada en obras de riego y drenaje which aims to foster the implementation of on farm and off farm irrigation infrastructure such as efficient irrigation systems and reservoirs excluded in this law are management techniques such as scheduling engler et al 2016 the promotion of these type of technologies has been common in other countries such as the us spain garc√≠a moll√° et al 2019 india bahinipati and viswanathan 2019 malik et al 2018 australia grafton and wheeler 2018 and china zhang et al 2019 where programs have a water conservation focus and some of them also incentivize the adoption and implementation of scheduling sears et al 2018 the chilean program differs in explicitly orienting towards an expansion of the irrigated land engler et al 2016 and improving the transparency and legal security of the water rights clarvis and allan 2014 however recent research has shown that the implementation of eis drip irrigation increases the adoption of scheduling claiming for the inclusion of management tools to the current set of subsidized technologies engler et al 2016 it may be argued that the adoption of it depends on means and incentives levidow et al 2014 according to the results of our case study credits and full irrigation are the main drivers influencing the adoption of it where the former may represent the availability lack of financial resources or means demonstrated to influence the adoption of it alcon et al 2011 and full irrigation the availability of water giving incentives disincentives to adopt it out of these incentives disincentives water availability scarcity has been shown to be a driver of the adoption of technologies olen et al 2015 taylor and zilberman 2017 conversely the relative abundance of surface water disincentives farmers to invest and adopt it and reduce water usage mendelsohn and dinar 2003 nevertheless in addition to these factors it is possible to introduce a set of elements hindering the adoption of it some institutional and policy factors have demonstrated to trigger the adoption of irrigation technologies in this setting policy instruments like water pricing have shown to boost the adoption of it alcon et al 2011 berbel and g√≥mez lim√≥n 2000 zilberman et al 2011 in this regard the relative water abundance in the study area next to some distinctive features of the allocation process and the characteristics of irrigation water rights no cost for initial allocation the full and permanent ownership on a certain amount of resources l s 1 poor conveyance and control infrastructure at canal level the current focus of the irrigation programs and the presence of a head reservoir shape an unsuitable scenario to apply policies to increase willingness to adopt such as pricing and as a result do not generate enough incentives to adopt it however for a better understanding of it adoption and irrigation management in the study area deeper comprehension of this stated relative abundance water is needed especially given the divergence between this relative abundance and the manifest water shortage scenario of central chile in the last decade garreaud et al 2019 4 conclusions and policy implications this article examines the adoption of irrigation technologies and the underlying diversity in terms of intensity of adoption in 2 irrigated valleys of the maule region in central chile where a mixture of farming coexists the results show a low level and range of technology adoption with only 30 of farmers adopting technologies and efficient irrigation systems and wells as more widespread practices this conforms to the subsidies provided by the chilean government over the past 4 decades this low level of adoption was disaggregated in 2 groups by a latent class analysis a small group was comprised of moderate to intensive users of technologies while the second group gathered the majority of non adopters most of them restricted in terms of natural capital and financial barriers econometric analyses showed that the adoption of technologies depends on a series of factors particularly education diversification and the dominance of fruit or horticultural production positively impact the number of technologies conversely higher water land rates community reservoirs and unlined canals reduce adoption the relative abundance of water and accessing financial capital are the main factors influencing the adoption of technologies although the results are case study specific to these two irrigated valleys they allow addressing some policy implications to both the public sector and private agents to date the irrigation policy in chile focuses on improvements in efficiency and on and off farm infrastructure aiming at increments of agricultural productivity and favoring projects with the largest increases in irrigated land this policy does not incorporate technical support and it is restricted to a limited type of technologies therefore if the goal is to increase the rate of adoption widening and facilitating access to public subsidies and relaxing entry barriers for those with limited resources creating irrigation extension programs to support and spread the range of subsidized irrigation technologies including management techniques is required given the low rate of adoption programs incentivizing the implementation of irrigation technologies are still needed nevertheless it is also crucial to consider a few other elements the results show that contextual characteristics are hindering adoption rates challenging the correct design of policy and programs moreover efficiency oriented policies can raise the pressure over water resources leading to incremental water consumption and irrigated areas instead of water savings if control on water resources is absent perry et al 2017 sears et al 2018 switching from less to more efficient irrigation causes changes in the demand of water and such improvements may also be a source of adverse spillover effects for those placed downstream grafton et al 2018 vicuna et al 2014 moreover those improvements do not uniquely depend on individual efforts but demand collective decisions in many situations requiring financial and technical capacity as well as a suitable environment and governance at both canal and basin level finally irrigation technologies are considered essential in dealing with water shortages as well as in developing long term adaptation strategies in light of climate change reductions in water availability are expected for central chile challenging public and private organizations to design suitable policies and programs increasing reliability generating

10618,tieguanyin tea plant is the most important tea cultivar in fujian province china it has suffered great economic losses due to high temperature and dry weather in recently years this study proposed a prediction model for daily reference evapotranspiration et0 of tieguanyin based on the combination of mathematical morphology clustering mmc and generalized regression neural networks grnn average air temperature sunshine hours and relative humidity were chosen as the input factors of grnn after a correlation analysis of the microclimate factors of the tea garden the mmc was adopted to cluster the historical meteorological data to find the similar class as the training dataset of grnn the fruit fly optimization algorithm foa was used to optimize the smoothing factor of grnn the meteorological data from jan 2018 to oct 2019 measured in dabaofeng tea garden anxi county fujian province china were used to train and test the proposed model and the performances was assessed with rmse mae and model validity coefficient the prediction results of different seasons show that the proposed model is efficient with high accuracy and has good adaptability under complex meteorological conditions keywords tieguanyin tea plant daily reference evapotranspiration generalized regression neural network mathematical morphology clustering prediction 1 introduction water saving irrigation is a general term of various measures taken to effectively utilize precipitation and irrigation water and obtain the best economic social and ecological benefits of agriculture according to the law of crop water demand and local water supply conditions at present the strategic choice of developing water saving agriculture to alleviate the water resources crisis has become the consensus of all countries in the world bouman and tuong 2001 deng et al 2006 china is one of the countries with a great shortage of water resources the crisis of water resources has become a bottleneck restricting the sustainable development of economy and society ding et al 2017 li et al 2012 therefore it is of great significance to study scientific water saving strategies minhas et al 2020 tieguanyin tea plant is the most important tea cultivar in quanzhou china and it is a perennial evergreen shrub the most suitable temperature for the tea plant growth is generally 20 30 c 0 the annual water demand is more than 1000 mm and the precipitation is required to adapt to the water demand of tea plants chen et al 2010 quanzhou area of fujian province china is a subtropical climate with rich heat resources the annual precipitation is about 1442 mm which basically meets the requirements of tea plant growth however the monthly distribution of rainfall is uneven drought occurs frequently in summer and autumn the temperature is high in the dry season and the evaporation is large which always leads a continuous high temperature and dry bad climate and it not only affects the autumn tea production but also causes the tea plant to prematurely aged crop water demand is the basis of determining irrigation water quota and its key parameter is reference evapotranspiration et0 the main method of calculating et0 is penman monteith equation recommended by food and agriculture organizations of united nations fao allen et al 1998 the formula can accurately estimate the et0 with detailed meteorological data in recent years the increasing number of micro meteorological stations opens up new opportunities for the application of weather forecast in agriculture and water resource management pelosi et al 2016 however the meteorological data collected by micro meteorological stations are often limited therefore it is necessary to study the accurate prediction method of crop evapotranspiration under the condition of limited meteorological data the simulation process of et0 can be regarded as a complex nonlinear regression process among meteorological parameters in recent years due to the excellent performance of machine learning model in dealing with the nonlinear relationship between model input and output it has been widely used to reveal complex hydrological phenomena yaseen et al 2018 hadi et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 including crop evapotranspiration prediction tao et al 2018 many machine learning methods such as evolutionary algorithm jovic et al 2018 jing et al 2019 support vector machines svm kisi 2013 shiri et al 2014 yao et al 2017 extreme learning machine wu et al 2019 ozgur and meysam 2018 deep learning mandeep and sushma 2019 artificial neural networks ann el shafie et al 2014 jazuli et al 2017 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 were adopted to et0 modeling process among which artificial neural network ann has strong non linear mapping ability and self adaptive characteristics it can simulate the non linear relationship between climate factors and crop evapotranspiration and then realize the prediction of et0 kumar et al 2008 however the complexity of neural network structure and the characteristics of needing large samples limit the prediction precision of ann the generalized regression neural network grnn has the advantages of strong nonlinear mapping ability single parameter setting high fault tolerance and robustness high prediction accuracy and stability superior to rbf neural network in learning efficiency and function approximation and has been applied to et0 prediction by some scholars and achieved good prediction results feng et al 2017 grnn has the advantages of strong nonlinear mapping ability single parameter setting high fault tolerance and robustness high prediction accuracy and stability and superior to rbf neural network in learning efficiency and function approximation it has been applied to the prediction of crop evapotranspiration and achieved good prediction results feng et al 2017 in the modeling process based on grnn the selection of training samples and the optimization of smoothing factors are very important the number of neurons in the pattern layer of grnn is proportional to the number of training samples with the increase of training samples the network structure will be too large and redundant which will reduce the efficiency the evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant is mainly affected by the meteorological factors in the located tea garden the alternation of day and night caused by the rotation of the earth makes the meteorological conditions of some days similar to each other so the trend of evapotranspiration has some common characteristics in similar days researchers have found that the weather type has an important influence on the prediction results of the short term prediction of crop reference evapotranspiration yang et al 2016 therefore after clustering the historical meteorological data of the located tea garden extracting the historical samples with high similarity to the predicted day as the training input of the prediction model can improve the prediction accuracy of evapotranspiration and greatly reduce the computation of modeling and simulation clustering refers to the process of classifying data sets into several classes according to the similarity and distance between data without any prior knowledge the commonly used clustering algorithms are mainly divided into k means clustering hartigan and wong 2013 hierarchical clustering onaiza and haroon 2007 density based clustering algorithm huang et al 2016 model based clustering etc mcnicholas 2016 however these algorithms need to specify the value of classes in advance so it is a difficult problem to determine the number of clusters moreover the traditional clustering method is not effective in the recognition of arbitrarily shaped classes the meteorological factors that influence et0 of tieguanyin tea plant vary widely which may lead to the decrease of prediction accuracy under complex meteorological conditions the mathematical morphology clustering mmc algorithm is a new clustering algorithm which can identify clusters of any shape automatically determine the number of clusters and classify them without manual participation thus avoiding the error brought by human subjectivity bloch et al 2007 manuel et al 2017 the smoothing factor of kernel function in the implicit regression unit of grnn has great influence on network output but it is difficult to determine due to this there are various optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing optimization algorithm meng et al 2020 genetic algorithm kim et al 2010 colony algorithm chia feng and yen ting 2018 and particle swarm algorithm harisankar et al 2017 have been applied to optimize the smooth factor of grnn thus improving the prediction accuracy but these algorithms cannot always converge to the global optimum and have many iterations and slow convergence speed fruit fly optimization foa algorithm is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm simulating biological population model since fruit fly itself is superior to other species in sensory perception it has a stronger ability to use its foraging behavior to push performance to seek global optimization pan 2012 li used it to the smoothing factor optimization of grnn li et al 2013 the results show that compared with particle swarm optimization and other algorithms foa needs less parameters to be adjusted which is simpler and easier to be realized experiments show that it has stronger ability to converge to the global optimization the traditional prediction algorithm cannot satisfy the requirements of prediction under complex meteorological conditions it is necessary to fully integrate intelligent algorithm with data mining method to achieve accurate prediction of et0 therefore this study proposed a method of combining mathematical morphology clustering with the algorithm of fruit fly optimized generalized regression neural network to predict the daily et0 of tieguanyin tea plant firstly the historical data closest to the predicted daily information is extracted by the mathematical morphology clustering method as the training sample of the grnn and then the smoothing factor of grnn is optimized by foa to get the best prediction model the performance of the proposed model in different seasons and different weather conditions is verified by using the historical observation data of dabaofeng tea garden anxi county fujian province china collected from jan 2018 to oct 2019 and satisfactory results are obtained 2 materials and methods 2 1 penman monteith equation in 1998 fao recommended p m equation as the preferred method to calculate et0 allen et al 1998 based on the principle of energy balance and aerodynamics this method takes a lot of meteorological factors into account and the calculation results are more accurate it is often taken as standard value the equation is 1 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where e t 0 reference evapotranspiration mm d Œ¥ the slope of the temperature vs saturated vapor pressure curve at t kpa c 0 t daily average temperature at 2 m above the ground c 0 r n net radiation on crop surface mj m 2 c 0 g soil heat flux mj m 2 c 0 Œ≥ hygrometer constant kpa c 0 e s saturated vapor pressure kpa e a actual vapor pressure kpa u 2 average wind speed at 2 m above the ground m s these parameters cannot directly obtained but are calculated by the original eight meteorological data including daily minimum temperature daily maximum temperature geographic latitude radian altitude daily average temperature average relative humidity actual sunshine duration and wind speed some parameters are difficult to measure and if there is missing data crop water demand cannot be calculated therefore using limited meteorological factors and agricultural information as model inputs to predict the value of et0 has practical irrigation guidance significance 2 2 correlation analysis method of microclimate impact factors correlation analysis is the analysis of two or more variables with correlation to measure the degree of correlation between the two variables it can delete redundant information and select the best suitable input index by using correlation analysis method to screen the microclimate factors of the located tea garden that affecting et0 pearson correlation coefficient can well represent the correlation of variables it is calculated as 2 sim x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where sim x y correlation between x y i the i th sample of an indicator n otal sample size x average of indicator x y average of indicator y when sim x y 0 it represents positive correlation between two variables when sim x y 0 it represents negative correlation between two variables when sim x y 0 8 it means that the two variables are high correlation when 0 5 sim x y 0 8 it means that the two variables are medium correlation when sim x y 0 5 it means that the two variables are low correlation in this paper the correlation analysis method is used to analyze the correlation between the microclimate meteorological factors and the daily evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant according to the specific correlation size and the actual situation the variables with high correlation and medium correlation are selected as the inputs of the prediction algorithm 2 3 mathematical morphology clustering mmc algorithm the basis of mathematical morphology is binary morphology and its operation object is set let a as image set and b as structure element the operation of mathematical morphology operation is to operate a with b the basic morphological operations are expansion and corrosion the function of expansion is to expand the target figure while the function of corrosion is to shrink the target figure so expansion and corrosion are two mutually dual operations this paper presents a clustering method based on mathematical morphology to classify the meteorological historical data of the located tea garden when applying mathematical morphology to clustering research binary image processing is needed for the original data first the data is processed to a binary matrix and then the new binary matrix is obtained by expanding and corroding the initial binary matrix the data points with the connected value of 1 in the new binary matrix are extracted as one class and the number of classes with relatively large amount of data is the number of clusters the average value of each kind of data is used as the clustering center according to the distance between each group of data and the clustering center the original data can be classified taking the clustering of two dimensional data sets as an example the specific algorithm to determine the number of clusters based on mathematical morphology is as follows 1 assuring the dataset x i y i i 1 2 n normalize the dataset x i y i i 1 2 n according to formula 3 to generate new data points 3 x ÀÜ i x i x min x m a x x min y ÀÜ i y i y min y m a x y min where x m a x x min the maximum and minimum of the observations of variable x y m a x y min the maximum and minimum of the observations of variable y 2 process the above data according to formula 4 firstly expand x ÀÜ i and y ÀÜ i by q j j 1 2 where q j is a positive integer then round the results and plus 1 so that all the data can be converted into a positive integer from 1 to q j 1 4 x i fix x ÀÜ i q 1 1 y i fix y ÀÜ i q 2 1 3 let the matrix a q 1 1 q 2 1 be a two dimensional binary matrix and a x i y i 1 i 1 2 n 4 select a circular structure element b with radius r b is much smaller than a use b to expand a to get a new binary matrix a 1 so that the points with value of 1 and with close distance in a can be connected into a region 5 increase the radius of b by 1 to form a new structural element c and then the binary matrix a 2 is obtained by using c to corrode a 1 in this way the small areas can be removed and the small connecting areas can be separated 6 display the matrix a 2 as a binary graph the number of large connecting regions in the graph is equal to the number of clusters 7 classifying the points with value 1 and connection in a 2 into one class if the number of data contained in a class is very small it is regarded as an abnormal situation and is directly discarded 8 take the average value of all points of each type as its clustering center and determine the category of each group of data according to the euclidean distance from each clustering center for three dimensional dataset a three dimensional spherical structure element can be used and for m dimensional dataset an m dimensional structure element can be used the clustering process is similar to the above mentioned two dimensional data set 2 4 improved generalized regression neural network 2 4 1 general regression neural networks grnn is a radial neural network based on nonparametric kernel regression different from the traditional neural networks grnn does not need to define the structure model of neural network but only needs to set the parameters of smoothing factor the theoretical basis of grnn is nonlinear kernel regression analysis that is the regression relationship between dependent variable y and independent variable x is not expressed by fitting formula but by analyzing the probability density function between x and y to calculate the maximum probability density of given x define the joint probability density function of variables x and y as f x y and calculate the probability density function of dependent variable y under the condition of given independent variable x that is the conditional mean value y ÀÜ of the probability density function 5 y ÀÜ e y x y f x y d y f x y d y the probability density function can be obtained by nonparametric estimation of training samples 6 f ÀÜ x y 1 2 œÄ p 1 n 2 Œ¥ p 1 i 1 n exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 exp y y i 2 Œ¥ 2 where n sample size p dimension of independent variable x i y i observations of random variables x y respectively Œ¥ smoothing factor substituting f ÀÜ x y for f x y b into the formula 5 the output value of grnn is obtained by simplifying integral operation 7 y ÀÜ x i 1 n y i exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 i 1 n exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 grnn consists of four layers as shown in fig 1 the input layer is the independent variable set for the modeling problem the pattern layer is the implicit regression layer for training samples obtained data from the input layer transferred by the gaussian transfer function 8 f i exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 i 1 2 n where x input variables of neural network x i the learning sample of the i th input neuron the number of neurons in the pattern layer is equal to the number of neurons in the input layer summation layer uses two different types of neurons to weighted sum the output data of pattern layer one is direct summation 9 s d i 1 n f i i 1 n exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 where s d output value of direct summation the other is weighted summation 10 s n i 1 n y i f i i 1 n y i exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 where s n output value of direct summation output layer divides the result of summation layer to get the final estimated result 11 y ÀÜ s n s d it can be seen from formula 10 that Œ¥ affects the result when Œ¥ is close to 0 the estimated value is almost the same as the training sample when Œ¥ is large the estimated value is approximately equal to the average of all the dependent variables of the samples therefore when Œ¥ is too large the fitting effect is not good and when Œ¥ is too small only the data contained in the sample can be predicted and over fitting phenomenon occurs therefore it can guarantee the prediction effect only with the appropriate Œ¥ 2 4 2 improved fruit fly algorithm to optimize smoothing factor in order to get the optimal grnn model it is necessary to determine the most appropriate smoothing factor therefore an foa based optimization of smoothing factor in grnn is proposed and its flowchart is shown as fig 2 since the classical foa uses a fixed step value which affects the local search ability in the later stage of the algorithm resulting in the algorithm fallen into the local optimum in this paper the strategy of changing the fixed step to the dynamic decreasing step is introduced and the random mechanism is introduced to avoid the algorithm falling into the local optimum 12 x i 1 x i l rand r y i 1 y i l rand r where x i y i i 1 n the position of fruit fly at the i th iteration n population size rand r a random number l dynamical step size which is calculated by 13 l l 0 p c œâ where l 0 the initial step size p index factor p 0 8 in this paper œâ weight factor œâ 1 e 0 5 x c transition parameter which is calculated by 14 c m m cos m m 1 where m current iterations m the maximum number of iterations it can be drawn from formula 14 that the variation of l obeys the exponential distribution so that the foa algorithm can jump out of the local optimum with a greater probability what s more as illustrated in formula 14 the step size will gradually decrease with the increase of the number of iterations which enhances the local search ability of the algorithm in the later stage 2 5 prediction model of et0 for tieguanyin tea plant and it verification method the flowchart of the modeling process of the prediction model of et0 for tieguanyin tea plant is as shown in fig 3 once the grnn prediction models corresponding to each class are successfully trained for the data to be predicted the distance between the data and the known classes is calculated firstly to determine its belonging class and then the corresponding class s grnn model is used to achieve the prediction root mean square error r m s e maximum absolute error m a e and model validity coefficient m v c were used to evaluate the error and consistency between the predciton results and the standard value the smaller the rmse is the smaller the model deviation is the closer the m v c is to 1 the more efficient the model has the calculation formulas are as follows 15 r m s e 1 m i 1 m y i x i 2 16 mvc 1

value of x i m the number of the samples 3 results 3 1 overview of the research tea garden taking the summer of 2018 july to september as an example the historical data of the first 20 days of each month are selected for clustering analysis and the three dimensional meteorological information is classified according to the above clustering method based on mathematical morphology in which the selected parameter q1 q2 q3 27 and the radius of the three dimensional spherical structure element r 5 the clustering results are shown in fig 3 the 60 day meteorological data are automatically divided into three categories including 26d in the first category 19d in the second category and 15d in the third category august 23 is chosen as the forecast day the distance between the weather information and the three cluster centers is 16 6238 6 3529 and 25 07491 respectively it is the closest to the second cluster center therefore it can be concluded that the forecast day belongs to the second category the 19 day historical day data in the second category is used in the model training the experiment was carried out in dabaofeng tea garden anxi county fujian province china the tea garden is located in dabaofeng mountain anxi county china with an altitude of 400 600 m and a slope of 12 37 this is a subtropical marine climate with an annual average temperature of 20 4 an extreme maximum temperature of 38 6 and an extreme minimum temperature of 2 4 a frost free period of about 357 days an annual sunshine duration of 1722 h and an annual rainfall of 1461 mm the soil layer is a loam layer mainly composed of eluvial deluvial soil with a thickness of 0 5 3 0 m a soil bulk density of 1 458 g cm2 and a field water capacity of 18 73 in order to estimate et0 of tieguanyin tea plant several factors should be considered including relative humidity sunshine hours air temperature and wind speed et al in this experiment the daily meteorological data recorded by a tintype meteorological station located in dabaofeng tieguanyin tea garden from jan 2018 to oct 2019 is selected as the original data and et0 calculated by p m equation is selected as the standard value the dataset is divided into three parts training set test set and verification set the data of 20 days per month is chosen as training set for model training the data of other days is chosen as test set for testing model accuracy the data of 2019 is taken as verification set for verifying model error and performance 3 2 results of input factors selection the data included the air temperature wind speed relative humidity net radiation sunshine hours air pressure etc the number of training samples was 365 days from january to december 2018 and the time resolution was 15 min after processing the data five attribute values including average temperature t average relative humidity r h average wind speed w s atmospheric pressure p and sunshine duration hours n were obtained to represent the meteorological information and the corresponding daily et0 was calculated by formula 1 in order to reduce computation the correlation between the five attributes and et0 were calculated according to formula 2 and the results were shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the correlation between each influencing factor and et0 varied greatly the indicators with high correlation and medium correlation were selected therefore four factors i e daily average temperature t sunshine duration hours n wind speed w s and average relative humidity r h were selected as the inputs of the grnn model 3 3 results of clustering analysis based on mathematical morphology cluster analysis was made on the historical data of dabaofeng tea garden in 2018 the four dimensional meteorological data was classified according to the proposed mmc algorithm the parameters were set as q 1 q 2 20 q 3 30 q 4 25 r 4 the clustering results were shown in table 2 3 4 training results of grnn based on foa 3 4 1 the results of smoothing factor for grnn based on foa the grnn was used to build the prediction model with daily average temperature t sunshine duration hours n wind speed w s and average relative humidity r h as inputs and et0 as output according the results of clustering nine grnn prediction models were established each model corresponding to one category and only the historical data contained in the corresponding category was needed when training the prediction model the smoothing factor in grnn was optimized by the foa mentioned in 2 4 2 the number of iterations m is set to 40 the population size is set to 30 the initial position of the fruit fly x y 0 1 and the single flight range r 1 1 take the grnn model corresponding to the first category as an example the iterative fitness curve was shown in fig 4 it converged at the 31 st generation and the corresponding smoothing factor was 0 3689 3 4 2 the prediction results of grnn for comparison the convergence curve of foa algorithm was also given as shown in fig 4 the global search ability of foa algorithm was strong and it reached the optimal value at the 20th generation but remained unchanged after that it can be drawn that the fixed search scale causes the local search ability of large step foa to be weak in the later stage of iteration the improved foa algorithm kept the change of search scale during the search process and balanced the global and local search ability of the algorithm so it can achieve good results for the optimization problem the historical meteorological data of the dabaofeng tea garden from march 1 to march 31 2019 was used for model verification the data set contained 31 days of data in total after calculating the distance between the daily data and the various categories listed in table 2 the grnn model of the corresponding category was used to predict the daily et0 the prediction results of the whole month were shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the predicted value of et0 based on the model proposed in this paper has the same change trend with the calculated value using p m equation the evapotranspiration of the fifth day corresponding to march 5 2019 and the twenty second day corresponding to march 22 2019 decreased largely according to the investigation the tea planation experienced strong wind and a fall in temperature in the two days and march 22 with moderate rain 4 discussions to verify the accuracy of the proposed prediction model the data of 2019 year in the tea garden was used as validation set the et0 calculated by p m equation was taken as the standard value and the et0 predicted by the proposed model was compared with the standard value based on the proposed model the daily reference evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant in march june august and october 2019 were predicted and the predicted results were shown in fig 6 to further verify the superiority of the proposed model the prediction results of the other two algorithms grnn foa grnn were also given as seen in fig 6 the overall trend of the prediction results of the three prediction models were basically the same but there were certain differences in the prediction accuracy the proposed model had the highest prediction accuracy followed by grnn foa method and the worst was the traditional grnn the performance parameters of the above models were shown in table 3 when predicting the daily reference evapotranspiration in different seasons as shown in table 3 some conclusions can be draws 1 the r m s e values of the proposed model mmc grnn foa were 0 271 0 189 0 223 and 0 283 respectively compared with the other two models the r m s e value of the proposed model were the lowest which verified that the proposed model has the highest accuracy 2 the m v c values of the proposed model mmc grnn foa were 0 982 0 976 0 985 and 0 981 respectively compared with the other two models the m v c values of the proposed model were the closest to 1 which verified that the proposed model has the most efficient 3 the m a e values of the proposed model mmc grnn foa were 0 431 0 472 0 345 and 0454 respectively compared with the other two models the m a e values of the proposed model were all minimum which means that the proposed model also has high accuracy and reliability when the meteorological conditions of the ten garden are complex and changeable it is helpful to make irrigation plan of tieguanyin tea plant since the prediction error of the proposed model is small and controllable 4 the prediction performances of the grnn model was the worst and the prediction performances of the grnn foa model was higher than that of the grnn model which meas that the prediction ability of the non optimized grnn model is limited thoug it has strong fitting ability 5 conclusions in this paper a prediction model of daily et0 of tieguanyin tea plant based on mathematical morphology clustering and generalized regression neural network is established the

relationship between meteorological data and evapotranspiration with higher prediction accuracy and better adaptability ability 1 through the correlation analysis of the main meteorological factors affecting the daily evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant the results show that temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity have the greatest impacts on the prediction accuracy of the model while the impacts of air pressure and other factors on the prediction of et0 can be ignored 2 the method of mathematical morphology clustering is used to select the training samples of grnn

can solve the difficult of parameter selection in grnn modeling process which is useful for reducing the interference of human factors on the modeling process and improving the stability of the model 4 the prediction results of different seasons show that the proposed model is efficient with high accuracy moreover the proposed model also has good adaptability under complex meteorological conditions in this paper only 22 months meteorological data of dabaofeng tea garden were selected for model training and testing and the combination of different meteorological conditions were not fully considered at the same time the accuracy on the spatial scale were relatively poor which needs further analysis in the future study in addition in the future study the evapotranspiration

10618,tieguanyin tea plant is the most important tea cultivar in fujian province china it has suffered great economic losses due to high temperature and dry weather in recently years this study proposed a prediction model for daily reference evapotranspiration et0 of tieguanyin based on the combination of mathematical morphology clustering mmc and generalized regression neural networks grnn average air temperature sunshine hours and relative humidity were chosen as the input factors of grnn after a correlation analysis of the microclimate factors of the tea garden the mmc was adopted to cluster the historical meteorological data to find the similar class as the training dataset of grnn the fruit fly optimization algorithm foa was used to optimize the smoothing factor of grnn the meteorological data from jan 2018 to oct 2019 measured in dabaofeng tea garden anxi county fujian province china were used to train and test the proposed model and the performances was assessed with rmse mae and model validity coefficient the prediction results of different seasons show that the proposed model is efficient with high accuracy and has good adaptability under complex meteorological conditions keywords tieguanyin tea plant daily reference evapotranspiration generalized regression neural network mathematical morphology clustering prediction 1 introduction water saving irrigation is a general term of various measures taken to effectively utilize precipitation and irrigation water and obtain the best economic social and ecological benefits of agriculture according to the law of crop water demand and local water supply conditions at present the strategic choice of developing water saving agriculture to alleviate the water resources crisis has become the consensus of all countries in the world bouman and tuong 2001 deng et al 2006 china is one of the countries with a great shortage of water resources the crisis of water resources has become a bottleneck restricting the sustainable development of economy and society ding et al 2017 li et al 2012 therefore it is of great significance to study scientific water saving strategies minhas et al 2020 tieguanyin tea plant is the most important tea cultivar in quanzhou china and it is a perennial evergreen shrub the most suitable temperature for the tea plant growth is generally 20 30 c 0 the annual water demand is more than 1000 mm and the precipitation is required to adapt to the water demand of tea plants chen et al 2010 quanzhou area of fujian province china is a subtropical climate with rich heat resources the annual precipitation is about 1442 mm which basically meets the requirements of tea plant growth however the monthly distribution of rainfall is uneven drought occurs frequently in summer and autumn the temperature is high in the dry season and the evaporation is large which always leads a continuous high temperature and dry bad climate and it not only affects the autumn tea production but also causes the tea plant to prematurely aged crop water demand is the basis of determining irrigation water quota and its key parameter is reference evapotranspiration et0 the main method of calculating et0 is penman monteith equation recommended by food and agriculture organizations of united nations fao allen et al 1998 the formula can accurately estimate the et0 with detailed meteorological data in recent years the increasing number of micro meteorological stations opens up new opportunities for the application of weather forecast in agriculture and water resource management pelosi et al 2016 however the meteorological data collected by micro meteorological stations are often limited therefore it is necessary to study the accurate prediction method of crop evapotranspiration under the condition of limited meteorological data the simulation process of et0 can be regarded as a complex nonlinear regression process among meteorological parameters in recent years due to the excellent performance of machine learning model in dealing with the nonlinear relationship between model input and output it has been widely used to reveal complex hydrological phenomena yaseen et al 2018 hadi et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 including crop evapotranspiration prediction tao et al 2018 many machine learning methods such as evolutionary algorithm jovic et al 2018 jing et al 2019 support vector machines svm kisi 2013 shiri et al 2014 yao et al 2017 extreme learning machine wu et al 2019 ozgur and meysam 2018 deep learning mandeep and sushma 2019 artificial neural networks ann el shafie et al 2014 jazuli et al 2017 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 were adopted to et0 modeling process among which artificial neural network ann has strong non linear mapping ability and self adaptive characteristics it can simulate the non linear relationship between climate factors and crop evapotranspiration and then realize the prediction of et0 kumar et al 2008 however the complexity of neural network structure and the characteristics of needing large samples limit the prediction precision of ann the generalized regression neural network grnn has the advantages of strong nonlinear mapping ability single parameter setting high fault tolerance and robustness high prediction accuracy and stability superior to rbf neural network in learning efficiency and function approximation and has been applied to et0 prediction by some scholars and achieved good prediction results feng et al 2017 grnn has the advantages of strong nonlinear mapping ability single parameter setting high fault tolerance and robustness high prediction accuracy and stability and superior to rbf neural network in learning efficiency and function approximation it has been applied to the prediction of crop evapotranspiration and achieved good prediction results feng et al 2017 in the modeling process based on grnn the selection of training samples and the optimization of smoothing factors are very important the number of neurons in the pattern layer of grnn is proportional to the number of training samples with the increase of training samples the network structure will be too large and redundant which will reduce the efficiency the evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant is mainly affected by the meteorological factors in the located tea garden the alternation of day and night caused by the rotation of the earth makes the meteorological conditions of some days similar to each other so the trend of evapotranspiration has some common characteristics in similar days researchers have found that the weather type has an important influence on the prediction results of the short term prediction of crop reference evapotranspiration yang et al 2016 therefore after clustering the historical meteorological data of the located tea garden extracting the historical samples with high similarity to the predicted day as the training input of the prediction model can improve the prediction accuracy of evapotranspiration and greatly reduce the computation of modeling and simulation clustering refers to the process of classifying data sets into several classes according to the similarity and distance between data without any prior knowledge the commonly used clustering algorithms are mainly divided into k means clustering hartigan and wong 2013 hierarchical clustering onaiza and haroon 2007 density based clustering algorithm huang et al 2016 model based clustering etc mcnicholas 2016 however these algorithms need to specify the value of classes in advance so it is a difficult problem to determine the number of clusters moreover the traditional clustering method is not effective in the recognition of arbitrarily shaped classes the meteorological factors that influence et0 of tieguanyin tea plant vary widely which may lead to the decrease of prediction accuracy under complex meteorological conditions the mathematical morphology clustering mmc algorithm is a new clustering algorithm which can identify clusters of any shape automatically determine the number of clusters and classify them without manual participation thus avoiding the error brought by human subjectivity bloch et al 2007 manuel et al 2017 the smoothing factor of kernel function in the implicit regression unit of grnn has great influence on network output but it is difficult to determine due to this there are various optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing optimization algorithm meng et al 2020 genetic algorithm kim et al 2010 colony algorithm chia feng and yen ting 2018 and particle swarm algorithm harisankar et al 2017 have been applied to optimize the smooth factor of grnn thus improving the prediction accuracy but these algorithms cannot always converge to the global optimum and have many iterations and slow convergence speed fruit fly optimization foa algorithm is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm simulating biological population model since fruit fly itself is superior to other species in sensory perception it has a stronger ability to use its foraging behavior to push performance to seek global optimization pan 2012 li used it to the smoothing factor optimization of grnn li et al 2013 the results show that compared with particle swarm optimization and other algorithms foa needs less parameters to be adjusted which is simpler and easier to be realized experiments show that it has stronger ability to converge to the global optimization the traditional prediction algorithm cannot satisfy the requirements of prediction under complex meteorological conditions it is necessary to fully integrate intelligent algorithm with data mining method to achieve accurate prediction of et0 therefore this study proposed a method of combining mathematical morphology clustering with the algorithm of fruit fly optimized generalized regression neural network to predict the daily et0 of tieguanyin tea plant firstly the historical data closest to the predicted daily information is extracted by the mathematical morphology clustering method as the training sample of the grnn and then the smoothing factor of grnn is optimized by foa to get the best prediction model the performance of the proposed model in different seasons and different weather conditions is verified by using the historical observation data of dabaofeng tea garden anxi county fujian province china collected from jan 2018 to oct 2019 and satisfactory results are obtained 2 materials and methods 2 1 penman monteith equation in 1998 fao recommended p m equation as the preferred method to calculate et0 allen et al 1998 based on the principle of energy balance and aerodynamics this method takes a lot of meteorological factors into account and the calculation results are more accurate it is often taken as standard value the equation is 1 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 where e t 0 reference evapotranspiration mm d Œ¥ the slope of the temperature vs saturated vapor pressure curve at t kpa c 0 t daily average temperature at 2 m above the ground c 0 r n net radiation on crop surface mj m 2 c 0 g soil heat flux mj m 2 c 0 Œ≥ hygrometer constant kpa c 0 e s saturated vapor pressure kpa e a actual vapor pressure kpa u 2 average wind speed at 2 m above the ground m s these parameters cannot directly obtained but are calculated by the original eight meteorological data including daily minimum temperature daily maximum temperature geographic latitude radian altitude daily average temperature average relative humidity actual sunshine duration and wind speed some parameters are difficult to measure and if there is missing data crop water demand cannot be calculated therefore using limited meteorological factors and agricultural information as model inputs to predict the value of et0 has practical irrigation guidance significance 2 2 correlation analysis method of microclimate impact factors correlation analysis is the analysis of two or more variables with correlation to measure the degree of correlation between the two variables it can delete redundant information and select the best suitable input index by using correlation analysis method to screen the microclimate factors of the located tea garden that affecting et0 pearson correlation coefficient can well represent the correlation of variables it is calculated as 2 sim x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where sim x y correlation between x y i the i th sample of an indicator n otal sample size x average of indicator x y average of indicator y when sim x y 0 it represents positive correlation between two variables when sim x y 0 it represents negative correlation between two variables when sim x y 0 8 it means that the two variables are high correlation when 0 5 sim x y 0 8 it means that the two variables are medium correlation when sim x y 0 5 it means that the two variables are low correlation in this paper the correlation analysis method is used to analyze the correlation between the microclimate meteorological factors and the daily evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant according to the specific correlation size and the actual situation the variables with high correlation and medium correlation are selected as the inputs of the prediction algorithm 2 3 mathematical morphology clustering mmc algorithm the basis of mathematical morphology is binary morphology and its operation object is set let a as image set and b as structure element the operation of mathematical morphology operation is to operate a with b the basic morphological operations are expansion and corrosion the function of expansion is to expand the target figure while the function of corrosion is to shrink the target figure so expansion and corrosion are two mutually dual operations this paper presents a clustering method based on mathematical morphology to classify the meteorological historical data of the located tea garden when applying mathematical morphology to clustering research binary image processing is needed for the original data first the data is processed to a binary matrix and then the new binary matrix is obtained by expanding and corroding the initial binary matrix the data points with the connected value of 1 in the new binary matrix are extracted as one class and the number of classes with relatively large amount of data is the number of clusters the average value of each kind of data is used as the clustering center according to the distance between each group of data and the clustering center the original data can be classified taking the clustering of two dimensional data sets as an example the specific algorithm to determine the number of clusters based on mathematical morphology is as follows 1 assuring the dataset x i y i i 1 2 n normalize the dataset x i y i i 1 2 n according to formula 3 to generate new data points 3 x ÀÜ i x i x min x m a x x min y ÀÜ i y i y min y m a x y min where x m a x x min the maximum and minimum of the observations of variable x y m a x y min the maximum and minimum of the observations of variable y 2 process the above data according to formula 4 firstly expand x ÀÜ i and y ÀÜ i by q j j 1 2 where q j is a positive integer then round the results and plus 1 so that all the data can be converted into a positive integer from 1 to q j 1 4 x i fix x ÀÜ i q 1 1 y i fix y ÀÜ i q 2 1 3 let the matrix a q 1 1 q 2 1 be a two dimensional binary matrix and a x i y i 1 i 1 2 n 4 select a circular structure element b with radius r b is much smaller than a use b to expand a to get a new binary matrix a 1 so that the points with value of 1 and with close distance in a can be connected into a region 5 increase the radius of b by 1 to form a new structural element c and then the binary matrix a 2 is obtained by using c to corrode a 1 in this way the small areas can be removed and the small connecting areas can be separated 6 display the matrix a 2 as a binary graph the number of large connecting regions in the graph is equal to the number of clusters 7 classifying the points with value 1 and connection in a 2 into one class if the number of data contained in a class is very small it is regarded as an abnormal situation and is directly discarded 8 take the average value of all points of each type as its clustering center and determine the category of each group of data according to the euclidean distance from each clustering center for three dimensional dataset a three dimensional spherical structure element can be used and for m dimensional dataset an m dimensional structure element can be used the clustering process is similar to the above mentioned two dimensional data set 2 4 improved generalized regression neural network 2 4 1 general regression neural networks grnn is a radial neural network based on nonparametric kernel regression different from the traditional neural networks grnn does not need to define the structure model of neural network but only needs to set the parameters of smoothing factor the theoretical basis of grnn is nonlinear kernel regression analysis that is the regression relationship between dependent variable y and independent variable x is not expressed by fitting formula but by analyzing the probability density function between x and y to calculate the maximum probability density of given x define the joint probability density function of variables x and y as f x y and calculate the probability density function of dependent variable y under the condition of given independent variable x that is the conditional mean value y ÀÜ of the probability density function 5 y ÀÜ e y x y f x y d y f x y d y the probability density function can be obtained by nonparametric estimation of training samples 6 f ÀÜ x y 1 2 œÄ p 1 n 2 Œ¥ p 1 i 1 n exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 exp y y i 2 Œ¥ 2 where n sample size p dimension of independent variable x i y i observations of random variables x y respectively Œ¥ smoothing factor substituting f ÀÜ x y for f x y b into the formula 5 the output value of grnn is obtained by simplifying integral operation 7 y ÀÜ x i 1 n y i exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 i 1 n exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 grnn consists of four layers as shown in fig 1 the input layer is the independent variable set for the modeling problem the pattern layer is the implicit regression layer for training samples obtained data from the input layer transferred by the gaussian transfer function 8 f i exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 i 1 2 n where x input variables of neural network x i the learning sample of the i th input neuron the number of neurons in the pattern layer is equal to the number of neurons in the input layer summation layer uses two different types of neurons to weighted sum the output data of pattern layer one is direct summation 9 s d i 1 n f i i 1 n exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 where s d output value of direct summation the other is weighted summation 10 s n i 1 n y i f i i 1 n y i exp x x i t x x i 2 Œ¥ 2 where s n output value of direct summation output layer divides the result of summation layer to get the final estimated result 11 y ÀÜ s n s d it can be seen from formula 10 that Œ¥ affects the result when Œ¥ is close to 0 the estimated value is almost the same as the training sample when Œ¥ is large the estimated value is approximately equal to the average of all the dependent variables of the samples therefore when Œ¥ is too large the fitting effect is not good and when Œ¥ is too small only the data contained in the sample can be predicted and over fitting phenomenon occurs therefore it can guarantee the prediction effect only with the appropriate Œ¥ 2 4 2 improved fruit fly algorithm to optimize smoothing factor in order to get the optimal grnn model it is necessary to determine the most appropriate smoothing factor therefore an foa based optimization of smoothing factor in grnn is proposed and its flowchart is shown as fig 2 since the classical foa uses a fixed step value which affects the local search ability in the later stage of the algorithm resulting in the algorithm fallen into the local optimum in this paper the strategy of changing the fixed step to the dynamic decreasing step is introduced and the random mechanism is introduced to avoid the algorithm falling into the local optimum 12 x i 1 x i l rand r y i 1 y i l rand r where x i y i i 1 n the position of fruit fly at the i th iteration n population size rand r a random number l dynamical step size which is calculated by 13 l l 0 p c œâ where l 0 the initial step size p index factor p 0 8 in this paper œâ weight factor œâ 1 e 0 5 x c transition parameter which is calculated by 14 c m m cos m m 1 where m current iterations m the maximum number of iterations it can be drawn from formula 14 that the variation of l obeys the exponential distribution so that the foa algorithm can jump out of the local optimum with a greater probability what s more as illustrated in formula 14 the step size will gradually decrease with the increase of the number of iterations which enhances the local search ability of the algorithm in the later stage 2 5 prediction model of et0 for tieguanyin tea plant and it verification method the flowchart of the modeling process of the prediction model of et0 for tieguanyin tea plant is as shown in fig 3 once the grnn prediction models corresponding to each class are successfully trained for the data to be predicted the distance between the data and the known classes is calculated firstly to determine its belonging class and then the corresponding class s grnn model is used to achieve the prediction root mean square error r m s e maximum absolute error m a e and model validity coefficient m v c were used to evaluate the error and consistency between the predciton results and the standard value the smaller the rmse is the smaller the model deviation is the closer the m v c is to 1 the more efficient the model has the calculation formulas are as follows 15 r m s e 1 m i 1 m y i x i 2 16 mvc 1

value of x i m the number of the samples 3 results 3 1 overview of the research tea garden taking the summer of 2018 july to september as an example the historical data of the first 20 days of each month are selected for clustering analysis and the three dimensional meteorological information is classified according to the above clustering method based on mathematical morphology in which the selected parameter q1 q2 q3 27 and the radius of the three dimensional spherical structure element r 5 the clustering results are shown in fig 3 the 60 day meteorological data are automatically divided into three categories including 26d in the first category 19d in the second category and 15d in the third category august 23 is chosen as the forecast day the distance between the weather information and the three cluster centers is 16 6238 6 3529 and 25 07491 respectively it is the closest to the second cluster center therefore it can be concluded that the forecast day belongs to the second category the 19 day historical day data in the second category is used in the model training the experiment was carried out in dabaofeng tea garden anxi county fujian province china the tea garden is located in dabaofeng mountain anxi county china with an altitude of 400 600 m and a slope of 12 37 this is a subtropical marine climate with an annual average temperature of 20 4 an extreme maximum temperature of 38 6 and an extreme minimum temperature of 2 4 a frost free period of about 357 days an annual sunshine duration of 1722 h and an annual rainfall of 1461 mm the soil layer is a loam layer mainly composed of eluvial deluvial soil with a thickness of 0 5 3 0 m a soil bulk density of 1 458 g cm2 and a field water capacity of 18 73 in order to estimate et0 of tieguanyin tea plant several factors should be considered including relative humidity sunshine hours air temperature and wind speed et al in this experiment the daily meteorological data recorded by a tintype meteorological station located in dabaofeng tieguanyin tea garden from jan 2018 to oct 2019 is selected as the original data and et0 calculated by p m equation is selected as the standard value the dataset is divided into three parts training set test set and verification set the data of 20 days per month is chosen as training set for model training the data of other days is chosen as test set for testing model accuracy the data of 2019 is taken as verification set for verifying model error and performance 3 2 results of input factors selection the data included the air temperature wind speed relative humidity net radiation sunshine hours air pressure etc the number of training samples was 365 days from january to december 2018 and the time resolution was 15 min after processing the data five attribute values including average temperature t average relative humidity r h average wind speed w s atmospheric pressure p and sunshine duration hours n were obtained to represent the meteorological information and the corresponding daily et0 was calculated by formula 1 in order to reduce computation the correlation between the five attributes and et0 were calculated according to formula 2 and the results were shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 the correlation between each influencing factor and et0 varied greatly the indicators with high correlation and medium correlation were selected therefore four factors i e daily average temperature t sunshine duration hours n wind speed w s and average relative humidity r h were selected as the inputs of the grnn model 3 3 results of clustering analysis based on mathematical morphology cluster analysis was made on the historical data of dabaofeng tea garden in 2018 the four dimensional meteorological data was classified according to the proposed mmc algorithm the parameters were set as q 1 q 2 20 q 3 30 q 4 25 r 4 the clustering results were shown in table 2 3 4 training results of grnn based on foa 3 4 1 the results of smoothing factor for grnn based on foa the grnn was used to build the prediction model with daily average temperature t sunshine duration hours n wind speed w s and average relative humidity r h as inputs and et0 as output according the results of clustering nine grnn prediction models were established each model corresponding to one category and only the historical data contained in the corresponding category was needed when training the prediction model the smoothing factor in grnn was optimized by the foa mentioned in 2 4 2 the number of iterations m is set to 40 the population size is set to 30 the initial position of the fruit fly x y 0 1 and the single flight range r 1 1 take the grnn model corresponding to the first category as an example the iterative fitness curve was shown in fig 4 it converged at the 31 st generation and the corresponding smoothing factor was 0 3689 3 4 2 the prediction results of grnn for comparison the convergence curve of foa algorithm was also given as shown in fig 4 the global search ability of foa algorithm was strong and it reached the optimal value at the 20th generation but remained unchanged after that it can be drawn that the fixed search scale causes the local search ability of large step foa to be weak in the later stage of iteration the improved foa algorithm kept the change of search scale during the search process and balanced the global and local search ability of the algorithm so it can achieve good results for the optimization problem the historical meteorological data of the dabaofeng tea garden from march 1 to march 31 2019 was used for model verification the data set contained 31 days of data in total after calculating the distance between the daily data and the various categories listed in table 2 the grnn model of the corresponding category was used to predict the daily et0 the prediction results of the whole month were shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the predicted value of et0 based on the model proposed in this paper has the same change trend with the calculated value using p m equation the evapotranspiration of the fifth day corresponding to march 5 2019 and the twenty second day corresponding to march 22 2019 decreased largely according to the investigation the tea planation experienced strong wind and a fall in temperature in the two days and march 22 with moderate rain 4 discussions to verify the accuracy of the proposed prediction model the data of 2019 year in the tea garden was used as validation set the et0 calculated by p m equation was taken as the standard value and the et0 predicted by the proposed model was compared with the standard value based on the proposed model the daily reference evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant in march june august and october 2019 were predicted and the predicted results were shown in fig 6 to further verify the superiority of the proposed model the prediction results of the other two algorithms grnn foa grnn were also given as seen in fig 6 the overall trend of the prediction results of the three prediction models were basically the same but there were certain differences in the prediction accuracy the proposed model had the highest prediction accuracy followed by grnn foa method and the worst was the traditional grnn the performance parameters of the above models were shown in table 3 when predicting the daily reference evapotranspiration in different seasons as shown in table 3 some conclusions can be draws 1 the r m s e values of the proposed model mmc grnn foa were 0 271 0 189 0 223 and 0 283 respectively compared with the other two models the r m s e value of the proposed model were the lowest which verified that the proposed model has the highest accuracy 2 the m v c values of the proposed model mmc grnn foa were 0 982 0 976 0 985 and 0 981 respectively compared with the other two models the m v c values of the proposed model were the closest to 1 which verified that the proposed model has the most efficient 3 the m a e values of the proposed model mmc grnn foa were 0 431 0 472 0 345 and 0454 respectively compared with the other two models the m a e values of the proposed model were all minimum which means that the proposed model also has high accuracy and reliability when the meteorological conditions of the ten garden are complex and changeable it is helpful to make irrigation plan of tieguanyin tea plant since the prediction error of the proposed model is small and controllable 4 the prediction performances of the grnn model was the worst and the prediction performances of the grnn foa model was higher than that of the grnn model which meas that the prediction ability of the non optimized grnn model is limited thoug it has strong fitting ability 5 conclusions in this paper a prediction model of daily et0 of tieguanyin tea plant based on mathematical morphology clustering and generalized regression neural network is established the model is trained and verified by using the meteorological data of dabaofeng tea garden anxi county china the experimental results show that the proposed model can better reflect the nonlinear mapping relationship between meteorological data and evapotranspiration with higher prediction accuracy and better adaptability ability 1 through the correlation analysis of the main meteorological factors affecting the daily evapotranspiration of tieguanyin tea plant the results show that temperature sunshine hours wind speed and relative humidity have the greatest impacts on the prediction accuracy of the model while the impacts of air pressure and other factors on the prediction of et0 can be ignored 2 the method of mathematical morphology clustering is used to select the training samples of grnn which can not only reduce the number of neurons in the pattern layer of grnn compress the network scale improve the training efficiency but also improve the adaptability of the model to different environments 3 the et0 prediction model based on the generalized regression neural network is established and the improved fruit fly optimization algorithm is used to optimize the smoothing factors it can solve the difficult of parameter selection in grnn modeling process which is useful for reducing the interference of human factors on the modeling process and improving the stability of the model 4 the prediction results of different seasons show that the proposed model is efficient with high accuracy moreover the proposed model also has good adaptability under complex meteorological conditions in this paper only 22 months meteorological data of dabaofeng tea garden were selected for model training and testing and the combination of different meteorological conditions were not fully considered at the same time the accuracy on the spatial scale were relatively poor which needs further analysis in the future study in addition in the future study the evapotranspiration prediction model of tieguanyin tea plant should be established with the measured evapotranspiration value as the prediction target value to provide more accurate scientific basis for water management

for 20 years in addition chemical analysis revealed an important accumulation of heavy metals such as cd cu zn and ni along with the irrigation period especially in 20 years irrigated soils with tww the assessment of the bacterial functional diversity showed an important change in average well color development awcd and in diversity index values besides substrate utilization profile revealed a significant variation along with the irrigation periods in conclusion long term tww irrigation has increased the metabolic activities of the soil s microorganisms meanwhile traces elements

enzymes bacterial functional diversity 1 introduction numerous factors such as the global increase of human development climate change and pollution are rapidly changing our planet defries et al 2004 hagmann et al 2015 consequently the world is facing a serious problem on natural resources availability such as freshwater resources pouyat et al 2007 thus various alternatives were developed in order to decrease pressure on natural resources besides the south mediterranean region which are facing severe water problems were mandatory searching for alternatives to satisfy their demand especially for agricultural sector del mar alguacil et al 2012 treated wastewater tww coming from treatment plants is considered as a sustainable alternative increasingly used for various purpose around the world such as land irrigation decorative fountains landscape impoundments and groundwater recharge pedersen et al 2003 levine et asano 2004 wade miller 2006 xu et al 2010 adrover et al 2012 therefore tww irrigation is now recognized as an important supplement of water which also has both positive and negative consequences it could provide the soil nutrients and organic matter jim√©nez cisneros 1995 horswell et al 2003 rattan et al 2005 also they serve as an environmentally safe disposal method for treated effluents ternes et al 2007 gwenzi and munondo 2008 therefore soil that act as filters of toxic chemicals may adsorb and retain heavy metals xenobiotics pathogens etc which could be present in tww therefore numerous recent studies have shown that long term application of tww could lead to the accumulation of heavy metals pharmaceuticals and organic emergent pollutants in the ecosystems receiving secondary tww klay et al 2010 bedbabis et al 2014 2015 balkhair and ashraf 2016 houda et al 2016 vanryckeghem et al 2018 eckert et al 2018 because of its geographical position tunisia faces two climates the mediterranean in the north and the saharan in the south generating a spatio temporal variability of water resources this situation makes tunisia a country with low renewable resources which is relatively rare and irregular meanwhile agriculture is typically considered as one of the fields that requires huge amount of water to satisfy demands qadir et al 2010 for this purposes in 1975 the tunisian authorities have legalized the reuse of tww for agricultural industrial and other purposes then in cooperation with international organization such as fao who oecd etc the national institute of normalization has required severe criteria and limits for better use of non conventional water resources norm 106 02 and 106 03 1989 therefore there is an increasing interest on the effect of tww on soils which comes through studying changes in physical chemical and biological activities in soils in order to understand and to improve the performance of this alternative on crop production and soil fertility pedrero et al 2010 paudel et al 2018 carlos et al 2018 on the other hand while it s known that tww are a good way to replace freshwater resources in agriculture and as a natural fertilizer few studies have already assessed the impact of these non conventional water on soil s microbial communities and their activities chen et al 2008 hidri et al 2014 ibekwe et al 2018 the soil is a key natural resource interacting with above ground plant and animal communities and contributing to a better functioning kennedy and smith 2016 soil quality consists of the chemical physical and biological components of a soil and their interactions arshad and coen 1992 indeed microbial communities in the soils were known for their significant roles in the nutrients degradation and in the maintaining of soil s structure alexander 1977 paul and clark 1989 in addition soil microbial biomass is a fundamental link in the biogeochemical cycles and for the cycling of organic compounds which ensures eventually soil biofertility interestingly it is well admitted that enzymes in soils coming essentially from bacteria and fungi are involved in the biogeochemical cycles of c n p and s therefore evaluation of their activities could reflect the extent of chemical pollutants and biological reactions in soils dick 1997 killham and staddon 2002 chen et al 2008 in fact soil enzyme activities changes could provide interesting information on the ability of soils to perform biogeochemical reactions and the impact of anthropogenic and agricultural practices on its composition and health in the light of this introduction this study aims to evaluate microbial properties of five soils sampled from ouardanin perimeter in the east central region of tunisia monastir governorate first seven enzyme s activities were assessed second microbial biomass and functional diversity using biolog ecoplate were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling from the east central region of tunisia latitude 35 43 n longitude 10 40 e we have chosen to work on

concentrated hno3 hcl 9 3 ml using a microwave speed wave xpert berghof instruments then soil solutions were filtered and diluted with 5 hno3 finally the obtained solutions were analyzed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp aes spectroblue 2 3 soil microbial biomass in the interest to determine the total microbial biomass the substrate induced respiration technique sir was applied according to anderson 1982 2 g of soil samples were initially doped with glucose 10 mg g 1 into flasks 15 ml which were locked with a butyl ptfe shield caps finally samples were analyzed using a micro gas chromatography micro gc 490 agilent and the hourly produced co2 was measured the microbial biomass was calculated using the following equation according to anderson and domsch 1978 sir biomass c Œºg co2 g 1 of soil sir Œºl co2 g 1 of soil h 1 40 04 0 37 2 4 enzymes assays in this study we assessed the activities of seven enzymes involved in c n p and s cycles arylsulfatase Œ≤ glucosidase acid and alkaline phosphatase were measured based on the amount of p nitrophenol pnp released from p nitrophenyl sulfate p nitrophenyl Œ≤ d glucopyranoside and p nitrophenyl phosphates respectively tabatabai 1994 for that soils were mixed with water 4 c and 100 Œºl of the homogenate was mixed with 10 m of the desired substrate and 50 Œºl of mac ilvain buffered

centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min after that 75 Œºl of supernatant was mixed with 175 Œºl of 0 2 na2co3 in order to stop the reaction color intensity of the solution was immediately determined by colorimetry at 405 nm and the activity was determined referring to a pnp calibration curve second dehydrogenase activity was assessed according to klein et al 1971 method for that 0 5 g of soil samples were brought to 60 of its holding capacity in falcon tubes 15 ml therefore the substrate 2 3 5 tripenyltetrazolium chloride ttc was added to the soil samples and incubated at 28 c during 96 h finally the color intensity was determined at 405 nm using genesys 10 Œºv scanning thermo and the activity was determined referring to a triphenyl formazan tpf calibration curve the activity of urease was assessed in line with the method described by kandeler and gerber 1988 for that 0 5 g of soil samples were mixed with urea as a substrate and borate buffer the homogenates were incubated at 37 c for 4 h the color intensity was read at 660 nm using genesys 10 Œºv scanning thermo and the activity was determined referring to a nh4 calibration curve finally the total enzymatic activity apprehended with fluorescein diacetate fda hydrolysis was measured as described in taylor et al 2002 soil samples were preincubated for 24 h at 25 c and then mixed with mac ilvain buffered solution ph of 7 and 50 Œºl of 2 m fda substrate afterwards the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 c and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min then 100 Œºl of the supernatant was mixed with 100 Œºl of mac ilvain buffered solution ph of 7 in order to stop the reaction and intensity of color was immediately determined at 490 nm and the activity was calculated referring to an fda calibration curve 2 5 soil bacterial functional diversity biolog system microbial functional diversity was assessed with the biolog ecoplate system biolog inc ca usa each 96 well plate consists of three replicates each one comprising 31 sole carbon sources and a water blank as described by harris hellal et al 2009 1 g of soil samples was homogenized with 9 ml of 0 9 nacl mixed for 30 min then centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm tenfold dilutions were performed using the supernatant and aliquots of 100 Œºl they were utilized for biolog ecoplate inoculation which were subsequently incubated at 25 c for 7 days zak et al 1994 color development in each well was recorded as optical density od at 590 nm with a plate reader at regular 24 h intervals microbial activity in each microplate expressed as average well color development awcd was determined as follows a w c d o d i 31 the functional diversity index was calculated for each soil sample in order to assess the relationship between environmental variability and functional traits of benthic macrofauna petchey and gaston 2002 this parameter represents on average the number of positive wells absorbance 0 125 the 168 h optical density value chosen according to exponential phase of growth curves of all plates for each sample in triplicate divided by their awcd to normalize the values were used to calculate the utilization of carbon sources zak et al 1994 2 6 statistical analysis the results for trace elements content microbial biomass enzymatic activity and microbial functional diversity are presented as the mean sd of 3 samples spss software version 20 0 was used for statistical analysis the normality of the distribution was tested using the shapiro wilk test for multiple comparisons a parametric one way analysis of variance anova was performed on data along with tukey s test principal component analysis pca was performed using r software r core team v 6 3 0 and the package ade4tkgui thioulouse and dray 2007 3 results 3 1 heavy metal contents in soils the total concentrations of cd cu zn cr and ni are displayed in table 2 for cd and cr there was no significant difference in the trace elements content of s2 s3 and s4 comparing to reference soil s1 moreover under 20 years of tww irrigation cu zn and ni concentration increased significantly in the case of s4 samples to reach respectively 23 81 2 22 19 32 1 38 and 5 81 0 26 ppm also all heavy metals tested in s5 were significantly different compared to s1 and their concentrations were the highest compared to the other soil sampled 3 2 soil carbon microbial biomass tww irrigation had led to an increase of the soil microbial biomass carbon cmic after long irrigation periods indeed as reported in fig 2 cmic decreased in soils irrigated with tww for 1 and 8 years while it increased significantly in s4 and s5 comparing to reference site and reached respectively 163 06 16 86 and 283 06 57 67 Œºg co2 g 1 of dry soil 3 3 soil enzymatic activities the enzymatic activities related to c s and p cycling in soils were given in fig 3 however Œ≤ glucosidase s fig 3a activity increased significantly in all soil samples irrigated except for cultured soils irrigated with tww for 20 years reaching 18 47 0 31 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 meanwhile a sudden increase was noted in soils receiving tww surplus for 20 years to attempt 165 81 18 24 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 within the studied soils arylsulfatase fig 3b showed an important decrease in s2 s3 and s4 irrigated respectively for 1 8 and 20 years with secondary tww however the highest activity 40 03 5 33 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 was recorded in s5 soil samples receiving the surplus of tww tank for 20 years on one hand alkaline and acid phosphatase fig 3c and d decreased significantly in s2 s3 and s4 soil samples comparing to the reference site s1 while a slight increase of the acid phosphatase was recorded in s4 soils reaching 17 48 1 25 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 also under 20 years of tww discharge s5 acid and alkaline phosphatase s activities were respectively on average 5 and 3 times higher than their controls one the other hand urease activity was significantly affected by tww irrigation fig 4 a under 1 year of tww irrigation the activity decreased to reach 0 13 0 002 Œºg nh4 n g 1 h 1 yet the activity of urease expanded progressively along the irrigation periods to attain a maximum of 1 37 0 12 Œºg nh4 n g 1 h 1 in s5 soil samples the activity of dehydrogenase was given in fig 4b it increased significantly in all the experimented soil samples comparing to the recorded activity in control soils s1 reaching a maximum of 3 21 0 04 Œºg tpf g 1 h 1 in s4 soil samples subject to 20 years of tww irrigation the fda activity in soils differed significantly among the irrigation periods fig 4c it increased progressively to 23 67 2 79 Œºg of fluorescein g 1 h 1 in s5 samples which is on average 10 times higher than the reference s soils s1 activity 2 32 0 44 Œºg of fluorescein g 1 h 1 pca of microbiological activities in the five soils of ouardanin perimeter was represented in fig 5 the correlation circle fig 5a revealed that the first axis 74 35 was mainly defined by cmic arylsulfatase alkaline and acid phosphatases urease and Œ≤ glucosidase while the second axis showing 1876 of variability is composed by the fda and dehydrogenase activities however the projection of soils samples upon the tow axis fig 5b showed that s5 and s4 were highly correlated respectively with axis 1 and axis 2 this separation is due to the high microbiological activities recorded in these sites 3 4 microbial functional diversity the average well color development awcd was used as an indicator of the microbial activity in soil samples garland and mills 1991 tww have significantly affected the awcd as shown in fig 6 a the s2 soil samples presented the highest awcd 1 17 0 04 while the s3 soil samples irrigated for 8 years exhibited the lowest awcd value 0 98 0 04 the shannon diversity index that is commonly used to characterize species diversity in a community calculated from 120 h biolog data was represented in fig 6b our results showed a significant decrease of shannon diversity index in s4 and s5 soil samples reaching respectively 0 6 0 01 and 0 46 0 08 comparing to values recorded in reference site s1 0 74 0 03 more thoroughly the substrate utilization pattern of 31 substrates belonging to six classes was calculated fig 7 globally and comparing to the control soils s1 the substrate utilization pattern was bigger in s2 s4 and s5 soil samples while it was overall lower in s3 samples irrigated with secondary tww for 8 years regarding the most metabolized groups we found microbial communities has a high affinity to carboxylic and amino acids polymers and carbohydrates than the other classes however for carboxylic acids we recorded the maximum of od in s2 and s5 soil samples reaching respectively however amines and miscellaneous degradation fig 7c and f was less important than the other classes moreover carboxylic acids carbohydrates and amino acids fig 7a b and d were the most degradable classes 4 discussion soil biofertility is commonly defined as the ability of soils to ensure better plant growth and good quality of vegetables at harvesting doran and zeiss 2000 blanco and lal 2009 however soil biofertility involves numerous inputs such as microorganisms earthworms and plants ensuring through their activities the good functioning of soils so under environmental and anthropic pressures soils component may be exposed to different kind of pollutants such as heavy metals emergent organic contaminants pathogens etc nowadays agricultural practices such as tww irrigation became an alternative to freshwater use in irrigation it is recognized that secondary wastewater could be a natural fertilizer increasing crops rentability jim√©nez cisneros 1995 kiziloglu et al 2007 2008 on the other hand this strategy became also an attractive field for researchers because of its harmful effects on soils including organisms and crop quality bending et al 2002 klay et al 2010 nair et ngouajio 2012 hidri et al 2014 stenchly et al 2017 mkhinini et al 2019a 2019b in this context the current study aimed to evaluate the impact of long term irrigation by tww on heavy metal accumulation and microbiological activity through the assessment of soil microbial biomass soil enzyme activities in relation with geochemical cycling of h c s p and n and bacterial functional diversity in this present work microbial biomass evaluation in the soils of ouardenin perimeter irrigated with tww from different periods demonstrated a significant decrease in newly irrigated soils while an important increase was recorded in 20 years irrigated soils the presence of heavy metals and pathogens could be considered as a threat for soil ecosystem mechri et al 2007 di serio et al 2008 mechri et al 2008 in fact numerous pollutants can reach soils through tww reuse the most known are trace elements such as cd ni and cu that could lead to the modification of the physicochemical and microbiological properties of soils in contrast tww irrigation could contribute to an increase of microbial biomass as reported by several works filip et al 1999 friedel et al 2000 adrover et al 2012 on this hand the composition of tww could influence microbial properties of soils considering their higher level of organic matter and minerals this could be explained also by the fact that microbial community can acquire and develop a tolerance mechanism to face the several changes in soil composition during many years of tww application burkhardt et al 1993 jedidi et al 2004 hidri et al 2014 on the other hand enzymes activities have shown an important change among soils compared to the reference site s1 which was never irrigated with tww in addition we noticed a crucial increase of the activities in soil samples s5 which received tww surplus for 20 years for the Œ≤ glucosidase its activity increased progressively in the case of s2 s3 and s4 soil samples however it is recognized that glucosidases are involved in the cycling of carbon in soils and they were significantly influenced by the load of organic matter and could decrease the inhibitory effect of heavy metals on biological activities of soils which was in concordance with tejada et al 2008 results regarding arylsulfatase which is involved in sulfur cycling we noticed an important decrease in all soil samples except s5 extracellular enzymes in soils could be easily denatured by exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity or indigenous factors like salinity and heavy metals which may lead to a decrease of the enzyme s activity in soils li and sara 2003 for acid and alkaline phosphatase their activities showed a crucial decrease in soils irrigated for short period and an important increase in soils receiving tww for 20 years our results are consistent with several works which demonstrates the impact of pollutants on soil and agricultural practices on enzyme activities colvan et al 2001 albrecht et al 2010 li et al 2010 leite et al 2004 kamran et al 2018 interestingly the activity of soil s phosphatases is regulated within soils by the amount of organic matter and nutrients microbial biomass and soil ph ferreira et al 2016 in addition the increase of acid and alkaline phosphatases could be attributed to numerous factors such as microorganism proliferation moisture and air transpiration of soils which provides a favorable environment for microorganism action olander and vitousek 2000 deluca et al 2009 jin et al 2016 in the case of urease activity we recorded a progressive increase along the irrigation period it was commonly reported that urease activity was positively correlated with microbial biomass and its activity increased with the increase of biomass qin et al 2010 also urease activity is related to the amount of nitrogen loaded into soils after tww irrigation for years for dehydrogenase which is involved in the energy production into cells its activity was greater in all soils compared to control soil s1 however tww could bring to soils easily decomposable organic matter and nutrients also we must take into consideration cropping systems that leave residues on the soil surface which will enhance enzyme activities friedel et al 2000 chen et al 2008 adrover et al 2012 chen et al 2015 garcia orenes et al 2015 however our results showed that the trace elements accumulation increased significantly compared to reference soils trace elements could influence biological functions of soil s microorganisms and could be involved in the decrease of the organic matter mineralization consequently this could disturb the availability of nutrients for microorganisms dotaniya et al 2017b dotaniya and pipalde 2018 additionally heavy metals may reduce the release of roots exudates which cause the decrease of enzyme synthesis thus leading to the modification of microorganism s activity in soils overall these aspects were developed in numerous works that assessed the effect of heavy metals on microbial properties kuperman and carreiro 1997 hinojosa et al 2004 meng et al 2018 vithanage et al 2018 boughattas et al 2019 besides the effect of pollutant on microorganisms has often been studied under controlled conditions with special attention to the abundance and physiology of some species duxbury 1981 brynhildsen et al 1988 regarding physiological pathways enzyme activities variation could be attributed to the modification of bacterial processes involved in the enzymes production due to their rapid interaction especially with trace elements cambier et al 2009 moreover guin√© et al 2007 have proved that cu and zn absorption by soil bacteria was very fast with stabilization within two hours more thoroughly this phenomenon was related to numerous ways of adaptation and an acquired resistance which is clearly observed in s5 soil samples where the microbial activities reached their maximum the microbial resistance to heavy metals includes many chemical mechanisms such as the precipitation and the conjugation of metals as reported in wyszkowska et al 2006 and dotaniya and pipalde 2018 works on the other hand biolog ecoplate was adopted to improve the effect of tww irrigation on physiological and metabolic activity of soil microorganisms however awcd which represent the catabolic diversity in soils was found to increase especially in soils irrigated for long periods with tww in similar works ibekwe et al 2018 and chen et al 2017 had proved that microbial activity increased significantly in long term irrigated soils in addition functional diversity has shown a significant decrease in short term irrigated soils and a crucial increase in s5 soil samples tww irrigation may incorporate exogenous microorganisms into the soils and this could influence native microbial population santamaria and toranzos 2003 gerba and smith 2005 frenk et al 2014 garcia orenes et al 2015 ibekwe et al 2013 2016 2018 in fact we have recorded an important increase of microbial biomass along with the irrigation period which was positively correlated with the biolog ecoplate results however it is also likely known that tww may provide nutrients and organic loads that can create a favorable environment for the development of specific populations mechri et al 2007 garcia orenes et al 2015 meanwhile an important variation was recorded in substrate utilization pattern among experimented soils which was induced especially in the case of s4 soil samples that is cultured and irrigated for 20 years with tww however soil bacteria trends to the consumption of carbohydrates amines and polymers which were a natural component that may exists in organic matter in soils and this was consistent with kenarova et al 2014 works in addition our results suggest that the major microbial community in soils is widely driven by the quality of the organic substrates loaded in them by the reuse of tww from perspective the high metabolic activity in 20 years irrigated soils may be related to the newest microorganisms coming from tww and this was proved in garcia orenes et al 2015 which proved that microbial community had disappeared after long term application of tww also more findings had proved that there was proliferation of more functional groups of bacteria which were involved in the geochemical cycling of c n and p 5 conclusion in conclusion tww may contain a variety of components that could enhance bacterial processes in soils also long term application of these water could modify the functional diversity of microbial communities on one hand and based on our findings we can conclude that the long term tww reuse in the context of the studied area may represent an interesting alternative to face water shortage in arid regions on the other hand it is suggested that risk assessment should be conducted prior to effluent irrigation to keep the safe application of treated wastewater for landscape and agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

10619,climate change and population growth generates a decrease in water availability around the world which can compromise the maintenance of sustainable agriculture thus treated wastewater tww became an alternative to minimize water shortage however this may indirectly affect the soil s microbial properties in this study different soils irrigated for 0 1 8 and 20 years with tww were sampled and from the east central region of tunisia the objective was to investigate its effect on heavy metal accumulation and enzyme activities of Œ≤ glucosidase arylsulfatase acid phosphatase alkaline phosphatase urease dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate fda moreover carbon microbial biomass cmic using substrate induced respiration sir technique and microbial functional diversity using biolog ecoplate were assessed our results had shown a crucial decrease of the enzymatic activities in soils that were newly irrigated with tww while a crucial increase was recorded in soils exposed to tww

the assessment of the bacterial functional diversity showed an important change in average well color development awcd and in diversity index values besides substrate utilization profile revealed a significant variation along with the irrigation periods in conclusion long term tww irrigation has increased the metabolic activities of the soil s microorganisms meanwhile traces elements

data along with tukey s test principal component analysis pca was performed using r software r core team v 6 3 0 and the package ade4tkgui thioulouse and dray 2007 3 results 3 1 heavy metal contents in soils the total concentrations of cd cu zn cr and ni are displayed in table 2 for cd and cr there was no significant difference in the trace elements content of s2 s3 and s4 comparing to reference soil s1 moreover under 20 years of tww irrigation cu zn and ni concentration increased significantly in the case of s4 samples to reach respectively 23 81 2 22 19 32 1 38 and 5 81 0 26 ppm also all heavy metals tested in s5 were significantly different compared to s1 and their concentrations were the highest compared to the other soil sampled 3 2 soil carbon microbial biomass tww irrigation had led to an increase of the soil microbial biomass carbon cmic after long irrigation periods indeed as reported in fig 2 cmic decreased in soils irrigated with tww for 1 and 8 years while it increased significantly in s4 and s5 comparing to reference site and reached respectively 163 06 16 86 and 283 06 57 67 Œºg co2 g 1 of dry soil 3 3 soil enzymatic activities the enzymatic activities related to c s and p cycling in soils were given in fig 3 however Œ≤ glucosidase s fig 3a activity increased significantly in all soil samples irrigated except for cultured soils irrigated with tww for 20 years reaching 18 47 0 31 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 meanwhile a sudden increase was noted in soils receiving tww surplus for 20 years to attempt 165 81 18 24 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 within the studied soils arylsulfatase fig 3b showed an important decrease in s2 s3 and s4 irrigated respectively for 1 8 and 20 years with secondary tww however the highest activity 40 03 5 33 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 was recorded in s5 soil samples receiving the surplus of tww tank for 20 years on one hand alkaline and acid phosphatase fig 3c and d decreased significantly in s2 s3 and s4 soil samples comparing to the reference site s1 while a slight increase of the acid phosphatase was recorded in s4 soils reaching 17 48 1 25 Œºmol pnp g 1 h 1 also under 20 years of tww discharge s5 acid and alkaline phosphatase s activities were respectively on average 5 and 3 times higher than their controls one the other hand urease activity was significantly affected by tww irrigation fig 4 a under 1 year of tww irrigation the activity decreased to reach 0 13 0 002 Œºg nh4 n g 1 h 1 yet the activity of urease expanded progressively along the irrigation periods to attain a maximum of 1 37 0 12 Œºg nh4 n g 1 h 1 in s5 soil samples the activity of dehydrogenase was given in fig 4b it increased significantly in all the experimented soil samples comparing to the recorded activity in control soils s1 reaching a maximum of 3 21 0 04 Œºg tpf g 1 h 1 in s4 soil samples subject to 20 years of tww irrigation the fda activity in soils differed significantly among the irrigation periods fig 4c it increased progressively to 23 67 2 79 Œºg of fluorescein g 1 h 1 in s5 samples which is on average 10 times higher than the reference s soils s1 activity 2 32 0 44 Œºg of fluorescein g 1 h 1 pca of microbiological activities in the five soils of ouardanin perimeter was represented in fig 5 the correlation circle fig 5a revealed that the first axis 74 35 was mainly defined by cmic arylsulfatase alkaline and acid phosphatases urease and Œ≤ glucosidase while the second axis showing 1876 of variability is composed by the fda and dehydrogenase activities however the projection of soils samples upon the tow axis fig 5b showed that s5 and s4 were highly correlated respectively with axis 1 and axis 2 this separation is due to the high microbiological activities recorded in these sites 3 4 microbial functional diversity the average well color development awcd was used as an indicator of the microbial activity in soil samples garland and mills 1991 tww have significantly affected the awcd as shown in fig 6 a the s2 soil samples presented the highest awcd 1 17 0 04 while the s3 soil samples irrigated for 8 years exhibited the lowest awcd value 0 98 0 04 the shannon diversity index that is commonly used to characterize species diversity in a community calculated from 120 h biolog data was represented in fig 6b our results showed a significant decrease of shannon diversity index in s4 and s5 soil samples reaching respectively 0 6 0 01 and 0 46 0 08 comparing to values recorded in reference site s1 0 74 0 03 more thoroughly the substrate utilization pattern of 31 substrates belonging to six classes was calculated fig 7 globally and comparing to the control soils s1 the substrate utilization pattern was bigger in s2 s4 and s5 soil samples while it was overall lower in s3 samples irrigated with secondary tww for 8 years regarding the most metabolized groups we found microbial communities has a high affinity to carboxylic and amino acids polymers and carbohydrates than the other classes however for carboxylic acids we recorded the maximum of od in s2 and s5 soil samples reaching respectively however amines and miscellaneous degradation fig 7c and f was less important than the other classes moreover carboxylic acids carbohydrates and amino acids fig 7a b and d were the most degradable classes 4 discussion soil biofertility is commonly defined as the ability of soils to ensure better plant growth and good quality of vegetables at harvesting doran and zeiss 2000 blanco and lal 2009 however soil biofertility involves numerous inputs such as microorganisms earthworms and plants ensuring through their activities the good functioning of soils so under environmental and anthropic pressures soils component may be exposed to different kind of pollutants such as heavy metals emergent organic contaminants pathogens etc nowadays agricultural practices such as tww irrigation became an alternative to freshwater use in irrigation it is recognized that secondary wastewater could be a natural fertilizer increasing crops rentability jim√©nez cisneros 1995 kiziloglu et al 2007 2008 on the other hand this strategy became also an attractive field for researchers because of its harmful effects on soils including organisms and crop quality bending et al 2002 klay et al 2010 nair et ngouajio 2012 hidri et al 2014 stenchly et al 2017 mkhinini et al 2019a 2019b in this context the current study aimed to evaluate the impact of long term irrigation by tww on heavy metal accumulation and microbiological activity through the assessment of soil microbial biomass soil enzyme activities in relation with geochemical cycling of h c s p and n and bacterial functional diversity in this present work microbial biomass evaluation in the soils of ouardenin perimeter irrigated with tww from different periods demonstrated a significant decrease in newly irrigated soils while an important increase was recorded in 20 years irrigated soils the presence of heavy metals and pathogens could be considered as a threat for soil ecosystem mechri et al 2007 di serio et al 2008 mechri et al 2008 in fact numerous pollutants can reach soils through tww reuse the most known are trace elements such as cd ni and cu that could lead to the modification of the physicochemical and microbiological properties of soils in contrast tww irrigation could contribute to an increase of microbial biomass as reported by several works filip et al 1999 friedel et al 2000 adrover et al 2012 on this hand the composition of tww could influence microbial properties of soils considering their higher level of organic matter and minerals this could be explained also by the fact that microbial community can acquire and develop a tolerance mechanism to face the several changes in soil composition during many years of tww application burkhardt et al 1993 jedidi et al 2004 hidri et al 2014 on the other hand enzymes activities have shown an important change among soils compared to the reference site s1 which was never irrigated with tww in addition we noticed a crucial increase of the activities in soil samples s5 which received tww surplus for 20 years for the Œ≤ glucosidase its activity increased progressively in the case of s2 s3 and s4 soil samples however it is recognized that glucosidases are involved in the cycling of carbon in soils and they were significantly influenced by the load of organic matter and could decrease the inhibitory effect of heavy metals on biological activities of soils which was in concordance with tejada et al 2008 results regarding arylsulfatase which is involved in sulfur cycling we noticed an important decrease in all soil samples except s5 extracellular enzymes in soils could be easily denatured by exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity or indigenous factors like salinity and heavy metals which may lead to a decrease of the enzyme s activity in soils li and sara 2003 for acid and alkaline phosphatase their activities showed a crucial decrease in soils irrigated for short period and an important increase in soils receiving tww for 20 years our results are consistent with several works which demonstrates the impact of pollutants on soil and agricultural practices on enzyme activities colvan et al 2001 albrecht et al 2010 li et al 2010 leite et al 2004 kamran et al 2018 interestingly the activity of soil s phosphatases is regulated within soils by the amount of organic matter and nutrients microbial biomass and soil ph ferreira et al 2016 in addition the increase of acid and alkaline phosphatases could be attributed to numerous factors such as microorganism proliferation moisture and air transpiration of soils which provides a favorable environment for microorganism action olander and vitousek 2000 deluca et al 2009 jin et al 2016 in the case of urease activity we recorded a progressive increase along the irrigation period it was commonly reported that urease activity was positively correlated with microbial biomass and its activity increased with the increase of biomass qin et al 2010 also urease activity is related to the amount of nitrogen loaded into soils after tww irrigation for years for dehydrogenase which is involved in the energy production into cells its activity was greater in all soils compared to control soil s1 however tww could bring to soils easily decomposable organic matter and nutrients also we must take into consideration cropping systems that leave residues on the soil surface which will enhance enzyme activities friedel et al 2000 chen et al 2008 adrover et al 2012 chen et al 2015 garcia orenes et al 2015 however our results showed that the trace elements accumulation increased significantly compared to reference soils trace elements could influence biological functions of soil s microorganisms and could be involved in the decrease of the organic matter mineralization consequently this could disturb the availability of nutrients for microorganisms dotaniya et al 2017b dotaniya and pipalde 2018 additionally heavy metals may reduce the release of roots exudates which cause the decrease of enzyme synthesis thus leading to the modification of microorganism s activity in soils overall these aspects were developed in numerous works that assessed the effect of heavy metals on microbial properties kuperman and carreiro 1997 hinojosa et al 2004 meng et al 2018 vithanage et al 2018 boughattas et al 2019 besides the effect of pollutant on microorganisms has often been studied under controlled conditions with special attention to the abundance and physiology of some species duxbury 1981 brynhildsen et al 1988 regarding physiological pathways enzyme activities variation could be attributed to the modification of bacterial processes involved in the enzymes production due to their rapid interaction especially with trace elements cambier et al 2009 moreover guin√© et al 2007 have proved that cu and zn absorption by soil bacteria was very fast with stabilization within two hours more thoroughly this phenomenon was related to numerous ways of adaptation and an acquired resistance which is clearly observed in s5 soil samples where the microbial activities reached their maximum the microbial resistance to heavy metals includes many chemical mechanisms such as the precipitation and the conjugation of metals as reported in wyszkowska et al 2006 and dotaniya and pipalde 2018 works on the other hand biolog ecoplate was adopted to improve the effect of tww irrigation on physiological and metabolic activity of soil microorganisms however awcd which represent the catabolic diversity in soils was found to increase especially in soils irrigated for long periods with tww in similar works ibekwe et al 2018 and chen et al 2017 had proved that microbial activity increased significantly in long term irrigated soils in addition functional diversity has shown a significant decrease in short term irrigated soils and a crucial increase in s5 soil samples tww irrigation may incorporate exogenous microorganisms into the soils and this could influence native microbial population santamaria and toranzos 2003 gerba and smith 2005 frenk et al 2014 garcia orenes et al 2015 ibekwe et al 2013 2016 2018 in fact we have recorded an important increase of microbial biomass along with the irrigation period which was positively correlated with the biolog ecoplate results however it is also likely known that tww may provide nutrients and organic loads that can create a favorable environment for the development of specific populations mechri et al 2007 garcia orenes et al 2015 meanwhile an important variation was recorded in substrate utilization pattern among experimented soils which was induced especially in the case of s4 soil samples that is cultured and irrigated for 20 years with tww however soil bacteria trends to the consumption of carbohydrates amines and polymers which were a natural component that may exists in organic matter in soils and this was consistent with kenarova et al 2014 works in addition our results suggest that the major microbial community in soils is widely driven by the quality of the organic substrates loaded in them by the reuse of tww from perspective the high metabolic activity in 20 years irrigated soils may be related to the newest microorganisms coming from tww and this was proved in garcia orenes et al 2015 which proved that microbial community had disappeared after long term application of tww also more findings had proved that there was proliferation of more functional groups of bacteria which were involved in the geochemical cycling of c n and p 5 conclusion in conclusion tww may contain a variety of components that could enhance bacterial processes in soils also long term application of these water could modify the functional diversity of microbial communities on one hand and based on our findings we can conclude that the long term tww reuse in the context of the studied area may represent an interesting alternative to face water shortage in arid regions on the other hand it is suggested that risk assessment should be conducted prior to effluent irrigation to keep the safe application of treated wastewater for landscape and agriculture declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
