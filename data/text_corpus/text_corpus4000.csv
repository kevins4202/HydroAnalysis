20000,municipal wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas are facing numerous challenges including the need to provide a cost effective approach for removing nutrients and trace organic contaminants from wastewater as well as adapting to the effects of climate change the horizontal levee is a multi benefit response to these issues that consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between a coastal levee and tidal marshes the wetland attenuates storm surges and can provide space for wetland transgression to higher elevations as sea levels rise while simultaneously removing contaminants from treated wastewater effluent to assess the ability of the horizontal levee to improve water quality and to identify optimal operating conditions a 0 7 ha experimental system was studied over a two year period the removal of nitrate and trace organic contaminants was particularly sensitive to hydrology rapid and near complete removal 97 of these contaminants was observed in water flowing through the subsurface whereas surface flows did not exhibit measurable contaminant removal removal of f coliphage also appeared to be sensitive to hydrology with up to 99 removal of these indicator viruses in subsurface flow for phosphate removal was not as sensitive to hydrology but significant removal 83 was still observed when overland flow was eliminated although removal of contaminants did not appear to be sensitive to other design considerations parameters such as soil texture and planting regimes affected the maximum subsurface flows which in turn controlled contaminant mass loadings rapid subsurface removal of contaminants suggests that water quality benefits of these systems are limited by physical constraints i e the ability of the system to maintain subsurface flow and not chemical or biological conditions in the subsurface graphical abstract image 1 keywords nutrient removal constructed wetlands pharmaceuticals wetland hydrology 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants located in coastal environments are facing numerous challenges nutrient i e nitrogen and phosphorus discharges can impact marine and estuarine ecosystems by causing harmful algal blooms and eutrophication heisler et al 2008 in addition trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and household pesticides have been detected in treated wastewater effluent at concentrations that pose risks to aquatic ecosystems sumpter and johnson 2005 although future regulations may require additional treatment for these contaminants retrofitting conventional treatment plants to remove them is expensive and technically challenging schwarzenbach et al 2006 foley et al 2010 to further complicate matters coastal wastewater treatment facilities are susceptible to flooding as sea level rises and the frequency of severe storms increases wastewater treatment plants and other coastal infrastructure as well as sensitive coastal ecosystems will be threatened heberger et al 2011 for example in the united states 30 cm of sea level rise would result in flooding and loss of service at wastewater treatment plants serving more than 4 million people hummel et al 2018 the traditional approach for protecting coastal infrastructure from flooding involves the construction of seawalls and levees at significant cost heberger et al 2011 in 2013 a new approach for reducing the need to raise existing levees as sea level rises while simultaneously reducing the mass of contaminants discharged by municipal wastewater treatment plants was designed this system which is referred to as the horizontal levee consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between coastal levees and tidal marshes the horizontal levee provides transitional wetland habitat consisting of native vegetation that protects existing levees from erosion and reduces the threat of coastal flooding by attenuating storm waves wamsley et al 2010 gedan et al 2011 shepard et al 2011 treated municipal wastewater effluent is discharged to the subsurface of these wetlands through a perforated pipe to provide water for plants growing on this elevated wedge of land as the water flows though the subsurface wastewater derived contaminants are attenuated to accommodate greater applied flows the subsurface consists of multiple layers a surficial layer of low permeability soil i e clay or loam that is suitable for cultivating wetland plants is underlain by coarse layers i e sand and gravel with higher hydraulic conductivities to achieve greater subsurface flows in natural and constructed wetlands hydrology plays a significant role in contaminant removal this is especially true for contaminants that are removed through microbial processes as exemplified by nitrate across diverse aquatic ecosystems variation in the proportion of nitrate removed appears to be largely explained by hydrological variables such as residence times and water depth seitzinger et al 2006 hydraulic short circuiting is common in constructed wetlands knowles et al 2010 and can adversely impact treatment efficacy headley and kadlec 2007 by routing flows and nitrate contained therein around quiescent suboxic zones where denitrification activity is more significant seitzinger et al 2006 for example while denitrification walls can remove nitrate from groundwater schipper and vojvodic vukovic 2001 schmidt and clark 2012 treatment efficiency decreases if water bypasses regions of biological activity by flowing through zones with higher hydraulic conductivity schipper et al 2004 additionally overland flow in riparian wetlands often leads to less nitrate removal hill 2000 likely due to decreased contact with plant roots and denitrifying communities in the subsurface willems et al 1997 similar effects are expected for trace organic contaminants that are susceptible to biotransformation in wetlands to assess the potential for using a horizontal levee to remove contaminants from treated wastewater effluent we studied water quality and hydrological conditions over two years of operation in an experimental horizontal levee consisting of various combinations of design parameters e g sediment texture planting regimes we monitored nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus and wastewater derived trace organic contaminants because they are difficult to remove in existing treatment systems and frequently are present above concentrations of concern for aquatic ecosystems we also monitored f coliphage to assess the ability of these systems to remove enteric pathogen indicators results from these analyses inform the design and operation of horizontal levee systems and provide a basis for assessing the performance of full scale subsurface treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site a 0 7 ha experimental horizontal levee was constructed in san lorenzo ca 37 67 n by 122 16 w to treat a small portion i e 1 of the secondary effluent from a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant operated by the oro loma sanitary district https oroloma org sewage treatment the treatment plant has a design capacity of 76 000 m3 d 1 the effluent was nitrified in a gravel trench upstream of the wetland system water quality characteristics for nitrified secondary effluent are summarized in table s1 native wetland plants section s1 3 of the si mainly consisting of members of the families cyperaceae sedges juncaceae rushes and salicaceae willows were planted in the horizontal levee between november 2015 and february 2016 native plants were propagated from cuttings typically less than 3 cm in the surficial soil approximately 15 months before nitrified wastewater effluent was introduced into the subsurface during this period the sloped wetland was irrigated via sprinklers using shallow groundwater from a well located approximately 50 m from the wetland in april 2017 treated effluent from the wastewater treatment plant was first introduced to the horizontal levee at a total flow of 265 m3 d 1 prior to entering the horizontal levee wastewater effluent passed through a gravel nitrification trench and a 0 8 ha surface flow wetland planted with cattails and bulrushes typhaceae spp fig s1 in the si the nitrification trench converted 90 of the ammonia in the effluent into nitrate and nitrite i e average applied ammonia concentrations were 31 5 1 mg n l 1 between april and november 2017 the hydraulic residence time in the surface flow wetland was approximately 11 days under these conditions an average of 63 of influent nitrate was removed before entering the horizontal levee i e average influent nitrate concentrations were 11 4 2 mg n l from april to october 2017 in november of 2017 the flow from the nitrification trench was rerouted directly into the influent pump station to the subsurface wetland to assure that higher concentrations of nitrate entered the horizontal levee after november 2017 mean nitrate concentrations were 31 6 3 mg n l 1 in the influent to the horizontal levee the subsurface wetland was divided into 12 parallel treatment cells each having dimensions of 1 m deep x 12 m wide x 46 m long the cells were hydraulically isolated from each other with clay berms and were underlain with a geotextile liner and a low permeability compacted clay layer k sat 10 6 cm s 1 the 12 cells provided an ability to test four different wetland configurations in triplicate fig s2 and section s1 of the si the four treatments i e swale depression cells wet meadows with fine or coarse topsoil and willow riparian cells varied in terms of their topography soil type and plant community the horizontal levee was gently sloped 1 30 and consisted of three granular media layers from the bottom to the top these included gravel coarse sand and varying loam topsoil layers with hydraulic conductivities of approximately 0 25 cm s 1 0 1 cm s 1 and 10 3 cm s 1 respectively the topsoil layers consisted of various mixtures of fine clay loam excavated onsite mixed with coarse sand section s1 2 of the si the topsoil layer supported plant roots and prevented rapid diffusion of oxygen into the subsurface the higher hydraulic conductivities of the underlying layers were integrated to allow for a greater flow of water through the system all subsurface layers were amended with organic carbon i e wood chips to promote microbial conversion of nitrate no3 to nitrogen gas n2 via denitrification wood chips sequoia sempervirens or pseudotsuga menziesii of less than 2 cm in their greatest dimension were mixed into the sand and gravel layers by disking at 30 v v prior to installing the loamy soil surface layer wood fines of less than 0 5 cm in size were mixed into the topsoil layer 10 v v wood fines were composted for 12 months prior to use see section s1 of the si for further details nitrified treated municipal wastewater effluent was introduced into each wetland cell via perforated 5 cm diameter pvc pipes located at a depth of 5 cm below the surface within 0 6 m wide gravel trenches at the top of the slope several features were incorporated into the design of the subsurface wetland to minimize hydraulic short circuiting and to provide a means of collecting representative water samples 0 6 m wide vertical gravel walls oriented perpendicular to the direction of water flow were installed in each cell at 15 and 30 m along the slope i e 33 and 66 of the length of the slope 5 cm diameter monitoring wells screened at depths from 0 9 to 0 3 m were installed in the center of each trench fig s2 in the si the effluent from each cell flowed into a 0 6 m wide gravel trench at the end of the cell where it was collected in perforated 7 cm diameter pipes located at the bottom of the trench these pipes conveyed treated water to a monitoring well in each individual cell where samples were collected water flowing out of the horizontal levee was pumped back to the headworks of the wastewater treatment plant and constituted less than 0 6 on average of the overall flow to the plant ultrasonic flow meters master meter mansfield tx usa collected flow data continuously in the influent piping prior to each cell and in treated water leaving monitoring wells at the southwest corner of each treatment cell over the course of the 24 month study operational parameters were varied to assess their impact on system performance fig s3 in the si during the first phase of the study from april to november 2017 the total applied flow setting was 265 m3 d 1 22 m3 d 1 per cell and water flowed from the nitrification facility into the surface flow wetland before being applied to the subsurface wetland cells as described previously in july 2017 the applied flows going into each cell were adjusted to achieve similar levels of treatment across cells during the second phase between november 2017 and july 2018 the overall applied flow setting decreased to 190 m3 d 1 16 m3 d 1 per cell and water flowed directly from the nitrification facility into the subsurface wetland cells during the third and final phase between july 2018 and april 2019 the flow setting decreased to 95 m3 d 1 7 9 m3 d 1 per cell during this last phase applied flows to individual cells were again adjusted to eliminate overland flow in the majority of cells d l details are included in section s2 of the si 2 2 sample collection water samples were collected on a monthly or biweekly basis starting in april 2017 fig s3 in the si from the influent pump station and monitoring wells located at the end of the treatment cells additional samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the surface flow wetland and periodically from intermediate wells in the subsurface wetland samples for chemical analyses were collected using a masterflex e s portable water sampler cole parmer vernon hills il usa and analyzed in triplicate between april 2017 and july 2018 or duplicate between july 2018 and april 2019 at least two well volumes were purged prior to collecting a sample when appropriate samples were filtered on site through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters into 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and immediately stored on ice prior to analysis which normally occurred within 24 48 h samples for f coliphage analysis were collected in triplicate into acid washed nalgene bottles bottles were triple rinsed with sample water at the site before collecting samples samples were stored on ice during transport to the laboratory electrical conductivity and ph were measured at each sampling

springs oh usa porewater samples were collected at depths ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 m into luer lok bd syringes using stainless steel pushpoint sediment porewater samplers mhe products east tawas mi usa these samples were filtered on site through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters or 0 2 μm nylon filters and stored on ice prior to analysis 2 3 sample processing and analytical methods field filtered samples were stored at 4 c upon returning to the laboratory and were analyzed using established methods within 6 h of collection subsamples for ion chromatography analysis were filtered through 0 2 μm nylon filters into 0 5 ml polyvials capped with filter caps and refrigerated prior to analysis which normally occurred within 4 36 h of processing samples for cation analyses were acidified to ph 5 to limit volatilization of ammonia prior to analysis inorganic anions cl no2 br no3 po4 3 and so4 2 and cations li na nh4 k mg2 and ca2 were measured on dionex aquion ion chromatography systems thermo fisher scientific ma usa anion measurements were performed with a dionex ionpac as23 column according to u s epa method 300 0 and cations measurements were performed according to previously described methods thomas et al 2002 with minor modifications by using a 3 0 mm methanesulfonic acid eluent and a dionex ionpac cs16 column 15 ml aliquots of each field filtered sample were transferred for toc analysis into 24 ml borosilicate glass sample vials that had been rinsed with deionized water and baked at 450 c for 4 h prior to use analysis of non purgeable organic carbon npoc and total nitrogen tn was performed on a shimadzu toc v csh analyzer with an attached tn 1 unit according to standard methods method 5310b apha 2012 organic nitrogen concentrations were calculated by subtracting concentrations of nitrate nitrite and ammonium from total nitrogen measurements concentrations of a suite of trace organic contaminants were quantified according to previously described methods jasper et al 2014a prasse et al 2015 bear et al 2017 with minor modifications briefly field filtered samples were held at 4 c for 24 h to allow reduced iron to oxidize and precipitate these samples were filtered through 0 2 μm nylon filters to remove particulates which mainly consisted of fe iii oxides to assess potential losses concentrations of trace organic compounds in filtered samples and samples acidified to approximately ph 2 with hcl were compared because acidification could cause artifacts or damage the hplc ms ms system and no significant differences were observed in concentrations measured with the two pre treatment methods p value 0 6 the filtration method was used for all analyses samples were amended with a mixture containing stable isotope labeled pharmaceuticals 5 ng of each and analyzed using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent 1200 series hplc and agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer f coliphage were enumerated using previously published methods sinton et al 1996 epa method 1601 briefly magnesium chloride was added to 500 ml samples to achieve a final concentration of 0 05 m samples were subsequently filtered through a negatively charged 0 45 μm membrane filter millipore hawp04700 to capture the viruses filters were placed gridded side down into a 47 mm diameter plastic petri dish containing 300 μl of sterile 1 1 glycerol pbs solution the petri dishes containing the filters were frozen at 80 c until further processing within 6 months to enumerate the coliphage the coliphage were eluted from the membrane filters using a solution of 3 beef extract 3 tween 80 and 0 3 m sodium chloride 2 ml of the elution solution was added to each petri dish and the dish was rocked for 5 min on a shaker table at room temperature the elution liquid was removed from the dish and coliphage was enumerated in the liquid using epa method 1601 dal method the filter was placed on solid tryptic soy agar tsa media containing the appropriate concentrations of ampicillin and streptomycin antibiotics and the e coli host strain epa method 1601 the numbers of pfu obtained from assaying the liquid media and present on the filter were added together to obtain the concentration of pfu in the assayed water 3 results and discussion during the two year monitoring period the horizontal levee processed approximately 126 103 m3 of municipal wastewater effluent to assess water quality improvements that occurred as water passed through the system we measured contaminants and water quality parameters in over 1000 samples of influent and effluent as well as over 300 porewater samples we also measured water flows along with other design and operational variables the full dataset can be found on mendeley data cecchetti et al 2020 3 1 water balance in the experimental wetland system inflows of municipal wastewater effluent and a small volume of precipitation which constituted less than 1 of the total volume of water entering the system during the monitoring period and therefore did not have a significant impact on results were balanced by outflows through the effluent pipes and evapotranspiration water flowed along the ground surface i e overland flow passed through the subsurface and evaporated or was transpired by the plants fig 1 over the 2 year study period evapotranspiration accounted for the loss of approximately 25 of the water the remaining water left the system through the outlet pipe of this remaining flow the contributions of overland flow and subsurface flow varied considerably during the three phases of the study table 1 during phases 1 and 2 overland flow was approximately 2 5 times the magnitude of subsurface flow during phase 3 swale type cells continued to have high overland flows i e around 5 times subsurface flows though overland flow was negligible in most cells i e wet meadow cells with both fine and coarse topsoils and willow riparian cells methods used to calculate flows are detailed in section s3 of the si 3 1 1 effect of hydrology on contaminant removal the water balance in the horizontal levee was important due to its influence on contaminant removal evapotranspiration removed water from the subsurface concentrating dissolved species in the remaining water subsurface and overland flows mixed together prior to the final sample collection point but the water experienced different conditions the very short hydraulic retention times in the overland flow led to little if any removal of contaminants while nearly complete removal of contaminants was observed in the subsurface flow therefore hydrological variables e g the fraction of subsurface flow largely determined contaminant removal negative correlations r2 0 6 were observed between the fraction of overland flow and the fractional removal of nitrogen species pharmaceuticals and f coliphage fig 2 using standardized multiple linear regressions additional variables e g temperature planting regime were shown to be less influential on removal of studied contaminants with the exception of organic nitrogen and acyclovir see section s5 of the si for more details the most significant correlation for most contaminants studied was between subsurface flow and contaminant removal these observed contaminant removal trends were attributable to efficient removal in the subsurface with little or no contaminant removal in the overland flow for example in the case of nitrate the overland flow experienced short hydraulic residence times approximately 0 4 1 0 days section s4 of the si and aerobic conditions whereas subsurface flow was characterized by longer hydraulic residence times i e approximately 12 20 days and anoxic conditions that are conducive to microbial denitrification for trace organic contaminants the lack of contact with biofilms that coat organic matter plant roots and fluctuating redox conditions in the subsurface reduced contaminant removal in the overland flow for viruses we would expect a variety of mechanisms to increase the removal of f coliphage in the subsurface for example filtration facilitated by attachment to solids virus inactivation and rhizosphere processes could all contribute to the high levels of removal observed in cells with less overland flow vidales et al 2003 muerdter et al 2018 for phosphate limited contact with phosphate adsorbing mineral surfaces prevented significant removal in the overland flow the assumption that little removal of contaminants occurred in overland flow was verified through the collection of samples from the water flowing over the wetland surface fig 3 a which were consistently statistically indistinguishable p 0 05 from the influent porewater samples collected deeper than 0 1 m indicate that most contaminants were removed in the subsurface within 5 m of the inlet to the horizontal levee fig 3 the subsurface residence time in the first 5 m of the slope approximately 0 5 1 0 days was similar to residence times in the overland flow the significant and rapid subsurface removal of contaminants was likely due to a combination of mechanisms diffusion of oxygen into the subsurface was limited by overlying fine sediments preventing re introduction of oxygen and promoting anaerobic processes the subsurface also provided ample organic matter i e decomposing woodchips plant roots and exudates on which microbial communities can obtain energy promoting microbially mediated processes such as denitrification kadlec and wallace 2009 consistent with these observations removal of contaminants was most significant during the third phase of treatment when overland flow was eliminated in most cells section s2 of the si during this period over 96 of the mass of nitrogen and nitrate and 92 99 of trace organic contaminants were removed compared to 38 48 and 54 86 for the periods with more overland flow i e phases 1 and 2 in contrast to nitrogen species and trace organic contaminants hydrologic conditions e g percentage overland flow did not appear to have a consistent impact on the removal of phosphate fig 2b although removal of phosphate was high during the period when overland flow was eliminated in most cells averaging 81 23 removal phosphate removal was poorly explained by hydrological variables in standardized multiple linear regressions even when combined with other design and operational variables overall r2 0 34 for phosphate compared to r2 0 75 for other contaminants removal of phosphate varied over time ranging from 74 removal at best to concentrations more than doubling through the full horizontal levee fig s5 in addition to plant uptake phosphate exhibits an affinity for a variety of minerals holtan et al 1988 yao and millero 1996 and forms precipitates under certain conditions egger et al 2015 rothe et al 2016 biogeochemical cycling of other elements such as iron and carbon can have complex and variable impacts on these mechanisms in freshwater systems caraco et al 1989 murray 1995 szilas et al 1998 lin et al 2018 which may partly explain the observed variability in phosphate removal regardless of the cause of this observed variability we do not expect long term phosphate removal in horizontal levees because these mechanisms largely involve storage mechanisms that eventually will be exhausted for example following plant uptake decomposition of plant residues will eventually release a significant portion of assimilated phosphorus back into the subsurface additionally even if the amount of phosphate adsorption sites on minerals in the subsurface remains constant they will eventually be exhausted without the addition or formation of more mineral surfaces further research is required to understand how horizontal levees could be designed and operated to achieve substantial long term phosphate removal 3 2 effect of design and operational parameters on hydrology the interplay between overland flow and subsurface flow was the dominant factor controlling contaminant removal in the horizontal levee but design and operational parameters e g substrate type plant species also had significant impacts on the magnitudes of those flows and therefore on mass removal of contaminants the impact of cell design on contaminant removal was unclear based on fractional contaminant removal alone because flows were adjusted in an effort to obtain similar flow distributions there also were not significant differences in subsurface contaminant removal trends between cells based on porewater observations however there were significant differences in the water balance for the different cell treatment types fig 4 a these differences in flows translated into significant differences in contaminant mass removal rates fig 4b suggesting that design decisions like plant species and soil type can have a significant impact on the treatment capacity of horizontal levees 3 2 1 impacts of cell design on subsurface flows over the full monitoring period there were significant differences in flows based on soil texture as expected subsurface flows were significantly higher i e approximately twice as high in coarse sediment meadow cells when compared with those constructed with fine sediments i e 4 6 m3 d 1 versus 2 3 m3 d 1 p value 0 001 because soil texture is correlated with hydraulic conductivity in granular media kadlec and wallace 2009 however the magnitude of these differences decreased throughout the monitoring period for example during the last monitoring phase coarse textured cells exhibited flows that were only 54 higher than fine textured cells cells planted with the willow trees which were constructed with coarse sediments had the highest subsurface flows and the highest contaminant mass removal rates among tested cell types throughout the full monitoring period subsurface flows averaged 4 9 m3 d 1 in these cells compared with flows of 4 6 2 3 and 2 4 m3 d 1 in coarse and fine wet meadow cells and swale type cells respectively differences in subsurface flows between the willow and the coarse meadow cells were not significant p value 0 92 over the full monitoring period however during the third phase of treatment the differences in subsurface flows between the two coarse cell planting regimes willow cells and meadow cells increased significantly during the final phase the willow cells had 59 higher subsurface flows than coarse meadow cells p value 0 001 at 3 6 m3 d 1 versus 2 3 m3 d 1 corresponding to differences in mass removal of nitrogen on the order of 10 kg n per year per cell fig 4 the observed impact of riparian planting regimes on subsurface flows was consistent with past research willows have extensive rooting zones kuzovkina and volk 2009 which lead to greater subsurface flows in stormwater bioinfiltration systems read et al 2008 in the horizontal levee the willow cells also appeared to play an important role in increasing the volume of water that could be processed by a cell although subsurface flow in swale type cells was the lowest throughout phases 1 and 2 these cells had the second highest subsurface flow during the third monitoring phase there was an average 40 decrease p value 0 001 in the subsurface flow capacity of other cell types likely due to a variety of clogging mechanisms section s7 of the si whereas subsurface flows of swale cells did not decrease significantly p value 0 85 when compared to earlier monitoring periods the unique topography of swale type cells with swales running down the center of these cells fig s1 2 may have played a role in the observed subsurface flow conditions see s8 of the si for more details 3 2 2 impacts of cell design on evapotranspiration and overland flow throughout the monitoring period evapotranspiration rates were similar among cell types with average evapotranspiration rates ranging from 3 2 to 3 9 m3 d 1 only differences between fine and coarse meadow cells were significant p value 0 02 however in the third monitoring phase more significant differences among the cells emerged with willow cells 3 3 m3 d 1 exhibiting significantly higher evapotranspiration rates than both coarse p value 0 04 and fine p value 0 001 meadow cells 2 9 and 2 3 m3 d 1 this observation was consistent with evapotranspiration rates reported in short rotation coppice forests which are frequently higher than rates reported for grass like crops such as barley and grass ley persson and lindroth 1994 evapotranspiration rates at the field site were significantly higher than rates observed in natural wetlands with similar plant communities section s3 1 of the si this was consistent with past research which has also shown that evapotranspiration rates appear to increase in coppice forests when wastewater or sewage sludge are applied as a source of nutrients dimitriou and aronsson 2011 possibly due to increased biomass growth through nutrient enrichment morris et al 2013 higher evapotranspiration rates could be beneficial from an operational perspective because they can drive greater flows of water into the subsurface by lowering the water table which could increase treatment capacity overland flow correlated strongly with applied flow spearman s ρ 0 88 throughout the monitoring period swale type cells had the greatest overland flow averaging 14 2 m3 d 1 compared to 6 8 m3 d 1 for other cell types while values were similar p values 0 25 among all other cell types the significantly higher overland flows in swale type cells compared to other cells during earlier monitoring phases p value 0 001 were likely due primarily to topographical differences in the design of those cells isolating the impact of topography on overland flows i e comparing cells a c and cells d f yields a spearman s ρ value of 0 57 indicating a stronger correlation than observed for temperature 0 05 soil type 0 02 or planting regime 0 25 because of these high overland flows swale type cells had lower contaminant removal efficiencies than other cells e g over the entire study period 31 of applied nitrate was removed in swale type cells compared to 75 in other cells however swale type cells removed comparable masses of contaminants to other cells because of similar subsurface flows swale type cells removed around 100 kg n cell 1 of nitrate n compared to an average removal of 112 kg of n cell 1 in all other cell types in the final monitoring phase mass removal of nitrate n in the subsurface was greatest in swale and riparian type cells with 191 and 242 g n cell 1 d 1 removed in those cells respectively compared to 131 and 180 g n cell 1 d 1 in wet meadow cells with a fine and coarse topsoil type respectively 3 3 implications for design and operation of horizontal levees the design of constructed wetlands involves tradeoffs among a variety of considerations of which construction and operational costs space requirements and contaminant removal capabilities are typically most important kadlec and wallace 2009 other considerations section 3 3 3 such as habitat quality public benefits knight 1997 and control of disease vectors knight et al 2003 can also drive design decisions for horizontal levees subsurface flow capacity appears to have the most significant effect on contaminant mass removal if sand and gravel needed for the subsurface is not readily available onsite the purchase and transport of coarse material could increase construction costs though possibly only marginally our research also suggests that other design considerations such as the plant community composition can have significant impacts on subsurface flow capacities in these systems thereby impacting contaminant removal 3 3 1 design and operational considerations in the horizontal levee contaminant removal was largely confined to subsurface flows at the beginning of the slope while overland flow affords negligible treatment because the amount of treatment achieved is likely to be a critical design objective for these systems it is essential that they be designed to pass all of the flow through a portion of the subsurface to achieve this in full scale systems appropriate selection of the materials used for subsurface flow is essential hydraulic conductivity of potential construction materials can be well approximated using the carman kozeny equation to make a priori estimates kadlec and wallace 2009 or with simple laboratory tests e g constant head permeameter tests these methods tend to be quite accurate values approximated for construction materials a priori were 0 6 0 9 times observed values in the test facility while values derived from falling head permeameter tests were not significantly different p 0 05 from observed values see s3 2 of the si available fill found on a constructed wetland site is often not suitable to provide the needed subsurface flow capacity of these systems to strike a balance between obtaining the desired subsurface flow capacities and the cost of bringing more permeable materials to the site engineers could build a narrower treatment zone to achieve treatment within the first few meters of the horizontal levee beyond this initial treatment zone overland flow is not as much of a concern because sufficient treatment will have already been achieved although ponding of surface water should be avoided because it provides potential mosquito breeding grounds the full sloped wetlands may need to be much longer 50 100 m in length for geotechnical reasons e g to provide an appropriate level of wave attenuation and for ecological reasons to provide sufficient habitat area for wildlife but the majority of the slope could be constructed using fill found onsite that is appropriate for supporting restored wetland habitat additional design features such as subsurface layers constructed with coarse materials and periodic mixing trenches could also be included in horizontal levee design to help increase subsurface flow capacities though it is essential that designers include controls e g geotextile liners to prevent fine sediments from migrating into the pore spaces in these coarse material zones and clogging them in systems where it is critical that horizontal levees meet treatment objectives continuous real time monitoring of conductivity can be conducted at the end of the treatment zone depending on the system configuration with minimal additional costs or labor requirements zhuiykov 2012 this would allow operators to quickly identify conditions in which overland flow occurs because water flowing over the wetland surface has a lower salinity than water in the subsurface that gets progressively concentrated by evapotranspiration flow equalization could precede these systems to ensure that applied flow rates can be temporarily decreased if necessary to prevent overland flow 3 3 2 comparison to other types of wetlands subsurface wetlands that have been built in many locations often do not provide a significant advantage over surface flow wetlands in terms of space requirements and performance though they are less susceptible to seasonal variability especially in temperate climates kadlec 2009 consistent with past research seasonal climate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on contaminant removal in the horizontal levee contaminant removal efficiency was not correlated with ambient or water temperatures during the monitoring period fig s6 however the climate in the san francisco bay area is mild and stable the average daily temperature was 16 4 c at the field site with 95 of temperatures falling between 11 and 22 c throughout the monitoring period the relative insensitivity of contaminant removal to seasonal variations in temperature and plant growth may also be partly explained by the asynchronous seasonality of different removal mechanisms for example peak activity of plant uptake of nitrate and microbial removal of nitrate occur at different times of year kadlec and wallace 2009 the mechanisms of contaminant transformation in the subsurface will be investigated further in subsequent publications horizontal levees can offer significant advantages over other types of constructed wetlands used for treating wastewater effluent horizontal levees appear to be significantly more efficient in terms of space requirements provided that water can be directed to the subsurface to compare area requirements across wetland types we calculated the wetland area needed for 90 removal a1 90 of nitrate in hectares per m3 d 1 introduced by jasper et al 2014b open water and vegetated wetlands have seasonal a1 90 values ranging from around 1 2 10 3 ha m3 d 1 and 3 4 10 3 ha m3 d 1 respectively in the summer to greater than 6 10 3 ha m3 d 1 in the winter jasper et al 2014b for comparison a1 90 values for horizontal levees were seasonally invariable and ranged from 0 1 to 0 7 10 3 ha m3 d 1 fig s7 the median yearly a1 90 value of 0 2 10 3 ha m3 d 1 for horizontal levees is significantly lower than even the most efficient summer values for open water wetlands 3 3 3 additional benefits horizontal levees can also provide additional benefits that could make them more attractive than other types of wetlands for example coastal wetlands can provide storm surge protection shepard et al 2011 elevation gains to keep pace with sea level rise morris et al 2013 plant and animal biodiversity enhancements restored habitat and recreational opportunities ghermandi et al 2010 and increase the resiliency of tidal marshes to sea level rise beagle et al 2019 interviews with decision makers in the san francisco bay area where there is already awareness of the technology revealed that horizontal levees are viewed more favorably than other nutrient control options because they provide multiple potential benefits like sustainability and climate change resiliency harris lovett et al 2018 2019 other potential benefits of horizontal levees such as their ability to provide recreational opportunities are discussed further in section s7 of the si growth of native plants was rapid in the test system dense vegetation established on the horizontal levee within three years of construction native plants rapidly established and outcompeted non natives 2 of the surface coverage consisted of non native plants in riparian cells arroyo willows s lasiolepis reached heights above 6 m by mid 2018 section s1 of the si the rapid establishment of dense vegetation observed in this system was likely due to a combination of nutrient enrichment morris et al 2013 and high plant community diversity grace et al 2007 both of which can lead to greater productivity consistent with past wetlands research knight et al 2001 diverse fauna were also attracted to the test facility likely due to highly varied habitat and niche complementarity created by the dense biomass growth grace et al 2007 at full scale these benefits would likely increase because habitat diversity and quality tend to increase with wetland size hsu et al 2011 at the horizontal levee we observed diverse wildlife including ground squirrels otospermophilus beecheyi and other rodents jackrabbits lepus californicus garter snakes thamnophis sirtalis gopher snakes pituophis catenifer and other reptiles amphibians such as the pacific tree frog pseudacris regilla and a wide array of insects along with a large and varied community of birds section s9 of the si these observations are in line with past research suggesting that constructed wetlands provide attractive and productive habitats kadlec and wallace 2009 4 conclusions horizontal levees can achieve significant removal of a wide range of wastewater derived contaminants including nutrients pharmaceuticals and f coliphage while providing other benefits such as high quality habitat and increased shoreline resilience to sea level rise at our field site treatment efficiency was controlled by hydrological conditions which were the strongest predictors for the removal of a wide range of contaminants removed in these systems certain design parameters such as planting regimes and soil texture also affected the total mass of contaminants that can be removed based on their influence over maximum subsurface flow rates additional research is needed to develop an understanding of the mechanisms behind contaminant removal in this system as well as how horizontal levees would function under a variety of additional other design and operational conditions and in more variable climates horizontal levees may also be useful in potable water reuse scenarios which will likely expand in the future currently there are limited options for disposal of waste streams associated with wastewater reuse e g reverse osmosis concentrate streams which tend to have low volumes but high concentrations of salts nutrients and trace organic contaminants horizontal levees could be used to treat these waste streams because our results suggest these systems could handle significantly higher contaminant mass loads than we have studied this application requires testing to ensure that differences in water matrices do not adversely impact treatment capacity such as through stress to microbial or plant communities caused by higher salinity water if successful horizontal levees could continue to be appropriate multi benefit treatment options even throughout dramatic shifts in water and wastewater management

20000,municipal wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas are facing numerous challenges including the need to provide a cost effective approach for removing nutrients and trace organic contaminants from wastewater as well as adapting to the effects of climate change the horizontal levee is a multi benefit response to these issues that consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between a coastal levee and tidal marshes the wetland attenuates storm surges and can provide space for wetland transgression to higher elevations as sea levels rise while simultaneously removing contaminants from treated wastewater effluent to assess the ability of the horizontal levee to improve water quality and to identify optimal operating conditions a 0 7 ha experimental system was studied over a two year period the removal of nitrate and trace organic contaminants was particularly sensitive to hydrology rapid and near complete removal 97 of these contaminants was observed in water flowing through the subsurface whereas surface flows did not exhibit measurable contaminant removal removal of f coliphage also appeared to be sensitive to hydrology with up to 99 removal of these indicator viruses in subsurface flow for phosphate removal was not as sensitive to hydrology but significant removal 83 was still observed when overland flow was eliminated although removal of contaminants did not appear to be sensitive to other design considerations parameters such as soil texture and planting regimes affected the maximum subsurface flows which in turn controlled contaminant mass loadings rapid subsurface removal of contaminants suggests that water quality benefits of these systems are limited by physical constraints i e the ability of the system to maintain subsurface flow and not chemical or biological conditions in the subsurface graphical abstract image 1 keywords nutrient removal constructed wetlands pharmaceuticals wetland hydrology 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants located in coastal environments are facing numerous challenges nutrient i e nitrogen and phosphorus discharges can impact marine and estuarine ecosystems by causing harmful algal blooms and eutrophication heisler et al 2008 in addition trace organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and household pesticides have been detected in treated wastewater effluent at concentrations that pose risks to aquatic ecosystems sumpter and johnson 2005 although future regulations may require additional treatment for these contaminants retrofitting conventional treatment plants to remove them is expensive and technically challenging schwarzenbach et al 2006 foley et al 2010 to further complicate matters coastal wastewater treatment facilities are susceptible to flooding as sea level rises and the frequency of severe storms increases wastewater treatment plants and other coastal infrastructure as well as sensitive coastal ecosystems will be threatened heberger et al 2011 for example in the united states 30 cm of sea level rise would result in flooding and loss of service at wastewater treatment plants serving more than 4 million people hummel et al 2018 the traditional approach for protecting coastal infrastructure from flooding involves the construction of seawalls and levees at significant cost heberger et al 2011 in 2013 a new approach for reducing the need to raise existing levees as sea level rises while simultaneously reducing the mass of contaminants discharged by municipal wastewater treatment plants was designed this system which is referred to as the horizontal levee consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between coastal levees and tidal marshes the horizontal levee provides transitional wetland habitat consisting of native vegetation that protects existing levees from erosion and reduces the threat of coastal flooding by attenuating storm waves wamsley et al 2010 gedan et al 2011 shepard et al 2011 treated municipal wastewater effluent is discharged to the subsurface of these wetlands through a perforated pipe to provide water for plants growing on this elevated wedge of land as the water flows though the subsurface wastewater derived contaminants are attenuated to accommodate greater applied flows the subsurface consists of multiple layers a surficial layer of low permeability soil i e clay or loam that is suitable for cultivating wetland plants is underlain by coarse layers i e sand and gravel with higher hydraulic conductivities to achieve greater subsurface flows in natural and constructed wetlands hydrology plays a significant role in contaminant removal this is especially true for contaminants that are removed through microbial processes as exemplified by nitrate across diverse aquatic ecosystems variation in the proportion of nitrate removed appears to be largely explained by hydrological variables such as residence times and water depth seitzinger et al 2006 hydraulic short circuiting is common in constructed wetlands knowles et al 2010 and can adversely impact treatment efficacy headley and kadlec 2007 by routing flows and nitrate contained therein around quiescent suboxic zones where denitrification activity is more significant seitzinger et al 2006 for example while denitrification walls can remove nitrate from groundwater schipper and vojvodic vukovic 2001 schmidt and clark 2012 treatment efficiency decreases if water bypasses regions of biological activity by flowing through zones with higher hydraulic conductivity schipper et al 2004 additionally overland flow in riparian wetlands often leads to less nitrate removal hill 2000 likely due to decreased contact with plant roots and denitrifying communities in the subsurface willems et al 1997 similar effects are expected for trace organic contaminants that are susceptible to biotransformation in wetlands to assess the potential for using a horizontal levee to remove contaminants from treated wastewater effluent we studied water quality and hydrological conditions over two years of operation in an experimental horizontal levee consisting of various combinations of design parameters e g sediment texture planting regimes we monitored nutrients i e nitrogen and phosphorus and wastewater derived trace organic contaminants because they are difficult to remove in existing treatment systems and frequently are present above concentrations of concern for aquatic ecosystems we also monitored f coliphage to assess the ability of these systems to remove enteric pathogen indicators results from these analyses inform the design and operation of horizontal levee systems and provide a basis for assessing the performance of full scale subsurface treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site a 0 7 ha experimental horizontal levee was constructed in san lorenzo ca 37 67 n by 122 16 w to treat a small portion i e 1 of the secondary effluent from a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant operated by the oro loma sanitary district https oroloma org sewage treatment the treatment plant has a design capacity of 76 000 m3 d 1 the effluent was nitrified in a gravel trench upstream of the wetland system water quality characteristics for nitrified secondary effluent are summarized in table s1 native wetland plants section s1 3 of the si mainly consisting of members of the families cyperaceae sedges juncaceae rushes and salicaceae willows were planted in the horizontal levee between november 2015 and february 2016 native plants were propagated from cuttings typically less than 3 cm in the surficial soil approximately 15 months before nitrified wastewater effluent was introduced into the subsurface during this period the sloped wetland was irrigated via sprinklers using shallow groundwater from a well located approximately 50 m from the wetland in april 2017 treated effluent from the wastewater treatment plant was first introduced to the horizontal levee at a total flow of 265 m3 d 1 prior to entering the horizontal levee wastewater effluent passed through a gravel nitrification trench and a 0 8 ha surface flow wetland planted with cattails and bulrushes typhaceae spp fig s1 in the si the nitrification trench converted 90 of the ammonia in the effluent into nitrate and nitrite i e average applied ammonia concentrations were 31 5 1 mg n l 1 between april and november 2017 the hydraulic residence time in the surface flow wetland was approximately 11 days under these conditions an average of 63 of influent nitrate was removed before entering the horizontal levee i e average influent nitrate concentrations were 11 4 2 mg n l from april to october 2017 in november of 2017 the flow from the nitrification trench was rerouted directly into the influent pump station to the subsurface wetland to assure that higher concentrations of nitrate entered the horizontal levee after november 2017 mean nitrate concentrations were 31 6 3 mg n l 1 in the influent to the horizontal levee the subsurface wetland was divided into 12 parallel treatment cells each having dimensions of 1 m deep x 12 m wide x 46 m long the cells were hydraulically isolated from each other with clay berms and were underlain with a geotextile liner and a low permeability compacted clay layer k sat 10 6 cm s 1 the 12 cells provided an ability to test four different wetland configurations in triplicate fig s2 and section s1 of the si the four treatments i e swale depression cells wet meadows with fine or coarse topsoil and willow riparian cells varied in terms of their topography soil type and plant community the horizontal levee was gently sloped 1 30 and consisted of three granular media layers from the bottom to the top these included gravel coarse sand and varying loam topsoil layers with hydraulic conductivities of approximately 0 25 cm s 1 0 1 cm s 1 and 10 3 cm s 1 respectively the topsoil layers consisted of various mixtures of fine clay loam excavated onsite mixed with coarse sand section s1 2 of the si the topsoil layer supported plant roots and prevented rapid diffusion of oxygen into the subsurface the higher hydraulic conductivities of the underlying layers were integrated to allow for a greater flow of water through the system all subsurface layers were amended with organic carbon i e wood chips to promote microbial conversion of nitrate no3 to nitrogen gas n2 via denitrification wood chips sequoia sempervirens or pseudotsuga menziesii of less than 2 cm in their greatest dimension were mixed into the sand and gravel layers by disking at 30 v v prior to installing the loamy soil surface layer wood fines of less than 0 5 cm in size were mixed into the topsoil layer 10 v v wood fines were composted for 12 months prior to use see section s1 of the si for further details nitrified treated municipal wastewater effluent was introduced into each wetland cell via perforated 5 cm diameter pvc pipes located at a depth of 5 cm below the surface within 0 6 m wide gravel trenches at the top of the slope several features were incorporated into the design of the subsurface wetland to minimize hydraulic short circuiting and to provide a means of collecting representative water samples 0 6 m wide vertical gravel walls oriented perpendicular to the direction of water flow were installed in each cell at 15 and 30 m along the slope i e 33 and 66 of the length of the slope 5 cm diameter monitoring wells screened at depths from 0 9 to 0 3 m were installed in the center of each trench fig s2 in the si the effluent from each cell flowed into a 0 6 m wide gravel trench at the end of the cell where it was collected in perforated 7 cm diameter pipes located at the bottom of the trench these pipes conveyed treated water to a monitoring well in each individual cell where samples were collected water flowing out of the horizontal levee was pumped back to the headworks of the wastewater treatment plant and constituted less than 0 6 on average of the overall flow to the plant ultrasonic flow meters master meter mansfield tx usa collected flow data continuously in the influent piping prior to each cell and in treated water leaving monitoring wells at the southwest corner of each treatment cell over the course of the 24 month study operational parameters were varied to assess their impact on system performance fig s3 in the si during the first phase of the study from april to november 2017 the total applied flow setting was 265 m3 d 1 22 m3 d 1 per cell and water flowed from the nitrification facility into the surface flow wetland before being applied to the subsurface wetland cells as described previously in july 2017 the applied flows going into each cell were adjusted to achieve similar levels of treatment across cells during the second phase between november 2017 and july 2018 the overall applied flow setting decreased to 190 m3 d 1 16 m3 d 1 per cell and water flowed directly from the nitrification facility into the subsurface wetland cells during the third and final phase between july 2018 and april 2019 the flow setting decreased to 95 m3 d 1 7 9 m3 d 1 per cell during this last phase applied flows to individual cells were again adjusted to eliminate overland flow in the majority of cells d l details are included in section s2 of the si

treatment cells additional samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the surface flow wetland and periodically from intermediate wells in the subsurface wetland samples for chemical analyses were collected using a masterflex e s portable water sampler cole parmer vernon hills il usa and analyzed in triplicate between april 2017 and july 2018 or duplicate between july 2018 and

these samples were filtered on site through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters or 0 2 μm nylon filters and stored on ice prior to analysis 2 3 sample processing and analytical methods field filtered samples

scientific ma usa anion measurements were performed with a dionex ionpac as23 column according to u s epa method 300 0 and cations measurements were performed according to previously described methods thomas et al 2002 with minor modifications by using a 3 0 mm methanesulfonic acid eluent and a dionex ionpac cs16 column 15 ml aliquots of each field filtered sample were transferred for toc analysis into 24 ml borosilicate glass sample vials that had been rinsed with deionized water and baked at 450 c for 4 h prior to use analysis of non purgeable organic carbon npoc and total nitrogen tn was performed on a shimadzu toc v csh analyzer with an attached tn 1 unit according to standard methods method 5310b apha 2012 organic nitrogen concentrations were calculated by subtracting concentrations

prasse et al 2015 bear et al 2017 with minor modifications briefly field filtered samples were held at 4 c for 24 h to allow reduced iron to oxidize and precipitate these samples were filtered through 0 2 μm nylon filters to remove particulates which mainly consisted of fe iii oxides to assess potential losses concentrations of trace organic compounds in filtered samples and samples acidified to

two pre treatment methods p value 0 6 the filtration method was used for all analyses samples were amended with a mixture containing stable isotope labeled pharmaceuticals 5 ng of each and analyzed using isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry agilent 1200 series hplc and agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer f coliphage were enumerated using previously published methods sinton et al 1996 epa method 1601 briefly magnesium chloride was added to 500 ml samples to achieve a final concentration of 0 05 m samples were subsequently filtered through a negatively charged 0 45 μm membrane filter millipore hawp04700 to capture the viruses filters were placed gridded side down into a 47 mm diameter plastic petri dish containing 300 μl of sterile 1 1 glycerol pbs solution the petri dishes containing the filters were frozen at 80 c until further processing within 6 months to enumerate the coliphage the coliphage were eluted from the membrane filters using a solution of 3 beef extract 3 tween 80 and 0 3 m sodium chloride 2 ml of the elution solution was added to each petri dish and the dish was rocked for 5 min on a shaker table at room temperature the elution liquid was removed from the dish and coliphage was enumerated in the liquid using epa method 1601 dal method the filter was placed on solid tryptic soy agar tsa media containing the appropriate concentrations of ampicillin and streptomycin antibiotics and the e coli host strain epa method 1601 the numbers of pfu obtained from assaying the liquid media and present on the filter were added together to obtain the concentration of pfu in the assayed water 3 results and discussion during the two year monitoring period the horizontal levee processed approximately 126 103 m3 of municipal wastewater effluent to assess water quality improvements that occurred as water passed through the system we measured contaminants and water quality parameters in over 1000 samples of influent and effluent as well as over 300 porewater samples we also measured water flows along with other design and operational variables the full dataset can be found on mendeley data cecchetti et al 2020 3 1 water balance in the experimental wetland system inflows of municipal wastewater effluent and a small volume of precipitation which constituted less than 1 of the total volume of water entering the system during the monitoring period and therefore did not have a significant impact on results were balanced by outflows through the effluent pipes and evapotranspiration water flowed along the ground surface i e overland flow passed through the subsurface and evaporated or was transpired by the plants fig 1 over the 2 year study period evapotranspiration accounted for the loss of approximately 25 of the water the remaining water left the system through the outlet pipe of this remaining flow the contributions of overland flow and subsurface flow varied considerably during the three phases of the study table 1 during phases 1 and 2 overland flow was approximately 2 5 times the magnitude of subsurface flow during phase 3 swale type cells continued to have high overland flows i e around 5 times subsurface flows though overland flow was negligible in most cells i e wet meadow cells with both fine and coarse topsoils and willow riparian cells methods used to calculate flows are detailed in section s3 of the si 3 1 1 effect of hydrology on contaminant removal the water balance in the horizontal levee was important due to its influence on contaminant removal evapotranspiration removed water from the subsurface concentrating dissolved species in the remaining water subsurface and overland flows mixed together prior to the final sample collection point but the water experienced different conditions the very short hydraulic retention times in the overland flow led to little if any removal of contaminants while nearly complete removal of contaminants was observed in the subsurface flow therefore hydrological variables e g the fraction of subsurface flow largely determined contaminant removal negative correlations r2 0 6 were observed between the fraction of overland flow and the fractional removal of nitrogen species pharmaceuticals and f coliphage fig 2 using standardized multiple linear regressions additional variables e g temperature planting regime were shown to be less influential on removal of studied contaminants with the exception of organic nitrogen and acyclovir see section s5 of the si for more details the most significant correlation for most contaminants studied was between subsurface flow and contaminant removal these observed contaminant removal trends were attributable to efficient removal in the subsurface with little or no contaminant removal in the overland flow for example in the case of nitrate the overland flow experienced short hydraulic residence times approximately 0 4 1 0 days section s4 of the si and aerobic conditions whereas subsurface flow was characterized by longer hydraulic residence times i e approximately 12 20 days and anoxic conditions that are conducive to microbial denitrification for trace organic contaminants the lack of contact with biofilms that coat organic matter plant roots and fluctuating redox conditions in the subsurface reduced contaminant removal in the overland flow for viruses we would expect a variety of mechanisms to increase the removal of f coliphage in the subsurface for example filtration facilitated by attachment to solids virus inactivation and rhizosphere processes could all contribute to the high levels of removal observed in cells with less overland flow vidales et al 2003 muerdter et al 2018 for phosphate limited contact with phosphate adsorbing mineral surfaces prevented significant removal in the overland flow the assumption that little removal of contaminants occurred in overland flow was verified through the collection of samples from the water flowing over the wetland surface fig 3 a which were consistently statistically indistinguishable p 0 05 from the influent porewater samples collected deeper than 0 1 m indicate that most contaminants were removed in the subsurface within 5 m of the inlet to the horizontal levee fig 3 the subsurface residence time in the first 5 m of the slope approximately 0 5 1 0 days was similar to residence times in the overland flow the significant and rapid subsurface removal of contaminants was likely due to a combination of mechanisms diffusion of oxygen into the subsurface was limited by overlying fine sediments preventing re introduction of oxygen and promoting anaerobic processes the subsurface also provided ample organic matter i e decomposing woodchips plant roots and exudates on which microbial communities can obtain energy promoting microbially mediated processes such as denitrification kadlec and wallace 2009 consistent with these observations removal of contaminants was most significant during the third phase of treatment when overland flow was eliminated in most cells section s2 of the si during this period over 96 of the mass of nitrogen and nitrate and 92 99 of trace organic contaminants were removed compared to 38 48 and 54 86 for the periods with more overland flow i e phases 1 and 2 in contrast to nitrogen species and trace organic contaminants hydrologic conditions e g percentage overland flow did not appear to have a consistent impact on the removal of phosphate fig 2b although removal of phosphate was high during the period when overland flow was eliminated in most cells averaging 81 23 removal phosphate removal was poorly explained by hydrological variables in standardized multiple linear regressions even when combined with other design and operational variables overall r2 0 34 for phosphate compared to r2 0 75 for other contaminants removal of phosphate varied over time ranging from 74 removal at best to concentrations more than doubling through the full horizontal levee fig s5 in addition to plant uptake phosphate exhibits an affinity for a variety of minerals holtan et al 1988 yao and millero 1996 and forms precipitates under certain conditions egger et al 2015 rothe et al 2016 biogeochemical cycling of other elements such as iron and carbon can have complex and variable impacts on these mechanisms in freshwater systems caraco et al 1989 murray 1995 szilas et al 1998 lin et al 2018 which may partly explain the observed variability in phosphate removal regardless of the cause of this observed variability we do not expect long term phosphate removal in horizontal levees because these mechanisms largely involve storage mechanisms that eventually will be exhausted for example following plant uptake decomposition of plant residues will eventually release a significant portion of assimilated phosphorus back into the subsurface additionally even if the amount of phosphate adsorption sites on minerals in the subsurface remains constant they will eventually be exhausted without the addition or formation of more mineral surfaces further research is required to understand how horizontal levees could be designed and operated to achieve substantial long term phosphate removal 3 2 effect of design and operational parameters on hydrology the interplay between overland flow and subsurface flow was the dominant factor controlling contaminant removal in the horizontal levee but design and operational parameters e g substrate type plant species also had significant impacts on the magnitudes of those flows and therefore on mass removal of contaminants the impact of cell design on contaminant removal was unclear based on fractional contaminant removal alone because flows were adjusted in an effort to obtain similar flow distributions there also were not significant differences in subsurface contaminant removal trends between cells based on porewater observations however there were significant differences in the water balance for the different cell treatment types fig 4 a these differences in flows translated into significant differences in contaminant mass removal rates fig 4b suggesting that design decisions like plant species and soil type can have a significant impact on the treatment capacity of horizontal levees 3 2 1 impacts of cell design on subsurface flows over the full monitoring period there were significant differences in flows based on soil texture as expected subsurface flows were significantly higher i e approximately twice as high in coarse sediment meadow cells when compared with those constructed with fine sediments i e 4 6 m3 d 1 versus 2 3 m3 d 1 p value 0 001 because soil texture is correlated with hydraulic conductivity in granular media kadlec and wallace 2009 however the magnitude of these differences decreased throughout the monitoring period for example during the last monitoring phase coarse textured cells exhibited flows that were only 54 higher than fine textured cells cells planted with the willow trees which were constructed with coarse sediments had the highest subsurface flows and the highest contaminant mass removal rates among tested cell types throughout the full monitoring period subsurface flows averaged 4 9 m3 d 1 in these cells compared with flows of 4 6 2 3 and 2 4 m3 d 1 in coarse and fine wet meadow cells and swale type cells respectively differences in subsurface flows between the willow and the coarse meadow cells were not significant p value 0 92 over the full monitoring period however during the third phase of treatment the differences in subsurface flows between the two coarse cell planting regimes willow cells and meadow cells increased significantly during the final phase the willow cells had 59 higher subsurface flows than coarse meadow cells p value 0 001 at 3 6 m3 d 1 versus 2 3 m3 d 1 corresponding to differences in mass removal of nitrogen on the order of 10 kg n per year per cell fig 4 the observed impact of riparian planting regimes on subsurface flows was consistent with past research willows have extensive rooting zones kuzovkina and volk 2009 which lead to greater subsurface flows in stormwater bioinfiltration systems read et al 2008 in the horizontal levee the willow cells also appeared to play an important role in increasing the volume of water that could be processed by a cell although subsurface flow in swale type cells was the lowest throughout phases 1 and 2 these cells had the second highest subsurface flow during the third monitoring phase there was an average 40 decrease p value 0 001 in the subsurface flow capacity of other cell types likely due to a variety of clogging mechanisms section s7 of the si whereas subsurface flows of swale cells did not decrease significantly p value 0 85 when compared to earlier monitoring periods the unique topography of swale type cells with swales running down the center of these cells fig s1 2 may have played a role in the observed subsurface flow conditions see s8 of the si for more details 3 2 2 impacts of cell design on evapotranspiration and overland flow throughout the monitoring period evapotranspiration rates were similar among cell types with average evapotranspiration rates ranging from 3 2 to 3 9 m3 d 1 only differences between fine and coarse meadow cells were significant p value 0 02 however in the third monitoring phase more significant differences among the cells emerged with willow cells 3 3 m3 d 1 exhibiting significantly higher evapotranspiration rates than both coarse p value 0 04 and fine p value 0 001 meadow cells 2 9 and 2 3 m3 d 1 this observation was consistent with evapotranspiration rates reported in short rotation coppice forests which are frequently higher than rates reported for grass like crops such as barley and grass ley persson and lindroth 1994 evapotranspiration rates at the field site were significantly higher than rates observed in natural wetlands with similar plant communities section s3 1 of the si this was consistent with past research which has also shown that evapotranspiration rates appear to increase in coppice forests when wastewater or sewage sludge are applied as a source of nutrients dimitriou and aronsson 2011 possibly due to increased biomass growth through nutrient enrichment morris et al 2013 higher evapotranspiration rates could be beneficial from an operational perspective because they can drive greater flows of water into the subsurface by lowering the water table which could increase treatment capacity overland flow correlated strongly with applied flow spearman s ρ 0 88 throughout the monitoring period swale type cells had the greatest overland flow averaging 14 2 m3 d 1 compared to 6 8 m3 d 1 for other cell types while values were similar p values 0 25 among all other cell types the significantly higher overland flows in swale type cells compared to other cells during earlier monitoring phases p value 0 001 were likely due primarily to topographical differences in the design of those cells isolating the impact of topography on overland flows i e comparing cells a c and cells d f yields a spearman s ρ value of 0 57 indicating a stronger correlation than observed for temperature 0 05 soil type 0 02 or planting regime 0 25 because of these high overland flows swale type cells had lower contaminant removal efficiencies than other cells e g over the entire study period 31 of applied nitrate was removed in swale type cells compared to 75 in other cells however swale type cells removed comparable masses of contaminants to other cells because of similar subsurface flows swale type cells removed around 100 kg n cell 1 of nitrate n compared to an average removal of 112 kg of n cell 1 in all other cell types in the final monitoring phase mass removal of nitrate n in the subsurface was greatest in swale and riparian type cells with 191 and 242 g n cell 1 d 1 removed in those cells respectively compared to 131 and 180 g n cell 1 d 1 in wet meadow cells with a fine and coarse topsoil type respectively 3 3 implications for design and operation of horizontal levees the design of constructed wetlands involves tradeoffs among a variety of considerations of which construction and operational costs space requirements and contaminant removal capabilities are typically most important kadlec and wallace 2009 other considerations section 3 3 3 such as habitat quality public benefits knight 1997 and control of disease vectors knight et al 2003 can also drive design decisions for horizontal levees subsurface flow capacity appears to have the most significant effect on contaminant mass removal if sand and gravel needed for the subsurface is not readily available onsite the purchase and transport of coarse material could increase construction costs though possibly only marginally our research also suggests that other design considerations such as the plant community composition can have significant impacts on subsurface flow capacities in these systems thereby impacting contaminant removal 3 3 1 design and operational considerations in the horizontal levee contaminant removal was largely confined to subsurface flows at the beginning of the slope while overland flow affords negligible treatment because the amount of treatment achieved is likely to be a critical design objective for these systems it is essential that they be designed to pass all of the flow through a portion of the subsurface to achieve this in full scale systems appropriate selection of the materials used for subsurface flow is essential hydraulic conductivity of potential construction materials can be well approximated using the carman kozeny equation to make a priori estimates kadlec and wallace 2009 or with simple laboratory tests e g constant head permeameter tests these methods tend to be quite accurate values approximated for construction materials a priori were 0 6 0 9 times observed values in the test facility while values derived from falling head permeameter tests were not significantly different p 0 05 from observed values see s3 2 of the si available fill found on a constructed wetland site is often not suitable to provide the needed subsurface flow capacity of these systems to strike a balance between obtaining the desired subsurface flow capacities and the cost of bringing more permeable materials to the site engineers could build a narrower treatment zone to achieve treatment within the first few meters of the horizontal levee beyond this initial treatment zone overland flow is not as much of a concern because sufficient treatment will have already been achieved although ponding of surface water should be avoided because it provides potential mosquito breeding grounds the full sloped wetlands may need to be much longer 50 100 m in length for geotechnical reasons e g to provide an appropriate level of wave attenuation and for ecological reasons to provide sufficient habitat area for wildlife but the majority of the slope could be constructed using fill found onsite that is appropriate for supporting restored wetland habitat additional design features such as subsurface layers constructed with coarse materials and periodic mixing trenches could also be included in horizontal levee design to help increase subsurface flow capacities though it is essential that designers include controls e g geotextile liners to prevent fine sediments from migrating into the pore spaces in these coarse material zones and clogging them in systems where it is critical that horizontal levees meet treatment objectives continuous real time monitoring of conductivity can be conducted at the end of the treatment zone depending on the system configuration with minimal additional costs or labor requirements zhuiykov 2012 this would allow operators to quickly identify conditions in which overland flow occurs because water flowing over the wetland surface has a lower salinity than water in the subsurface that gets progressively concentrated by evapotranspiration flow equalization could precede these systems to ensure that applied flow rates can be temporarily decreased if necessary to prevent overland flow 3 3 2 comparison to other types of wetlands subsurface wetlands that have been built in many locations often do not provide a significant advantage over surface flow wetlands in terms of space requirements and performance though they are less susceptible to seasonal variability especially in temperate climates kadlec 2009 consistent with past research seasonal climate fluctuations did not have a significant impact on contaminant removal in the horizontal levee contaminant removal efficiency was not correlated with ambient or water temperatures during the monitoring period fig s6 however the climate in the san francisco bay area is mild and stable the average daily temperature was 16 4 c at the field site with 95 of temperatures falling between 11 and 22 c throughout the monitoring period the relative insensitivity of contaminant removal to seasonal variations in temperature and plant growth may also be partly explained by the asynchronous seasonality of different removal mechanisms for example peak activity of plant uptake of nitrate and microbial removal of nitrate occur at different times of year kadlec and wallace 2009 the mechanisms of contaminant transformation in the subsurface will be investigated further in subsequent publications horizontal levees can offer significant advantages over other types of constructed wetlands used for treating wastewater effluent horizontal levees appear to be significantly more efficient in terms of space requirements provided that water can be directed to the subsurface to compare area requirements across wetland types we calculated the wetland area needed for 90 removal a1 90 of nitrate in hectares per m3 d 1 introduced by jasper et al 2014b open water and vegetated wetlands have seasonal a1 90 values ranging from around 1 2 10 3 ha m3 d 1 and 3 4 10 3 ha m3 d 1 respectively in the summer to greater than 6 10 3 ha m3 d 1 in the winter jasper et al 2014b for comparison a1 90 values for horizontal levees were seasonally invariable and ranged from 0 1 to 0 7 10 3 ha m3 d 1 fig s7 the median yearly a1 90 value of 0 2 10 3 ha m3 d 1 for horizontal levees is significantly lower than even the most efficient summer values for open water wetlands 3 3 3 additional benefits horizontal levees can also provide additional benefits that could make them more attractive than other types of wetlands for example coastal wetlands can provide storm surge protection shepard et al 2011 elevation gains to keep pace with sea level rise morris et al 2013 plant and animal biodiversity enhancements restored habitat and recreational opportunities ghermandi et al 2010 and increase the resiliency of tidal marshes to sea level rise beagle et al 2019 interviews with decision makers in the san francisco bay area where there is already awareness of the technology revealed that horizontal levees are viewed more favorably than other nutrient control options because they provide multiple potential benefits like sustainability and climate change resiliency harris lovett et al 2018 2019 other potential benefits of horizontal levees such as their ability to provide recreational opportunities are discussed further in section s7 of the si growth of native plants was rapid in the test system dense vegetation established on the horizontal levee within three years of construction native plants rapidly established and outcompeted non natives 2 of the surface coverage consisted of non native plants in riparian cells arroyo willows s lasiolepis reached heights above 6 m by mid 2018 section s1 of the si the rapid establishment of dense vegetation observed in this system was likely due to a combination of nutrient enrichment morris et al 2013 and high plant community diversity grace et al 2007 both of which can lead to greater productivity consistent with past wetlands research knight et al 2001 diverse fauna were also attracted to the test facility likely due to highly varied habitat and niche complementarity created by the dense biomass growth grace et al 2007 at full scale these benefits would likely increase because habitat diversity and quality tend to increase with wetland size hsu et al 2011 at the horizontal levee we observed diverse wildlife including ground squirrels otospermophilus beecheyi and other rodents jackrabbits lepus californicus garter snakes thamnophis sirtalis gopher snakes pituophis catenifer and other reptiles amphibians such as the pacific tree frog pseudacris regilla and a wide array of insects along with a large and varied community of birds section s9 of the si these observations are in line with past research suggesting that constructed wetlands provide attractive and productive habitats kadlec and wallace 2009 4 conclusions horizontal levees can achieve significant removal of a wide range of wastewater derived contaminants including nutrients pharmaceuticals and f coliphage while providing other benefits such as high quality habitat and increased shoreline resilience to sea level rise at our field site treatment efficiency was controlled by hydrological conditions which were the strongest predictors for the removal of a wide range of contaminants removed in these systems certain design parameters such as planting regimes and soil texture also affected the total mass of contaminants that can be removed based on their influence over maximum subsurface flow rates additional research is needed to develop an understanding of the mechanisms behind contaminant removal in this system as well as how horizontal levees would function under a variety of additional other design and operational conditions and in more variable climates horizontal levees may also be useful in potable water reuse scenarios which will likely expand in the future currently there are limited options for disposal of waste streams associated with wastewater reuse e g reverse osmosis concentrate streams which tend to have low volumes but high concentrations of salts nutrients and trace organic contaminants horizontal levees could be used to treat these waste streams because our results suggest these systems could handle significantly higher contaminant mass loads than we have studied this application requires testing to ensure that differences in water matrices do not adversely impact treatment capacity such as through stress to microbial or plant communities caused by higher salinity water if successful horizontal levees could continue to be appropriate multi benefit treatment options even throughout dramatic shifts in water and wastewater management

20001,on site wastewater reuse can improve global access to clean water sanitation and hygiene we developed a treatment system aerated bioreactor ultrafiltration membrane granular activated carbon and electrolysis for chlorine disinfection that recycles hand washing and toilet flush water three prototypes were field tested in non sewered areas one in switzerland hand washing and two in south africa hand washing toilet flushing over periods of 63 74 and 94 days respectively we demonstrated that the system is able to recycle sufficient quantities of safe and appealing hand washing and toilet flush water for domestic or public use in real life applications chemical contaminants were effectively removed from the used water in all prototypes removal efficiencies were 99 7 for the chemical oxygen demand cod 98 5 for total nitrogen tn and 99 9 for phosphate in a prototype treating hand washing water and 99 8 for cod 95 7 for tn and 89 6 for phosphate in a prototype treating toilet flush water while this system allowed for true recycling for the same application most on site wastewater reuse systems downcycle the treated water i e reuse it for an application requiring lower water quality an analysis of 18 selected wastewater reuse specifications revealed that at best these guidelines are only partially applicable to innovative recycling systems as they are focused on the downcycling of water to the environment e g use for irrigation we believe that a paradigm shift is necessary and advocate for the implementation of risk based and thus end use dependent system performance targets to

water sanitation and hygiene wash who and unicef 2017 wash challenges are interdependent access to safe water improved sanitation facilities or washing facilities do not independently of one another necessarily lead to improved health eisenberg et al 2007 consequently adequate sanitation facilities should not only protect water sources from contamination but also provide access to improved hygiene in particular hand washing with water and soap has been shown to be at least as important as drinking water quality in reducing the burden of global infectious diseases wagstaff et al 2006 reliable water supplies are also required for flush based sanitation systems which are to this day still what most people aspire to flores 2011 one of the great challenges for the provision of wash services is to provide process and distribute the required water today two thirds of the global population experience severe water scarcity at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 additionally aging infrastructure population growth rapid urbanization and low institutional reliability acutely challenge the practicability of centralized water treatment distribution and evacuation networks in many parts of the world larsen et al 2016 many authorities responsible for providing wash services face the challenge of insufficient freshwater supplies and infrastructure with which to meet their citizens increasing expectations innovative approaches are necessary to provide locally adapted resource efficient solutions the blue diversion autarky project www autarky ch aims to fill this gap by developing decentralized sanitation systems that are safe affordable and aspirational as part of this project we devised a true on site water recycling system called the water wall the system treats and recycles water for applications like hand washing and toilet flushing without the need for external water input the combination of an aerobic bioreactor with ultrafiltration membrane activated carbon filter and electrolysis flow cell provides multiple barriers for chemical and microbial contaminants previously published laboratory studies have demonstrated that the system is capable of removing bacteria nguyen et al 2017 ziemba et al 2019 nutrients ziemba et al 2018 and color künzle et al 2015 from recycled water a range of treatment technologies has been suggested to reuse toilet flush water on site where reuse can imply water recycling water reuse for the same application or water downcycling water reuse for a lower quality application some systems use electrochemical processes to treat the water e g cid et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 sahondo et al 2020 but most systems rely on anaerobic e g bair et al 2015 or aerobic membrane bioreactors e g abegglen et al 2008 fountoulakis et al 2016 ratanatamskul et al 2014 santasmasas et al 2013 many of these systems were capable of partially or completely meeting treatment targets from selected wastewater reuse specifications in real life testing where the water was downcycled but the treated water quality in these systems would not be sufficient for long term true recycling for the same application there is a diversity of regional and national guidelines with a diversity of quality targets for reuse recently risk based frameworks for water reuse have been introduced in the iso 30500 on non sewered sanitation systems and the werf framework for the development of health guidance for decentral water reuse iso 2018 sharvelle et al 2017 in this study we present field testing results for three water wall prototypes that were implemented in selected locations in switzerland and south africa where they provided recycled hand washing and flush water to diverse focus groups the purpose was to show that the water wall system is capable of providing sufficient water that is suitable for the intended use even under highly variable and unpredictable real life usage conditions our approach was to verify that i the chemical composition allows for its repeated use for toilet flushing and hand washing low and stable oxygen demand nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the treated water ii the microbial risk is low no pathogen indicators detected and free residual chlorine in the storage tank and iii the appearance is appealing no color turbidity or suspended solids visible to the human eye 2 methodology 2 1 water wall system the water wall systems fig 1 consisted of two main components the core treatment took place in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 after which the water was polished and disinfected in a clean water tank cwt the bambi contained a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra langgöns germany featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration was provided directly below the membrane module at low aeration rates incomplete mixing and formation of anoxic zones at the bottom of the reactor allow for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification ravndal et al 2015 the bambi was operated in a gravity driven membrane gdm configuration in which the pressure on the membrane is supplied only by the water head peter varbanets et al 2010 active biomass in the bambi responsible for carbon oxidation nitrification and denitrification is partially suspended and partially growing as a biofilm on the membranes as discussed in ravndal et al 2015 long term stable operation does not require systematic sludge wastage and does not require a specific solids retention time greatly simplifying operation during the three field tests described in this paper sludge was never removed from the bambi water that passed through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir 10 cm polyvinyl chloride pipe connected to the membrane module permeate outlet holding volume of 4 l from where it was pumped through a granular activated carbon gac filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston usa to the cwt at regular intervals in the cwt water was recirculated at a rate of 0 5 l min through an 85 cm2 boron doped diamond electrolysis flow cell diaclean 103 waterdiam delémont switzerland operated with polarity reversal the electrolysis treatment produced residual chlorine from the chloride dissolved in the water the target chloride concentration was 200 mg l and chloride was provided through nacl supplementation if necessary from the cwt the water was used for hand washing and toilet flushing or recirculated back to the bambi through an overflow after use the hand washing water was recirculated directly into the bambi by means of gravity or collected in a wastewater tank wwt from where it was pumped into the bambi for treatment the flush water provided from a urine diverting toilet udt save keramik laufen ag laufen switzerland passed through a solids separator separator aquatron västerås sweden before collection in the wwt the water wall was designed as part of a modular system and can be combined with different types of urine or feces treatment technologies three water wall prototypes were tested in the field the main characteristics are summarized in table 1 prototype 1 p1 recycled up to 75 l day of hand washing water prototype 2 p2 recycled up to 500 l day of hand washing water and prototype 3 p3 recycled up to 500 l day of flush water design capacities p1 was initially filled with 65 l of tap water and inoculated with 2 l of activated sludge from a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant in switzerland p2 and p3 were initially filled with 360 l of tap water and inoculated with 10 l of activated sludge from a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant in south africa as the ratios of nutrients to carbon in hand washing water is generally too low for biological treatment the users of p1 and p2 were provided with nutrient supplemented biodegradable soap ziemba et al 2019 the soap composition is detailed in the supplementary information table s1 2 2 testing contexts the hand washing station p1 was tested in a public park in zurich switzerland next to an existing composting toilet and two urinals the site was not connected to the power grid or to a sewer power was provided through a solar panel and a methanol fuel cell efoy pro brunnthal switzerland testing took place over 63 days between may and july 2018 the hand washing station p2 was tested in an informal settlement in durban south africa with approximately 500 households the community relied on communal ablution blocks for access to water and sanitation the hand washing station was located adjacent to the main road with many people passing by the station on the way to or from town electric power was available on site testing took place over 74 days between april and june 2019 p3 was integrated in a toilet system which was tested in a 14 person household in a peri urban zone of durban south africa the prototype was installed next to an existing urine diverting dry toilet uddt that the household owned as part of a municipal cost free basic sanitation program the prototype was tested in a complete toilet system with concurrent testing of the user interface and a urine treatment system developed as part of the autarky project more information on the process www autarky ch feces were collected in a sealed container that was discharged off site into a sewer twice per week testing took place over 94 days between march and june 2019 pictures of the three prototypes are shown in the supplementary information fig s2 all prototypes were removed from the sites after the end of the testing the present paper evaluates the functioning of the water wall system from a technical point of view the field test was closely studied by a team of social scientists users interactions with the system and their acceptance of recycled water for hand washing and toilet flushing is outside the scope of this paper and will be discussed in separate publications 2 3 usage water availability water refill flow rate through the membrane p1 was equipped with a photoelectric sensor ex 10 panasonic kadoma japan that allowed the number of usages to be logged a two day usage count was performed for data validation the usage of p2 was recorded during a two day usage count p3 was equipped with miniature switches behind the flush buttons to count the number of toilet usages these counts were validated through a 14 day self reported survey by the users the water levels in the bambi and cwt were continuously monitored with pressure transducers p1 pmp131 p2 and p3 pmc11 endress hauser reinach switzerland the volume of water to be refilled due to losses from evaporation losses at the tap and losses at the solids urine separation was calculated based on the pressure readings water was refilled around 1x week the flow rate through the membrane was calculated as the ratio between the total cwt volume and the time required to fill the cwt empty to full 2 4 water quality monitoring samples from the cwt were taken bi weekly and analyzed for their chemical composition hygienic quality and appearance for p2 and p3 weekly samples were taken from the wwt and analyzed for the chemical composition all samples were filtered at 0 45 μm nanocolor chromafil membranefilter gf pet 0 45 μm macherey nagel düren germany for sample conservation and stored at 4 c before chemical analysis for p1 dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a total

immediately in the laboratory for p1 e coli was measured according to the us epa method 1603 us epa 2014 for p2 and p3 e coli and total coliforms were enumerated with an enzyme activity test colilert

test kit model co1 hach loveland usa and total suspended solids tss according to the apha standard method apha 2005 2 5 calculation of water recycling rate and organic nutrient removal efficiencies the water recycling rate r c l was defined as the ratio between the used water returning to the system and the total amount of used water including losses 1 r c l v t o t u s a g e v t o t l o s s v t o t u s a g e with v t o t u s a g e total volume of water used for hand washing or toilet flushing and v t o t l o s s total volume of water lost from the system the removal efficiencies of cod tn and phosphate from the water were calculated based on mass balances of the compounds in the system water volume bambi and cwt the total mass m of the compound i cod tn or phosphate in the water corresponds to the product of the concentration c i measured in the cwt and the system water volume v the change of mass of compound i over the field test duration is equal to the difference between the incoming mass m i n i from the used water the outflowing mass m o u t i from water losses and the removal of the compound in the system r e m i degradation and transformations 2 δ m i m i n i m o

wwt and v t o t l o s s total volume of water lost from the system v t o t i n was estimated from the total volume of water used for toilet flushing or hand washing the removal efficiency r e m i for compound i is defined as 3 r e m i r e m i m i n i m i n i m o u t i δ m i m i n i removal efficiencies were not calculated for p1 as the influent load was not known p1 did not include a wwt and the used water entered directly into the bambi 2 6 energy requirements for p1 the energy requirements were continuously logged by the fuel cell p2 and p3 were connected to electric meters energy requirements were corrected for devices that were not part of the treatment system e g monitoring devices 2 7 data analysis data analysis was conducted in r r development core team 2017 and figures were produced using the package ggplot2 wickham 2016 chemical analyses often revealed concentrations below the detection limit of the method used these censored data were analyzed with the package nada lee 2017 average concentrations were computed using regression by maximum likelihood estimation for left censored data assuming a gaussian distribution of the data 3 results 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 usage water availability refill and recycling rate all systems were regularly used despite alternatives being available in the immediate surroundings fig 2 presents the daily number of usages of each prototype average daily usages were 44 usages 22 l for p1 31 5 usages 31 5 l for p2 and 8 usages 48 l for p3 especially in the case of p2 and p3 maximum usage was significantly below the design capacity see table 1 which may have an influence on the performance presented in the subsequent sections we are nevertheless confident that p2 and p3 would have performed well at a usage closer to the capacity based on the experiences with p1 the cwt was usually full in all systems as the tank was continuously refilled and unused water recirculated to the bambi fig 3 water was always available throughout the testing in p1 and p2 in p3 there was sufficient water during regular operation but the cwt was drained on three occasions due to leakages from the toilet cistern days 0 7 and again due to an operational error days 32 34 bambi permeate not pumped into cwt the flows through the membrane were measured at the beginning and at the end of the field tests and did not change over the testing period table 2 the high fill volumes in the cwt were linked to high water flows in p2 and p3 respectively 105 and 122 l h the flow rate in p1 was considerably lower 3 l h a difference remained even when corrected for differences in membrane surface and water pressure in the bambi clearly the flow rate was significantly higher than the water usage for p2 and p3 and a substantial part 98 of the recycled water was directly recirculated back to the bambi for improved energy efficiency a float switch could be implemented in the cwt stopping the flow from the bambi to the cwt when the cwt is full regular water refills were necessary to balance losses due to evaporation water removed on people s hands and accidental losses due to leakages for p3 a substantial amount of water was also lost to the urine diversion of the udt 0 1 l flush unpublished laboratory results and by withdrawal with the solids 0 5 l flush calculated from water refills and usage the weekly refill volumes corrected for accidental losses were 3 5 l week for p1 10 l week for p2 and 50 l week for p3 comparing the total water usage and loss as described in equation 1 the water recycling rates were 98 for p1 supplementary information fig s4 95 for p2 and 85 for p3 fig 4 3 1 2 chemical composition and nutrient removal fig 5 shows the concentrations of doc p1 cod p2 and p3 nitrogen compounds ammonium nitrite and nitrate phosphate and the ph in the cwt in p1 the average doc concentration in the cwt was 2 2 0 7 mgc l the maximum value of 4 6 mgc l on day 14 was due to the loss of 20 l of water around a third of the total water volume caused by an act of vandalism however the system recovered quickly and doc concentrations had already dropped to the long term average by the next day the average ammonium concentration was 0 07 0 25 mgn l with a maximum value of 1 16 mgn l after the water loss nitrite concentrations were consistently below the detection limit 2 mgn l while nitrate concentrations initially increased in p1 and stabilized around 9 mgn l phosphate concentrations decreased from 20 to 8 7 mgp l over the testing period the ph was stable 7 3 0 3 in p2 the average cod concentration was 9 1 10 0 mgo2 l ammonium was on average 0 16 0 35 mgn l with an ammonium spike on day 19 1 3 mgn l caused by the breakdown of the electrolysis recirculation pump nitrite stabilized around the detection limit 0 002 mgn l after an initial increase up to 4 1 mgn l while nitrate concentrations were stable around 9 1 1 8 mgn l phosphate concentrations decreased from 8 4 to 4 2 mgp l the ph was stable 8 0 0 5 in p3 the average cod concentration was 7 5 9 9 mgo2 l the ammonium concentration was on average 0 93 1 89 mgn l with generally increased concentrations after day 63 maximum on day 82 7 75 mgn l these increased concentrations coincided with an observed reduction in the aeration rate after a power outage on day 63 nitrite initially increased up to 16 6 mgn l day 13 after which the concentrations gradually decreased to the detection limit 0 002 mgn l after day 50 however a second strong increase was observed starting on day 63 power outage after which nitrite concentrations remained high up to 20 mgn l nitrate was stable with an average concentration of 24 6 6 8 mgn l only the last measurement indicates a decrease in the nitrate concentration phosphate concentrations stabilized at around 30 mgp l the ph was stable 7 3 0 3 the mass flows and removal efficiencies of cod total nitrogen and phosphate in p2 and p3 were calculated for the entire duration of the field trials fig 4 fig 4 also presents the average concentrations in the wastewater and cwt for p2 cod removal was 99 7 total nitrogen removal 98 5 and phosphate removal 99 9 p3 had 99 8 cod removal 95 7 total nitrogen removal and 89 6 phosphate removal removal from the water included the use of a compound as energy source incorporation into the biomass and precipitation in the system phosphorus in particular was presumably substantially removed through inorganic precipitation this indicates that the removal of precipitates from the system may be necessary in longer term operation in order to ensure a stable system operation mass flows and removal efficiencies could not be calculated for p1 as the influent load was not available 3 1 3 hygiene fig 6 shows the hygienic quality in the cwt in terms of two pathogen indicators e coli and total coliforms and free chlorine concentrations in p1 no e coli were detected during the testing total coliforms not measured residual free chlorine concentrations were slightly below 0 2 mg l minimum concentration at tap proposed by who 2017 during the first three weeks of operation in p1 there were two occasions with no residual chlorine day 12 breakdown of the electrolysis recirculation pump day 14 water loss from vandalism after an increase in the electrolysis operating time day 21 60 90 s on s off to 60 60 s on s off free chlorine concentrations were consistently above 0 2 mg l the average free chlorine concentration was 0 5 mg l hydraulic retention time hrt in the cwt 400 min when electrolysis was working in p2 no e coli were detected during the testing but 2 mpn most probable number 100 ml total coliforms were measured on day 19 free chlorine concentrations were below 0 2 mg l during the first three weeks of operation and on days 63 65 breakdown of the electrolysis recirculation pump after the replacement with a pump generating a higher flux 0 5 l min to 3 l min the average free chlorine concentration was 2 2 mg l hrt 23 min when electrolysis was working in p3 e coli concentrations of 3 1 mpn most probable number 100 ml and 1 mpn 100 ml were measured on days 11 and 14 respectively on day 46 a concentration of 56 5 mpn 100 ml total coliforms was measured free chlorine concentrations were below 0 2 mg l throughout the testing the electrolysis pump broke down on days 36 and 56 and was only replaced 7 and 3 days after the breakdowns respectively the introduction of a pump with a higher flux on day 43 did not increase the chlorine concentration the average free chlorine concentration when electrolysis was working was only 0 05 mg l hrt 20 min we believe the increased total coliforms count on day 46 may be due to contamination during the sampling as there was residual chlorine in the water 0 1 mg l free 0 4 mg l total on that day though microbial regrowth in the system after the prolonged period without electrolysis post treatment cannot be excluded chlorine was produced from chloride dissolved in the water in p1 chloride concentrations were stable at around 120 mg l throughout the testing in p2 and p3 chloride concentrations initially decreased and required balancing through the addition of nacl on average 3 4 g nacl day in p2 and 2 4 g nacl day in p3 resulting in average concentrations of 380 and 180 mg l of chloride in the cwt 3 1 4 appearance the water was evaluated in terms of color turbidity and tss and always appeared clear to the human eye in all field tests color measurement revealed 0 pt co platinum cobalt color scale throughout the testing of p2 and p3 fig 7 turbidity was on average 0 44 0 21 ntu in p2 and 0 37 0 18 ntu in p3 as only low tss were expected after the ultrafiltration membrane tss were measured in only two spot samples revealing a tss of 0 4 mg l in p2 and 1 7 mg l tss in p3 a visual inspection of the residue indicated that tss were due to the passage of gac particles into the cwt 3 1 5 energy requirements the average energy requirements were 0 5 kwh day for p1 and 1 2 kwh day for p2 and p3 taking into account the water production presented in table 2 this corresponded to around 6 9 kwh m3 in p1 low water flux 0 5 kwh m3 in p2 and 0 4 kwh m3 in p3 both high water fluxes as reference the energy requirements for the overall centralized water system for transport and drinking and wastewater treatment is on the order of 1 10 kwh m3 olsson 2015 3 2 comparison with specifications for wastewater reuse table 3 compares the composition of the recycled water with quality requirements for toilet flushing from 18 selected wastewater reuse specifications details in the supplementary information table s5 most requirements related to wastewater reuse for toilet flushing were met in all three field trials only requirements

presents the effluent characteristics and nutrient removal efficiencies in several on site wastewater reuse systems with the exception of rogers et al 2018 all results presented are from field trials from the systems investigated only cid et al 2018 and rogers et al 2018 achieved true recycling blackwater reused for toilet flushing ratanatamskul et al 2014 and sahondo et al 2020 specify water reuse for toilet flushing as a potential application of the system and abegglen et al 2008 reused 35 of the water for toilet flushing and irrigation fountoulakis et al 2016 and santasmasas et al 2013 reused treated greywater for toilet flushing downcycling 5 discussion 5 1 appealing water free of bacterial pathogen indicators but sensitive to failure of electrolysis all prototypes tested in this study were capable of producing sufficient quantities of appealing water throughout the field trials usage of all systems was high through the testing period despite alternatives being available in the immediate surroundings and no concerns were raised by users regarding the quality of the recycled water it hence appears that users deemed the water suitable for hand washing and toilet flushing the laboratory analyses confirm that the water wall systems effectively removed chemical contaminants visual impurities and bacterial pathogen indicators from the used water in real life hand washing and toilet flushing applications the field trials also allowed for the identification of weaknesses and components prone to failure electrolysis for disinfection and to produce a chlorine residual was identified as the most vulnerable process in the treatment chain chlorine concentrations were affected by the following three mechanisms first the failure of components specifically the electrolysis recirculation pump resulted in the depletion of the residual chlorine in the cwt when assembling the prototypes one of the objectives had been to reduce the cost of individual components however these issues highlight the necessary tradeoff between increasing the capital costs of a system with more robust components and increasing the maintenance costs or decreasing the system reliability due to more frequent replacement of system parts second increased concentrations of ammonia and nitrite in the influent to the electrolysis unit impaired the efficacy of the disinfection process over the last four weeks of the field trial reduced nitrification in p3 was observed caused by a reduced aeration rate due to a partial blockage of the aeration tubes after a power outage reduced nitrification resulted in increased nitrite and ammonium concentrations while nitrite and ammonium are not per se a constraint for reuse as flush water as risk of ingestion is minimal both compounds affect the efficacy of the electrolysis post treatment as they react with the residual free chlorine to form nitrate from nitrite and chloramines from ammonium yang and cheng 2007 many developing countries suffer from severe electricity deficits seetharam et al 2013 our field trials revealed that power cuts might have a long term impact on the water quality a backup power supply system for instance with solar panels and batteries would increase system robustness but is associated with increased capital costs again we believe there is need for a detailed tradeoff analysis for the specific setting for instance low maintenance may be more critical in a household than in a public setting possibly with several water wall systems where maintenance personnel can be available on site more frequently third there was a need for chloride supplementation in p2 and p3 by adding nacl to ensure stable chlorine production from chloride this had not been expected as chloride additions from soap people s hands and urine contamination had balanced the chlorine losses due to volatilization in previous testing while the supplemental chloride can be added through the soap in the case of hand washing water p2 the need for chloride supplementation is a disadvantage for systems recycling flush water p3 that would otherwise not have required any additives there are two approaches for ensuring hygiene with these described potential failure modes process simplification or increased monitoring capability i electrolysis could be replaced by the addition of slow dissolving chlorine tabs rather than the addition of nacl for on site chlorine production making chlorination independent of the availability of power previous research indicates that electrolysis treatment does not yield lower cell counts than direct chlorination ziemba et al 2019 implying that direct chlorine addition disinfects the water as effectively as electrolysis treatment there would however be the drawback of reliance on supply chains and maintenance though this is true of any spare parts or consumables ii more advanced monitoring of unit processes and residual chlorine to provide real time information on water safety would prevent the use of potentially compromised water online monitoring cannot prevent all forms of process failures but it can shut off the system in case a problem is detected while the water wall uses high tech components the system was designed with robust operation and low maintenance requirements in mind the aerobic bioreactor was operated without the need for sludge wastage the ultrafiltration membranes produced a stable flux without the need for shear cleaning or backwashing the gac filter did not require replacement the electrolysis unit was operated with simple timer control and polarity reversal to prevent scaling out of these four barriers for chemical and microbial contaminants only the electrolysis was prone to failure 5 2 true water recycling possible due to source separation of urine and feces the reuse applications of recycled wastewater depend on the water quality that can be achieved true recycling for toilet flushing is not yet well established and most systems in table 2 downcycled the water likely in part because of the yuck factor smith et al 2018 or diluted the treated water with freshwater which can allow repeated reuse whilst minimizing nutrient build up in the system in cid et al 2018 and rogers et al 2018 the blackwater recycling systems experienced high nutrient concentrations in the treated water with cod concentrations over 900 mg l and ammonia concentrations over 100 mg l non biological treatment processes generally struggle to meet nutrient removal targets e g 80 phosphorus removal in iso 30500 without the use of chemical or biological additives trotochaud et al 2019 in contrast the prototypes tested as part of the current study all produced recycled water with low and stable organic carbon and nutrient concentrations avoiding the accumulation of nitrogen in the recycling of toilet flush water p3 was due to nitrification and denitrification in the bambi and due to the fact that the major part of the urine was separated at the source source separation of urine limited the amount of nitrogen entering the system and generated cod n ratios suitable for denitrification if all the urine and fecal matter had entered the flush water this would have resulted in a cod n ratio in the order of 3 1 however a minimum cod n ratio of 7 6 1 has been reported as necessary for full denitrification sobieszuk and szewczyk 2006 similarly phosphorus concentrations would have increased had major parts of the feces not been diverted the separation of urine and feces from the water also led to considerably reduced energy requirements compared to cid et al 2018 sahondo et al 2020 and even compared to centralized systems olsson 2015 besides the efficient recovery of the water the implementation of source separation also enables the recovery and reuse of nutrients from feces and urine larsen et al 2009 zeeman and kujawa roeleveld 2011 we believe that separating water urine and feces is a vital requirement for flush water recycling allowing for an optimized recovery of resources from each stream 5 3 wastewater reuse specifications should be risk based the required level of treatment and treatment targets should be linked to the intended reuse application as health risks associated with wastewater reuse depend on likely contact pathways today many specifications on non potable wastewater reuse do not differentiate between specific reuse applications the category unrestricted urban reuse used by us epa 2012 for instance may comprise landscape irrigation as well as toilet flushing only the iso standard 30 500 explicitly mentions hand washing as a potential application of recycled water iso 2018 but does not provide specific targets and instead refers to the world health organization guidelines for drinking water who 2017 because true recycling for high quality applications is not yet well established many wastewater reuse specifications target applications where the water is downcycled and ultimately released into the environment e g irrigation many quality requirements from such specifications are however unsuitable for true recycling applications where there is no discharge for instance the water wall systems did not meet the requirements on maximum chloride concentrations table s4 presumably to protect receiving water bodies although elevated chloride concentrations are necessary for chlorine production in this technology from our perspective specifications should clearly differentiate between downcycling and recycling wastewater reuse systems as the latter do not need to account for ecosystem impacts especially for applications involving close personal contact with the water like the water wall system the effective protection of human health is essential we see two limitations in the evaluation of hygiene presented in this paper 1 today many specifications assess the microbial quality of the treated water in terms of bacterial fecal contamination and require monitoring of indicators like e coli or total coliforms table s4 the water wall met the criteria of safety for fecal bacterial contamination but this approach may be insufficient due to i limited fecal contamination in the source water in p1 and p2 hand washing water and ii microbial risk that may be linked to regrowth during storage rather than incomplete retention in membrane bioreactors most bacteria are retained by the membrane 6 log for ultrafiltration sharvelle et al 2017 but there can be regrowth of bacteria in the cwt in the absence of residual chlorine nguyen et al 2017 we thus have doubts regarding the appropriateness of fecal bacteria as the main indicator of hygiene in hand washing systems and more generally in systems that rely on ultrafiltration processes for such systems we need to identify appropriate indicators for hand washing water and for regrowth in the stored water in systems with final disinfection like the water wall it may also be appropriate to measure disinfectant concentrations e g residual chlorine if the required doses for the inactivation of the system relevant indicator organisms have been established 2 despite their relevance for public health many wastewater reuse specifications do not define virus related quality requirements for instance only 2 out of 10 guidelines for unrestricted urban reuse in the united states include virus removal rates prescribed by the treatment requirements tables 4 7 us epa 2012 the ultrafiltration membrane used in the water wall with a molecular weight cutoff of 150 kda cannot guarantee sufficient virus retention log removal 0 5 for the bacteriophage ms2 unpublished results their inactivation is thus dependent on the final disinfection with chlorine which emerged as the most vulnerable treatment step during the field tests monitoring viruses is thus highly relevant for membrane systems like the water wall it is possible to define virus related indicators and many studies have proposed the use of native coliphages bacteriophages that infect e coli as indicators of enteric viruses zhang and farahbakhsh 2007 however there is limited practical experience with virus monitoring in real life implementations of on site wastewater reuse systems another strategy is to evaluate virus removal by spiking known amounts of virus surrogates into the system which is required by some wastewater reuse specifications most commonly bacteriophage ms2 see table s4 future research should focus on assessing to what degree viral indicators versus virus challenge studies are useful in assessing safety of water reuse for non potable purposes e g hand washing overall we believe there is a need for a paradigm shift from one fits all wastewater reuse specifications that do not differentiate between types of water sources and end uses to more flexible approaches enabling a pragmatic development of water recycling systems that ensure the reliable delivery of safe water for a specific context the werf report by sharvelle et al 2017 has made an important step towards the implementation of risk based and thus context based performance targets by publishing a framework for the development of public health guidance for decentralized water reuse systems such a framework for water quality targets and technology choices needs to be coupled with an organization maintenance and monitoring approach that ensures system performance there is a need for adequate online measurements that are reliable effective and correlated with system performance to protect public health future research on on site wastewater reuse needs to focus on the identification and evaluation of such monitoring devices thus allowing for direct intervention in case of treatment failure 6 conclusions the field trials of water wall prototypes in switzerland and south africa show that the system effectively removes chemical contaminants visual impurities and pathogen indicators from the used water low and stable doc cod nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the treated water allowed for true recycling of the water which distinguishes the water wall systems from comparable wastewater reuse systems that mostly downcycle the water when treating flush water removal of nutrients to ensure true recycling water quality was possible due to reduced influent contaminant concentrations as the urine and the major part of the particles had been separated before the treatment throughout the testing the prototypes were capable of providing sufficient quantities of flush and hand washing water where systems were evaluated at different scales in varied geographical contexts and in public and private applications usage of all systems was frequent despite alternatives being available in the immediate surroundings overall our results from real life applications show that the technology is ready to move forward towards a larger scale implementation of prototypes under the lead of an entity that would be specialized in the detailed engineering construction and marketing of such systems to ensure effective protection of human health

20001,on site wastewater reuse can improve global access to clean water sanitation and hygiene we developed a treatment system aerated bioreactor ultrafiltration membrane granular activated carbon and electrolysis for chlorine disinfection that recycles hand washing and toilet flush water three prototypes were field tested in non sewered areas one in switzerland hand washing and two in south africa hand washing toilet flushing over periods of 63 74 and 94 days respectively we demonstrated that the system is able to recycle sufficient quantities of safe and appealing hand washing and toilet flush water for domestic or public use in real life applications chemical contaminants were effectively removed from the used water in all prototypes removal efficiencies were 99 7 for the chemical oxygen demand cod 98 5 for total nitrogen tn and 99 9 for phosphate in a prototype treating hand washing water and 99 8 for cod 95 7 for tn and 89 6 for phosphate in a prototype treating toilet flush water while this system allowed for true recycling for the same application most on site wastewater reuse systems downcycle the treated water i e reuse it for an application requiring lower water quality an analysis of 18 selected wastewater reuse specifications revealed that at best these guidelines are only partially applicable to innovative recycling systems as they are focused on the downcycling of water to the environment e g use for irrigation we believe that a paradigm shift is necessary and advocate for the implementation of risk based and thus end use dependent system performance targets to

water sanitation and hygiene wash who and unicef 2017 wash challenges are interdependent access to safe water improved sanitation facilities or washing facilities do not independently of one another necessarily lead to improved health eisenberg et al 2007 consequently adequate sanitation facilities should not only protect water sources from contamination but also provide access to improved hygiene in particular hand washing with water and soap has been shown to be at least as important as drinking water quality in reducing the burden of global infectious diseases wagstaff et al 2006 reliable water supplies are also required for flush based sanitation systems which are to this day still what most people aspire to flores 2011 one of the great challenges for the provision of wash services is to provide process and distribute the required water today two thirds of the global population experience severe water scarcity at least one month per year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 additionally aging infrastructure population growth rapid urbanization and low institutional reliability acutely challenge the practicability of centralized water treatment distribution and evacuation networks in many parts of the world larsen et al 2016 many authorities responsible for providing wash services face the challenge of insufficient freshwater supplies and infrastructure with which to meet their citizens increasing expectations innovative approaches are necessary to provide locally adapted resource efficient solutions the blue diversion autarky project www autarky ch aims to fill this gap by developing decentralized sanitation systems that are safe affordable and aspirational as part of this project we devised a true on site water recycling system called the water wall the system treats and recycles water for applications like hand washing and toilet flushing without the need for external water input the combination of an aerobic bioreactor with ultrafiltration membrane activated carbon filter and electrolysis flow cell provides multiple barriers for chemical and microbial contaminants previously published laboratory studies have demonstrated that the system is capable of removing bacteria nguyen et al 2017 ziemba et al 2019 nutrients ziemba et al 2018 and color künzle et al 2015 from recycled water a range of treatment technologies has been suggested to reuse toilet flush water on site where reuse can imply water recycling water reuse for the same application or water downcycling water reuse for a lower quality application some systems use electrochemical processes to treat the water e g cid et al 2018 rogers et al 2018 sahondo et al 2020 but most systems rely on anaerobic e g bair et al 2015 or aerobic membrane bioreactors e g abegglen et al 2008 fountoulakis et al 2016 ratanatamskul et al 2014 santasmasas et al 2013 many of these systems were capable of partially or completely meeting treatment targets from selected wastewater reuse specifications in real life testing where the water was downcycled but the treated water quality in these systems would not be sufficient for long term true recycling for the same application there is a diversity of regional and national guidelines with a diversity of quality targets for reuse recently risk based frameworks for water reuse have been introduced in the iso 30500 on non sewered sanitation systems and the werf framework for the development of health guidance for decentral water reuse iso 2018 sharvelle et al 2017 in this study we present field testing results for three water wall prototypes that were implemented in selected locations in switzerland and south africa where they provided recycled hand washing and flush water to diverse focus groups the purpose was to show that the water wall system is capable of providing sufficient water that is suitable for the intended use even under highly variable and unpredictable real life usage conditions our approach was to verify that i the chemical composition allows for its repeated use for toilet flushing and hand washing low and stable oxygen demand nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the treated water ii the microbial risk is low no pathogen indicators detected and free residual chlorine in the storage tank and iii the appearance is appealing no color turbidity or suspended solids visible to the human eye 2 methodology 2 1 water wall system the water wall systems fig 1 consisted of two main components the core treatment took place in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 after which the water was polished and disinfected in a clean water tank cwt the bambi contained a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra langgöns germany featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration was provided directly below the membrane module at low aeration rates incomplete mixing and formation of anoxic zones at the bottom of the reactor allow for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification ravndal et al 2015 the bambi was operated in a gravity driven membrane gdm configuration in which the pressure on the membrane is supplied only by the water head peter varbanets et al 2010 active biomass in the bambi responsible for carbon oxidation nitrification and denitrification is partially suspended and partially growing as a biofilm on the membranes as discussed in ravndal et al 2015 long term stable operation does not require systematic sludge wastage and does not require a specific solids retention time greatly simplifying operation during the three field tests described in this paper sludge was never removed from the bambi water that passed through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir 10 cm polyvinyl chloride pipe connected to the membrane module permeate outlet holding volume of 4 l from where it was pumped through a granular activated carbon gac filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston usa to the cwt at regular intervals in the cwt water was recirculated at a rate of 0 5 l min through an 85 cm2 boron doped diamond electrolysis flow cell diaclean 103 waterdiam delémont switzerland operated with polarity reversal the electrolysis treatment produced residual chlorine from the chloride dissolved in the water the target chloride concentration was 200 mg l and chloride was provided through nacl supplementation if necessary from the cwt the water was used for hand washing and toilet flushing or recirculated back to the bambi through an overflow after use the hand washing water was recirculated directly into the bambi by means of gravity or collected in a wastewater tank wwt from where it was pumped into the bambi for treatment the flush water provided from a urine diverting toilet udt save keramik laufen ag laufen switzerland passed through a solids separator separator aquatron västerås sweden before collection in the wwt the water wall was designed as part of a modular system and can be combined with different types of urine or feces treatment technologies three water wall prototypes were tested in the field the main characteristics are summarized in table 1 prototype 1 p1 recycled up to 75 l day of hand washing water prototype 2 p2 recycled up to 500 l day of hand washing water and prototype 3 p3 recycled up to 500 l day of flush water design capacities p1 was initially filled with 65 l of tap water and inoculated with 2 l of activated sludge from a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant in switzerland p2 and p3 were initially filled with 360 l of tap water and inoculated with 10 l of activated sludge from a conventional activated sludge wastewater treatment plant in south africa as the ratios of nutrients to carbon in hand washing water is generally too low for biological treatment the users of p1 and p2 were provided with nutrient supplemented biodegradable soap ziemba et al 2019 the soap composition is detailed in the supplementary information table s1 2 2 testing contexts the hand washing station p1 was tested in a public park in zurich switzerland next to an existing composting toilet and two urinals the site was not connected to the power grid or to a sewer power was provided through a solar panel and a methanol fuel cell efoy pro brunnthal switzerland testing took place over 63 days between may and july 2018 the hand washing station p2 was tested in an informal settlement in durban south africa with approximately 500 households the community relied on communal ablution blocks for access to water and sanitation the hand washing station was located adjacent to the main road with many people passing by the station on the way to or from town electric power was available on site testing took place over 74 days between april and june 2019 p3 was integrated in a toilet system which was tested in a 14 person household in a peri urban zone of durban south africa the prototype was installed next to an existing urine diverting dry toilet uddt that the household owned as part of a municipal cost free basic sanitation program the prototype was tested in a complete toilet system with concurrent testing of the user interface and a urine treatment system developed as part of the autarky project more information on the process www autarky ch feces were collected in a sealed container that was discharged off site into a sewer twice per week testing took place over 94 days between march and june 2019 pictures of the three prototypes are shown in the supplementary information fig s2 all prototypes were removed from the sites after the end of the testing the present paper evaluates the functioning of the water wall system from a technical point of view the field test was closely studied by a team of social scientists users interactions with the system and their acceptance of recycled water for hand washing and toilet flushing is outside the scope of this paper and will be discussed in separate publications 2 3 usage water availability water refill flow rate through the membrane p1 was equipped with a photoelectric sensor ex 10 panasonic kadoma japan that allowed the number of usages to be logged a two day usage count was performed for data validation the usage of p2 was recorded during a two day usage count p3 was equipped with miniature switches behind the flush buttons to count the number of toilet usages these counts were validated through a 14 day self reported survey by the users the water levels in the bambi and cwt were continuously monitored with pressure transducers p1 pmp131 p2 and p3 pmc11 endress hauser reinach switzerland the volume of water to be refilled due to losses from evaporation losses at the tap and losses at the solids urine separation was calculated based on the pressure readings water was refilled around 1x week the flow rate through the membrane was calculated as the ratio between the total cwt volume and the time required to fill the cwt empty to full 2 4 water quality monitoring samples from the cwt were taken bi weekly and analyzed for their chemical composition hygienic quality and appearance for p2 and p3 weekly samples were taken from the wwt and analyzed for the chemical composition all samples were filtered at 0 45 μm nanocolor

test kit model co1 hach loveland usa and total suspended solids tss according to the apha standard method apha 2005 2 5 calculation of water recycling rate and organic nutrient removal efficiencies the water recycling rate r c l was defined as the ratio between the used water returning to the system and the total amount of used water including losses 1 r c l v t o t u s a g e v t o t l o s s v t

corresponds to the product of the concentration c i measured in the cwt and the system water volume v the change of mass of compound i over the field test duration is equal to the difference between

used water entered directly into the bambi 2 6 energy requirements for p1 the energy requirements were continuously logged by the fuel cell p2 and p3 were connected to electric meters energy requirements were corrected for devices that were not part of the treatment system e g monitoring devices 2 7 data analysis data analysis was conducted in r r development core team 2017 and figures were produced using the package ggplot2 wickham 2016 chemical analyses often revealed concentrations below the detection limit of the method used these censored data were analyzed with the package nada lee 2017 average concentrations were computed using regression by maximum likelihood estimation for left censored data assuming a gaussian distribution of the data 3 results 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 usage water availability refill and recycling rate all systems were regularly used despite alternatives being available in the immediate surroundings fig 2 presents the daily number of usages of each prototype average daily usages were 44 usages 22 l for p1 31 5 usages 31 5 l for p2 and 8 usages 48 l for p3 especially in the case of p2 and p3 maximum usage was significantly below the design capacity see table 1 which may have an influence on the performance presented in the subsequent sections we are nevertheless confident that p2 and p3 would have performed well at a usage closer to the capacity based on the experiences with p1 the cwt was usually full in all systems as the tank was continuously refilled and unused water recirculated to the bambi fig 3 water was always available throughout the testing in p1 and p2 in p3 there was sufficient water during regular operation but the cwt was drained on three occasions due to leakages from the toilet cistern days 0 7 and again due to an operational error days 32 34 bambi permeate not pumped into cwt the flows through the membrane were measured at the beginning and at the end of the field tests and did not change over the testing period table 2 the high fill volumes in the cwt were linked to high water flows in p2 and p3 respectively 105 and 122 l h the flow rate in p1 was considerably lower 3 l h a difference remained even when corrected for differences in membrane surface and water pressure in the bambi clearly the flow rate was significantly higher than the water usage for p2 and p3 and a substantial part 98 of the recycled water was directly recirculated back to the bambi for improved energy efficiency a float switch could be implemented in the cwt stopping the flow from the bambi to the cwt when the cwt is full regular water refills were necessary to balance losses due to evaporation water removed on people s hands and accidental losses due to leakages for p3 a substantial amount of water was also lost to the urine diversion of the udt 0 1 l flush unpublished laboratory results and by withdrawal with the solids 0 5 l flush calculated from water refills and usage the weekly refill volumes corrected for accidental losses were 3 5 l week for p1 10 l week for p2 and 50 l week for p3 comparing the total water usage and loss as described in equation 1 the water recycling rates were 98 for

nitrite and nitrate phosphate and the ph in the cwt in p1 the average doc concentration in the cwt was 2 2 0 7 mgc l the maximum value of 4 6 mgc l on day 14 was due to the loss of 20 l of water

average ammonium concentration was 0 07 0 25 mgn l with a maximum value of 1 16 mgn l after the water loss nitrite concentrations were consistently below the detection limit 2 mgn l while nitrate concentrations initially increased in p1 and stabilized around 9 mgn l phosphate concentrations decreased from 20 to 8 7 mgp l over the testing period the ph was stable 7 3 0 3 in p2 the average cod concentration was 9 1 10 0 mgo2 l ammonium was on average 0 16 0 35 mgn l with an ammonium spike on day 19 1 3 mgn l caused by the breakdown of the electrolysis recirculation pump nitrite stabilized around the detection limit 0 002 mgn l after an initial increase up to 4 1 mgn l while nitrate concentrations were stable around 9 1 1 8 mgn l phosphate concentrations decreased from 8 4 to 4 2 mgp l the ph was stable 8 0 0 5 in p3 the average cod concentration was 7 5 9 9 mgo2 l the ammonium concentration was on average 0 93 1 89 mgn l with generally increased concentrations after day 63 maximum on day 82 7 75 mgn l these increased concentrations coincided with an observed reduction in the aeration rate after a power outage on day 63 nitrite initially increased up to 16 6 mgn l day 13 after which the concentrations gradually decreased to the detection limit 0 002 mgn l after day 50 however a second strong increase was observed starting on day 63 power outage after which nitrite concentrations remained high up to 20 mgn l nitrate was stable with an average concentration of 24 6 6 8 mgn l only the last measurement indicates a decrease in the nitrate concentration phosphate concentrations stabilized at around 30 mgp l the ph was stable 7 3 0 3 the mass flows and removal efficiencies of cod total nitrogen and phosphate in p2 and p3 were calculated for the entire duration of the field trials fig 4 fig 4 also presents the average concentrations in the wastewater and cwt for p2 cod removal was 99 7 total nitrogen removal 98 5 and phosphate removal 99 9 p3 had 99 8 cod removal 95 7 total nitrogen removal and 89 6 phosphate removal removal from the water included the use of a compound as energy source incorporation into the biomass and precipitation in the system phosphorus in particular was presumably substantially removed through inorganic precipitation this indicates that the removal of precipitates from the system may be necessary in longer term operation in order to ensure a stable system operation mass flows and removal efficiencies could not be calculated for p1 as the influent load was not available 3 1 3 hygiene fig 6 shows the hygienic quality in the cwt in terms of two pathogen indicators e coli and total coliforms and free chlorine concentrations in p1 no e coli were detected during the testing total coliforms not measured residual free chlorine concentrations were slightly below 0 2 mg l minimum concentration at tap proposed by who 2017 during the first three weeks of operation in p1 there were two occasions with no residual chlorine day 12 breakdown of the electrolysis recirculation pump day 14 water loss from vandalism after an increase in the electrolysis operating time day 21 60 90 s on s off to 60 60 s on s off free chlorine concentrations were consistently above 0 2 mg l the average free chlorine concentration was 0 5 mg l hydraulic retention time hrt in the cwt 400 min when electrolysis was working in p2 no e coli were detected during the testing but 2 mpn most probable number 100 ml total coliforms were measured on day 19 free chlorine concentrations were below 0 2 mg l during the first three weeks of operation and on days 63 65 breakdown of the electrolysis recirculation pump after the replacement with a pump generating a higher flux 0 5 l min to 3 l min the average free chlorine concentration was 2 2 mg l hrt 23 min when electrolysis was working in p3 e coli concentrations of 3 1 mpn most probable number 100 ml and 1 mpn 100 ml were measured on days 11 and 14 respectively on day 46 a concentration of 56 5 mpn 100 ml total coliforms was measured free chlorine concentrations were below 0 2 mg l throughout the testing the electrolysis pump broke down on days 36 and 56 and was only replaced 7 and 3 days after the breakdowns respectively the introduction of a pump with a higher flux on day 43 did not increase the chlorine concentration the average free chlorine concentration when electrolysis was working was only 0 05 mg l hrt 20 min we believe the increased total coliforms count on day 46 may be due to contamination during the sampling as there was residual chlorine in the water 0 1 mg l free 0 4 mg l total on that day though microbial regrowth in the system after the prolonged period without electrolysis post treatment cannot be excluded chlorine was produced from chloride dissolved in the water in p1 chloride concentrations were stable at around 120 mg l throughout the testing in p2 and p3 chloride concentrations initially decreased and required balancing through the addition of nacl on average 3 4 g nacl day in p2 and 2 4 g nacl day in p3 resulting in average concentrations of 380 and 180 mg l of chloride in the cwt 3 1 4 appearance the water was evaluated in terms of color turbidity and tss and always appeared clear to the human eye in all field tests color measurement revealed 0 pt co platinum cobalt color scale throughout the testing of p2 and p3 fig 7 turbidity was on average 0 44 0 21 ntu in p2 and 0 37 0 18 ntu in p3 as only low tss were expected after the ultrafiltration membrane tss were measured in only two spot samples revealing a tss of 0 4 mg l in p2 and 1 7 mg l tss in p3 a visual inspection of the residue indicated that tss were due to the passage of gac particles into the cwt 3 1 5 energy requirements the average energy requirements were 0 5 kwh day for p1 and 1 2 kwh day for p2 and p3 taking into account the water production presented in table 2 this corresponded to around 6 9 kwh m3 in p1 low water flux 0 5 kwh m3 in p2 and 0 4 kwh m3 in p3 both high water fluxes as reference the energy requirements for the overall centralized water system for transport and drinking and wastewater treatment is on the order of 1 10 kwh m3 olsson 2015 3 2 comparison with specifications for wastewater reuse table 3 compares the composition of the recycled water with quality requirements for toilet flushing from 18 selected wastewater reuse specifications details in the supplementary information table s5 most requirements related to wastewater reuse for toilet flushing were met in all three field trials only requirements on chlorine p1 p2 and p3 and ammonium p3 were mostly not met total phosphorus requirements were partially met p1 p2 and p3 3 3 performance compared to other on site wastewater reuse systems table 4 presents the effluent characteristics and nutrient removal efficiencies in several on site wastewater reuse systems with the exception of rogers et al 2018 all results presented are from field trials from the systems investigated only cid et al 2018 and rogers et al 2018 achieved true recycling blackwater reused for toilet flushing ratanatamskul et al 2014 and sahondo et al 2020 specify water reuse for toilet flushing as a potential application of the system and abegglen et al 2008 reused 35 of the water for toilet flushing and irrigation fountoulakis et al 2016 and santasmasas et al 2013 reused treated greywater for toilet flushing downcycling 5 discussion 5 1 appealing water free of bacterial pathogen indicators but sensitive to failure of electrolysis all prototypes tested in this study were capable of producing sufficient quantities of appealing water throughout the field trials usage of all systems was high through the testing period despite alternatives being available in the immediate surroundings and no concerns were raised by users regarding the quality of the recycled water it hence appears that users deemed the water suitable for hand washing and toilet flushing the laboratory analyses confirm that the water wall systems effectively removed chemical contaminants visual impurities and bacterial pathogen indicators from the used water in real life hand washing and toilet flushing applications the field trials also allowed for the identification of weaknesses and components prone to failure electrolysis for disinfection and to produce a chlorine residual was identified as the most vulnerable process in the treatment chain chlorine concentrations were affected by the following three mechanisms first the failure of components specifically the electrolysis recirculation pump resulted in the depletion of the residual chlorine in the cwt when assembling the prototypes one of the objectives had been to reduce the cost of individual components however these issues highlight the necessary tradeoff between increasing the capital costs of a system with more robust components and increasing the maintenance costs or decreasing the system reliability due to more frequent replacement of system parts second increased concentrations of ammonia and nitrite in the influent to the electrolysis unit impaired the efficacy of the disinfection process over the last four weeks of the field trial reduced nitrification in p3 was observed caused by a reduced aeration rate due to a partial blockage of the aeration tubes after a power outage reduced nitrification resulted in increased nitrite and ammonium concentrations while nitrite and ammonium are not per se a constraint for reuse as flush water as risk of ingestion is minimal both compounds affect the efficacy of the electrolysis post treatment as they react with the residual free chlorine to form nitrate from nitrite and chloramines from ammonium yang and cheng 2007 many developing countries suffer from severe electricity deficits seetharam et al 2013 our field trials revealed that power cuts might have a long term impact on the water quality a backup power supply system for instance with solar panels and batteries would increase system robustness but is associated with increased capital costs again we believe there is need for a detailed tradeoff analysis for the specific setting for instance low maintenance may be more critical in a household than in a public setting possibly with several water wall systems where maintenance personnel can be available on site more frequently third there was a need for chloride supplementation in p2 and p3 by adding nacl to ensure stable chlorine production from chloride this had not been expected as chloride additions from soap people s hands and urine contamination had balanced the chlorine losses due to volatilization in previous testing while the supplemental chloride can be added through the soap in the case of hand washing water p2 the need for chloride supplementation is a disadvantage for systems recycling flush water p3 that would otherwise not have required any additives there are two approaches for ensuring hygiene with these described potential failure modes process simplification or increased monitoring capability i electrolysis could be replaced by the addition of slow dissolving chlorine tabs rather than the addition of nacl for on site chlorine production making chlorination independent of the availability of power previous research indicates that electrolysis treatment does not yield lower cell counts than direct chlorination ziemba et al 2019 implying that direct chlorine addition disinfects the water as effectively as electrolysis treatment there would however be the drawback of reliance on supply chains and maintenance though this is true of any spare parts or consumables ii more advanced monitoring of unit processes and residual chlorine to provide real time information on water safety would prevent the use of potentially compromised water online monitoring cannot prevent all forms of process failures but it can shut off the system in case a problem is detected while the water wall uses high tech components the system was designed with robust operation and low maintenance requirements in mind the aerobic bioreactor was operated without the need for sludge wastage the ultrafiltration membranes produced a stable flux without the need for shear cleaning or backwashing the gac filter did not require replacement the electrolysis unit was operated with simple timer control and polarity reversal to prevent scaling out of these four barriers for chemical and microbial contaminants only the electrolysis was prone to failure 5 2 true water recycling possible due to source separation of urine and feces the reuse applications of recycled wastewater depend on the water quality that can be achieved true recycling for toilet flushing is not yet well established and most systems in table 2 downcycled the water likely in part because of the yuck factor smith et al 2018 or diluted the treated water with freshwater which can allow repeated reuse whilst minimizing nutrient build up in the system in cid et al 2018 and rogers et al 2018 the blackwater recycling systems experienced high nutrient concentrations in the treated water with cod concentrations over 900 mg l and ammonia concentrations over 100 mg l non biological treatment processes generally struggle to meet nutrient removal targets e g 80 phosphorus removal in iso 30500 without the use of chemical or biological additives trotochaud et al 2019 in contrast the prototypes tested as part of the current study all produced recycled water with low and stable organic carbon and nutrient concentrations avoiding the accumulation of nitrogen in the recycling of toilet flush water p3 was due to nitrification and denitrification in the bambi and due to the fact that the major part of the urine was separated at the source source separation of urine limited the amount of nitrogen entering the system and generated cod n ratios suitable for denitrification if all the urine and fecal matter had entered the flush water this would have resulted in a cod n ratio in the order of 3 1 however a minimum cod n ratio of 7 6 1 has been reported as necessary for full denitrification sobieszuk and szewczyk 2006 similarly phosphorus concentrations would have increased had major parts of the feces not been diverted the separation of urine and feces from the water also led to considerably reduced energy requirements compared to cid et al 2018 sahondo et al 2020 and even compared to centralized systems olsson 2015 besides the efficient recovery of the water the implementation of source separation also enables the recovery and reuse of nutrients from feces and urine larsen et al 2009 zeeman and kujawa roeleveld 2011 we believe that separating water urine and feces is a vital requirement for flush water recycling allowing for an optimized recovery of resources from each stream 5 3 wastewater reuse specifications should be risk based the required level of treatment and treatment targets should be linked to the intended reuse application as health risks associated with wastewater reuse depend on likely contact pathways today many specifications on non potable wastewater reuse do not differentiate between specific reuse applications the category unrestricted urban reuse used by us epa 2012 for instance may comprise landscape irrigation as well as toilet flushing only the iso standard 30 500 explicitly mentions hand washing as a potential application of recycled water iso 2018 but does not provide specific targets and instead refers to the world health organization guidelines for drinking water who 2017 because true recycling for high quality applications is not yet well established many wastewater reuse specifications target applications where the water is downcycled and ultimately released into the environment e g irrigation many quality requirements from such specifications are however unsuitable for true recycling applications where there is no discharge for instance the water wall systems did not meet the requirements on maximum chloride concentrations table s4 presumably to protect receiving water bodies although elevated chloride concentrations are necessary for chlorine production in this technology from our perspective specifications should clearly differentiate between downcycling and recycling wastewater reuse systems as the latter do not need to account for ecosystem impacts especially for applications involving close personal contact with the water like the water wall system the effective protection of human health is essential we see two limitations in the evaluation of hygiene presented in this paper 1 today many specifications assess the microbial quality of the treated water in terms of bacterial fecal contamination and require monitoring of indicators like e coli or total coliforms table s4 the water wall met the criteria of safety for fecal bacterial contamination but this approach may be insufficient due to i limited fecal contamination in the source water in p1 and p2 hand washing water and ii microbial risk that may be linked to regrowth during storage rather than incomplete retention in membrane bioreactors most bacteria are retained by the membrane 6 log for ultrafiltration sharvelle et al 2017 but there can be regrowth of bacteria in the cwt in the absence of residual chlorine nguyen et al 2017 we thus have doubts regarding the appropriateness of fecal bacteria as the main indicator of hygiene in hand washing systems and more generally in systems that rely on ultrafiltration processes for such systems we need to identify appropriate indicators for hand washing water and for regrowth in the stored water in systems with final disinfection like the water wall it may also be appropriate to measure disinfectant concentrations e g residual chlorine if the required doses for the inactivation of the system relevant indicator organisms have been established 2 despite their relevance for public health many wastewater reuse specifications do not define virus related quality requirements for instance only 2 out of 10 guidelines for unrestricted urban reuse in the united states include virus removal rates prescribed by the treatment requirements tables 4 7 us epa 2012 the ultrafiltration membrane used in the water wall with a molecular weight cutoff of 150 kda cannot guarantee sufficient virus retention log removal 0 5 for the bacteriophage ms2 unpublished results their inactivation is thus dependent on the final disinfection with chlorine which emerged as the most vulnerable treatment step during the field tests monitoring viruses is thus highly relevant for membrane systems like the water wall it is possible to define virus related indicators and many studies have proposed the use of native coliphages bacteriophages that infect e coli as indicators of enteric viruses zhang and farahbakhsh 2007 however there is limited practical experience with virus monitoring in real life implementations of on site wastewater reuse systems another strategy is to evaluate virus removal by spiking known amounts of virus surrogates into the system which is required by some wastewater reuse specifications most commonly bacteriophage ms2 see table s4 future research should focus on assessing to what degree viral indicators versus virus challenge studies are useful in assessing safety of water reuse for non potable purposes e g hand washing overall we believe there is a need for a paradigm shift from one fits all wastewater reuse specifications that do not differentiate between types of water sources and end uses to more flexible approaches enabling a pragmatic development of water recycling systems that ensure the reliable delivery of safe water for a specific context the werf report by sharvelle et al 2017 has made an important step towards the implementation of risk based and thus context based performance targets by publishing a framework for the development of public health guidance for decentralized water reuse systems such a framework for water quality targets and technology choices needs to be coupled with an organization maintenance and monitoring approach that ensures system performance there is a need for adequate online measurements that are reliable effective and correlated with system performance to protect public health future research on on site wastewater reuse needs to focus on the identification and evaluation of such monitoring devices thus allowing for direct intervention in case of treatment failure 6 conclusions the field trials of water wall prototypes in switzerland and south africa show that the system effectively removes chemical contaminants visual impurities and pathogen indicators from the used water low and stable doc cod nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the treated water allowed for true recycling of the water which distinguishes the water wall systems from comparable wastewater reuse systems that mostly downcycle the water when treating flush water removal of nutrients to ensure true recycling water quality was possible due to reduced influent contaminant concentrations as the urine and the major part of the particles had been separated before the treatment throughout the testing the prototypes were capable of providing sufficient quantities of flush and hand washing water where systems were evaluated at different scales in varied geographical contexts and in public and private applications usage of all systems was frequent despite alternatives being available in the immediate surroundings overall our results from real life applications show that the technology is ready to move forward towards a larger scale implementation of prototypes under the lead of an entity that would be specialized in the detailed engineering construction and marketing of such systems to ensure effective protection of human health

20002,south africa is the leading pesticide user in sub saharan africa however little is known about the occurrence of pesticide mixtures in surface water and potential environmental risks in africa this study investigated the occurrence of pesticides mixtures in three watersheds during a drought year in south africa the study was conducted in the krom river berg river and hex river watersheds within larger agriculture systems in the western cape pesticide spray records were collected from 38 farms a total of 21 passive water samplers styrenedivinylbenzene disks sdb were deployed each for two weeks per month over seven sampling rounds during the main pesticide application period between july 2017 and january 2018 samples were analyzed for 248 pesticide compounds using lc hr ms ms pesticide occurrence was analyzed for temporal agreement with pesticide spraying events cohen s κ and correlation with rainfall patterns and river discharge pearson correlation r p pesticide time weighted average concentrations were estimated and compared to environmental quality standards eqs according to the farm spray records 96 different pesticides were sprayed during the sampling period and differed considerably between the three study areas seasons and crops grown in total 53 compounds were detected in river water we detected 39 of compounds from the spraying records and demonstrated close temporal correlations of seasonal patterns for 11 pesticide compounds between reported on spraying records and observations in the streams κ 0 90 however 23 detected pesticides were not found on spray records many of them being herbicides most of the estimated two week average pesticide concentrations were below 40 ng l the insecticides imidacloprid thiacloprid chlorpyrifos and acetamiprid and the herbicide terbuthylazine exceeded at least once their eqs 58 fold eqs 13 ng l 12 fold eqs 10 ng l 9 fold eqs 0 46 ng l 5 fold eqs 24 ng l and 3 fold eqs 220 ng l respectively our study substantially widens the view on pesticide pollution in surface water compared to previous studies in sub saharan africa by targeting more than 200 pesticides using passive sampling systems this broad assessment revealed the presence of 53 compounds some of them in high concentrations indicating possible adverse effects on biota and the quality of the ecosystem whether the observed concentration levels in the year 2017 were exceptional due to the lowest ever recorded rainfall and river discharge needs to be tested with additional data to better understand how pesticide pollution levels manifest under average rainfall and river discharge conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords climate change drought passive water sampling pesticide surface water sustainable development goal 6 1 introduction south africa is the leading pesticide user in sub saharan africa dabrowski 2015 dalvie et al 2009 with more than 3 000 pesticide products containing 700 different pesticide compounds legally registered for agricultural use avcasa 2017 pesticide compounds also referred to as parent compounds or active ingredient can enter non target environments such as surface and groundwater where they persist or metabolize to transformation products tps and may present a risk for environmental and human health moschet et al 2015 sorensen et al 2015 stehle and schulz 2015 a thorough understanding of pesticide occurrence in surface water is of increasing importance as changing environmental conditions due to climate change such as an increase in temperature or more frequent extreme events may considerably impact on the use of pesticides and their environmental fate bloomfield et al 2006 delcour et al 2015 rosenzweig et al 2001 for example pest infestations often coincide with changes in climatic conditions delcour et al 2015 rosenzweig et al 2001 implying a potential increase in pesticide use during extreme events such as droughts or heavy rains bloomfield et al 2006 rosenzweig et al 2001 contrary a decrease in rainfall may reduce pesticide transport processes such as run off and lower pesticide concentration in surface water bloomfield et al 2006 otieno et al 2013 in the past monitoring programs have been developed mainly in high income countries to better understand seasonal occurrence and cumulative risks of pesticide mixtures spycher et al 2018 finizio et al 2011 gilliom et al 2006 gustavsson et al 2017 herrero hernández et al 2017 kapsi et al 2019 moschet et al 2014 stenrød 2015 such investigations are costly and therefore studies analyzing a broad range of pesticide mixtures used in agriculture and covering seasonal trends are rare in low and middle income countries lmics in general and sub saharan africa in specific chepchirchir et al 2017 unyimadu et al 2018 yahaya et al 2017 in sub saharan africa most of the studies focused on persistent pesticides such as organochlorines which are in many cases banned for agriculture use amdany et al 2014 chepchirchir et al 2017 teklu et al 2016 unyimadu et al 2018 yahaya et al 2017 only a few studies conducted in the past 10 years investigated currently used pesticides in agriculture and are found to be restricted in the following dimensions due to limited resources aneck hahn et al 2018 houbraken et al 2017 lehmann et al 2018 2017 mekonen et al 2016 nesser et al 2016 otieno et al 2010 wooding et al 2017 i temporal coverage relying mostly on grab sampling ii number of compounds studied up to a maximum of 33 target compounds analyzed and iii seasonality sampling schemes fail to consider seasonal patterns passive sampling methods are one practical possibility to overcome some of these limitations moschet et al 2015 passive samplers such as the chemcatchers styrenedivinylbenzene sdb disks allowed relatively easy deployment in the field and proofed to be a cost effective and robust monitoring tool even in remote areas with little infrastructure available chepchirchir et al 2017 moschet et al 2015 using chemcatchers screening can increase the temporal coverage and the probability of detecting a broad range of polar and semi polar compounds moschet et al 2014 passive samplers reflect time averaged concentrations hence they do not reflect possible peak concentrations and may substantially underestimate the acute exposure to toxic compounds spycher et al 2018 such short term episodic concentration peaks are known to negatively impact aquatic invertebrates beketov et al 2013 in addition to the lack of knowledge of pesticide mixtures in water there is little understanding of pesticide use on farms in lmics dabrowski 2015 dalvie et al 2009 currently there is a growing number of farms which record their pesticide use on spray records to adhere to good agriculture practice gap or to obtain export certifications globalg a p 2019 however the few efforts which generated an overview of used pesticides relied on country wide annual pesticide sales data the sales data lack temporal and spatial information and reported a mismatch between pesticide use and detects in the environment dabrowski 2015 dalvie et al 2009 hence there is a need to measure the temporal and spatial variation of pesticide mixtures and compare it with actual pesticide use data in lmics the present study was conducted in the western cape south africa which is experiencing acute pressure from climate change the western cape hit by an extreme drought between 2016 and 2018 that impacted profoundly on the water availability for domestic and agricultural use while reducing crop yields and changing pest patterns godsmark et al 2018 zwane 2019 therefore this study aim was to investigating the occurrence of pesticide mixtures using passive water sampling systems in three watersheds during the drought year in 2017 and 2018 in south africa we addressed three research questions i what is the seasonal variation and potential risks for the environment of the measured pesticides ii can pesticide spray records be used to predict the occurrence of pesticide mixtures in surface water and iii to what extent are measured pesticide levels driven by weather conditions and hydrology for all questions it is discussed how the prevailing major drought during the study period may have affected the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and pesticide

institute of aquatic science and technology eawag in switzerland for analysis 2 3 preparation and extraction of passive sampler the passive samplers were prepared according to vermeirssen et al 2009 briefly before the deployment the sdb disks and the pes membrane were conditioned in meoh and then in nanopure water 30 min each the sdb disks covered by a pes membrane were assembled on the holders the passive samplers were stored in nanopure water until deployment only one replicate of the sdb disks was analyzed the second one was kept for quality control the extraction was done according to moschet et al 2013 the vials containing the sdb disks were filled with 6 ml of acetone and shaken for 30 min on a rotary shaker after transferring the total volume of acetone into a new centrifuge glass tube 5 ml of methanol was added to the sdb disks for a second extraction and shaken for another 30 min the extract of acetone was concentrated to a volume of 1 ml and then mixed with the

crops the mean amount of pesticides sprayed per crop kg ha was calculated over all farms producing the same crop to investigate the correlation between measured amounts of pesticide compounds rainfall and water discharge of each river watershed pearson regression analysis r p was used to analyze the agreement between pesticides reported on the spraying records with pesticides measured on the passive samplers cohen s κ coefficient was used the time weighted average concentrations of the different compounds in the water phase were calculated using compound specific sampling rate r s from the literature where available charriau et al 2016 ahrens et al 2015 moschet et al 2014 if several values were available from these references we used the average as the expected value r s because sampling rates may vary with flow conditions or biofilm and sedimentation on the disks we considered those sampling rates as uncertain and considered a one order of magnitude range r s multiplied divided by 3 16 see table s7 of the si such a range covers 90 of the empirical variance observed among compounds in a previous field study moschet et al 2014 to assess the ecotoxicological relevance of time weighted average pesticides concentrations the values were compared to existing environmental quality standards eqs since such standards for surface waters are only available for two pesticides in south africa atrazine endosulfan department of water affairs and forestry 1996 a consistent set of eqs from the switzerland or the eu were used moschet et al 2014 swiss center for applied ecotoxicology eawag epfl 2013 acute and chronic eqs values are derived according to a standardized procedure european commission 2011 eqs indicate compound specific concentrations which may adversely affect aquatic biota because the eqs approach is conceptually similar to the procedure outlined by south african authorities department of water affairs and forestry 1996 and it considers data across the entire spectrum of aquatic organisms we have chosen this approach acknowledging that the choice of other reference values such as regulatory acceptable concentrations racs or toxic units may also be a valid option when assessing the risk of pesticides in surface waters when no eqs was available a limit of 100 ng l was assumed ispra 2018 an assessment of the risk of the pesticide mixtures was not done because it was beyond the scope of this study in general the risk of a pesticide mixture is similar to or higher than the risk of the highest risk for the single mixture

july 2017 and january 2018 96 different pesticide compounds 47 fungicides 31 insecticides and 18 herbicides were recorded to be sprayed over 341 spraying applications on the 38 farms table s3 of the si the sprayed pesticide compounds reflect 15 of the currently registered pesticides in south africa avcasa 2017 there were considerable differences in the numbers of pesticides used between piketberg hex river valley and grabouw n 36 48 and 71 respectively fig 2 c the mixtures differed also considerably between seasons and crops mean amounts of all applied pesticides per ha over the seven months was highest in table grapes 34 kg ha followed by pome fruits 29 kg ha wine grapes 21 kg ha citrus 5 kg ha and wheat 3 kg ha the most used crop specific pesticides 80 of total amounts applied were penconazole 56 mancozeb 27 and spiroxamine 4 for table grapes in hex river valley mancozeb 76 glyphosate 4 and chlorpyrifos 4 for pome fruits in grabouw and 2 4 d 40 bromoxynil 23 and mcpa 18 for wheat in piketberg fungicides were applied in highest amounts on table grapes 97 of all pesticides applied and pome fruits 88 while on wheat herbicides were sprayed mostly 82 respectively fig 2c table s3 of the si however our collected spray records have a bias in underreporting herbicides as in many cases only fungicides and insecticides are recorded due to their direct applications on crops personal communication with farmers 2019 high use of herbicides is however expected according to the south africa pesticide sales statistic from 2009 dabrowski et al 2014 there herbicides are reported to be the most used pesticides over all crops followed by fungicides and insecticides 50 41 and 8 of the total use respectively 3 2 pesticide occurrence in the streams during drought conditions 3 2 1 catchment hydrology and the effect of the drought all three watersheds were under extreme water shortage due to the drought condition which was reported for the whole western cape between 2016 and 2018 wcg 2017 zwane 2019 during the sampling in 2017 water discharge rates were the lowest on record since 1980 while total rainfall over the year was within the three lowest measurements for all three study areas since 1960 fig s2 ead 2018 nevertheless there were slight differences in the severity of the drought between the study areas during the seven months sampling period grabouw was the wettest area and received 179 mm of rain range 2 60 mm two week piketberg and hex river valley received three times less rain 56 mm range 0 26 mm two week and 51 mm range 0 37 mm two week respectively fig 2a ead 2018 water flow was highest in the grabouw area with 125 mm ranging between 0 5 and 15 9 mm two week 0 04 1 40 m3 s while both hex river and berg river had a flow of 12 mm range 0 4 1 3 mm two week 0 21 0 75 m3 s and 0 2 1 8 mm two week 0 58 4 67 m3 s respectively fig 2b in the following sections we describe to which degree the spatio temporal patterns of pesticide compounds detected reflect the reported pesticide applications during the study 3 2 2 pesticide compounds detected out of the 248 analyzed compounds 187 pesticide compounds and 61 tps 34 parent compounds 18 of the analyzed active ingredients and 19 tps 31 of the analyzed tp were detected table s4 of the si the 34 pesticide compounds detected above lod consisted of 13 fungicides 12 herbicides and nine insecticides fig 3 out of the 96 pesticide compounds that have been reported on the spray records 35 compounds were covered by the analytical method these included six out of the eight dominating compounds in the spraying records tables s3 and s4 of the si only the fungicide mancozeb and the herbicide glyphosate which are hardly stable in the environment or require particular analytical methods were not covered besides 18 of the 96 pesticide compounds were metals or organic compounds e g zinc copper manganese which require different analytics out of the three major crops in the study areas wheat pome fruits and table grapes this study covers over 50 of the applied pesticide compounds table s5 of the si out of 34 compounds from the spraying records which we analyzed 13 compounds 39 could be detected out of these compounds three chlorpyrifos penconazole spiroxamine belong to compounds sprayed in the highest quantities according to the spray records another 10 compounds which were reported in the spray records were found as well in the rivers fig 4 also 23 pesticide compounds were detected that were not reported on the spraying records 11 out of 12 detected herbicides five out of 13 fungicides and five out of nine insecticides table s5 of the si the low ratio between reports and detects of herbicides could originate from a reporting bias see section 3 2 earlier applications or non agriculture use for alien vegetation removal andrade rivas and rother 2015 and weed control alongside roads for example non reported triazine herbicides atrazine simazine terbuthylazine prometon and prometryn were frequently observed in the rivers but not recorded on any spray records the occurrence of these compounds was also shown in previous studies in other areas of south africa rimayi et al 2018 wooding et al 2017 atrazine was reported to be one of the pesticides sold in the highest quantities in south africa in 2009 dabrowski 2015 the ratio between parent compounds and tps can yield insight into the residence time of the pesticide compounds in the soil groundwater system where high values point to a recent application leu et al 2004 seven pesticide compound tp pairs could be observed in this study for the pesticide compounds atrazine azoxystrobin imidacloprid metolachlor simazine terbuthylazine and thiacloprid at least in one study area except for metolachlor the pesticide compound tp ratios reveal clear trends with the concentration of the parent compounds fig s3 of the si this indicates on the one hand that these pesticides stem from recent applications in the watersheds because we observed in samples with large parent concentrations high parent to tp ratios except for simazine in piketberg on the other hand in samples with low parent levels the small ratios indicate long residence times this implies that we also observed background concentrations from previous applications this is not surprising given the persistence of compounds such as triazine herbicides water sediment dt50 between 33 and 228 days table s7 of the si university of hertfordshire 2018 and is a well known phenomenon gomides freiatas et al 2008 several n 20 compounds on our target list were reported to be sprayed but not detected out of them one was not sprayed during the months of our sampling period prosulfocarb a possible explanation could be that the mean lod of the 20 non detected compounds is almost 8 times higher than the mean loq of the 11 compounds that were sprayed and detected 9 8 and 1 3 ng disk respectively 3 2 3 spatial patterns generally it is observed that pesticides found in surface waters reflect the cropping patterns gilliom 2007 accordingly it was not surprising to detect differences in individual pesticide compounds occurrence in the three rivers fig 3 most pesticide compounds were detected in piketberg 28 pesticide compounds 13 fungicides 12 herbicides and five insecticides followed by grabouw 26 pesticide compounds 10 fungicides nine herbicides and seven insecticides and hex river valley 11 pesticide compounds five herbicides four fungicides and two insecticides specific differences between study areas were apparent for thiacloprid insecticide only detected in grabouw and propyzamide herbicide only detected in piketberg fig 5 in hex river valley mainly insecticides were detected while primarily fungicides were reported to be sprayed fig 2c e in grabouw and piketberg herbicides were detected in the largest amounts throughout the seven sampling rounds while only reported to be sprayed during july in piketberg 3 2 4 temporal patterns we found strong temporal agreement κ 0 90 between spraying events and occurrence in river water for 11 compounds five insecticides and six fungicides over the 220 possible observations over the three study areas and the seven sampling rounds respectively six in piketberg table 1 fig 4 the agreement was only moderate κ 0 42 for the compounds detected and applied when considering the whole sampling period and the three areas 33 possible observations moreover three tps of sprayed compounds were detected imidacloprid desnitro imidacloprid urea and thiacloprid amide fig 4b which correlated in each case with the spraying of the pesticide compounds n 4 or the absence of spraying activity led to no quantification n 5 this suggests first that the spraying records collected provided a good representation of these specific insecticides and the fungicides applied and second that pesticide compounds entered surface water within a short time after application in addition to the pesticide application patterns one might also expect temporal relationships between pesticide occurrence in river water with rainfall events and discharge quantity doppler et al 2012 leu et al 2005 schulz 2004 thurman et al 1991 leading to sometimes pronounced seasonality leu et al 2010 indeed grabouw which had received the most rainfall both bi weekly discharge and rainfall quantities were positively correlated to the total measured amount of all pesticide compounds on the passive samplers ng disk r p 0 84 and 0 73 respectively for the two other rivers we could only find weak non significant correlations 3 3 pesticide concentrations ecotoxicological relevance the time weighted average concentrations for all bi weekly samples fig 5 and table s5 of the si were in the low ng l range this has also been observed for similar time averaged samples under much wetter conditions in europe moschet et al 2014 spycher et al 2018 four pesticide compounds and three tps have been quantified with a maximum concentration between 40 and 2300 ng l based on the expected sampling rates r s two herbicides terbuthylazine and mcpa two insecticides imidacloprid and oxamyl and three tps of herbicides propaxine 2 hydroxy terbuthylazine desethyl and metolachlor esa if the sampling rates were lower e g due to low flow velocities under the drought conditions the real concentrations might even have been higher taking composite samples over two weeks can have several effects on the detected concentration patterns on the one hand the maximum concentration levels will be dampened a comparison of pesticide patterns in swiss streams spycher et al 2018 between 0 5 day samples and two week composite samples as used here indicates that peak concentrations may be 10 fold underestimated on the other hand the duration of exceedance of a critical concentration may be overestimated the same swiss study showed in one study area that acute water quality criteria were exceeded 36 of the time with sampling intervals down to 0 5 days while with the two week composite samples criteria were exceeded 61 of the time when considering the time weighted average concentrations fig 5 shows that for most compounds 47 out of 53 the observed pesticide levels were below the eqs values however the three insecticides chlorpyrifos thiacloprid and imidacloprid exceeded eqs between nine 12 and 558 fold with possible maximum concentrations of 4 2 ng l 115 2 ng l and 7249 4 ng l respectively table s5 of the si specifically the concentration of imidacloprid exceeded its eqs in all samples both chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid have been repeatedly detected in different environments at concentration levels raising concerns in south africa and other parts of the world dalvie et al 2003 manrakhan et al 2013 mcgregor 1999 mitchell et al 2017 motsoeneng and dalvie 2015 concentrations of the two compounds acetamiprid and terbuthylazine were also detected at least once 5 and 3 fold above the eqs when assuming a fast sampling rate exceedances of eqs to that degree reported here suggest that sensitive species in the aquatic communities are at risk 3 4 limitations our study has three main limitations that need to be considered first spraying records have been obtained from a small subsample of farms in the study areas the 38 chosen farms cover 7 of the total agricultural land and grow 8 from 40 different crops in the three study areas further investigations would need to include a larger subsample of farms and establish an additional reporting strategy for herbicide use second despite a broad analytic coverage we were not able to analyze some pesticides that were used in high quantity e g the fungicides mancozeb ametoctradin and dimethomorph the herbicides glyphosate trifluralin and paraquat and the insecticides prothiofos omethoate and indoxacarb for some of them e g mancozeb or glyphosate very specific analytical methods are required which was beyond the means of our study mujawar et al 2014 poiger et al 2017 third as passive water samples were collected over two week periods evaluation of peak concentrations due to spraying or rain events was not possible the sampling duration may also cause non detects of compounds if their occurrence was limited to episodes only finally due to limited resources not the full spraying period is covered in this study however this study showed that it is possible to detect a broad range of compounds with large differences in physico chemical properties in different remote watersheds with little infrastructure available on site 4 conclusion our study substantially widened the view on pesticide pollution in surface water compared to previous studies in sub saharan africa by including more than 200 pesticide compounds using passive sampling systems in surface water while systematically comparing it with agriculture use the presented results demonstrate that a wide variety of pesticide compounds is present in streams draining agricultural watersheds strong agreement for a spatio temporal relationship between applications and occurrence in river water can be expected for specific insecticides and fungicides we analytically covered about 27 of all registered pesticides in south africa and thus real pesticide occurrence is expected to be higher in the water bodies also we detected several herbicides in the water that were not reported on the spraying record of the farms the most severe drought since recordings in 1960 was encountered during the main spraying season in the western cape during the study period these meteorological conditions have likely affected the use and subsequent fate of the measured pesticide compounds in the watershed hence our results shed light on pesticide pollution from agricultural areas during extreme drought conditions which are expected to increase in future driven by climate change given the extreme weather conditions during the study more data are needed to better understand how pesticide pollution levels manifest under average rainfall and river discharge conditions further the insecticide imidacloprid exceeded the eqs when assuming the highest sampling rate in all samples and up to 558 fold eqs 13 ng l additionally thiacloprid chlorpyrifos acetamiprid and terbuthylazine were detected at least once 12 9 5 and 3 fold above the eqs respectively these pesticide compounds have also been reported elsewhere in africa and around the world to cause environmental and public health issues to adequately address the ecological relevance of pesticide pollution it would be useful to complement the study approach in the future with samples taken at higher temporal resolution and to develop ecotoxicological quality criteria which are specific for the ecological context of southern africa funding this work was made possible with funding sources from the swiss african research cooperation

20002,south africa is the leading pesticide user in sub saharan africa however little is known about the occurrence of pesticide mixtures in surface water and potential environmental risks in africa this study investigated the occurrence of pesticides mixtures in three watersheds during a drought year in south africa the study was conducted in the krom river berg river and hex river watersheds within larger agriculture systems in the western cape pesticide spray records were collected from 38 farms a total of 21 passive water samplers styrenedivinylbenzene disks sdb were deployed each for two weeks per month over seven sampling rounds during the main pesticide application period between july 2017 and january 2018 samples were analyzed for 248 pesticide compounds using lc hr ms ms pesticide occurrence was analyzed for temporal agreement with pesticide spraying events cohen s κ and correlation with rainfall patterns and river discharge pearson correlation r p pesticide time weighted average concentrations were estimated and compared to environmental quality standards eqs according to the farm spray records 96 different pesticides were sprayed during the sampling period and differed considerably between the three study areas seasons and crops grown in total 53 compounds were detected in river water we detected 39 of compounds from the spraying records and demonstrated close temporal correlations of seasonal patterns for 11 pesticide compounds between reported on spraying records and observations in the streams κ 0 90 however 23 detected pesticides were not found on spray records many of them being herbicides most of the estimated two week average pesticide concentrations were below 40 ng l the insecticides imidacloprid thiacloprid chlorpyrifos and acetamiprid and the herbicide terbuthylazine exceeded at least once their eqs 58 fold eqs 13 ng l 12 fold eqs 10 ng l 9 fold eqs 0 46 ng l 5 fold eqs 24 ng l and 3 fold eqs 220 ng l respectively our study substantially widens the view on pesticide pollution in surface water compared to previous studies in sub saharan africa by targeting more than 200 pesticides using passive sampling systems this broad assessment revealed the presence of 53 compounds some of them in high concentrations indicating possible adverse effects on biota and the quality of the ecosystem whether the observed concentration levels in the year 2017 were exceptional due to the lowest ever recorded rainfall and river discharge needs to be tested with additional data to better understand how pesticide pollution levels manifest under average rainfall and river discharge conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords climate change drought passive water sampling pesticide surface water sustainable development goal 6 1 introduction south africa is the leading pesticide user in sub saharan africa dabrowski 2015 dalvie et al 2009 with more than 3 000 pesticide products containing 700 different pesticide compounds legally registered for agricultural use avcasa 2017 pesticide compounds also referred to as parent compounds or active ingredient can enter non target environments such as surface and groundwater where they persist or metabolize to transformation products tps and may present a risk for environmental and human health moschet et al 2015 sorensen et al 2015 stehle and schulz 2015 a thorough understanding of pesticide occurrence in surface water is of increasing importance as changing environmental conditions due to climate change such as an increase in temperature or more frequent extreme events may considerably impact on the use of pesticides and their environmental fate bloomfield et al 2006 delcour et al 2015 rosenzweig et al 2001 for example pest infestations often coincide with changes in climatic conditions delcour et al 2015 rosenzweig et al 2001 implying a potential increase in pesticide use during extreme events such as droughts or heavy rains bloomfield et al 2006 rosenzweig et al 2001 contrary a decrease in rainfall may reduce pesticide transport processes such as run off and lower pesticide concentration in surface water bloomfield et al 2006 otieno et al 2013 in the past monitoring programs have been developed mainly in high income countries to better understand seasonal occurrence and cumulative risks of pesticide mixtures spycher et al 2018

a broad range of pesticide mixtures used in agriculture and covering seasonal trends are rare in low and middle income countries lmics in general and sub saharan africa in specific chepchirchir et al 2017 unyimadu et al 2018 yahaya et al 2017 in sub saharan africa most of the studies focused on persistent pesticides such as organochlorines which are in many cases banned for agriculture use amdany et al 2014 chepchirchir et al 2017 teklu et al 2016 unyimadu et al 2018 yahaya et al 2017 only a few studies conducted in the past 10 years investigated currently used pesticides in agriculture and are found to be restricted in the following dimensions due to limited resources aneck hahn et al 2018 houbraken et al 2017 lehmann et al 2018 2017 mekonen et al 2016 nesser et al 2016 otieno et al 2010 wooding et al 2017 i temporal coverage relying mostly on grab sampling ii number of compounds studied up to a maximum of 33 target compounds analyzed and iii seasonality sampling schemes fail to consider seasonal patterns passive sampling methods are one practical possibility to overcome some of these limitations moschet et al 2015 passive samplers such as the chemcatchers styrenedivinylbenzene sdb disks allowed relatively easy deployment in the field and proofed to be a cost effective and robust monitoring tool even in remote areas with little infrastructure available chepchirchir et al 2017 moschet et al 2015 using chemcatchers screening can increase the temporal coverage and the probability of detecting a broad range of polar and semi polar compounds moschet et al 2014 passive samplers reflect time averaged concentrations hence they do not reflect possible peak concentrations and may substantially underestimate the acute exposure to toxic compounds spycher et al 2018 such short term episodic concentration peaks are known to negatively impact aquatic invertebrates beketov et al 2013 in addition to the lack of knowledge of pesticide mixtures in water there is little understanding of pesticide use on farms in lmics dabrowski 2015 dalvie et al 2009 currently there is a growing number of farms which record their pesticide use on spray records to adhere to good agriculture practice gap or to obtain export certifications globalg a p 2019 however the few efforts which generated an overview of used pesticides relied on country wide annual pesticide sales data the sales data lack temporal and spatial information and reported a mismatch between pesticide use and detects in the environment dabrowski 2015 dalvie et al 2009 hence there is a need to measure the temporal and spatial variation of pesticide mixtures and compare it with actual pesticide use data in lmics the present study was conducted in the western cape south africa which is experiencing acute pressure from climate change the western cape hit by an extreme drought between 2016 and 2018 that impacted profoundly on the water availability for domestic and agricultural use while reducing crop yields and changing pest patterns godsmark et al 2018 zwane 2019 therefore this study aim was to investigating the occurrence of pesticide mixtures using passive water sampling systems in three watersheds during the drought year in 2017 and 2018 in south africa we addressed three research questions i what is the seasonal variation and potential risks for the environment of the measured pesticides ii can pesticide spray records be used to predict the occurrence of pesticide mixtures in surface water and iii to what extent are measured pesticide levels driven by weather conditions and hydrology for all questions it is discussed how the prevailing major drought during the study period may have affected the results 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and pesticide

university of cape town uct and stored at 18 c at each sampling round one field blank sdb disk was taken along for quality control finally samples were transported at 4 c to the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology eawag in switzerland for analysis 2 3 preparation and extraction of passive sampler the passive samplers were prepared according to vermeirssen et al 2009 briefly before the deployment the sdb disks and the pes membrane were conditioned in meoh and then in nanopure water 30 min each the sdb disks covered by a pes membrane were assembled on the holders the passive samplers were stored in nanopure water until deployment only one replicate of the sdb disks was analyzed the second one was kept for quality control the extraction was done according to moschet et al 2013 the vials containing the sdb disks were filled with 6 ml of acetone and shaken for 30 min on a rotary shaker after transferring the total volume of acetone into a new centrifuge glass tube 5 ml of methanol was added to the sdb disks for a second extraction and shaken for another 30 min the extract of acetone was concentrated to a volume of 1 ml and then mixed with the methanol from the second extraction the 6 ml extract was further filtrated with a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter 0 45 um pore size and then evaporated to a volume of 0 1 ml the final extract was adjusted to 1 ml by adding nanopure water the samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 21 c for 30 min the supernatant was transferred into an offline vial for the analysis 2 4 water analysis the

the literature where available charriau et al 2016 ahrens et al 2015 moschet et al 2014 if several values were available from these references we used the average as the expected value r s because sampling rates may vary with flow conditions or biofilm and sedimentation on the disks we considered those sampling rates as uncertain and considered a one order of magnitude range r s multiplied divided by 3 16 see table s7 of the si such a range covers 90 of the empirical variance observed among compounds in a previous field study moschet et al 2014 to assess the ecotoxicological relevance of time weighted average pesticides concentrations the values were compared to existing environmental quality standards eqs since such standards for surface waters are only available for two pesticides in south africa atrazine endosulfan department of water affairs and forestry 1996 a consistent set of eqs from the switzerland or the eu were used moschet et al 2014 swiss center for applied ecotoxicology eawag epfl 2013 acute and chronic eqs values are derived according to a standardized procedure european commission 2011 eqs indicate compound specific concentrations which may adversely affect aquatic biota because the eqs approach is conceptually similar to the procedure outlined by south african authorities department of water affairs and forestry 1996 and it considers data across the entire spectrum of aquatic organisms we have chosen this approach acknowledging that the choice of other reference values such as regulatory acceptable concentrations racs or toxic units may also be a valid option when assessing the risk of pesticides in surface waters when no eqs was available a limit of 100 ng l was assumed ispra 2018 an assessment of the risk of the pesticide mixtures was not done because it was beyond the scope of this study in general the risk of a pesticide mixture is similar to or higher than the risk of the highest risk for the single mixture

july 2017 and january 2018 96 different pesticide compounds 47 fungicides 31 insecticides and 18 herbicides were recorded to be sprayed over 341 spraying applications on the 38 farms table s3 of the si the sprayed pesticide compounds reflect 15 of the currently registered pesticides in south africa avcasa 2017 there were considerable differences in the numbers of pesticides used between piketberg hex river valley and grabouw n 36 48 and 71 respectively fig 2 c the mixtures differed also considerably between seasons and crops mean amounts of all applied pesticides per ha over the seven months was highest in table grapes 34 kg ha followed by pome fruits 29 kg ha wine grapes 21 kg ha citrus 5 kg ha and wheat 3 kg ha the most used crop specific pesticides 80 of total amounts applied were penconazole 56 mancozeb 27 and spiroxamine 4 for table grapes in hex river valley mancozeb 76 glyphosate 4 and chlorpyrifos 4 for pome fruits in grabouw and 2 4 d 40 bromoxynil 23 and mcpa 18 for wheat in piketberg fungicides were applied in highest amounts on table grapes 97 of all pesticides applied and pome fruits 88 while on wheat herbicides were sprayed mostly 82 respectively fig 2c table s3 of the si however our collected spray records have a bias in underreporting herbicides as in many cases only fungicides and insecticides are recorded due to their direct applications on crops personal communication with farmers 2019 high use of herbicides is however expected according to the south africa pesticide sales statistic from 2009 dabrowski et al 2014 there herbicides are reported to be the most used pesticides over all crops followed by fungicides and insecticides 50 41 and 8 of the total use respectively 3 2 pesticide occurrence in the streams during drought conditions 3 2 1 catchment hydrology and the effect of the drought all three watersheds were under extreme water shortage due to the drought condition which was reported for the whole western cape between 2016 and 2018 wcg 2017 zwane 2019 during the sampling in 2017 water discharge rates were the lowest on record since 1980 while total rainfall over the year was within the three lowest measurements for all three study areas since 1960 fig s2 ead 2018 nevertheless there were slight differences in the severity of the drought between the study areas during the seven months sampling period grabouw was the wettest area and received 179 mm of rain range 2 60 mm two week piketberg and hex river valley received three times less rain 56 mm range 0 26 mm two week and 51 mm range 0 37 mm two week respectively fig 2a ead 2018 water flow was highest in the grabouw area with 125 mm ranging between 0 5 and 15 9 mm two week 0 04 1 40 m3 s while both hex river and berg river had a flow of 12 mm range 0 4 1 3 mm two week 0 21 0 75 m3 s and 0 2 1 8 mm two week 0 58 4 67 m3 s respectively fig 2b in the following sections we describe to which degree the spatio temporal patterns of pesticide compounds detected reflect the reported pesticide applications during the study 3 2 2 pesticide compounds detected out of the 248 analyzed compounds 187 pesticide compounds and 61 tps 34 parent compounds 18 of the analyzed active ingredients and 19 tps 31 of the analyzed tp were detected table s4 of the si the 34 pesticide compounds detected above lod consisted of 13 fungicides 12 herbicides and nine insecticides fig 3 out of the 96 pesticide compounds that have been reported on the spray records 35 compounds were covered by the analytical method these included six out of the eight dominating compounds in the spraying records tables s3 and s4 of the si only the fungicide mancozeb and the herbicide glyphosate which are hardly stable in the environment or require particular analytical methods were not covered besides 18 of the 96 pesticide compounds were metals or organic compounds e g zinc copper manganese which require different analytics out of the three major crops in the study areas wheat pome fruits and table grapes this study covers over 50 of the applied pesticide compounds table s5 of the si out of 34 compounds from the spraying records which we analyzed 13 compounds 39 could be detected out of these compounds three chlorpyrifos penconazole spiroxamine belong to compounds sprayed in the highest quantities according to the spray records another 10 compounds which were reported in the spray records were found as well in the rivers fig 4 also 23 pesticide compounds were detected that were not reported on the spraying records 11 out of 12 detected herbicides five out of 13 fungicides and five out of nine insecticides table s5 of the si the low ratio between reports and detects of herbicides could originate from a reporting bias see section 3 2 earlier applications or non agriculture use for alien vegetation removal andrade rivas and rother 2015 and weed control alongside roads for example non reported triazine herbicides atrazine simazine terbuthylazine prometon and prometryn were frequently observed in the rivers but not recorded on any spray records the occurrence of these compounds was also shown in previous studies in other areas of south africa rimayi et al 2018 wooding et al 2017 atrazine was reported to be one of the pesticides sold in the highest quantities in south africa in 2009 dabrowski 2015 the ratio between parent compounds and tps can yield insight into the residence time of the pesticide compounds in the soil groundwater system where high values point to a recent application leu et al 2004 seven pesticide compound tp pairs could be observed in this study for the pesticide compounds atrazine azoxystrobin imidacloprid metolachlor simazine terbuthylazine and thiacloprid at least in one study area except for metolachlor the pesticide compound tp ratios reveal clear trends with the concentration of the parent compounds fig s3 of the si this indicates on the one hand that these pesticides stem from recent applications in the watersheds because we observed in samples with large parent concentrations high parent to tp ratios except for simazine in piketberg on the other hand in samples with low parent levels the small ratios indicate long residence times this implies that we also observed background concentrations from previous applications this is not surprising given the persistence of compounds such as triazine herbicides water sediment dt50 between 33 and 228 days table s7 of the si university of hertfordshire 2018 and is a well known phenomenon gomides freiatas et al 2008 several n 20 compounds on our target list were reported to be sprayed but not detected out of them one was not sprayed during the months of our sampling period prosulfocarb a possible explanation could be that the mean lod of the 20 non detected compounds is almost 8 times higher than the mean loq of the 11 compounds that were sprayed and detected 9 8 and 1 3 ng disk respectively 3 2 3 spatial patterns generally it is observed that pesticides found in surface waters reflect the cropping patterns gilliom 2007 accordingly it was not surprising to detect differences in individual pesticide compounds occurrence in the three rivers fig 3 most pesticide compounds were detected in piketberg 28 pesticide compounds 13 fungicides 12 herbicides and five insecticides followed by grabouw 26 pesticide compounds 10 fungicides nine herbicides and seven insecticides and hex river valley 11 pesticide compounds five herbicides four fungicides and two insecticides specific differences between study areas were apparent for thiacloprid insecticide only detected in grabouw and propyzamide herbicide only detected in piketberg fig 5 in hex river valley mainly insecticides were detected while primarily fungicides were reported to be sprayed fig 2c e in grabouw and piketberg herbicides were detected in the largest amounts throughout the seven sampling rounds while only reported to be sprayed during july in piketberg 3 2 4 temporal patterns we found strong temporal agreement κ 0 90 between spraying events and occurrence in river water for 11 compounds five insecticides and six fungicides over the 220 possible observations over the three study areas and the seven sampling rounds respectively six in piketberg table 1 fig 4 the agreement was only moderate κ 0 42 for the compounds detected and applied when considering the whole sampling period and the three areas 33 possible observations moreover three tps of sprayed compounds were detected imidacloprid desnitro imidacloprid urea and thiacloprid amide fig 4b which correlated in each case with the spraying of the pesticide compounds n 4 or the absence of spraying activity led to no quantification n 5 this suggests first that the spraying records collected provided a good representation of these specific insecticides and the fungicides applied and second that pesticide compounds entered surface water within a short time after application in addition to the pesticide application patterns one might also expect temporal relationships between pesticide occurrence in river water with rainfall events and discharge quantity doppler et al 2012 leu et al 2005 schulz 2004 thurman et al 1991 leading to sometimes pronounced seasonality leu et al 2010 indeed grabouw which had received the most rainfall both bi weekly discharge and rainfall quantities were positively correlated to the total measured amount of all pesticide compounds on the passive samplers ng disk r p 0 84 and 0 73 respectively for the two other rivers we could only find weak non significant correlations 3 3 pesticide concentrations ecotoxicological relevance the time weighted average concentrations for all bi weekly samples fig 5 and table s5 of the si were in the low ng l range this has also been observed for similar time averaged samples under much wetter conditions in europe moschet et al 2014 spycher et al 2018 four pesticide compounds and three tps have been quantified with a maximum concentration between 40 and 2300 ng l based on the expected sampling rates r s two herbicides terbuthylazine and mcpa two insecticides imidacloprid and oxamyl and three tps of herbicides propaxine 2 hydroxy terbuthylazine desethyl and metolachlor esa if the sampling rates were lower e g due to low flow velocities under the drought conditions the real concentrations might even have been higher taking composite samples over two weeks can have several effects on the detected concentration patterns on the one hand the maximum concentration levels will be dampened a comparison of pesticide patterns in swiss streams spycher et al 2018 between 0 5 day samples and two week composite samples as used here indicates that peak concentrations may be 10 fold underestimated on the other hand the duration of exceedance of a critical concentration may be overestimated the same swiss study showed in one study area that acute water quality criteria were exceeded 36 of the time with sampling intervals down to 0 5 days while with the two week composite samples criteria were exceeded 61 of the time when considering the time weighted average concentrations fig 5 shows that for most compounds 47 out of 53 the observed pesticide levels were below the eqs values however the three insecticides chlorpyrifos thiacloprid and imidacloprid exceeded eqs between nine 12 and 558 fold with possible maximum concentrations of 4 2 ng l 115 2 ng l and 7249 4 ng l respectively table s5 of the si specifically the concentration of imidacloprid exceeded its eqs in all samples both chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid have been repeatedly detected in different environments at concentration levels raising concerns in south africa and other parts of the world dalvie et al 2003 manrakhan et al 2013 mcgregor 1999 mitchell et al 2017 motsoeneng and dalvie 2015 concentrations of the two compounds acetamiprid and terbuthylazine were also detected at least once 5 and 3 fold above the eqs when assuming a fast sampling rate exceedances of eqs to that degree reported here suggest that sensitive species in the aquatic communities are at risk 3 4 limitations our study has three main limitations that need to be considered first spraying records have been obtained from a small subsample of farms in the study areas the 38 chosen farms cover 7 of the total agricultural land and grow 8 from 40 different crops in the three study areas further investigations would need to include a larger subsample of farms and establish an additional reporting strategy for herbicide use second despite a broad analytic coverage we were not able to analyze some pesticides that were used in high quantity e g the fungicides mancozeb ametoctradin and dimethomorph the herbicides glyphosate trifluralin and paraquat and the insecticides prothiofos omethoate and indoxacarb for some of them e g mancozeb or glyphosate very specific analytical methods are required which was beyond the means of our study mujawar et al 2014 poiger et al 2017 third as passive water samples were collected over two week periods evaluation of peak concentrations due to spraying or rain events was not possible the sampling duration may also cause non detects of compounds if their occurrence was limited to episodes only finally due to limited resources not the full spraying period is covered in this study however this study showed that it is possible to detect a broad range of compounds with large differences in physico chemical properties in different remote watersheds with little infrastructure available on site 4 conclusion our study substantially widened the view on pesticide pollution in surface water compared to previous studies in sub saharan africa by including more than 200 pesticide compounds using passive sampling systems in surface water while systematically comparing it with agriculture use the presented results demonstrate that a wide variety of pesticide compounds is present in streams draining agricultural watersheds strong agreement for a spatio temporal relationship between applications and occurrence in river water can be expected for specific insecticides and fungicides we analytically covered about 27 of all registered pesticides in south africa and thus real pesticide occurrence is expected to be higher in the water bodies also we detected several herbicides in the water that were not reported on the spraying record of the farms the most severe drought since recordings in 1960 was encountered during the main spraying season in the western cape during the study period these meteorological conditions have likely affected the use and subsequent fate of the measured pesticide compounds in the watershed hence our results shed light on pesticide pollution from agricultural areas during extreme drought conditions which are expected to increase in future driven by climate change given the extreme weather conditions during the study more data are needed to better understand how pesticide pollution levels manifest under average rainfall and river discharge conditions further the insecticide imidacloprid exceeded the eqs when assuming the highest sampling rate in all samples and up to 558 fold eqs 13 ng l additionally thiacloprid chlorpyrifos acetamiprid and terbuthylazine were detected at least once 12 9 5 and 3 fold above the eqs respectively these pesticide compounds have also been reported elsewhere in africa and around the world to cause environmental and public health issues to adequately address the ecological relevance of pesticide pollution it would be useful to complement the study approach in the future with samples taken at higher temporal resolution and to develop

20003,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the novel aerobic granular sludge ags wastewater treatment technology in removing faecal indicator organisms fios compared to the conventional activated sludge cas treatment system the work was carried out at two full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtp in the netherlands vroomshoop and garmerwolde both treatment plants have a cas and ags system operated in parallel the parallel treatment lines are provided with the same influent wastewater the concentrations of the measured fios in the influent of the two wwtps were comparable with reported literature values as follows f specific rna bacteriophages at 106 pfu 100 ml and escherichia coli e coli enterococci and thermotolerant coliforms ttc at 105 to 106 cfu 100 ml although both systems cas and ags are different in terms of design operation and microbial community both systems showed similar fios removal efficiency at the vroomshoop wwtp log10 removals for f specific rna bacteriophages of 1 4 0 5 and 1 3 0 6 were obtained for the ags and cas systems while at the garmerwolde wwtp log10 removals for f specific rna bacteriophages of 1 9 0 7 and 2 1 0 7 were found for the ags and cas systems correspondingly e coli enterococci and ttc log10 removals of 1 7 0 7 and 1 1 0 7 were achieved for the ags and cas systems at vroomshoop wwtp for garmerwolde wwtp log10 removals of 2 3 0 8 and 1 9 0 7 for the ags and cas systems were found respectively the measured difference in removal rates between the plants was not significant physicochemical water quality parameters such as the concentrations of organic matter nutrients and total suspended solids tss were also determined overall it was not possible to establish a direct correlation between the physicochemical parameters and the removal of fios for any of the treatment systems cas and ags only the removal of tss could be positively correlated to the e coli removal for the ags technology at the evaluated wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge activated sludge faecal indicators f specific rna bacteriophages pathogen removal 1 introduction pathogens enter the aquatic environment through municipal wastewater discharges their occurrence in either treated or raw wastewater may contribute to spreading epidemiological waterborne diseases bijkerk et al 2015 efstratiou et al 2017 several studies have reported that conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp do not completely remove pathogens dias et al 2018 lucena et al 2004 ma et al 2016 ottoson et al 2006a for instance lodder and de roda husman 2005 and van beek et al 2016 reported the presence of noroviruses and enteric viruses in river basins in the netherlands originating from treated municipal wastewater discharges microorganisms such as e coli gram negative enterococci gram positive and total coliforms are commonly used as indicators for faecal contamination carré et al 2018 liu et al 2018 and as water quality standards for water reuse e u 2016 bacteriophages have been used as an indicator for the occurrence of viral pathogens amarasiri et al 2017 dias et al 2018 mcminn et al 2017 particularly the male specific phages f specific rna bacteriophages have been used as indicators considering their strong survival in wastewater treatment process and other water environments mandilara et al 2006 furthermore f specific rna bacteriophages characteristics such as their isoelectric point size 22 29 nm and morphology grabow 2001 lodder and de roda husman 2005 resemble human viruses such as noroviruses and other enteric viruses fauvel et al 2017 bacteriophages are also easier to detect than human viruses inexpensive conventional analytical methods can be used to determine them the municipal wastewater treatment worldwide and particularly in the netherlands where this research was carried out aims at removing organic matter and nutrients roeleveld et al 2010 the conventional activated sludge cas systems is one of the most commonly applied technologies this technology removes carbon c phosphorus p and nitrogen n by treating the raw wastewater in different compartments biological reactors the treated wastewater is finally separated from the biomass by a secondary clarification tank and discharged into the receiving water body orhon 2015 roeleveld et al 2010 cas systems can achieve over 90 removal of c p and n moreover cas systems are effective in removing pathogens matthews et al 2010 and amarasiri et al 2017 reported removal efficiencies of faecal indicator organisms fios such as f specific rna bacteriophages and total coliforms of 99 5 and higher fios may be either physically removed being enmeshed into the flocs during the sedimentation process chahal et al 2016 fauvel et al 2017 guzman et al 2007 or biologically predated by other high order organisms such as protozoa mallory et al 1983 aerobic granular sludge ags wastewater treatment systems have recently emerged as an alternative to the cas process ags systems simultaneously remove organic matter and nutrients in a single compartment by promoting the formation of a granular biofilm beun et al 1999 the bacteria are able to aggregate forming dense granules of a spherical shape with a much higher settling velocity compared to cas sludge flocs therefore the separation of the biomass granules from the treated water can be easily achieved by sedimentation de kreuk et al 2007 khan et al 2013 both the biological degradation of organic matter and nutrients and the solid liquid separation process occurs in a single basin according to pronk et al 2015 full scale ags systems may reach c p and n removals on average of 87 86 and 86 respectively however the performance of full scale ags systems on pathogen removal is still unknown the objective of this study was to compare the removal of fios in two full scale wastewater treatment plants in the netherlands provided with both ags and cas systems operated in parallel the ags and cas systems were evaluated on their removal of f specific bacteriophages e coli enterococci and thermotolerant coliforms ttc standard water quality parameters such as chemical organic matter cod ammonium nh4 n biological organic matter bod5 orthophosphate po4 p total suspended solids tss and their relation with the removal of the microbiological organisms was evaluated as well in order to see whether water quality parameters can be used to predict fios removals 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment

2015 the wwtps were initially designed as cas systems for treating municipal wastewater later on ags systems were incorporated in both wwtps both processes at the two wwtps cas and ags work in parallel receiving the same wastewater moreover both of them are lacking primary and tertiary treatment fig 1 the cas systems operate in a continuous flow mode and were designed to remove organic matter c and nutrients n and p the vroomshoop wwtp was designed as a biological carrousel cas system while the garmerwolde wwtp as a two stage ab adsorption bio oxidation cas configuration with ferric iron dosing in the unit a for p removal the ags systems located at both wwtps consist of a buffer tank designed to store the influent raw wastewater followed by a biological tank containing the granular biomass where all conversions simultaneously occur the ags systems are operated as sequencing batch reactors table 1 describes the operational conditions for each treatment system at each wwtp 2 2 sample collection grab samples were collected once a month on two consecutive days from december 2017 to may 2018 for each wwtp at three different sampling points 1 influent wastewater 2 cas treated effluent and 3 ags treated effluent the influent wastewater samples shown in fig 1 as influent 1 represent the raw municipal wastewater after passing through a grit removal process and before reaching either the cas system or the ags system s buffer tank the cas treated effluent samples shown in fig 1 as effluent cas 2 were taken directly from the overflow weir of the cas settling tank the ags treated effluent samples shown in fig 1 as effluent ags 3 were collected from the effluent discharge channel after completing one entire batch cycle the water temperature during the sample campaign ranged between 9 c and 15 c 2 3 sample analysis the influent and effluent samples were stored in plastic bottles and were shipped in dark containers refrigerated at 4 c within 24 h to two different laboratories as follows bacteriophages were determined at the wnl laboratory glimmen the netherlands other microbiological e coli ttc enterococci and physicochemical parameters cod bod5 nh4 n po4 p and tss were determined at the als laboratory prague czech republic water temperature and do concentrations were collected directly from the wwtps at the same time the samples were taken the determinations of the physicochemical parameters were carried out according to the standard methods apha 2012 for the examination of water and wastewater the determination of the microbiological parameter is explained below 2 3 1 bacteriophages detection f specific rna bacteriophages were enumerated in duplicate following the double layer method according to iso 10705 1 anon 2000c the samples were 10 100 and 1000 folds diluted in a saline water solution and then one 1 ml of sample was mixed together with one 1 ml of 3 h cultured bacterium host salmonella typhimurium strain wg49 each sample was mixed in a semi solid nutrient agar and poured in a solid nutrient agar plate samples were then incubated at 37 c for 18 h for enumeration each plaque in the bacterial mat was counted as one bacteriophage unit f specific rna bacteriophages were determined by plaque forming units pfu the detection limit was reported at 1 pfu 100 ml 2 3 2 bacteria enumeration the analytical determinations of e coli and ttc bacteria were performed following the membrane filtration technique for enumeration according to the standard csn 75 7835 which is a modified method of the standard method iso 9308 1 anon 2000b for samples with excessive growth of the accompanying microflora for enumeration samples were 10 100 and 1000 folds diluted in a phosphate buffered saline pbs solution samples were plated on chromocult merck millipore medium agar for e coli detection and plated in 4 methylumbelliferyl beta d glucuronide e coli broth for ttc detection later they were cultivated 24 h at 37 2 c and 44 2 c for e coli and ttc respectively enterococci detection and enumeration was performed by the same membrane filtration method according to the standard iso 7899 2 anon 2000a the samples were cultivated in the slanetz and bartley medium oxoidtm for 24 h at 44 2 c confirmatory colour reaction tests were also performed to discard false positive by placing the samples in a bile esculin agar sigma aldrich germany all bacteria e coli ttc and enterococci were enumerated by agar plate colony forming units cfu the detection limit was reported at 1 cfu 100 ml 2 4 data analysis a statistical analysis was performed on the twelve samples collected at each wwtp for each target organism data is presented in box whisker plots in which the horizontal line across each box represents the median the interquartile ranges 50 of the score of the data and the outliers represent the confident limit of 95 of the determined concentrations fios concentrations were converted to log10 the removal efficiencies log10 were calculated considering the concentration of the influent wastewater reaching the wwtps and the treated effluent discharges for each specific treatment process ags and cas shapiro wilk normality test was applied to the converted log10 concentrations of the target fios to the unconverted data of the studied physicochemical parameters and their corresponded removal efficiencies the log10 fio removal showed to be normally distributed therefore the two paired student s t distribution t test 95 confidence analyses were performed to check whether statistically significant differences on the fios removal efficiencies exist on i similar processes that is cas at vroomshoop versus cas at garmerwolde and ags at vroomshoop versus ags at garmerwolde and ii on different processes at each wwtp that is cas versus ags at both vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps a p value 0 05 was used to bind the statistical significance moreover pearson s product correlation analyses were performed to determine the possibility for establishing potential trends among the fios removal efficiencies and the spearman s rank relationship was applied to the comparison of i the fios and physicochemical concentrations of the influent wastewater ii the fios removal efficiency with the removal efficiency of the target standard water quality parameters the statistical analysis was carried out to determine the presence of any association by calculating the product correlation value from 1 to 1 moreover the p value for each correlation was calculated to determine whether the association was significant p value 0 05 or not calculations were statistical computing using r r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 fios concentrations in raw and treated wastewater fig 2 and fig 3 show box whisker plots of the fios concentrations obtained from each sampling point at the vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps respectively this corresponds to the microorganism concentration in the raw wastewater influent to the plant and the treated effluent from each treatment system ags and cas regarding influent flow wastewater f specific rna bacteriophages were detected in both wwtps at an arithmetic mean concentration of 106 pfu 100 ml enterococci were detected at mean concentrations of 105 cfu 100 ml and ttc and e coli bacteria both at the same order of magnitude 106 cfu 100 ml in both wwtps the average concentrations for each of the evaluated fios were of similar magnitude for the two wwtps however no significant correlation was found between the occurrences of the four groups of organisms p value 0 05 the main variations in the fios concentrations observed during the sampling campaign minimum and maximum values shown in figs 2 and 3 can be explained by the hydraulic and seasonal variations when conducting this evaluation the daily influent flow rate of both wwtps fluctuates considerably between rain and dry weather flow at the vroomshoop wwtp the minimum influent concentrations for all the target organisms were approximately between one to three orders of magnitude lower than the average concentrations these lower values were measured in samples that were diluted with rain water because they were taken during rainy weather flow rwf events with a flowrate of around 800 m3 h being more than 63 of the operational design average peak flow table 1 moreover variations from one to four orders of magnitude were observed at the garmerwolde wwtp high values were measured in samples taken at a dry weather flow period with a reported flowrate of 2300 m3 h corresponding to only 15 of the operational design average dry flow at garmerwolde wwtp although fluctuations in the influent wastewater flow were observed which had an effect on the concentrations of the target organism the correlation was not significant moreover also no significant correlations were found between the water temperature that gradually increased from 9 c in winter to 15 c in spring and the concentrations of the target organisms the mean concentrations of the target organisms in the treated effluent of the different processes ags and cas were not significantly different for the two studied wwtps for vroomshoop the average concentrations of the different fios in the ags treated effluent were slightly lower than the cas treated effluent however the minimum and maximum concentrations showed a high variation for garmerwolde the average concentration of the different fios were of the same order of magnitude in the ags and cas treated effluent minimum and maximum followed similar tendency as at vroomshoop 3 2 log10 removal the average log10 removals and the standard deviations for the different evaluated fios per treatment plant are shown in fig 4 the p values obtained from the statistical analysis are presented in table 2 log10 removal values for f specific rna bacteriophages of 1 34 0 60 95 5 removal and 2 13 0 69 99 3 removal were reported for the cas

reported at the vroomshoop and garmerwolde cas wwtps respectively correspondently values of 1 60 0 85 97 3 removal and 1 88 0 80 98 7 removal were reported for ttc at vroomshoop and garmerwolde cas wwtps respectively and 1 33 0 69 95 5 removal and 1 92 0 65 98 8 removal for enterococci at vroomshoop and garmerwolde cas wwtps respectively regarding the ags treatment systems no significant

water quality related parameters except for tss at vroomshoop f specific rna bacteriophage concentrations in the influent wastewater at both wwtps significantly correlated with the concentrations of the measured physicochemical water quality parameters the rest of the bacteria indicators showed better correlations with the physicochemical parameters at garmerwolde wwtp compared to vroomshoop regarding the fios removal efficiency the f specific rna bacteriophage removal measured at garmerwolde wwtp significantly correlated with ttc removal p 0 03 in the cas system and with enterococci

fig 5 shows the water quality parameters nh4 n bod5 cod po4 p and tss removal efficiency for the two different process cas and ags at each wwtp no significant difference between the wwtps and

correlation table 3 presents the spearman s rank coefficient rho and its corresponding p values the emphasised values bold correspond to statistically significant correlations p 0 05 overall the physicochemical water quality parameters removal efficiencies strongly correlated with each other at both wwtps data not shown but apparently not to all the observed fios removal for the cas process at vroomshoop f specific rna bacteriophages showed a significant correlation with most of the studied physicochemical parameters moreover both the enterococci and the e coli removal had a significant correlation with nh4 n po4 p and tss conversely ttc removal showed no substantial association with any of the measured parameters for the garmerwolde cas process a significant correlation was observed between f specific rna bacteriophages and the chemical po4 p removal and the tss enterococcus ttc and e coli did not significantly correlate with any of the studied parameters for the ags system located at vroomshoop the f specific rna bacteriophages removal showed a significant correlation with the bod5 po4 p removals and it was the only indicator affected by water temperature changes table 3 except for e coli which was positively correlated with the po4 p any bacteria indicator significantly correlated with the removals of any of the studied water quality parameters for the ags at garmerwolde f specific rna bacteriophages and enterococcus were positively correlated with the chemical parameters nh4 n bod5 cod and po4 p while e coli showed a positive correlation with the physical parameter tss ttc were associated with nh4 n cod bod5 and it was the only indicator that showed to be significantly affected by the do concentration 4 discussion the main objective of this study was to compare the removal of faecal indicators in ags systems and cas systems to this purpose detection and enumeration of f specific rna bacteriophages e coli enterococci and ttc were analysed in raw and the treated wastewater of two full scale wwtps in the netherlands the cas and ags systems studied were both engineered for domestic wastewater treatment they manage to efficiently remove representative water quality parameters such as organic matter tss and total nitrogen and phosphorous this in line with the eu water directive 91 271 eec on urban waste water treatment cas systems are based on interaction between bacteria and sewage with relatively large land requirements for biological treatment sludge recycling and separation henze et al 2008 the better understanding on the interaction between substrate and bacteria led the development of the ags system in which denser granular biomass is formed and simultaneously remove organic matter and nutrients in only one biological tank de kreuk et al 2005 this improvement has resulted in energy savings 20 50 while compared to cas systems pronk et al 2017 and other technologies such as membrane bioreactors purnell et al 2016 moreover less area is required compared to cas systems or other technologies such as trickling filters and constructed wetlands stefanakis et al 2019 those processes normally include primary treatment and in the case of cas a secondary sedimentation tank after the biological treatment to separate sludge from the liquid bulk in this study both studied wwtps vroomshoop and garmerwolde lack primary settling tanks therefore for the comparison of the fios removal it was only needed to consider the different biological treatment and different separation processes which is either through the settling tanks in the cas systems or in the same tank for the ags systems 4 1 fios concentrations in raw and treated wastewater the expected concentrations of f specific rna bacteriophages in raw wastewater has been reported to range approximately from 104 to 106 pfu 100 ml de luca et al 2013 mcminn et al 2017 thwaites et al 2018 zhang and farahbakhsh 2007 the concentration of faecal coliforms e coli ttc and enterococcus in raw wastewater ranges from 106 to 107 cfu 100 ml henze et al 2008 chahal et al 2016 reported for e coli concentrations of 104 to 109 cfu 100 ml and matthews et al 2010 reported for enterococcus from 105 to 106 cfu 100 ml the arithmetic mean concentrations of those types of organisms in raw wastewater analysed in the current study agrees with previous studies 4 2 log10 removal the log10 removal of f specific rna bacteriophages have been reported to range from 1 5 up to 2 8 in cas systems hata et al 2013 ulbricht et al 2013 the results obtained in our study are in accordance with those reported values regarding the faecal indicator bacteria the determined log10 removal values for the cas systems in our research at both vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps ranged from 1 1 to 1 9 slightly lower than the values reported in the literature the microbiological methods are standardized therefore the differences between the reported data and the present study might be because our cas systems are compared with cas systems which have primary and sometimes tertiary treatment for example ottoson et al 2006a reported removal values of 3 2 0 8 3 2 0 1 and 3 5 0 85 for e coli enterococcus and f specific bacteriophages in a cas system with primary sedimentation and sand filters little is known about the specific contribution per unit on the removal efficiency however not strong contribution of fios removal was observed after a pre treatment stage being an underground septic tank purnell et al 2016 and a primary sedimentation tank stefanakis et al 2019 therefore the sand filtration unit must have increased the fios removal rates in case of ottoson et al 2006a in this study the only significant difference in fios removal measured when comparing the cas process at garmerwolde wwtp with the cas process at vroomshoop wwtp was for the f specific rna bacteriophages 2 1 log10 versus 1 3 log10 however when looking at fig 2 the average values for all fios removal were higher for garmerwolde cas process compared to vroomshoop this can be explained by reviewing the pathogen removal mechanisms in wastewater treatment systems it may be expected that due to the fios isoelectric point they get attached to the flocs and then end up the sludge line with a high probability to remain alive in the sludge cake guzman et al 2007 due to the ferric iron dosing in the unit a which contributes to the floc formation the two stage ab cas process in garmerwolde wwtp might enable extra fios removal through flocculation vroomshoop is operated as a carrousel and does not have ferric iron dosing moreover the cas system at vroomshoop wwtp receives the excess waste sludge from the ags system pronk et al 2017 which may result in an additional accumulation of fios in the biological tank in garmerwolde wwtp the excess sludge is directly discharged to the sludge digestion line another removal mechanism in cas systems such as biological predation in the aeration tank by protozoa organisms have been broadly studied madoni 1994 a 1994 b predation might equally affect bacteriophages and faecal bacteria but an extra biological removal mechanism might occur for bacteria such as cell lysis using e coli or enterococcus as preferred organism for human virus and bacteriophages replication young 1992 reproduction of the host bacteria is a prerequisite to get infected by bacteriophages grabow 2001 since the experimental period of this study was carried out during winter and spring with a low range of temperature bacteria lysis by bacteriophages replication likely not contributed in the removal in line with wen et al 2009 findings the overall low bacterial and viral indicators removal efficiencies found in this study could have been influenced by the low temperatures in which the campaign was carried out 15 c the lower the temperature lesser amount of bacteria is expected to be adsorbed into a solid phase those effects can be due to changes of the water microbial surface viscosity reduction of some chemical physical adsorption properties and changes physiology of the organisms hendricks et al 1979 stevik et al 2004 with respect to the two ags systems vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps both systems showed a similar fios removal efficiency results indicate that the differences in the flow treated and the treated organic loading rate had little impact on the fios removal when comparing ags with cas systems the fios removal in the two ags systems showed to be statistically similar as in the cas systems for the two wwtps our results are in accordance with a previous study conducted by thwaites et al 2018 who compared the removal of related fios in pilot scale ags and cas systems the design and operational conditions of the full scale ags systems such as absence of primary treatment solid liquid separation occurring in the same biological reactor a short sedimentation period and shorter hrt than in the cas systems may have an effect on the fios removal mechanisms however although different mechanisms might be taking place in the cas and ags systems the overall amount of fios removal was found to be similar the operational conditions of an ags system determine the formation of a spherical shaped granule which surface can function as adsorption area for fios little is known about whether fios can be adsorbed or attached to the surface of the granular biomass thwaites et al 2018 applied a method to compare the detachment of fios from particulate materials in cas and mature ags contrary to the f specific rna bacteriophages their results showed larger separation of sulphite reducing clostridia e coli and total coliforms from the ags than cas the applied technique was not selective enough to distinguish which mechanism absorption or single adhesion to the granule surface was involved thus additional studies were recommended to understand the contribution of the granular composition in the fios removals moreover attachment of ciliate protozoa on the surface area of the granules can also take place facilitating biological predation of the fios by the protozoa li et al 2013 thwaites et al 2018 weber et al 2007 the high biomass density in the ags systems can also be a limitation for bacteriophages propagation since the granules may provide shelter to host bacteria rabinovitch et al 2003 therefore further studies are needed to better understand the ags process and how it relates to the pathogen removal mechanisms 4 3 correlation between microbial organisms and water quality related parameters correlations between bacteriophages bacteria indicators and physicochemical parameter removal and wastewater influent concentrations reported in this study are in accordance with previous literature de luca et al 2013 mcminn et al 2017 purnell et al 2016 in agreement with de luca et al 2013 the physicochemical parameters measured in this study better correlated with each other than with the target microorganism removals ottoson et al 2006a b reported removal trends between fios cod and total organic carbon in a cas system for the ags process at garmerwolde correlations between the removal of the fios and cod bod5 and nh4 n were found e coli removal strongly correlated with the tss removal in the ags system at garmerwolde wwtps according to van dijk et al 2018 the rapid liquid bulk separation from the biomass carried out in the biological tank of the ags system causes a disturbance of the biomass during feeding which lead to wash out of particles measured as tss in the effluent which might also include fios the rest of the measured physicochemical water quality related parameters were randomly correlated with the fios removal for both treatment systems and could not be used to predict fios removal in this study 4 4 perspective this research showed the overall removal efficiency of two different full scale ags processes and compared them with the parallel cas systems future priorities should be given to determine how the pathogens are removed specifically in the ags process it is interesting to ascertain to what extend the short settling time or the design configuration of the ags process affects the pathogen removal rate the granular biofilm may also provide a large available surface area for bacteria adhesion but may also play a significant role as carrier material for protozoa ciliates an understanding of the dynamics in the biological tank such as microbial community granule morphology and association with predators might help in clarifying the pathogen removal mechanisms in the ags systems 5 conclusions this work describes for the first time the removal efficiency of faecal indicators at full scale ags systems over a period of six months compared with conventional activated sludge systems valuable information is provided for topics associated to human health risk treated effluent discharge regulations post treatment constraints and disinfection matters the faecal indicator f specific rna bacteriophages e coli enterococci and ttc concentrations in the raw influent wastewater of two wwtps in the netherlands vroomshoop and garmerwolde were found to be comparable with those reported in literature it can be concluded that on average fios statistically significant for f specific rna bacteriophages only were removed less efficiently in a more simple cas configuration carrousel at the vroomshoop wwtp compared to a more complex one ab cas system at the garmerwolde wwtp which might be related to the sludge separation and discharge the results of this study showed that the researched ags systems remove f specific rna bacteriophages e coli enterococci and ttc as efficient as cas systems when treating the same raw influent wastewater however further studies need to be done to determine in how far the removal mechanisms in both systems are comparable finally the f specific rna bacteriophage better correlated with nh4 n bod5 cod po4 p and tss removals than the rest of the bacteria indicators at the two evaluated wwtps the measured water quality parameters could not accurately predict fios removal at any of

20003,the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the novel aerobic granular sludge ags wastewater treatment technology in removing faecal indicator organisms fios compared to the conventional activated sludge cas treatment system the work was carried out at two full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtp in the netherlands vroomshoop and garmerwolde both treatment plants have a cas and ags system operated in parallel the parallel treatment lines are provided with the same influent wastewater the concentrations of the measured fios in the influent of the two wwtps were comparable with reported literature values as follows f specific rna bacteriophages at 106 pfu 100 ml and escherichia coli e coli enterococci and thermotolerant coliforms ttc at 105 to 106 cfu 100 ml although both systems cas and ags are different in terms of design operation and microbial community both systems showed similar fios removal efficiency at the vroomshoop wwtp log10 removals for f specific rna bacteriophages of 1 4 0 5 and 1 3 0 6 were obtained for the ags and cas systems while at the garmerwolde wwtp log10 removals for f specific rna bacteriophages of 1 9 0 7 and 2 1 0 7 were found for the ags and cas systems correspondingly e coli enterococci and ttc log10 removals of 1 7 0 7 and 1 1 0 7 were achieved for the ags and cas systems at vroomshoop wwtp for garmerwolde wwtp log10 removals of 2 3 0 8 and 1 9 0 7 for the ags and cas systems were found respectively the measured difference in removal rates between the plants was not significant physicochemical water quality parameters such as the concentrations of organic matter nutrients and total suspended solids tss were also determined overall it was not possible to establish a direct correlation between the physicochemical parameters and the removal of fios for any of the treatment systems cas and ags only the removal of tss could be positively correlated to the e coli removal for the ags technology at the evaluated wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge activated sludge faecal indicators f specific rna bacteriophages pathogen removal 1 introduction pathogens enter the aquatic environment through municipal wastewater discharges their occurrence in either treated or raw wastewater may contribute to spreading epidemiological waterborne diseases bijkerk et al 2015 efstratiou et al 2017 several studies have reported that conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp do not completely remove pathogens dias et al 2018 lucena et al 2004 ma et al 2016 ottoson et al 2006a for instance lodder and de roda husman 2005 and van beek et al 2016 reported the presence of noroviruses and enteric viruses in river basins in the netherlands originating from treated municipal wastewater discharges microorganisms such as e coli gram negative enterococci gram positive and total coliforms are commonly used as indicators for faecal contamination carré et al 2018 liu et al 2018 and as water quality standards for water reuse e u 2016 bacteriophages have been used as an indicator for the occurrence of viral pathogens amarasiri et al 2017 dias et al 2018 mcminn et al 2017 particularly the male specific phages f specific rna bacteriophages have been used as indicators considering their strong survival in wastewater treatment process and other water environments mandilara et al 2006 furthermore f specific rna bacteriophages characteristics such as their isoelectric point size 22 29 nm and morphology grabow 2001 lodder and de roda husman 2005 resemble human viruses such as noroviruses and other enteric viruses fauvel et al 2017 bacteriophages are also easier to detect than human viruses inexpensive conventional analytical methods can be used to determine them the municipal wastewater treatment worldwide and particularly in the netherlands where this research was carried out aims at removing organic matter and nutrients roeleveld et al 2010 the conventional activated sludge cas systems is one of the most commonly applied technologies this technology removes carbon c phosphorus p and nitrogen n by treating the raw wastewater in different compartments biological reactors the treated wastewater is finally separated from the biomass by a secondary clarification tank and discharged into the receiving water body orhon 2015 roeleveld et al 2010 cas systems can achieve over 90 removal of c p and n moreover cas systems are effective in removing pathogens matthews et al 2010 and amarasiri et al 2017 reported removal efficiencies of faecal indicator organisms fios such as f specific rna bacteriophages and total coliforms of 99 5 and higher fios may be either physically removed being enmeshed into the flocs during the sedimentation process chahal et al 2016 fauvel et al 2017 guzman et al 2007 or biologically predated by other high order organisms such as protozoa mallory et al 1983 aerobic granular sludge ags wastewater treatment systems have recently emerged as an alternative to the cas process ags systems simultaneously remove organic matter and nutrients in a single compartment by promoting the formation of a granular biofilm beun et al 1999 the bacteria are able to aggregate forming dense granules of a spherical shape with a much higher settling velocity compared to cas sludge flocs therefore the separation of the biomass granules from the treated water can be easily achieved by sedimentation de kreuk et al 2007 khan et al 2013 both the biological degradation of organic matter and nutrients and the solid liquid separation process occurs in a single basin according to pronk et al 2015 full scale ags systems may reach c p and n removals on average of 87 86 and 86 respectively however the performance of full scale ags systems on pathogen removal is still unknown the objective of this study was to compare the removal of fios in two full scale wastewater treatment plants in the netherlands provided with both ags and cas systems operated in parallel the ags and cas systems were evaluated on their removal of f specific bacteriophages e coli enterococci and thermotolerant coliforms ttc standard water quality parameters such as chemical organic matter cod ammonium nh4 n biological organic matter bod5 orthophosphate po4 p total suspended solids tss and their relation with the removal of the microbiological organisms was evaluated as well in order to see whether water quality parameters can be used to predict fios removals 2 materials and methods 2 1 treatment facilities this research was performed at two different wastewater treatment plants wwtp in the netherlands vroomshoop 52 26 49 0 n 6 33 52 6 e and garmerwolde 53 14 51 8 n 6 40 19 6 e pronk et al 2015 the wwtps were initially designed as cas systems for treating municipal wastewater later on ags systems were incorporated in both wwtps both processes at the two wwtps cas and ags work in parallel receiving the same wastewater moreover both of them are lacking primary and tertiary treatment fig 1 the cas systems operate in a continuous flow mode and were designed to remove organic matter c and nutrients n and p the vroomshoop wwtp was designed as a biological carrousel cas system while the garmerwolde wwtp as a two stage ab adsorption bio oxidation cas configuration with ferric iron dosing in the unit a for p removal the ags systems located at both wwtps consist of a buffer tank designed to store the influent raw wastewater followed by a biological tank containing the granular biomass where all conversions simultaneously occur the ags systems are operated as sequencing batch reactors table 1 describes the operational conditions for each treatment system at each wwtp 2 2 sample collection grab samples were collected once a month on two consecutive days from december 2017 to may 2018 for each wwtp at three different sampling points 1 influent wastewater 2 cas treated effluent and 3 ags treated effluent the influent wastewater samples shown in fig 1 as influent 1 represent the raw municipal wastewater after passing through a grit removal process and before reaching either the cas system or the ags system s buffer tank the cas treated effluent samples shown in fig 1 as effluent cas 2 were taken directly from the overflow weir of the cas settling tank the ags treated effluent samples shown in fig 1 as effluent ags 3 were collected from the effluent discharge channel after completing one entire batch cycle the water temperature during the sample campaign ranged between 9 c and 15 c 2 3 sample analysis the influent and effluent samples were stored in plastic bottles and were shipped in dark containers refrigerated at 4 c within 24 h to two different laboratories as follows bacteriophages were determined at the wnl laboratory glimmen the netherlands other microbiological e coli ttc enterococci and physicochemical parameters cod bod5 nh4 n po4 p and tss were determined at the als laboratory prague czech republic water temperature and do concentrations were collected directly from the wwtps at the same time the samples were taken the determinations of the physicochemical parameters were carried out according to the standard methods apha 2012 for the examination of water and wastewater the determination of the microbiological parameter is explained below 2 3 1 bacteriophages detection f specific rna bacteriophages were enumerated in duplicate following the double layer method according to iso 10705 1 anon 2000c the samples were 10 100 and 1000 folds diluted in a saline water solution and then one 1 ml of sample was mixed together with one 1 ml of 3 h cultured bacterium host salmonella typhimurium strain wg49 each sample was mixed in a semi solid nutrient agar and poured in a solid nutrient agar plate samples were then incubated at 37 c for 18 h for enumeration each plaque in the bacterial mat was counted as one bacteriophage unit f specific rna bacteriophages were determined by plaque forming units pfu the detection limit was reported at 1 pfu 100 ml 2 3 2 bacteria enumeration the analytical determinations of e coli and ttc bacteria were performed following the membrane filtration technique for enumeration according to the standard csn 75 7835 which is a modified method of the standard method iso 9308 1 anon 2000b for samples with excessive growth of the accompanying microflora for enumeration samples were 10 100 and 1000 folds diluted in a phosphate buffered saline pbs solution samples were plated on chromocult merck millipore medium agar for e coli detection and plated in 4 methylumbelliferyl beta d glucuronide e coli broth for ttc detection later they were cultivated 24 h at 37 2 c and 44 2 c for e coli and ttc respectively enterococci detection and enumeration was performed by the same membrane filtration method according to the standard iso 7899 2 anon 2000a the samples were cultivated in the slanetz and bartley medium oxoidtm for 24 h at 44 2 c confirmatory colour reaction tests were also performed to discard false positive by placing the samples in a bile esculin agar sigma aldrich germany all bacteria e coli ttc and enterococci were enumerated by agar plate colony forming units cfu the detection limit was reported at 1 cfu 100 ml 2 4 data analysis a statistical analysis was performed on the twelve samples collected at each wwtp for each target organism data is presented in box whisker plots in which the horizontal line across each box represents the median the interquartile ranges 50 of the score of the data and the outliers represent the confident limit of 95 of the determined concentrations fios concentrations were converted to log10 the removal efficiencies log10 were calculated considering the concentration of the influent wastewater reaching the wwtps and the treated effluent discharges for each specific treatment process ags and cas shapiro wilk normality test was applied to the converted log10 concentrations of the target fios to the unconverted data of the studied physicochemical parameters and their corresponded removal efficiencies the log10 fio removal showed to be normally distributed therefore the two paired student s t distribution t test 95 confidence analyses were performed to check whether statistically significant differences on the fios removal efficiencies exist on i similar processes that is cas at vroomshoop versus cas at garmerwolde and ags at vroomshoop versus ags at garmerwolde and ii on different processes at each wwtp that is cas versus ags at both vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps a p value 0 05 was used to bind the statistical significance moreover pearson s product correlation analyses were performed to determine the possibility for establishing potential trends among the fios removal efficiencies and the spearman s rank relationship was applied to the comparison of i the fios and physicochemical concentrations of the influent wastewater ii the fios removal efficiency with the removal efficiency of the target standard water quality parameters the statistical analysis was carried out to determine the presence of any association by calculating the product correlation value from 1 to 1 moreover the p value for each correlation was calculated to determine whether the association was significant p value 0 05 or not calculations were statistical computing using r r core team 2019 3 results 3 1 fios concentrations in raw and treated wastewater fig 2 and fig 3 show box whisker plots of the fios concentrations obtained from each sampling point at the vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps respectively this corresponds to the microorganism concentration in the raw wastewater influent to the plant and the treated effluent from each treatment system ags and cas regarding influent flow wastewater f specific rna bacteriophages were detected in both wwtps at an arithmetic mean concentration of 106 pfu 100 ml enterococci were detected at mean concentrations of 105 cfu 100 ml and ttc and e coli bacteria both at the same order of magnitude 106 cfu 100 ml in both wwtps the average concentrations for each of the evaluated fios were of similar magnitude for the two wwtps however no significant correlation was found between the occurrences of the four groups of organisms p value 0 05 the main variations in the fios concentrations observed during the sampling campaign minimum and maximum values shown in figs 2 and 3 can be explained by the hydraulic and seasonal variations when conducting this evaluation the daily influent flow rate of both wwtps fluctuates considerably between rain and dry weather flow at the vroomshoop wwtp the minimum influent concentrations for all the target organisms were approximately between one to three orders of magnitude lower than the average concentrations these lower values were measured in samples that were diluted with rain water because they were taken during rainy weather flow rwf events with a flowrate of around 800 m3 h being more than 63 of the operational design average peak flow table 1 moreover variations from one to four orders of magnitude were observed at the garmerwolde wwtp high values were measured in samples taken at a dry weather flow period with a reported flowrate of 2300 m3 h corresponding to only 15 of the operational design average dry flow at garmerwolde wwtp although fluctuations in the influent wastewater flow were observed which had an effect on the concentrations of the target organism the correlation was not significant moreover also no significant correlations were found between the water temperature that gradually increased from 9 c in winter to 15 c in spring and the concentrations of the target organisms the mean concentrations of the target organisms in the treated effluent of the different processes ags and cas were not significantly different for the two studied wwtps for vroomshoop the average concentrations of the different fios in the ags treated effluent were slightly lower than the cas treated effluent however the minimum and maximum concentrations showed a high variation for garmerwolde the average concentration of the different fios were of the same order of magnitude in the ags and cas treated effluent minimum and maximum followed similar tendency as at vroomshoop 3 2 log10 removal the average log10 removals and the standard deviations for the different evaluated fios per treatment plant are shown in fig 4 the p values obtained from the statistical analysis are presented in table 2 log10 removal values for f specific rna bacteriophages of 1 34 0 60 95 5 removal and 2 13 0 69 99 3 removal were reported for the cas carrousel configuration at vroomshoop and for the ab cas configuration at garmerwolde respectively this difference is statistically significant p value 0 007 0 05 no significant statistical differences p value 0 05 could be reported for the rest of the evaluated fios between the different cas systems e coli average log10 removals of 1 12 0 69 94 4 removal and 1 65 0 68 97 8 removal were reported at the vroomshoop and garmerwolde cas wwtps respectively correspondently values of 1 60 0 85 97 3 removal and 1 88 0 80 98 7 removal were reported for ttc at vroomshoop and garmerwolde cas wwtps respectively and 1 33 0 69 95 5 removal and 1 92 0 65 98 8 removal for enterococci at vroomshoop and garmerwolde cas wwtps respectively regarding the ags treatment systems no significant statistical differences p value 0 05 were reported when comparing the log10 removal of the evaluated fios at the ags systems located at the two evaluated wwtps vroomshoop versus garmerwolde f specific rna bacteriophages log10 removals of 1 38 0 50 95 8 and 1 88 0 74 98 6 e coli log10 removals of 1 29 0 64 94 9 and 1 86 0 94 98 6 ttc log10 removals of 2 26 0 78 99 5 and 2 05 0 69 99 0 and enterococci 1 96 0 47 98 9 and 1 67 0 66 97 9 were measured for the vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps respectively comparing the two different wastewater treatment processes ags versus cas no significant statistical differences p value 0 05 were observed for the removal of the fios by the two treatment technologies at the two evaluated wwtps 3 3 correlation between microbial organisms and water quality related parameters except for tss at vroomshoop f specific rna bacteriophage concentrations in the influent wastewater at both wwtps significantly correlated with the concentrations of the measured physicochemical water quality parameters the rest of the bacteria indicators showed better correlations with the physicochemical parameters at garmerwolde wwtp compared to vroomshoop regarding the fios removal efficiency the f specific rna bacteriophage removal measured at garmerwolde wwtp significantly correlated with ttc removal p 0 03 in the cas system and with enterococci

physicochemical water quality parameters removal efficiencies strongly correlated with each other at both wwtps data not shown but apparently not to all the observed fios removal for the cas process at vroomshoop f specific rna bacteriophages showed a significant correlation with most of the studied physicochemical parameters moreover both the enterococci and the e coli removal had a significant correlation with nh4 n po4 p and tss conversely ttc removal showed no substantial association with any of the measured parameters for the garmerwolde cas process a significant correlation was observed between f specific rna bacteriophages and the chemical po4 p removal and the tss enterococcus ttc and e coli did not significantly correlate with any of the studied parameters for the ags system located at vroomshoop the f specific rna bacteriophages removal showed a significant correlation with the bod5 po4 p removals and it was the only indicator affected by water temperature changes table 3 except for e coli which was positively correlated with the po4 p any bacteria indicator significantly correlated with the removals of any of the studied water quality parameters for the ags at garmerwolde f specific rna bacteriophages and enterococcus were positively correlated with the chemical parameters nh4 n bod5 cod and po4 p while e coli showed a positive correlation with the physical parameter tss ttc were associated with nh4 n cod bod5 and it was the only indicator that showed to be significantly affected by the do concentration 4 discussion the main objective of this study was to compare the removal of faecal indicators in ags systems and cas systems to this purpose detection and enumeration of f specific rna bacteriophages e coli enterococci and ttc were analysed in raw and the treated wastewater of two full scale wwtps in the netherlands the cas and ags systems studied were both engineered for domestic wastewater treatment they manage to efficiently remove representative water quality parameters such as organic matter tss and total nitrogen and phosphorous this in line with the eu water directive 91 271 eec on urban waste water treatment cas systems are based on interaction between bacteria and sewage with relatively large land requirements for biological treatment sludge recycling and separation henze et al 2008 the better understanding on the interaction between substrate and bacteria led the development of the ags system in which denser granular biomass is formed and simultaneously remove organic matter and nutrients in only one biological tank de kreuk et al 2005 this improvement has resulted in energy savings 20 50 while compared to cas systems pronk et al 2017 and other technologies such as membrane bioreactors purnell et al 2016 moreover less area is required compared to cas systems or other technologies such as trickling filters and constructed wetlands stefanakis et al 2019 those processes normally include primary treatment and in the case of cas a secondary sedimentation tank after the biological treatment to separate sludge from the liquid bulk in this study both studied wwtps vroomshoop and garmerwolde lack primary settling tanks therefore for the comparison of the fios removal it was only needed to consider the different biological treatment and different separation processes which is either through the settling tanks in the cas systems or in the same tank for the ags systems 4 1 fios concentrations in raw and treated wastewater the expected concentrations of f specific rna bacteriophages in raw wastewater has been reported to range approximately from 104 to 106 pfu 100 ml de luca et al 2013 mcminn et al 2017 thwaites et al 2018 zhang and farahbakhsh 2007 the concentration of faecal coliforms e coli ttc and enterococcus in raw wastewater ranges from 106 to 107 cfu 100 ml henze et al 2008 chahal et al 2016 reported for e coli concentrations of 104 to 109 cfu 100 ml and matthews et al 2010 reported for enterococcus from 105 to 106 cfu 100 ml the arithmetic mean concentrations of those types of organisms in raw wastewater analysed in the current study agrees with previous studies 4 2 log10 removal the log10 removal of f specific rna bacteriophages have been reported to range from 1 5 up to 2 8 in cas systems hata et al 2013 ulbricht et al 2013 the results obtained in our study are in accordance with those reported values regarding the faecal indicator bacteria the determined log10 removal values for the cas systems in our research at both vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps ranged from 1 1 to 1 9 slightly lower than the values reported in the literature the microbiological methods are standardized therefore the differences between the reported data and the present study might be because our cas systems are compared with cas systems which have primary and sometimes tertiary treatment for example ottoson et al 2006a reported removal values of 3 2 0 8 3 2 0 1 and 3 5 0 85 for e coli enterococcus and f specific bacteriophages in a cas system with primary sedimentation and sand filters little is known about the specific contribution per unit on the removal efficiency however not strong contribution of fios removal was observed after a pre treatment stage being an underground septic tank purnell et al 2016 and a primary sedimentation tank stefanakis et al 2019 therefore the sand filtration unit must have increased the fios removal rates in case of ottoson et al 2006a in this study the only significant difference in fios removal measured when comparing the cas process at garmerwolde wwtp with the cas process at vroomshoop wwtp was for the f specific rna bacteriophages 2 1 log10 versus 1 3 log10 however when looking at fig 2 the average values for all fios removal were higher for garmerwolde cas process compared to vroomshoop this can be explained by reviewing the pathogen removal mechanisms in wastewater treatment systems it may be expected that due to the fios isoelectric point they get attached to the flocs and then end up the sludge line with a high probability to remain alive in the sludge cake guzman et al 2007 due to the ferric iron dosing in the unit a which contributes to the floc formation the two stage ab cas process in garmerwolde wwtp might enable extra fios removal through flocculation vroomshoop is operated as a carrousel and does not have ferric iron dosing moreover the cas system at vroomshoop wwtp receives the excess waste sludge from the ags system pronk et al 2017 which may result in an additional accumulation of fios in the biological tank in garmerwolde wwtp the excess sludge is directly discharged to the sludge digestion line another removal mechanism in cas systems such as biological predation in the aeration tank by protozoa organisms have been broadly studied madoni 1994 a 1994 b predation might equally affect bacteriophages and faecal bacteria but an extra biological removal mechanism might occur for bacteria such as cell lysis using e coli or enterococcus as preferred organism for human virus and bacteriophages replication young 1992 reproduction of the host bacteria is a prerequisite to get infected by bacteriophages grabow 2001 since the experimental period of this study was carried out during winter and spring with a low range of temperature bacteria lysis by bacteriophages replication likely not contributed in the removal in line with wen et al 2009 findings the overall low bacterial and viral indicators removal efficiencies found in this study could have been influenced by the low temperatures in which the campaign was carried out 15 c the lower the temperature lesser amount of bacteria is expected to be adsorbed into a solid phase those effects can be due to changes of the water microbial surface viscosity reduction of some chemical physical adsorption properties and changes physiology of the organisms hendricks et al 1979 stevik et al 2004 with respect to the two ags systems vroomshoop and garmerwolde wwtps both systems showed a similar fios removal efficiency results indicate that the differences in the flow treated and the treated organic loading rate had little impact on the fios removal when comparing ags with cas systems the fios removal in the two ags systems showed to be statistically similar as in the cas systems for the two wwtps our results are in accordance with a previous study conducted by thwaites et al 2018 who compared the removal of related fios in pilot scale ags and cas systems the design and operational conditions of the full scale ags systems such as absence of primary treatment solid liquid separation occurring in the same biological reactor a short sedimentation period and shorter hrt than in the cas systems may have an effect on the fios removal mechanisms however although different mechanisms might be taking place in the cas and ags systems the overall amount of fios removal was found to be similar the operational conditions of an ags system determine the formation of a spherical shaped granule which surface can function as adsorption area for fios little is known about whether fios can be adsorbed or attached to the surface of the granular biomass thwaites et al 2018 applied a method to compare the detachment of fios from particulate materials in cas and mature ags contrary to the f specific rna bacteriophages their results showed larger separation of sulphite reducing clostridia e coli and total coliforms from the ags than cas the applied technique was not selective enough to distinguish which mechanism absorption or single adhesion to the granule surface was involved thus additional studies were recommended to understand the contribution of the granular composition in the fios removals moreover attachment of ciliate protozoa on the surface area of the granules can also take place facilitating biological predation of the fios by the protozoa li et al 2013 thwaites et al 2018 weber et al 2007 the high biomass density in the ags systems can also be a limitation for bacteriophages propagation since the granules may provide shelter to host bacteria rabinovitch et al 2003 therefore further studies are needed to better understand the ags process and how it relates to the pathogen removal mechanisms 4 3 correlation between microbial organisms and water quality related parameters correlations between bacteriophages bacteria indicators and physicochemical parameter removal and wastewater influent concentrations reported in this study are in accordance with previous literature de luca et al 2013 mcminn et al 2017 purnell et al 2016 in agreement with de luca et al 2013 the physicochemical parameters measured in this study better correlated with each other than with the target microorganism removals ottoson et al 2006a b reported removal trends between fios cod and total organic carbon in a cas system for the ags process at garmerwolde correlations between the removal of the fios and cod bod5 and nh4 n were found e coli removal strongly correlated with the tss removal in the ags system at garmerwolde wwtps according to van dijk et al 2018 the rapid liquid bulk separation from the biomass carried out in the biological tank of the ags system causes a disturbance of the biomass during feeding which lead to wash out of particles measured as tss in the effluent which might also include fios the rest of the measured physicochemical water quality related parameters were randomly correlated with the fios removal for both treatment systems and could not be used to predict fios removal in this study 4 4 perspective this research showed the overall removal efficiency of two different full scale ags processes and compared them with the parallel cas systems future priorities should be given to determine how the pathogens are removed specifically in the ags process it is interesting to ascertain to what extend the short settling time or the design configuration of the ags process affects the pathogen removal rate the granular biofilm may also provide a large available surface area for bacteria adhesion but may also play a significant role as carrier material for protozoa ciliates an understanding of the dynamics in the biological tank such as microbial community granule morphology and association with predators might help in clarifying the pathogen removal mechanisms in the ags systems 5 conclusions this work describes for the first time the removal efficiency of faecal indicators at full scale ags systems over a period of six months compared with conventional activated sludge systems valuable information is provided for topics associated to human health risk treated effluent discharge regulations post treatment constraints and disinfection matters the faecal indicator f specific rna bacteriophages e coli enterococci and ttc concentrations in the raw influent wastewater of two wwtps in the netherlands vroomshoop and garmerwolde were found to be comparable with those reported in literature it can be concluded that on average fios statistically significant for f specific rna bacteriophages only were removed less efficiently in a more simple cas configuration carrousel at the vroomshoop wwtp compared to a more complex one ab cas system at the garmerwolde wwtp which might be related to the sludge separation and discharge the results of this study showed that the researched ags systems remove f specific rna bacteriophages e coli enterococci and ttc as efficient as cas systems when treating the same raw influent wastewater however further studies need to be done to determine in how far the removal mechanisms in both systems are comparable finally the f specific rna bacteriophage better correlated with nh4 n bod5 cod po4 p and tss removals than the rest of the bacteria indicators at the two evaluated wwtps the measured water quality parameters could not accurately predict fios removal at any of

20004,ascaris eggs are commonly used as indicators for pathogen inactivation during the treatment of fecal sludge and wastewater due to their highly resistant lipid membrane and ability to survive in the environment for long periods of time current guidelines suggest that thermal treatment alone cannot inactivate ascaris eggs at temperatures below 45 c although some evidence in the literature suggests this to be incorrect here we performed a controlled experiment to test the effect of mesophilic temperatures on ascaris inactivation we exposed ascaris suum eggs to a temperature gradient between 34 c and 45 c under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to observe the required exposure times for a 3 log reduction indeed we found that temperatures lower than 45 c did inactivate these eggs and the required exposure times were up to two orders of magnitude shorter than suggested by current guidelines results from the anaerobic exposures were used to develop a time temperature relationship that is appropriate for ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures data from the literature demonstrated that our relationship is conservative with faster inactivation occurring under environmental conditions when ascaris eggs were suspended in fecal sludge or manure a specific aerobic relationship was not developed but we demonstrated that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation than anaerobic conditions therefore the anaerobic relationship provides a conservative guideline for both conditions we demonstrate that relatively low temperatures can considerably impact ascaris viability and suggest that mesophilic temperatures can be used in waste treatment processes to inactivate pathogens the development of safe low input mesophilic treatment processes is particularly valuable for ensuring universal access to safe sanitation and excreta management graphical abstract image 1 keywords ascaris pathogens mesophilic thermal inactivation sanitation fecal sludge 1 introduction the intestinal roundworm ascaris lumbricoides is widely considered to be the most resistant pathogen to disinfection processes in human fecal sludge and wastewater feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 a lumbricoides infects approximately 1 3 billion people worldwide and is spread by fecal oral transmission particularly in areas with poor access to sanitation de silva et al 1997 eggs are passed into the environment through feces and have been shown to survive and retain infectivity for many years brudastov et al 1970 due to their extreme resistance ascaris eggs are often used as indicators of pathogen inactivation when testing treatment methods for wastewater and fecal sludge the resistance of ascaris eggs to thermal inactivation is of particular interest here time temperature recommendations for using heat to inactivate fecal pathogens are provided by feachem et al 1983 and the us environmental protection agency us epa 40 cfr part 503 regulations us epa 2003 both guidelines consider ascaris eggs to be among the most resistant pathogens to thermal inactivation feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 according to the us epa regulations ascaris viability is not substantially reduced at temperatures between 32 c and 38 c and complete reduction at 38 c 50 c is still not guaranteed us epa 2003 therefore feachem et al and the us epa suggest a minimum temperature of 45 c and 50 c respectively for any thermal treatment disqualifying many treatment options such as mesophilic 45 c anaerobic or aerobic digestion feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 previous work already demonstrated that the feachem and us epa guidelines were extremely conservative at thermophilic temperatures aitken et al 2005 popat et al 2010 manser et al 2015 demonstrated that mesophilic inactivation was feasible with ascaris inactivation observed at 35 c after exposure times of 16 24 days in anaerobic digesters and in phosphate buffer solutions several additional studies have investigated the effect of temperature on inactivation by other measures such as ammonia ph and peracetic acid fidjeland et al 2015 ghiglietti et al 1995 maya et al 2012 nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 all of these studies show that small changes in mesophilic temperatures have a large effect on inactivation rates and the control treatments from some of these studies can also be used to examine the effect of temperature alone the combined evidence from these studies clearly indicates that the recommended minimum temperature threshold for ascaris inactivation is too high but little work has been performed to decisively prove this or to establish a time temperature relationship that is appropriate for mesophilic temperatures the feachem and us epa guidelines also make no distinction between time temperature requirements for anaerobic and aerobic conditions but inactivation has been found to be faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions manser et al 2015 embryonic development of larvae occurs only in the presence of oxygen and the eggshell is expected to weaken during this process leaving the larvae more vulnerable to inactivation this process is further supported by studies that have found faster inactivation of embryonated eggs compared to unembryonated eggs maya et al 2012 the effect of anaerobic versus aerobic conditions may be particularly important at mesophilic temperatures compared to thermophilic temperatures because longer exposure times will be required during which embryonic development can occur current beliefs about the temperature limits for thermal inactivation may be preventing development of useful low input treatment processes that could help provide safe excreta management for the 4 5 billion people that currently live without it who and unicef 2017 to better understand these temperature limits we exposed ascaris suum eggs to temperatures between 34 c and 45 c for a range of exposure times under anaerobic and aerobic conditions we used this data to 1 determine exposure times required to achieve a 3 log reduction of ascaris viability at each temperature 2 develop a new time temperature relationship that can be used to predict ascaris inactivation in this range and 3 compare with evidence from the literature to confirm that our relationship is conservative but reasonable 2 methods a suum eggs were collected from fecal material in the intestines of naturally infected pigs and used as surrogates for a lumbricoides in this study collected fecal material was passed through a series of six sieves ranging from us 10 us 100 to remove large debris and eggs were collected on a us 500 sieve the eggs were later purified from additional small debris by centrifugal flotation in a magnesium sulfate solution specific gravity 1 2 at 800 g for 5 min eggs were stored at 4 c in 0 1 n h2so4 until use a series of four exposure trials was conducted with results from earlier trials used to select appropriate treatment conditions in subsequent trials table 1 temperatures ranged between 34 c and 45 c temperatures below 34 c were not tested because ascaris eggs have been shown to form mobile larvae when incubated aerobically at temperatures up to 34 c arene 1986 for each treatment 1000 a suum eggs were suspended in 1 5 ml 0 1 n h2so4 in a 2 0 ml microcentrifuge tube anaerobic and aerobic conditions were tested the tube caps for all treatments were left open and sealed with parafilm bemis na neenah wi to allow for gas exchange tubes for anaerobic treatments were kept in gas tight chambers that were made anaerobic using gaspak ez anaerobe sachets bd sparks md and indicator strips bd sparks md were used to confirm anaerobic conditions tubes were stored in the dark in incubators and temperatures were monitored using data loggers hobo ux100 003 bourne ma and lascar electronics el usb 1 eerie pa all treatments were performed in duplicate after the designated exposure times eggs were removed from incubators and transferred to 24 well plates where they were suspended in 0 1 n h2so4 and incubated aerobically at 28 c for 3 weeks in the dark to promote larval development the 24 well plates were monitored throughout the incubation period and additional 0 1 n h2so4 was added as needed to replace evaporated solution eggs were examined microscopically before and after the 3 week incubation for eggs treated under anaerobic conditions pre incubation examination confirmed that they had not begun developing during treatment which would have indicated oxygen exposure for all treatments viability was quantified after the 3 week incubation period approximately 500 eggs were examined in each well eggs that had formed larvae were considered viable and all others were considered nonviable if no viable eggs were found in the initial 500 the remaining eggs in the well were examined to a maximum of 1000 eggs reported percent viabilities are normalized to the baseline viability of the a suum eggs used for a given trial table 1 baseline viability was determined by incubating a suum eggs aerobically at 28 c for 3 weeks with no prior treatment when chemically or thermally treating ascaris eggs a lag period is expected with minimal loss of viability followed by a region of exponential inactivation nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 for most treatments in the present study the initial sampling time occurred after the lag period therefore only exponential decline was observed and inactivation was modeled using linear regression 1 l n n n 0 k t b where n 0 is the baseline percent viability of the a suum eggs used for the trial table 1 n is the percent viability of the a suum eggs exposed to a given temperature for time t in days k is the first order inactivation constant and b is the y intercept which gives some indication of the expected but unobserved lag period if viability was below the detection limit for multiple exposure times then only the shortest time was used in the regression analysis and viability at that time was assumed to equal the detection limit the linear regression equations for each temperature were then used to calculate the exposure time required to achieve a 3 log reduction in viability t 3 next linear regression of the base ten logarithms of the anaerobic t 3 values versus temperature were used to develop a new time temperature relationship for ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval for each t 3 value was used to develop a conservative relationship and a literature review was performed to compile additional evidence of ascaris inactivation at temperatures below 45 c all statistical analysis was performed using r r core team 2018 and confidence intervals were calculated using the chemcal package ranke 2018 finally we compared our time temperature relationship to relationships provided by the feachem guidelines and the us epa part 503 guidelines for producing class a biosolids feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 feachem et al 1983 provides a figure with a zone of safety of time temperature combinations that are expected to cause inactivation of ascaris eggs based on literature studies but the detection limits or degrees of inactivation in these studies are not known the equation for the boundary of the zone of safety is also not given but was derived elsewhere equation 2 where t feachem is the required exposure time in hours and t is the temperature in c vinnerås et al 2003 2 t f e a c h e m 1 77 10 2 10 0 1944 t 45 the us epa recommended exposure time was calculated based on the time temperature equation for sewage sludge with less than 7 total solids and a contact time of at least 30 min equation 3 where t epa is the required exposure time in days and t is the temperature in c us epa 2003 3 t e p a 5 007 10 7 10 0 14 t equation 3 is expected to create class a biosolids that contain less than 1 viable ascaris egg per 4 g biosolids dry weight basis equation 3 represents the least stringent of the four time temperature relationships given by the epa and was chosen here because our experimental data was collected with ascaris eggs suspended in aqueous solution the corresponding log reduction would depend on the initial concentration of viable eggs in the biosolids it should be noted that the feachem equation and the us epa equation were only intended for use at temperatures 45 c and 50 c respectively but we have extended them here below the recommended minimums for comparison purposes 3 results and discussion 3 1 ascaris inactivation under anaerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions we observed ascaris inactivation at temperatures between 37 c and 45 c when no additional inactivating agents were present fig 1 a and we used linear regression of graphs of ln n 0 n versus time to determine inactivation parameters k and b and the time required for a 3 log reduction in ascaris viability t 3 table 2 at 45 c we observed rapid inactivation under anaerobic conditions with viability reduced below the detection limit within 2 days fig 1a table s1 correspondingly the t 3 calculated by linear regression was 2 12 days table 2 at 40 c under anaerobic conditions we observed a 2 19 log reduction after a maximum exposure time of 16 days fig 1a table s1 and the calculated t 3 from linear regression was 20 5 days table 2 we did not test longer exposure times to confirm the t 3 value but we have high confidence in the regression because all four time points occurred along the exponential portion of the inactivation curve fig 1a and the regression provided a good fit to the data with all inactivation parameters significant at p 0 05 and r2 0 954 table 2 under anaerobic conditions at 39 c the exponential portion of the inactivation curve was fully captured and we found no viable eggs after a 32 day exposure time fig 1a table s1 our linear regression fit the data well and yielded a t 3 of 31 8 days table 2 the longest exposure time tested under anaerobic conditions at 37 c was 40 days at which point the results from the duplicate samples varied viability was reduced below detection 2 84 log reduction for one sample but only a 1 37 log reduction was observed for the second sample fig 1a table s1 correspondingly the t 3 calculated by linear regression 57 5 days was longer than 40 days table 2 the regression line fit the data well r2 0 759 but would be improved with an additional time point beyond 40 days to demonstrate viability below detection in both replicates and an additional point between 21 and 40 days to refine the rate of decline unfortunately the three week incubation time required between the end of the exposure period and examining the eggs for viability prevented us from recognizing the need for these treatments until after the experiment was completed longer exposure times were also needed to improve inactivation predictions under anaerobic conditions at 36 c the longest exposure time we tested was 42 days and we observed minimal inactivation 0 321 log reduction indicating that the exponential portion of the inactivation curve was not observed fig 1a table s1 as expected the resulting linear regression provided a poor fit to the data table 2 3 2 ascaris inactivation under aerobic conditions under aerobic conditions we observed ascaris inactivation at temperatures between 34 c and 45 c with ascaris viability reduced below detection during the tested exposure times at all temperatures inactivation at 45 c under aerobic conditions was similar to the inactivation observed under anaerobic conditions with no viable eggs found after a 2 day exposure time fig 1b table s1 for temperatures between 34 c and 40 c mesophilic inactivation of ascaris eggs was even more effective under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions fig 1b under aerobic conditions at 40 c no viable eggs were found in samples with an 8 day exposure time detection limit 2 69 log reduction however low viability 2 33 log reduction was still observed in samples with a 12 day exposure time and exposure times longer than 12 days were not tested fig 1b table s1 the corresponding t 3 value calculated by linear regression was 12 6 days which was substantially shorter than the 20 5 days calculated for anaerobic conditions at the same temperature table 2 inactivation rates under aerobic conditions at 34 c and 36 c were similar with no viable eggs found after exposure times of 15 days for both temperatures fig 1b table s1 the corresponding t 3 values calculated by linear regression were 16 6 and 16 5 days respectively which are less than half of the longest exposure time tested for 36 c under anaerobic conditions that resulted in minimal inactivation fig 1 table 2 3 3 we developed a time temperature relationship for mesophilic temperatures and anaerobic conditions that is reasonable and conservative our results demonstrate that thermal inactivation of ascaris eggs consistently occurs at temperatures between 37 c and 45 c under anaerobic conditions and between 34 c and 45 c under aerobic conditions which directly contradicts current guidance from feachem et al 1983 and the us epa 2003 that require minimum temperatures of 45 c and 50 c respectively even if lower temperatures were considered sufficient the time temperature relationships provided by these guidelines predict substantially longer inactivation times than we found from our t 3 values table 2 under anaerobic conditions the feachem guidelines suggest exposure times that are 3 5 times larger than our t 3 values and the us epa guidelines suggest times that are up to 12 times larger than ours table 2 under aerobic conditions the differences are even larger particularly at lower temperatures of 34 c and 36 c the recommended exposure time by feachem et al at 34 c is two orders of magnitude larger than our t 3 value table 2 therefore a new time temperature relationship specific for mesophilic temperatures is clearly necessary we developed this relationship using linear regression of the base ten logarithm of our anaerobic t 3 values as a function of temperature rearranged to produce equation 4 4 t h a r r o f f 2 20 10 9 10 0 199 t where t harroff is the exposure time in days required for a 3 log reduction and t is temperature in c the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval was used for each t 3 value to develop a more conservative relationship the t 3 calculated for anaerobic inactivation at 36 c was excluded due to the poor fit of the linear regression model therefore the model should only be applied with confidence to temperatures between 37 c and 45 c under anaerobic conditions to evaluate the appropriateness of our time temperature relationship outside of the current study we compared it to mesophilic inactivation that has been observed previously in literature under anaerobic conditions fig 2 a table s2 cruz espinoza et al 2012 johansen et al 2013 manser et al 2015 nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 scheinemann et al 2015 we selected literature data points that measured ascaris viability without addition of external inactivating agents e g ammonia or volatile fatty acids so inactivation is assumed to occur primarily due to temperature although some variation is expected due to differences in moisture content sludge properties and intrinsic concentrations of inactivating compounds cruz espinoza et al 2012 senecal et al 2018 many of the relevant literature data points were control treatments from larger studies individually these data points prove little about mesophilic thermal inactivation but they provide convincing evidence when combined details about each literature data point in fig 2 as well as other studies that are discussed here are included as supplementary data table s2 details in table s2 include exposure conditions how inactivation times were determined and the degree of inactivation that was measured in each study with all literature data points falling at or below our time temperature relationship and the t 3 values generated from regression of experimental data we conclude that the time temperature relationship developed here is more reasonable than the feachem and us epa relationships for temperatures between 37 c and 45 c while still being conservative the conservative nature of our time temperature relationship can be attributed to the use of aqueous solutions for exposing eggs in our experimental results versus the use of manure or fecal sludge matrices for the literature points past work looking at ascaris inactivation in autoclaved versus non autoclaved anaerobic fecal material at 30 c showed that compounds may be biologically produced during anaerobic fermentation that contribute to ascaris inactivation harroff et al 2017 other studies examining ascaris inactivation by ammonia have also found that results from exposures in aqueous solutions are conservative compared to those in manures and fecal sludge nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 schuh et al 1985 here the relationship that we developed using aqueous exposures appears more conservative at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures indicating that intrinsic inactivating compounds in sludge became less important at warmer temperatures within the mesophilic spectrum fidjeland et al 2015 even though overly conservative guidelines may hamper the use of simple treatment the use of a conservative time temperature relationship is still important for protecting public health when developing waste treatment strategies for this reason our time temperature relationship should still be confirmed at temperatures less than 37 c using exposures in aqueous solutions although literature values demonstrate inactivation at 34 c and 35 c at exposure times less than those predicted by our relationship cruz espinoza et al 2012 manser et al 2015 nordin et al 2009 intrinsic factors in those treatments such as ammonia and solids concentration may have affected inactivation times for example manser et al 2015 observed 99 inactivation of ascaris eggs after 24 days in an anaerobic digester at 35 c but another study observed only 50 inactivation after 35 days in a 35 c digester johnson et al 1998 both times are far below the 238 days required for a 3 log 99 9 inactivation by our time temperature relationship but they suggest a need for more information 3 4 the time temperature relationship we developed also provides conservative recommendations under aerobic conditions recent work by manser et al 2015 compared inactivation times required for ascaris inactivation under anaerobic and aerobic conditions at 34 c 24 days and 16 days respectively and concluded that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation an earlier study compared anaerobic and aerobic digestion at 37 c and 47 c and reached the opposite conclusion that anaerobic conditions caused faster inactivation however the authors acknowledged that the actual temperatures in the aerobic digesters were uncertain due to the use of circulating air to keep them oxygenated therefore the results of that study are inconclusive kato et al 2003 our experimental data supports the conclusion of manser et al 2015 at a range of mesophilic temperatures between 34 c and 40 c fig 1 which has not been shown before in addition our data shows that the effect of oxygen exposure decreases as temperature increases three temperatures 36 c 40 c and 45 c were tested under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions we cannot directly compare the 36 c treatments because exponential decline was not observed under anaerobic conditions but the t 3 calculated for 37 c under anaerobic conditions is 3 5 times larger than the t 3 predicted for 36 c under aerobic conditions table 2 meanwhile at 40 c the t 3 under anaerobic conditions is only 1 6 times larger than the t 3 under aerobic conditions table 2 the t 3 values at 45 c for anaerobic and aerobic conditions are equal which indicates that the effect of oxygen becomes negligible at this temperature table 2 aerobic conditions likely cause faster inactivation because the larvae undergo embryonic development when they have access to oxygen and they consume lipids and carbohydrates within the eggshell to cause structural and chemical changes that may leave the larvae more susceptible to environmental conditions arene 1986 fairbairn 1957 manser et al 2015 however inactivation at 45 c is likely too rapid 2 1 days to allow for significant embryonic development which causes the effect of oxygen presence to be negated previous studies have shown aerobic inactivation at times and temperatures consistent with ours but they did not directly compare inactivation rates under anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig 2b table s2 in control treatments of a ph 7 saline solution ghiglietti et al 1995 observed 99 inactivation of ascaris eggs after exposure to 40 c for 14 days fig 2b aerobic conditions were not explicitly indicated in the ghiglietti study but embryonic development was observed during the exposure time for treatments at lower temperatures so we can assume that oxygen was present in the treatments ghiglietti et al 1995 in comparison our t 3 for 40 c under aerobic conditions was slightly lower at 12 6 days tharaldsen and helle 1989 found that ascaris eggs in mechanically aerated pig manure slurry at 37 c were 99 inactivated between 14 and 22 days which is shown in fig 2b as 22 days and we observed similar inactivation at 36 c with a predicted t 3 of 16 5 days nordin et al 2009 examined ascaris inactivation from different ammonia concentrations at 34 c and reported results that also indicate an effect of aerobic conditions in one treatment of fecal material containing 43 mm nh3 ammonia maximum ph 8 3 total ammonia nh3 nh4 247 mm 99 inactivation was predicted after 21 days using linear regression for a treatment using diluted urine containing 40 mm nh3 ammonia maximum ph 8 7 total ammonia nh3 nh4 131 mm 99 inactivation was predicted after only 8 5 days with similar nh3 ammonia concentrations the study concluded that unmonitored factors contributed to the different inactivation rates we propose here that oxygen was the primary unmonitored factor for the fecal material treatment eggs were contained in mesh bags and inserted in 200 g of fecal material in sealed containers leading to anaerobic conditions for the urine treatment the mesh bags were suspended in urine contained in a sealed 50 ml tube however the tube was opened on days 1 2 7 and 10 for sample collection allowing the urine to be oxygenated each time and decreasing the required exposure time for inactivation a control treatment of 0 9 nacl solution at the same temperature also provided an interesting result because eggs were only 7 inactivated after 31 days based on our experimental results we expect eggs in aerobic conditions at 34 c to be 99 9 inactivated after 16 6 days however results for the control are only reported after 31 days without the frequent sampling interval used for the urine treatment the control would have been anaerobic and we would not expect to see significant inactivation after 31 days results reported for the urine treatment are expectedly faster than ours due to the added inactivating effects of ammonia in the urine other studies have examined the effect of temperature on rates of embryonic development in ascaris and found that eggs could not fully develop into motile larvae at temperatures between 34 c and 45 c arene 1986 gaspard et al 1996 seamster 1950 we cannot predict the required exposure times for these studies because the eggs were never removed from the warmer temperatures but embryonic development is expected to occur within 14 21 days and therefore we can assume that required exposure times would be less than 21 days for temperatures between 34 c and 45 c similarly all of our predicted inactivation times for the same temperature range under aerobic conditions were less than 21 days based on the faster inactivation observed under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions fig 1 table 2 a separate time temperature relationship should be developed for aerobic conditions however more experimental data is needed to accurately capture the effect of oxygen and how it increases at lower temperatures table 2 therefore we recommend using the time temperature relationship developed under anaerobic conditions equation 4 as a conservative predictor for aerobic conditions by comparing our data points under aerobic conditions results from literature under aerobic conditions and our time temperature relationship given by equation 4 we confirm that anaerobic conditions present a conservative case fig 2b these results also demonstrate the importance of strictly maintaining and monitoring anaerobic and aerobic conditions when testing ascaris inactivation by temperature and other mechanisms inactivation that is observed under aerobic conditions may not occur under anaerobic conditions monitoring of additional pathogens may also be required for mesophilic treatment systems particularly under aerobic conditions previous work has shown that escherichia coli and salmonella are also inactivated faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions pandey et al 2016 but the extent to which different pathogens are affected is not known and it is possible that other pathogens will prove more resilient than ascaris eggs under certain conditions 3 5 limitations caution must be used when applying the results and time temperature relationship shown here to large scale systems where required exposure times for inactivation may be affected by uneven heating fluctuating temperatures and shielding effects of solids popat et al 2010 senecal et al 2018 for example composting systems often do not reach expected temperatures leading to poor pathogen inactivation mehl et al 2011 those that do reach proper temperatures have large spatial and temporal variations that make thermal inactivation difficult to predict in one study measured temperatures ranged between 30 c and nearly 50 c in different portions of a compost heap over a 120 day period and over 100 days of exposure was required to observe 99 ascaris inactivation jensen et al 2009 another study observed temperatures 60 c ascaris inactivation would typically be expected within minutes at such high temperatures but 6 days were required to reduce viability below detection indicating pockets with a lower temperature szabová et al 2010 for this reason the us epa guidelines require longer exposure times for sewage sludges with higher solids content us epa 2003 in addition to variation within treatment systems pecson and nelson 2005 also have observed variability in temperature resiliency between batches of ascaris eggs temperature must be closely controlled and monitored for any treatment system relying on thermal inactivation of pathogens for mesophilic systems in particular pathogen inactivation should be verified for each unique system 4 conclusions given adequate exposure times ascaris eggs are consistently inactivated under anaerobic conditions at mesophilic temperatures between 37 c and 45 c and under aerobic conditions at mesophilic temperatures between 34 c and 45 c without the addition of external inactivating agents the relationship t h a r r o f f 2 20 10 9 10 0 199 t can be used to conservatively estimate exposure times t days required to achieve a 3 log reduction of ascaris viability at temperatures t between 37 c and 45 c under both anaerobic and aerobic batch conditions when uniform temperature occurs this relationship is still conservative but much less conservative than current relationships that are used as standards therefore reduction of minimum temperature thresholds in regulations for thermal waste treatment processes should be considered mesophilic waste treatment processes should be given greater consideration when considering how to treat the excreta of the 4 5 billion people globally who currently lack access to safely managed sanitation services who and unicef 2017 mesophilic systems can be less expensive and easier to operate than thermophilic systems and they are shown here to potentially provide adequate pathogen treatment thermal inactivation of ascaris eggs is faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions therefore presence of oxygen should be monitored more closely in research new waste treatment systems should be developed that use this advantage of oxygen to inactivate pathogens ascaris is less resistant to thermal inactivation than is often stated and more work is needed to evaluate the circumstances under which it can be used as a reliable indicator

20004,ascaris eggs are commonly used as indicators for pathogen inactivation during the treatment of fecal sludge and wastewater due to their highly resistant lipid membrane and ability to survive in the environment for long periods of time current guidelines suggest that thermal treatment alone cannot inactivate ascaris eggs at temperatures below 45 c although some evidence in the literature suggests this to be incorrect here we performed a controlled experiment to test the effect of mesophilic temperatures on ascaris inactivation we exposed ascaris suum eggs to a temperature gradient between 34 c and 45 c under anaerobic and aerobic conditions to observe the required exposure times for a 3 log reduction indeed we found that temperatures lower than 45 c did inactivate these eggs and the required exposure times were up to two orders of magnitude shorter than suggested by current guidelines results from the anaerobic exposures were used to develop a time temperature relationship that is appropriate for ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures data from the literature demonstrated that our relationship is conservative with faster inactivation occurring under environmental conditions when ascaris eggs were suspended in fecal sludge or manure a specific aerobic relationship was not developed but we demonstrated that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation than anaerobic conditions therefore the anaerobic relationship provides a conservative guideline for both conditions we demonstrate that relatively low temperatures can considerably impact ascaris viability and suggest that mesophilic temperatures can be used in waste treatment processes to inactivate pathogens the development of safe low input mesophilic treatment processes is particularly valuable for ensuring universal access to safe sanitation and excreta management graphical abstract image 1 keywords ascaris pathogens mesophilic thermal inactivation sanitation fecal sludge 1 introduction the intestinal roundworm ascaris lumbricoides is widely considered to be the most resistant pathogen to disinfection processes in human fecal sludge and wastewater feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 a lumbricoides infects approximately 1 3 billion people worldwide and is spread by fecal oral transmission particularly in areas with poor access to sanitation de silva et al 1997 eggs are passed into the environment through feces and have been shown to survive and retain infectivity for many years brudastov et al 1970 due to their extreme resistance ascaris eggs are often used as indicators of pathogen inactivation when testing treatment methods for wastewater and fecal sludge the resistance of ascaris eggs to thermal inactivation is of particular interest here time temperature recommendations for using heat to inactivate fecal pathogens are provided by feachem et al 1983 and the us environmental protection agency us epa 40 cfr part 503 regulations us epa 2003 both guidelines consider ascaris eggs to be among the most resistant pathogens to thermal inactivation feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 according to the us epa regulations ascaris viability is not substantially reduced at temperatures between 32 c and 38 c and complete reduction at 38 c 50 c is still not guaranteed us epa 2003 therefore feachem et al and the us epa suggest a minimum temperature of 45 c and 50 c respectively for any thermal treatment disqualifying many treatment options such as mesophilic 45 c anaerobic or aerobic digestion feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 previous work already demonstrated that the feachem and us epa guidelines were extremely conservative at thermophilic temperatures aitken et al 2005 popat et al 2010 manser et al 2015 demonstrated that mesophilic inactivation was feasible with ascaris inactivation observed at 35 c after exposure times of 16 24 days in anaerobic digesters and in phosphate buffer solutions several additional studies have investigated the effect of temperature on inactivation by other measures such as ammonia ph and peracetic acid fidjeland et al 2015 ghiglietti et al 1995 maya et al 2012 nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 all of these studies show that small changes in mesophilic temperatures have a large effect on inactivation rates and the control treatments from some of these studies can also be used to examine the effect of temperature alone the combined evidence from these studies clearly indicates that the recommended minimum temperature threshold for ascaris inactivation is too high but little work has been performed to decisively prove this or to establish a time temperature relationship that is appropriate for mesophilic temperatures the feachem and us epa guidelines also make no distinction between time temperature requirements for anaerobic and aerobic conditions but inactivation has been found to be faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions manser et al 2015 embryonic development of larvae occurs only in the presence of oxygen and the eggshell is expected to weaken during this process leaving the larvae more vulnerable to inactivation this process is further supported by studies that have found faster inactivation of embryonated eggs compared to unembryonated eggs maya et al 2012 the effect of anaerobic versus aerobic conditions may be particularly important at mesophilic temperatures compared to thermophilic temperatures because longer exposure times will be required during which embryonic development can occur current beliefs about the temperature limits for thermal inactivation may be preventing development of useful low input treatment processes that could help provide safe excreta management for the 4 5 billion people that currently live without it who and unicef 2017 to better understand these temperature limits we exposed ascaris suum eggs to temperatures between 34 c and 45 c for a range of exposure times under anaerobic and aerobic conditions we used this data to 1 determine exposure times required to achieve a 3 log reduction of ascaris viability at each temperature 2 develop a new time temperature relationship that can be used to predict ascaris inactivation in this range and 3 compare with evidence from the literature to confirm that our relationship is conservative but reasonable 2 methods a suum eggs were collected from fecal material in the intestines of naturally infected pigs and used as surrogates for a lumbricoides in this study collected fecal material was passed through a series of six sieves ranging from us 10 us 100 to remove large debris and eggs were collected on a us 500 sieve the eggs were later purified from additional small debris by centrifugal flotation in a magnesium sulfate solution specific gravity 1 2 at 800 g for 5 min eggs were stored at 4 c in 0 1 n h2so4 until use a series of four exposure trials was conducted with results from earlier trials used to select appropriate treatment conditions in subsequent trials table 1 temperatures ranged between 34 c and 45 c temperatures below 34 c were not tested because ascaris eggs have been shown to form mobile larvae when incubated aerobically at temperatures up to 34 c arene 1986 for each treatment 1000 a suum eggs were suspended in 1 5 ml 0 1 n h2so4 in a 2 0 ml microcentrifuge tube anaerobic and aerobic conditions were tested the tube caps for all treatments were left open and sealed with parafilm bemis na neenah wi to allow for gas exchange tubes for anaerobic treatments were kept in gas tight chambers that were made anaerobic using gaspak ez anaerobe sachets bd sparks md and indicator strips bd sparks md were used to confirm anaerobic conditions tubes were stored in the dark in incubators and temperatures were monitored using data loggers hobo ux100 003 bourne ma and lascar electronics el usb 1 eerie pa all treatments were performed in duplicate after the designated exposure times eggs were removed from incubators and transferred to 24 well plates where they were suspended in 0 1 n h2so4 and incubated aerobically at 28 c for 3 weeks in the dark to promote larval development the 24 well plates were monitored throughout the incubation period and additional 0 1 n h2so4 was added as needed to replace evaporated solution eggs were examined microscopically before and after the 3 week incubation for eggs treated under anaerobic conditions pre incubation examination confirmed that they had not begun developing during treatment which would have indicated oxygen exposure for all treatments viability was quantified after the 3 week incubation period approximately 500 eggs were examined in each well eggs that had formed larvae were considered viable and all others were considered nonviable if no viable eggs were found in the initial 500 the remaining eggs in the well were examined to a maximum of 1000 eggs reported percent viabilities are normalized to the baseline viability of the a suum eggs used for a given trial table 1 baseline viability was determined by incubating a suum eggs aerobically at 28 c for 3 weeks with no prior treatment when chemically or thermally treating ascaris eggs a lag period is expected with minimal loss of viability followed by a region of exponential inactivation nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 for most treatments in the present study the initial sampling time occurred after the lag period therefore only exponential decline was observed and inactivation was modeled using linear regression 1 l n n n 0 k t b where n 0 is the baseline percent viability of the a suum eggs used for the trial table 1 n is the percent viability of the a suum eggs exposed to a given temperature for time t in days k is the first order inactivation constant and b is the y intercept which gives some indication of the expected but unobserved lag period if viability was below the detection limit for multiple exposure times then only the shortest time was used in the regression analysis and viability at that time was assumed to equal the detection limit the linear regression equations for each temperature were then used to calculate the exposure time required to achieve a 3 log reduction in viability t 3 next linear regression of the base ten logarithms of the anaerobic t 3 values versus temperature were used to develop a new time temperature relationship for ascaris inactivation at mesophilic temperatures the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval for each t 3 value was used to develop a conservative relationship and a literature review was performed to compile additional evidence of ascaris inactivation at temperatures below 45 c all statistical analysis was performed using r r core team 2018 and confidence intervals were calculated using the chemcal package ranke 2018 finally we compared our time temperature relationship to relationships provided by the feachem guidelines and the us epa part 503 guidelines for producing class a biosolids feachem et al 1983 us epa 2003 feachem et al 1983 provides a figure with a zone of safety of time temperature combinations that are expected to cause inactivation of ascaris eggs based on literature studies but the detection limits or degrees of inactivation in these studies are not known the equation for the boundary of the zone of safety is also not given but was derived elsewhere equation 2 where t feachem is the required exposure time in hours and t is the temperature in c vinnerås et al 2003 2 t f e a c h e m 1 77 10 2 10 0 1944 t 45 the us epa recommended exposure time was calculated based on the time temperature equation for sewage sludge with less than 7 total solids and a contact time of at least 30 min equation 3 where t epa is the required exposure time in days and t is the temperature in c us epa 2003 3 t e p a 5 007 10 7 10 0 14 t equation 3 is expected to create class a biosolids that contain less than 1 viable ascaris egg per 4 g biosolids dry weight basis equation 3 represents the least stringent of the four time temperature relationships given by the epa and was chosen here because our experimental data was collected with ascaris eggs suspended in aqueous solution the corresponding log reduction would depend on the initial concentration of viable eggs in the biosolids it should be noted that the feachem equation and the us epa equation were only intended for use at temperatures 45 c and 50 c respectively but we have extended them here below the recommended minimums for comparison purposes 3 results and discussion 3 1 ascaris inactivation under anaerobic conditions under anaerobic conditions we observed ascaris inactivation at temperatures between 37 c and 45 c when no additional inactivating agents were present fig 1 a and we used linear regression of graphs of ln n 0 n versus time to determine inactivation parameters k and b and the time required for a 3 log reduction in ascaris viability t 3 table 2 at 45 c we observed rapid inactivation under anaerobic conditions with viability reduced below the detection limit within 2 days fig 1a table s1 correspondingly the t 3 calculated by linear regression was 2 12 days table 2 at 40 c under anaerobic conditions we observed a 2 19 log reduction after a maximum exposure time of 16 days fig 1a table s1 and the calculated t 3 from linear regression was 20 5 days table 2 we did not test longer exposure times to confirm the t 3 value but we have high confidence in the regression because all four time points occurred along the exponential portion of the inactivation curve fig 1a and the regression provided a good fit to the data with all inactivation parameters significant at p 0 05 and r2 0 954 table 2 under anaerobic conditions at 39 c the exponential portion of the inactivation curve was fully captured and we found no viable eggs after a 32 day exposure time fig 1a table s1 our linear regression fit the data well and yielded a t 3 of 31 8 days table 2 the longest exposure time tested under anaerobic conditions at 37 c was 40 days at which point the results from the duplicate samples varied viability was reduced below detection 2 84 log reduction for one sample but only a 1 37 log reduction was observed for the second sample fig 1a table s1 correspondingly the t 3 calculated by linear regression 57 5 days was longer than 40 days table 2 the regression line fit the data well r2 0 759 but would be improved with an additional time point beyond 40 days to demonstrate viability below detection in both replicates and an additional point between 21 and 40 days to refine the rate of decline unfortunately the three week incubation time required between the end of the exposure period and examining the eggs for viability prevented us from recognizing the need for these treatments until after the experiment was completed longer exposure times were also needed to improve inactivation predictions under anaerobic conditions at 36 c the longest exposure time we tested was 42 days and we observed minimal inactivation 0 321 log reduction indicating that the exponential portion of the inactivation curve was not observed fig 1a table s1 as expected the resulting linear regression provided a poor fit to the data table 2 3 2 ascaris inactivation under aerobic conditions under aerobic conditions we observed ascaris inactivation at temperatures between 34 c and 45 c with ascaris viability reduced below detection during the tested exposure times at all temperatures inactivation at 45 c under aerobic conditions was similar to the inactivation observed under anaerobic conditions with no viable eggs found after a 2 day exposure time fig 1b table s1 for temperatures between 34 c and 40 c mesophilic inactivation of ascaris eggs was even more effective under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions fig 1b under aerobic conditions at 40 c no viable eggs were found in samples with an 8 day exposure time detection limit 2 69 log reduction however low viability 2 33 log reduction was still observed in samples with a 12 day exposure time and exposure times longer than 12 days were not tested fig 1b table s1 the corresponding t 3 value calculated by linear regression was 12 6 days which was substantially shorter than the 20 5 days calculated for anaerobic conditions at the same temperature table 2 inactivation rates under aerobic conditions at 34 c and 36 c were similar with no viable eggs found after exposure times of 15 days for both temperatures fig 1b table s1 the corresponding t 3 values calculated by linear regression were 16 6 and 16 5 days respectively which are less than half of the longest exposure time tested for 36 c under anaerobic conditions that resulted in minimal inactivation fig 1 table 2 3 3 we developed a time temperature relationship for mesophilic temperatures and anaerobic conditions that is reasonable and conservative our results demonstrate that thermal inactivation of ascaris eggs consistently occurs at temperatures between 37 c and 45 c under anaerobic conditions and between 34 c and 45 c under aerobic conditions which directly contradicts current guidance from feachem et al 1983 and the us epa 2003 that require minimum temperatures of 45 c and 50 c respectively even if lower temperatures were considered sufficient the time temperature relationships provided by these guidelines predict substantially longer inactivation times than we found from our t 3 values table 2 under anaerobic conditions the feachem guidelines suggest exposure times that are 3 5 times larger than our t 3 values and the us epa guidelines suggest times that are up to 12 times larger than ours table 2 under aerobic conditions the differences are even larger particularly at lower temperatures of 34 c and 36 c the recommended exposure time by feachem et al at 34 c is two orders of magnitude larger than our t 3 value table 2 therefore a new time temperature relationship specific for mesophilic temperatures is clearly necessary we developed this relationship using linear regression of the base ten logarithm of our anaerobic t 3 values as a function of temperature rearranged to produce equation 4 4 t h a r r o f f 2 20 10 9 10 0 199 t where t harroff is the exposure time in days required for a 3 log reduction and t is temperature in c the upper limit of the 95 confidence interval was used for each t 3 value to develop a more conservative relationship the t 3 calculated for anaerobic inactivation at 36 c was excluded due to the poor fit of the linear regression model therefore the model should only be applied with confidence to temperatures between 37 c and 45 c under anaerobic conditions to evaluate the appropriateness of our time temperature relationship outside of the current study we compared it to mesophilic inactivation that has been observed previously in literature under anaerobic conditions fig 2 a table s2 cruz espinoza et al 2012 johansen et al 2013 manser et al 2015 nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 scheinemann et al 2015 we selected literature data points that measured ascaris viability without addition of external inactivating agents e g ammonia or volatile fatty acids so inactivation is assumed to occur primarily due to temperature although some variation is expected due to differences in moisture content sludge properties and intrinsic concentrations of inactivating compounds cruz espinoza et al 2012 senecal et al 2018 many of the relevant literature data points were control treatments from larger studies individually these data points prove little about mesophilic thermal inactivation but they provide convincing evidence when combined details about each literature data point in fig 2 as well as other studies that are discussed here are included as supplementary data table s2 details in table s2 include exposure conditions how inactivation times were determined and the degree of inactivation that was measured in each study with all literature data points falling at or below our time temperature relationship and the t 3 values generated from regression of experimental data we conclude that the time temperature relationship developed here is more reasonable than the feachem and us epa relationships for temperatures between 37 c and 45 c while still being conservative the conservative nature of our time temperature relationship can be attributed to the use of aqueous solutions for exposing eggs in our experimental results versus the use of manure or fecal sludge matrices for the literature points past work looking at ascaris inactivation in autoclaved versus non autoclaved anaerobic fecal material at 30 c showed that compounds may be biologically produced during anaerobic fermentation that contribute to ascaris inactivation harroff et al 2017 other studies examining ascaris inactivation by ammonia have also found that results from exposures in aqueous solutions are conservative compared to those in manures and fecal sludge nordin et al 2009 pecson et al 2007 schuh et al 1985 here the relationship that we developed using aqueous exposures appears more conservative at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures indicating that intrinsic inactivating compounds in sludge became less important at warmer temperatures within the mesophilic spectrum fidjeland et al 2015 even though overly conservative guidelines may hamper the use of simple treatment the use of a conservative time temperature relationship is still important for protecting public health when developing waste treatment strategies for this reason our time temperature relationship should still be confirmed at temperatures less than 37 c using exposures in aqueous solutions although literature values demonstrate inactivation at 34 c and 35 c at exposure times less than those predicted by our relationship cruz espinoza et al 2012 manser et al 2015 nordin et al 2009 intrinsic factors in those treatments such as ammonia and solids concentration may have affected inactivation times for example manser et al 2015 observed 99 inactivation of ascaris eggs after 24 days in an anaerobic digester at 35 c but another study observed only 50 inactivation after 35 days in a 35 c digester johnson et al 1998 both times are far below the 238 days required for a 3 log 99 9 inactivation by our time temperature relationship but they suggest a need for more information 3 4 the time temperature relationship we developed also provides conservative recommendations under aerobic conditions recent work by manser et al 2015 compared inactivation times required for ascaris inactivation under anaerobic and aerobic conditions at 34 c 24 days and 16 days respectively and concluded that aerobic conditions cause faster inactivation an earlier study compared anaerobic and aerobic digestion at 37 c and 47 c and reached the opposite conclusion that anaerobic conditions caused faster inactivation however the authors acknowledged that the actual temperatures in the aerobic digesters were uncertain due to the use of circulating air to keep them oxygenated therefore the results of that study are inconclusive kato et al 2003 our experimental data supports the conclusion of manser et al 2015 at a range of mesophilic temperatures between 34 c and 40 c fig 1 which has not been shown before in addition our data shows that the effect of oxygen exposure decreases as temperature increases three temperatures 36 c 40 c and 45 c were tested under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions we cannot directly compare the 36 c treatments because exponential decline was not observed under anaerobic conditions but the t 3 calculated for 37 c under anaerobic conditions is 3 5 times larger than the t 3 predicted for 36 c under aerobic conditions table 2 meanwhile at 40 c the t 3 under anaerobic conditions is only 1 6 times larger than the t 3 under aerobic conditions table 2 the t 3 values at 45 c for anaerobic and aerobic conditions are equal which indicates that the effect of oxygen becomes negligible at this temperature table 2 aerobic conditions likely cause faster inactivation because the larvae undergo embryonic development when they have access to oxygen and they consume lipids and carbohydrates within the eggshell to cause structural and chemical changes that may leave the larvae more susceptible to environmental conditions arene 1986 fairbairn 1957 manser et al 2015 however inactivation at 45 c is likely too rapid 2 1 days to allow for significant embryonic development which causes the effect of oxygen presence to be negated previous studies have shown aerobic inactivation at times and temperatures consistent with ours but they did not directly compare inactivation rates under anaerobic and aerobic conditions fig 2b table s2 in control treatments of a ph 7 saline solution ghiglietti et al 1995 observed 99 inactivation of ascaris eggs after exposure to 40 c for 14 days fig 2b aerobic conditions were not explicitly indicated in the ghiglietti study but embryonic development was observed during the exposure time for treatments at lower temperatures so we can assume that oxygen was present in the treatments ghiglietti et al 1995 in comparison our t 3 for 40 c under aerobic conditions was slightly lower at 12 6 days tharaldsen and helle 1989 found that ascaris eggs in mechanically aerated pig manure slurry at 37 c were 99 inactivated between 14 and 22 days which is shown in fig 2b as 22 days and we observed similar inactivation at 36 c with a predicted t 3 of 16 5 days nordin et al 2009 examined ascaris inactivation from different ammonia concentrations at 34 c and reported results that also indicate an effect of aerobic conditions in one treatment of fecal material containing 43 mm nh3 ammonia maximum ph 8 3 total ammonia nh3 nh4 247 mm 99 inactivation was predicted after 21 days using linear regression for a treatment using diluted urine containing 40 mm nh3 ammonia maximum ph 8 7 total ammonia nh3 nh4 131 mm 99 inactivation was predicted after only 8 5 days with similar nh3 ammonia concentrations the study concluded that unmonitored factors contributed to the different inactivation rates we propose here that oxygen was the primary unmonitored factor for the fecal material treatment eggs were contained in mesh bags and inserted in 200 g of fecal material in sealed containers leading to anaerobic conditions for the urine treatment the mesh bags were suspended in urine contained in a sealed 50 ml tube however the tube was opened on days 1 2 7 and 10 for sample collection allowing the urine to be oxygenated each time and decreasing the required exposure time for inactivation a control treatment of 0 9 nacl solution at the same temperature also provided an interesting result because eggs were only 7 inactivated after 31 days based on our experimental results we expect eggs in aerobic conditions at 34 c to be 99 9 inactivated after 16 6 days however results for the control are only reported after 31 days without the frequent sampling interval used for the urine treatment the control would have been anaerobic and we would not expect to see significant inactivation after 31 days results reported for the urine treatment are expectedly faster than ours due to the added inactivating effects of ammonia in the urine other studies have examined the effect of temperature on rates of embryonic development in ascaris and found that eggs could not fully develop into motile larvae at temperatures between 34 c and 45 c arene 1986 gaspard et al 1996 seamster 1950 we cannot predict the required exposure times for these studies because the eggs were never removed from the warmer temperatures but embryonic development is expected to occur within 14 21 days and therefore we can assume that required exposure times would be less than 21 days for temperatures between 34 c and 45 c similarly all of our predicted inactivation times for the same temperature range under aerobic conditions were less than 21 days based on the faster inactivation observed under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions fig 1 table 2 a separate time temperature relationship should be developed for aerobic conditions however more experimental data is needed to accurately capture the effect of oxygen and how it increases at lower temperatures table 2 therefore we recommend using the time temperature relationship developed under anaerobic conditions equation 4 as a conservative predictor for aerobic conditions by comparing our data points under aerobic conditions results from literature under aerobic conditions and our time temperature relationship given by equation 4 we confirm that anaerobic conditions present a conservative case fig 2b these results also demonstrate the importance of strictly maintaining and monitoring anaerobic and aerobic conditions when testing ascaris inactivation by temperature and other mechanisms inactivation that is observed under aerobic conditions may not occur under anaerobic conditions monitoring of additional pathogens may also be required for mesophilic treatment systems particularly under aerobic conditions previous work has shown that escherichia coli and salmonella are also inactivated faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions pandey et al 2016 but the extent to which different pathogens are affected is not known and it is possible that other pathogens will prove more resilient than ascaris eggs under certain conditions 3 5 limitations caution must be used when applying the results and time temperature relationship shown here to large scale systems where required exposure times for inactivation may be affected by uneven heating fluctuating temperatures and shielding effects of solids popat et al 2010 senecal et al 2018 for example composting systems often do not reach expected temperatures leading to poor pathogen inactivation mehl et al 2011 those that do reach proper temperatures have large spatial and temporal variations that make thermal inactivation difficult to predict in one study measured temperatures ranged between 30 c and nearly 50 c in different portions of a compost heap over a 120 day period and over 100 days of exposure was required to observe 99 ascaris inactivation jensen et al 2009 another study observed temperatures 60 c ascaris inactivation would typically be expected within minutes at such high temperatures but 6 days were required to reduce viability below detection indicating pockets with a lower temperature szabová et al 2010 for this reason the us epa guidelines require longer exposure times for sewage sludges with higher solids content us epa 2003 in addition to variation within treatment systems pecson and nelson 2005 also have observed variability in temperature resiliency between batches of ascaris eggs temperature must be closely controlled and monitored for any treatment system relying on thermal inactivation of pathogens for mesophilic systems in particular pathogen inactivation should be verified for each unique system 4 conclusions given adequate exposure times ascaris eggs are consistently inactivated under anaerobic conditions at mesophilic temperatures between 37 c and 45 c and under aerobic conditions at mesophilic temperatures between 34 c and 45 c without the addition of external inactivating agents the relationship t h a r r o f f 2 20 10 9 10 0 199 t can be used to conservatively estimate exposure times t days required to achieve a 3 log reduction of ascaris viability at temperatures t between 37 c and 45 c under both anaerobic and aerobic batch conditions when uniform temperature occurs this relationship is still conservative but much less conservative than current relationships that are used as standards therefore reduction of minimum temperature thresholds in regulations for thermal waste treatment processes should be considered mesophilic waste treatment processes should be given greater consideration when considering how to treat the excreta of the 4 5 billion people globally who currently lack access to safely managed sanitation services who and unicef 2017 mesophilic systems can be less expensive and easier to operate than thermophilic systems and they are shown here to potentially provide adequate pathogen treatment thermal inactivation of ascaris eggs is faster under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions therefore presence of oxygen should be monitored more closely in research new waste treatment systems should be developed that use this advantage of oxygen to inactivate pathogens ascaris is less resistant to thermal inactivation than is often stated and more work is needed to evaluate the circumstances under which it can be used as a reliable indicator
