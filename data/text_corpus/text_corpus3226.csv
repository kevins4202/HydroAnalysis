16130,if we can use toxic aromatic compounds as supplementary carbon source the simultaneous removal of nitrate no3 and aromatic compounds may be achieved at much lower chemical costs this study uses the expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactors to investigate the hypersaline 3 denitrification performance the removal of aromatic compounds i e aniline phenol and their mixture and the mechanisms involved in the four reactors exhibit high removal efficiency of no3 92 8 and aromatic compounds 73 9 at 0 1200 mg l of aromatic compounds the formation of toxic intermediates such as catechol and azo dyes is revealed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms with and without n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa derivation and their toxic effects lead to the lower cell survival ratios after exposing to phenol 64 2 68 9 than to aniline and mixture 72 7 78 0 the stable performance is associated with the more secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the adsorption of pollutants on eps and this was indicated from the higher fluorescence intensity in three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem moreover the halomonas and azoarcus show high abundance and play important roles in the removal of both no3 and aromatic compounds besides quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr results demonstrate the key role of highly abundant nosz and nirs genes in denitrification the toxic organics in industrial wastewaters are potentially feasible carbon sources for denitrification even under high salinity stress graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification high salinity stress aromatic compounds extracellular polymeric substances eps expanded granular sludge bed egsb 1 introduction the excessive elemental nitrogen in various form such as ammonia nitrate no3 and organic nitrogen were discharged into water environments which is one of the important reasons that led to eutrophication problem globally yang et al 2016 the oxidative no3 exerts toxic effects towards human health mousavi et al 2012 zheng et al 2018 and affects the microbiologic structure as well as aquatic ecological systems mousavi et al 2012 zheng et al 2014 in many effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps no3 as the predominant n species contributes most to the total nitrogen tn yuan et al 2015 to control the adverse environmental effects the effluents tn concentrations are strictly regulated to be below 15 mg l in many wwtps national environmental protection agency 2002 and the even more strict standards are issued in environmental sensitive areas such as lakes and reservoirs the state environmental protection administration 2002a in addition to the industrial wastewater the high no3 wastewater in different industries e g nuclear electroplating printed circuit board metal finishing and semiconductors etc have also received huge attention dhamole et al 2007 liao et al 2015 miao et al 2017 shen et al 2009 these wastewaters usually exhibit the characters of extremely high no3 concentrations high salinity acidic ph and the coexistence of toxic organics therefore no3 concentrations were required to be below tens of milligrams per liter as n prior to discharge into drainage systems in some countries many physico chemical methods namely reverse osmosis schoeman 2009 electro dialysis schoeman 2009 ion exchange mautner et al 2016 adsorption bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 and chemical denitrification soares et al 2011 have been proposed to treat the high no3 wastewater however their application is sometimes restricted due to the high costs production of concentrated brine and the scale up challenge he et al 2017 comparatively the biological denitrification is efficient and cost effective pathway to transform the active no3 into inert nitrogen gas n2 cheng et al 2019 miao et al 2020b nevertheless in the treatment of high salinity wastewater the high osmotic pressure potentially causes cell plasmolysis and microorganism death and biological denitrification may be infeasible comparing with 0 salinity the specific denitrifying activity decreased 73 73 and 99 72 under 2 salinity and 10 salinity pressure respectively wang et al believed that decreasing denitrification activity at low salinity was ascribed to inhibition of functional enzymes whereas inhibition at high salinity was ascribed to the lethality to denitrifying cells wang et al 2016 however it was reported that the cultivated aerobic granular sludge could tolerate 9 salinity stress in a sequencing batch reactor ou et al 2018a this may be due to the increase in the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps as a self protection mechanism wang et al 2013 the eps as being extracted from anoxic aerobic active sludge was found to have positively correlated with salinity with the elevated salinity from 0 5 to 6 the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps increased nearly 800 and 275 respectively wang et al 2013 moreover the high salinity also affects the denitrification by decreasing the abundance of denitrifying microbial community and inhibiting metabolic pathways miao et al 2015 halomonas is the key community for nitrite reduction and the high salinity tends to inhibit halomonas growth and the incomplete denitrification occurs it was observed that the abundance of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nad p h dependent nitrite reductase was higher than that of no forming nitrite reductases and this indicated the more transformation of nitrite to ammonia rather than nitric oxide miao et al 2015 besides the coexistence of toxic organics also exerts effects on denitrification performance the wastewaters from different industries e g electroplating petrochemical and coal chemical industry sometimes include high concentrations of no3 salinity and aromatic compounds such as aniline and phenol o neill et al 2000 these toxic compounds usually exhibit strong toxicity towards microorganisms and their biological degradation is sometimes difficult in our previous study the decreased denitrification efficiency from 85 to 50 was observed due to the co existing the hydroxyethane 1 1 bisphosphonic acid hedp and this was ascribed to the decrease in membrane potential leading to the inhibition of electron transport from tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle to denitrifying enzymes via the electron transport chain etc koju et al 2020a however some halophilic bacteria or archaea have demonstrated the excellent removal ability of nitrogen and organic pollutants in hypersaline environments li et al 2022 these microorganism can grow in the granular sludge with high gradient to improve diffusion and tolerance moussavi et al 2014 on the other hand the addition of electron acceptors such as no3 and sulfate was beneficial to the degradation of toxic pollutants in the treatment of wastewater cortinas et al 2006 in some cases the simultaneous removal of phenol and no3 has been observed during denitrification the phenol of up to 70 mg l was used as the solo carbon source to donate electrons to no3 ramos et al 2016 this is practically important in considering the carbon sources deficiency in the denitrification of most high no3 wastewater and the addition of expensive external carbon source as acetate ethanol and methanol is rather expensive miao et al 2020a torà et al 2011 nevertheless the toxic organics seem to show trade off effects towards denitrification at high concentration they can inhibit denitrifying activity and gene expression and lead to the destruction of denitrification system bajaj et al 2010 koju et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 miao et al reported that the removal efficiency of phenol and no3 decreased from nearly 50 to 10 and from 100 to 55 respectively with elevated phenol concentrations from 0 to 1200 mg l miao et al 2017 unfortunately there are limited documentation on the continuous experiment utilizing toxic aromatic compounds as supplementary carbon sources under high salinity denitrification conditions especially at high concentrations if we can achieve promising denitrification and cod removal under these conditions the chemicals cost may be reduced as much as possible on the basis of these considerations this study incubated the anaerobic granular sludge in the expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactors and aims to 1 evaluate the removal performance and stability of no3 and aromatic compounds i e aniline phenol and their mixture with elevated concentrations of no3 aromatic compounds and salinity in the long term continuous experiments 2 explore the content and speciation of sludge eps and cell viability under high salinity and toxic aromatic compounds stress and 3 illustrate the microbial communities diversity and function metabolic abundance through high throughput sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust this study may advance the understanding of the heterotrophic denitrification in the presence of toxic aromatic compounds and high salinity and is practically valuable for the treatment of high no3 industrial wastewaters with toxic aromatic compounds additionally this study also provides insight into the feasibility of using toxic organics as carbon sources for denitrification even under high salinity stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 design and operation of egsb reactors the egsb reactors were schematized in fig s1 the inter diameter and height were 20 mm and 800 mm respectively with working volume of 2 8 l the egsb reactors were installed and continuously operated for 130 days with four scenarios of the control group with sodium acetate as source carbon rctrl and the introduction of aniline ran phenol rph and their mixture rmix the water temperature in these reactors was carefully controlled by surrounding water jackets which was circulated through the constant temperature water tank to achieve stable temperature of 38 1 c the synthetic raw water was slowly introduced into the bottom of the reactors by peristaltic pumps at the velocity of 116 ml h and the hydraulic retention time hrt were determined to be 24 h accordingly the denitrifying seed sludge was collected from a plant scale egsb reactor for the treatment of high no3 industrial wastewater in jiaxing city zhejiang province china and it was quickly transported to laboratory for pre incubation in the pre incubation period the influent salinity as expressed by nacl concentration was increased gradually from 0 5 to 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and the effluent no3 concentrations no3 eff was always fluctuating in a low range below 21 3 mg l likewise the oxidation reduction potential orp decreased slowly with prolonged pre incubation time after 120 days of pre incubation no3 eff was stabilized below 10 mg l and orp was as low as 400 50 mv fig s2 then pre incubated sludge was transferred to four reactors i e rctrl ran rph and rmix for the further formal experiments in the startup period of experiments the synthetic water with 2000 mg l no3 and 3 nacl was introduced the mass ratio of cod no3 n p at 5 5 1 0 022 was maintained by addition of ch3coona nano3 and k2hpo4 in the synthetic water to enhance bacterial growth the stock solution of trace elements was also added at a volumetric ratio of 1 ml l table s1 further the solutions of aniline phenol and their mixed solution with the mass ratios of 1 1 were introduced into the reactors of ran rph and rmix respectively the concentrations of aniline phenol and their mixture increased from 0 to 1200 mg l stepwise to ensure the stable reactors performance the concentrations of aromatic compounds were increased slowly up to 400 mg l initially after that the larger gradient was used in the range of 400 mg l 1200 mg l 2 2 analytical methods the influents and effluents were collected at the frequency of once every 2 3 days the collected samples were filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters and stored at 4 c before analysis uv spectrophotometer u 3010 hitachi high technologies co japan was used to measure the concentrations of no3 and no2 using colormetric methods according to the standard methods the state environmental protection administration 2002b total organic carbon toc was measured using the total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu co japan by the catalytic combustion orp and ph were measured using the ultrameter ii water quality analyzer myron l co u s a the concentrations of aniline and phenol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity agilent co u s a and the intermediate products were qualified by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890b 5977b agilent technologies u s a the methods are described in method s1 in detail 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the sludge samples were collected from the middle port of ran rph and rmix in the stable stage of 0 400 800 and 1200 mg l concentration of aromatic compounds i e the no3 eff concentration below 10 mg l eps was extracted from the collected sludge samples method s2 and the concentrations of protein pn polysaccharide ps and deoxyribonucleic acid dna in eps were analyzed as described in method s3 further a f 4600 luminescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies co japan in 3d scan mode was used to measure three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of eps following the steps given in method s4 2 4 toxicity evaluation and microbial survival determination the toxicity of different water samples was evaluated by luminescent bacteria of vibrio qinghaiensis sp nov q67 bioassay as described in previous studies ma et al 1999 the detailed process is shown in method s5 the microbial survival ratio were assayed by the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit molecular the probes co usa the detailed process is shown in method s6 2 5 quantitative real time pcr qpcr and high throughput sequencing the sludge samples were collected from the middle part of all four egsb reactors at 0 1200 mg l aromatic compounds concentrations the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa was used to extract the genomic dna and the dna concentrations and the purity were determined by the nanodrop nd 1000 microspectrophotometry nanodrop co usa the five denitrifying function genes i e napa narg nirk nirs and nosz were quantified and the 16s rrna genes were sequenced at v3 v4 region samples were transported to tinygene bio tech co to analyze the qpcr and 16s rrna genes the detailed methods on qpcr and 16s rrna analysis are illustrated in method s7 and method s8 in supplementary materials moreover picrust followed the methods reported in previous studies langille et al 2013 ou et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 egsb reactors performance 3 1 1 denitrification performance and aromatic compounds removal fig 1 illustrates the concentrations of no3 no2 aromatic compounds and effluent toc toc eff in the 130 days operation in rctrl ran rph and rmix in the startup stage no3 eff no2 eff and toc eff were all in the same level of below 30 mg l this was related to the high denitrification performance 99 and toc removal efficiency 97 respectively the introduction of aromatic compounds at concentrations below 800 mg l showed slight effects on denitrification quantitatively no3 eff were observed to be lower than 25 115 and 105 mg l and toc removal was higher than 96 93 and 91 in ran rph and rmix respectively besides the high removal efficiency of aniline and phenol in these reactors were observed the effluent aniline concentrations aniline eff were less than 3 mg l with the removal efficiency of over 99 in ran and the residual phenol concentrations phenol eff were below detection limit in rph the concentration of aniline and phenol was both reduced to below 43 mg l in rmix the removal of toc and aromatic compounds supported relatively complete removal and conversion of organic pollutants at 1200 mg l aromatic compounds these reactors showed different removal performance ran and rmix exhibited stable performance in terms of denitrification and aromatic compounds removal the effluent concentrations of no3 toc and aromatic compounds were below 57 mg l 171 mg l and 64 mg l in these two reactors there was no significance difference in the removal of aniline and phenol in rmix and their removal efficiency were 96 and 98 in rmix respectively comparatively phenol at 1200 mg l showed more significant inhibition effects on denitrification in rph the phenol eff and no3 eff were in the range of 138 337 mg l and 0 145 mg l respectively and toc eff accumulated to be in rang of 14 338 mg l it was noted that the effluent no2 concentrations no2 eff were consistently below 1 mg l in rph and the common accumulation of no2 was not observed the variation trends of ph and orp were illustrated in fig s3 as for denitrifying bacteria the tolerable ph is in the range from 7 to 9 5 and the acidic ph potentially inhibits their growth and survival during these experiments the acidic wastewater at ph 4 was directly introduced into reactors and little variation in terms of pollutants removal was observed this may be attributed to the dilution and buffering effect upon the introduction of the acidic raw water into the reactors and this improved the adaption of the denitrifying bacteria to the acidic raw water additionally the denitrification process produces alkalinity eq 1 to neutralize the acidic influent it was noted that most high no3 wastewater exhibited the acidic character and this result was practically valuable to simplify the operation maintenance and reduce the chemicals cost for ph adjustment 1 2 n o 3 10 h 10 e n 2 2 o h 4 h 2 o the variation in the color of the effluents from three different reactors was observed fig s4 and their colorimetric color followed the sequence of rmix ran rph the low concentrations of residual aromatic compounds were determined in the effluents of ran 9 mg l rph 137 mg l and rmix 26 mg l aniline and 2 mg l phenol respectively this indicated that the appeared color was not correlated with residual aniline and phenol the dark yellow color has been reported during the denitrification process in the co existence of aniline which was attributed to the chemical reaction between nitrite and aromatic amines pereira et al 2011 moreover similar yellow pigment was observed in the media involved in aniline degradation with the occurrence of no3 reduction which was ascribed to the formation of a benzene diazonium salt via the reaction between aniline and no2 and its coupling with aniline in the para position to form the p amino azo benzene o neill et al 2000 therefore in this study aniline and no2 were assumed to contribute most to the strong light absorbance in yellow color range due to the formation of aniline oxidation intermediates with azo groups in the rmix reactor the simultaneous presence of aniline and phenol further complicated the reactions involved in and the higher colorimetric color was observed accordingly the biodegradation of azo dyes have been proved but strict anaerobic conditions is key factors to achieve decolorization chang and kuo 2000 in our experiments uncontrolled influent dissolved oxygen may be one of the reasons for unsuccessful decolorization in addition the high no3 concentrations in our reactors have strong inhibition effect on the reduction and cleavage of azo bonds jian et al 2001 in order to obtain better effluent and achieve decolorization of azo dyes it is necessary to adjust operating parameters the application of aerobic treatment process could be considered after egsb reactor treatment to further de mineralize or decomposed selvaraj et al 2021 3 1 2 effects of aromatic compounds on microbial cells toxicity assay was conducted using luminescent bacteria to examine the toxic effect of wastewater on microbial cells at the elevated concentrations of 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig s5 after denitrification the ratios of toxicity inhibition strongly decreased from 99 in different influent scenarios to 23 3 24 8 and 13 4 for rctrl ran and rph respectively however the ratio of toxicity inhibition was as high as 91 for the rmix effluent this result was related to the formation of toxic brown by products with azo groups in rmix it can severely inhibit enzyme activity and even lead to microbial death saratale et al 2011 additionally the potential effects of aromatic compounds on the growth and survival of denitrifying bacterial cell were explore by the ratios of live to dead cell rlive dead fig 2 rlive dead decreased from 2 21 to 1 79 in rph this indicated the slight effects of phenol on the survival of denitrifying bacteria which may inhibit denitrification in rph on the contrary rlive dead increased slightly from 3 12 to 3 68 and 2 66 to 3 61 in ran and rmix respectively besides there were the high percentage of live cells in ran 75 73 78 67 and rmix 72 70 78 33 these results were consistent with the results of denitrification performance and removal of aromatic compounds in ran rph and rmix fortunately the denitrifiers might exhibit good tolerance towards these intermediates to achieve good performance with regard to denitrification and toxic aromatic compounds degradation further we investigated the species transformation and intermediates formation using gc ms at the concentration of 1200 mg l aromatic compounds the formation of small molecule acids succinic acid was detected along with aniline and phenol after the bstfa derivatization pretreatment fig s6a and much less oxidation intermediates were observed as compared to the water samples in reactors in ran the acetanilide fig s6c was detected except aniline fig s6b it was the reversible acylation by product from the acetylation between aniline and acetic acid the conversion of aniline to acetanilide may reduce the toxic effects towards microorganisms and was the indicative of the microbial self protection effect lyons et al 1984 this was the reason behind the excellent denitrification under aniline stress likewise in rph reactor catechol fig s6e and undegraded phenol fig s6d were detected with bstfa derivatization pretreatment the formation of catechol is regarded as the first step involve in phenol biodegradation and more toxic to the microbial cells than phenol kumar et al 2005 the plentiful catechol might adversely inhibit the denitrification performance accordingly in rmix reactor rare intermediates were detected by gc ms even after the bstfa derivatization pretreatment this might be attributed to the difficulty in extracting these intermediates by dichloromethane this toxic oxidation intermediates may also be an important factor on inhibited denitrification 3 2 analysis of eps characteristics in different egsb reactors 3 2 1 effects of aromatic compounds on eps composition and the contents the different egsb reactors showed rather different trends in terms of eps contents variation fig 3 a with the elevated concentrations aromatic compounds from 0 to 1200 mg l the total eps protein polysaccharides dna contents increased from 54 52 67 03 and 71 84 mg g mlvss mixed liquid volatile suspended solids to 56 48 67 03 and 260 36 mg g mlvss in ran rph and rmix respectively fig s7 the increased eps secretion was the response of sludge to the high salinity stress wang et al 2013 and the extra introduction of toxic aromatic compounds at 1200 mg l further increased the eps contents this eps is an important diffusion barrier between the cell membrane and the toxic environment zhang et al 2016 and it can protect microbial cells and improve adaption towards extreme conditions he et al 2018 2021 in this study protein contribute to the highest total eps increase and the protein contents increased from 37 41 34 55 and 37 79 mg g mlvss to 42 49 227 21 and 112 46 mg g mlvss for ran rph and rmix fig s7 respectively these proteins mainly derived from functional proteins produced and released by live bacteria li and yang 2007 wang et al 2013 as well as the release of proteins from dead bacteria upon cytomembrane destruction he et al 2021 on the contrary with the introduction of aromatic compounds the contribution ratios of polysaccharides decreased from 18 1 33 2 and 25 0 to 12 9 9 2 and 15 8 in ran rph and rmix respectively fig 3a this increased the pn ps ratio which enabled sludge with better suspension performance lu et al 2015 and adversely affected the granular sludge stability mikkelsen and nielsen 2001 this change in sludge morphology was also reflected in the experiment at low phenol pressure the sludge particle size was relatively large and shown better settling properties fig s8a however under the 1200 mg l phenol pressure granular sludge showed the signs of disintegration which shown in relatively smaller particle size and floccular morphology fig s8b this potentially contributed to the unstable effluent quality at the late stage in rph which adversely affected the denitrification accordingly the different eps species i e soluble eps s eps lb eps and tb eps also showed variation after the exposure to 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig 3b after exposure of sludge to the aromatic compounds s eps and lb eps were increased whereas the ratios of tb eps decreased to from 77 1 84 6 and 88 0 to 68 4 35 5 and 54 2 in ran rph and rmix respectively this variation can be attributed to the species transformation among various eps species and adsorption of organic pollutants which through the entry and binding to the hydrophobic region of eps leading to the loosening of the sludge xu et al 2013 however the contribution of salinity cannot be ignored the microorganisms can exhibit high hydrophobicity under the long term salinity pressure muñoz sierra et al 2021 further β polysaccharides was viewed as the core of network like outer layer in which proteins dna and so on were embedded adav et al 2008 in this study the lowered proportion of polysaccharides was observed after the exposure to aromatic compounds and this contributed to the unstable eps structure and the transformation of tb eps to s eps and lb eps accordingly without the protection of dense tb eps microorganism would be directly impacted by aromatic compounds 3 2 2 eem spectra of eps three main peaks were observed in the eps eem spectra at 0 and 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig 4 the first peak peak a was identified at ex em of 258 278 302 352 regions iv and was associated with tryptophan protein like substances the second and third main peak i e peak b and peak c were located at ex em of 214 246 282 320 regions i and 224 242 300 344 regions ii and they were related to aromatic proteins these three fluorescence peaks showed different extent of either blue or red shift table 1 the location of tryptophan protein like substances was reported to be at ex em of 280 285 340 350 sheng and yu 2006 in the absence of aromatic compounds peak a was located at ex em 272 276 334 344 but the significant blue shift to ex em 258 286 302 352 was obtained after the addition of 1200 mg l aromatic compounds this might be due to the variation of eps components and the aromatic ring and conjugated bonds in chain structures zhu et al 2012 in the absence of aromatic compounds there existed peak a and peak c in s eps and lb eps samples whereas peak a and peak b were observed in tb eps samples tb eps exhibited higher peaks intensity than the other two fractions of s eps and lb eps fig 4a and table 1 this might be related to the aggregation character of eps being tightly distributed on microorganism surfaces upon the addition of aromatic compounds the peaks intensity of ran rph and rmix were observed to extremely increase compared to 0 mg l aromatic compounds fig 4b and table 1 the variation trends of peak b and peak c might be assigned to the adsorption of aromatic compounds onto eps which contains adsorption sites such as lipophilic substances and apolar groups towards aromatic compounds and their intermediates späth et al 1998 this effect contributed greatly to the significant increase of eps fluorescence intensity besides with the response to the aromatic compounds stress the peaks intensity followed the sequence of s eps lb eps tb eps and it was inferred that the contents of aromatic compounds in eps decreased with closing distance to cell membranes therefore herein this study eps played an important role in the migration and biodegradation of aromatic compounds and it affected the diffusion and mass transfer of pollutants and buffered their toxic effects accordingly sheng et al 2005 3 3 microbial community and function genes analysis 3 3 1 microbial diversity and community evolution the alpha α diversity index was illustrated in table s3 there showed little variation in terms of richness index and diversity index in rctrl comparatively with the elevated aniline and phenol concentrations in ran and rph the richness and diversity of community increased lightly as indicated from the change of otu ace chao shannon and simpson index in rmix α diversity index indicated the less significant richness and diversity of community than those in ran and rph toxic chemicals can show complicate effects on microbial community with elevated concentrations in our previous study and the species diversity was observed to increase to the maximum value at 9 5 mmol l hedp and then decreased at further elevated hedp concentrations to 30 mmol l koju et al 2020b venn diagram was used to further analyze and illustrated in fig 5 the shared number of otus was 175 at 0 mg l fig 5a and slightly increased to 187 at 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig 5b the unique number of otus decreased from 4 to 3 in ran 11 to 7 in rph and 5 to 4 in rmix the insignificant otus variation indicated the similar microbial community and it was inferred that the original microorganisms have adapted to the aromatic compounds stress and exhibited good removal performance towards them by using the principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the beta weighted unifrac beta β diversity were analyzed to investigate the effects of aromatic compounds concentrations on microbial community structure the principal component 1 pc1 explained 65 4 whereas pc1 and principal component 2 pc2 explained 81 7 of the microbial community variation fig 5c the sludge samples in each reactor clustered and showed insignificant difference even with elevated concentrations of aromatic compounds comparatively the microbial community structure was rather different and was highly dependent on different reactors scenarios in four reactors the seven phylum of proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes thermotogae chrysiogenetes deinococcus thermus and chloroflexi were the most abundant with the abundant values of 1 fig s9 among these phylum proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes contributed to the summative relative abundance of 68 0 proteobacteria was the most predominant phylum and it usually played the key role in treatment of both high no3 miao et al 2015 and saline wastewater ou et al 2018a in this study the proteobacteria abundance was stable in the range of 59 4 62 5 in rctrl the aromatic compounds exhibited different effects on proteobacteria abundance with elevated aniline concentrations from 0 to 1200 mg l the proteobacteria abundance decreased from 72 6 to 57 3 in ran r 0 83 whereas the corresponsive abundance increased from 48 8 to 54 1 r 0 70 and from 54 1 to 62 5 r 0 97 in rph and rmix respectively additionally the firmicutes abundance was stable to be 10 0 10 2 under aniline stress in ran and it decreased from 11 5 to 7 2 and 16 9 to 7 5 in rph and rmix respectively both phylum proteobacteria and firmicutes played important roles in the degradation of aromatic compounds in our study due to their potential to degrade organic pollutants jiang et al 2017 li et al 2019 further the low toc in effluents may be attributed to the high abundance of bacteroidetes due to its ability to remove acetic acid from wastewater fykse et al 2016 nelson et al 2011 deeper taxonomic classification was investigated at class level fig s10 the two dominant classes were identified to be gammaproteobacteria 17 7 25 0 and betaproteobacteria 19 1 30 1 both classes were associated with the removal of aromatic compounds and some communities of class gammaproteobacteria can metabolize aniline jiang et al 2017 and phenol li et al 2019 gammaproteobacteria abundance decreased from 30 6 to 24 5 due to the 1200 mg l aniline stress in ran which was similar with the results reported previously peng et al 2021 comparatively the gammaproteobacteria abundance increased from 12 1 to 18 2 and from 20 2 to 25 0 in rph and rmix respectively however rph showed the lowest total abundance of gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria table s4 and this may contribute to the incomplete degradation of phenol at 1200 mg l in addition to these two classes clostridia and bacteroidia contributed to the second largest abundance and they were closely related to organics degradation and organic acid formation shu et al 2015 based on pyrosequencing data relative abundance of 9 putative denitrifying genera were detected table 2 the relative abundance of these denitrifying genera decreased from 53 9 to 44 0 in ran increased from 34 3 to 47 2 in rmix and increased from 29 2 to 35 4 in rph with elevated concentrations of aromatic compounds from 0 mg l to 1200 mg l rph showed less abundance of denitrifiers than both ran and rmix possibly due to the less nitrogen groups in phenol molecular in these samples the two dominant genera halomonas and azoarcus fig 6 were widely occurred denitrifying bacteria halomonas usually exhibit good tolerance towards salts in high salinity condition miao et al 2015 ou et al 2018a and it can use phenol as the solo carbon source for denitrification munoz et al 2001 therefore halomonas may be important in the high denitrification and aromatic degradation performance in our study likewise azoarcus also involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds parales 2010 besides the thauera was the third dominant denitrifying bacteria and increased with aromatic compounds concentrations the genus thauera can reduce no3 to n2 xu et al 2018 and benefit denitrification with aromatic compounds as carbon sources ren et al 2021 3 3 2 variation of denitrifying function genes and metabolic pathways as indicated from q pcr results fig 7 nitrous reductase gene nosz showed the highest abundance in all samples among the tested genes comparatively the nosz abundance increased from 1 06 107 to 1 89 107 copies μl dna in rph r 0 90 and from 1 34 107 to 3 19 107 copies μl dna in rmix r 0 87 whereas decreased from 1 95 107 to 1 15 107 copies μl dna r 0 84 in ran this trend was consistent with that of gammaproteobacteria in class level and putative denitrifying genera nosz abundance was reported to be indicative of the potential denitrification activity petersen et al 2012 and the observed high values supported the highly efficient denitrification performance in these reactors additionally nosz usually coexisted with the nirs gene related to no2 reduction jones et al 2008 in this study the nirs abundance increased with aromatic compounds stress and the other no2 related genes of nirk showed lower abundance than nirs and rarely varied with aromatic compounds concentrations although nirs and nirk genes have same function in terms of nitrogen cycling their abundance was related to the habitat selection and nutrient environment miao et al 2015 under high aromatic compounds stress nirs may play a more important role than nirk in no2 reduction the increased nirs abundance explained the stably low no2 eff even at high no3 eff in the end period for rph reactor additionally the abundance of no3 reduction genes i e narg and napa were lower than other denitrifying genes in these reactors possibly due to the inhibitive effects of high salinity miao et al 2015 on the basis of 16s high throughput sequencing data picrust was used to predict the effects of aromatic compounds on microbial metabolic pathway 22 major kegg pathways level 2 with the abundant values of 1 was illustrated in fig 8 a the highest relative abundance of the genes related to membrane transport 11 6 12 1 and amino acid metabolism pathways 9 8 9 9 were observed additionally some functional protein was synthesized through amino acid metabolism and the release of which through membrane transporters was reported to keep osmotic pressure balance li et al 2017 this effect positively protected bacterial cells from high salinity and benefited their survival accordingly further the relative abundance of genes ranking third was related to carbohydrate metabolism 9 3 9 4 carbohydrate metabolism played important roles in the metabolism of the sodium acetate under aromatic compounds stress additionally xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism is the key metabolism to degrade some refractory toxic pollutants ma et al 2020 and the genes related to which contributed to the degradation of aniline and phenol to understand the functional genes associated with nitrogen removal the prediction of nitrogen metabolism using circos was illustrated in fig 8b the genes associated with nitrogen metabolism especially those related to denitrification complete nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction showed high abundance in rctrl and nearly all the dark bands connected to rctrl circle however they were inhibited to some extent in other reactors of ran rph and rmix the bacteria in rctrl have the most abundance and greatest potential in regards to nitrogen metabolism and the toxic aromatic compounds negatively inhibited the abundance of nitrogen metabolizing genes 4 conclusions this study investigates the feasibility of hypersaline denitrification to simultaneously remove aromatic pollutants and no3 at high concentrations by continuous egsb reactors results of 130 days operation indicate the nearly complete denitrification performance of 99 and high toc removal of 97 under 3 salinity the aromatic compounds may be used as supplementary carbon sources with their removal efficiency in the orders of aniline 88 mixtures 95 phenol 72 and the ratios of live cells in ran and rmix are higher than that in rph the formation of different intermediate products such as succinic acid acetanilide catechol and azo compounds etc was detected by gc ms and these intermediates show different toxic effects on microbial activity as indicated by luminescent bacteria 3d eem spectra results indicate the more significant eps secretion and the adsorption of aromatic pollutants onto eps and these effects play key roles in protecting microbial cell against these toxic aromatic compounds halomonas and azoarcus were the main denitrifying bacteria in these reactors with the abundance of about 40 and were responsible for the simultaneous removal of no3 and aromatic compounds qrt pcr document the high abundance of nirs and nosz genes as the key functional genes associated with denitrification on the basis of these results the wastewaters containing toxic organics such as aniline and phenol are inferred to be potentially feasible carbon sources for denitrification even under high salinity stress in the future more intensive efforts may be attributed to the feasibility

16130,if we can use toxic aromatic compounds as supplementary carbon source the simultaneous removal of nitrate no3 and aromatic compounds may be achieved at much lower chemical costs this study uses the expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactors to investigate the hypersaline 3 denitrification performance the removal of aromatic compounds i e aniline phenol and their mixture and the mechanisms involved in the four reactors exhibit high removal efficiency of no3 92 8 and aromatic compounds 73 9 at 0 1200 mg l of aromatic compounds the formation of toxic intermediates such as catechol and azo dyes is revealed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms with and without n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa derivation and their toxic effects lead to the lower cell survival ratios after exposing to phenol 64 2 68 9 than to aniline and mixture 72 7 78 0 the stable performance is associated with the more secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps and the adsorption of pollutants on eps and this was indicated from the higher fluorescence intensity in three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem moreover the halomonas and azoarcus show high abundance and play important roles in the removal of both no3 and aromatic compounds besides quantitative real time pcr rt qpcr results demonstrate the key role of highly abundant nosz and nirs genes in denitrification the toxic organics in industrial wastewaters are potentially feasible carbon sources for denitrification even under high salinity stress graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrification high salinity stress aromatic compounds extracellular polymeric substances eps expanded granular sludge bed egsb 1 introduction the excessive elemental nitrogen in various form such as ammonia nitrate no3 and organic nitrogen were discharged into water environments which is one of the important reasons that led to eutrophication problem globally yang et al 2016 the oxidative no3 exerts toxic effects towards human health mousavi et al 2012 zheng et al 2018 and affects the microbiologic structure as well as aquatic ecological systems mousavi et al 2012 zheng et al 2014 in many effluents of wastewater treatment plants wwtps no3 as the predominant n species contributes most to the total nitrogen tn yuan et al 2015 to control the adverse environmental effects the effluents tn concentrations are strictly regulated to be below 15 mg l in many wwtps national environmental protection agency 2002 and the even more strict standards are issued in environmental sensitive areas such as lakes and reservoirs the state environmental protection administration 2002a in addition to the industrial wastewater the high no3 wastewater in different industries e g nuclear electroplating printed circuit board metal finishing and semiconductors etc have also received huge attention dhamole et al 2007 liao et al 2015 miao et al 2017 shen et al 2009 these wastewaters usually exhibit the characters of extremely high no3 concentrations high salinity acidic ph and the coexistence of toxic organics therefore no3 concentrations were required to be below tens of milligrams per liter as n prior to discharge into drainage systems in some countries many physico chemical methods namely reverse osmosis schoeman 2009 electro dialysis schoeman 2009 ion exchange mautner et al 2016 adsorption bhatnagar and sillanpää 2011 and chemical denitrification soares et al 2011 have been proposed to treat the high no3 wastewater however their application is sometimes restricted due to the high costs production of concentrated brine and the scale up challenge he et al 2017 comparatively the biological denitrification is efficient and cost effective pathway to transform the active no3 into inert nitrogen gas n2 cheng et al 2019 miao et al 2020b nevertheless in the treatment of high salinity wastewater the high osmotic pressure potentially causes cell plasmolysis and microorganism death and biological denitrification may be infeasible comparing with 0 salinity the specific denitrifying activity decreased 73 73 and 99 72 under 2 salinity and 10 salinity pressure respectively wang et al believed that decreasing denitrification activity at low salinity was ascribed to inhibition of functional enzymes whereas inhibition at high salinity was ascribed to the lethality to denitrifying cells wang et al 2016 however it was reported that the cultivated aerobic granular sludge could tolerate 9 salinity stress in a sequencing batch reactor ou et al 2018a this may be due to the increase in the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps as a self protection mechanism wang et al 2013 the eps as being extracted from anoxic aerobic active sludge was found to have positively correlated with salinity with the elevated salinity from 0 5 to 6 the loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps increased nearly 800 and 275 respectively wang et al 2013 moreover the high salinity also affects the denitrification by decreasing the abundance of denitrifying microbial community and inhibiting metabolic pathways miao et al 2015 halomonas is the key community for nitrite reduction and the high salinity tends to inhibit halomonas growth and the incomplete denitrification occurs it was observed that the abundance of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nad p h dependent nitrite reductase was higher than that of no forming nitrite reductases and this indicated the more transformation of nitrite to ammonia rather than nitric oxide miao et al 2015 besides the coexistence of toxic organics also exerts effects on denitrification performance the wastewaters from different industries e g electroplating petrochemical and coal chemical industry sometimes include high concentrations of no3 salinity and aromatic compounds such as aniline and phenol o neill et al 2000 these toxic compounds usually exhibit strong toxicity towards microorganisms and their biological degradation is sometimes difficult in our previous study the decreased denitrification efficiency from 85 to 50 was observed due to the co existing the hydroxyethane 1 1 bisphosphonic acid hedp and this was ascribed to the decrease in membrane potential leading to the inhibition of electron transport from tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle to denitrifying enzymes via the electron transport chain etc koju et al 2020a however some halophilic bacteria or archaea have demonstrated the excellent removal ability of nitrogen and organic pollutants in hypersaline environments li et al 2022 these microorganism can grow in the granular sludge with high gradient to improve diffusion and tolerance moussavi et al 2014 on the other hand the addition of electron acceptors such as no3 and sulfate was beneficial to the degradation of toxic pollutants in the treatment of wastewater cortinas et al 2006 in some cases the simultaneous removal of phenol and no3 has been observed during denitrification the phenol of up to 70 mg l was used as the solo carbon source to donate electrons to no3 ramos et al 2016 this is practically important in considering the carbon sources deficiency in the denitrification of most high no3 wastewater and the addition of expensive external carbon source as acetate ethanol and methanol is rather expensive miao et al 2020a torà et al 2011 nevertheless the toxic organics seem to show trade off effects towards denitrification at high concentration they can inhibit denitrifying activity and gene expression and lead to the destruction of denitrification system bajaj et al 2010 koju et al 2020a zhou et al 2020 miao et al reported that the removal efficiency of phenol and no3 decreased from nearly 50 to 10 and from 100 to 55 respectively with elevated phenol concentrations from 0 to 1200 mg l miao et al 2017 unfortunately there are limited documentation on the continuous experiment utilizing toxic aromatic compounds as supplementary carbon sources under high salinity denitrification conditions especially at high concentrations if we can achieve promising denitrification and cod removal under these conditions the chemicals cost may be reduced as much as possible on the basis of these considerations this study incubated the anaerobic granular sludge in the expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactors and aims to 1 evaluate the removal performance and stability of no3 and aromatic compounds i e aniline phenol and their mixture with elevated concentrations of no3 aromatic compounds and salinity in the long term continuous experiments 2 explore the content and speciation of sludge eps and cell viability under high salinity and toxic aromatic compounds stress and 3 illustrate the microbial communities diversity and function metabolic abundance through high throughput sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust this study may advance the understanding of the heterotrophic denitrification in the presence of toxic aromatic compounds and high salinity and is practically valuable for the treatment of high no3 industrial wastewaters with toxic aromatic compounds additionally this study also provides insight into the feasibility of using toxic organics as carbon sources for denitrification even under high salinity stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 design and operation of egsb reactors the egsb reactors were schematized in fig s1 the inter diameter and height were 20 mm and 800 mm respectively with working volume of 2 8 l the egsb reactors were installed and continuously operated for 130 days with four scenarios of the control group with sodium acetate as source carbon rctrl and the introduction of aniline ran phenol rph and their mixture rmix the water temperature in these reactors was carefully controlled by surrounding water jackets which was circulated through the constant temperature water tank to achieve stable temperature of 38 1 c the synthetic raw water was slowly introduced into the bottom of the reactors by peristaltic pumps at the velocity of 116 ml h and the hydraulic retention time hrt were determined to be 24 h accordingly the denitrifying seed sludge was collected from a plant scale egsb reactor for the treatment of high no3 industrial wastewater in jiaxing city zhejiang province china and it was quickly transported to laboratory for pre incubation in the pre incubation period the influent salinity as expressed by nacl concentration was increased gradually from 0 5 to 1 5 2 2 5 and 3 and the effluent no3 concentrations no3 eff was always fluctuating in a low range below 21 3 mg l likewise the oxidation reduction potential orp decreased slowly with prolonged pre incubation time after 120 days of pre incubation no3 eff was stabilized below 10 mg l and orp was as low as 400 50 mv fig s2 then pre incubated sludge was transferred to four reactors i e rctrl ran rph and rmix for the further formal experiments in the startup period of experiments the synthetic water with 2000 mg l no3 and 3 nacl was introduced the mass ratio of cod no3 n p at 5 5 1 0 022 was maintained by addition of ch3coona nano3 and k2hpo4 in the synthetic water to enhance bacterial growth the stock solution of trace elements was also added at a volumetric ratio of 1 ml l table s1 further the solutions of aniline phenol and their mixed solution with the mass ratios of 1 1 were introduced into the reactors of ran rph and rmix respectively the concentrations of aniline phenol and their mixture increased from 0 to 1200 mg l stepwise to ensure the stable reactors performance the concentrations of aromatic compounds were increased slowly up to 400 mg l initially after that the larger gradient was used in the range of 400 mg l 1200 mg l 2 2 analytical methods the influents and effluents were collected at the frequency of once every 2 3 days the collected samples were filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters and stored at 4 c before analysis uv spectrophotometer u 3010 hitachi high technologies co japan was used to measure the concentrations of no3 and no2 using colormetric methods according to the standard methods the state environmental protection administration 2002b total organic carbon toc was measured using the total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu co japan by the catalytic combustion orp and ph were measured using the ultrameter ii water quality analyzer myron l co u s a the concentrations of aniline and phenol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity agilent co u s a and the intermediate products were qualified by a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms 7890b 5977b agilent technologies u s a the methods are described in method s1 in detail 2 3 eps extraction and analysis the sludge samples were collected from the middle port of ran rph and rmix in the stable stage of 0 400 800 and 1200 mg l concentration of aromatic compounds i e the no3 eff concentration below 10 mg l eps was extracted from the collected sludge samples method s2 and the concentrations of protein pn polysaccharide ps and deoxyribonucleic acid dna in eps were analyzed as described in method s3 further a f 4600 luminescence spectrometer hitachi high technologies co japan in 3d scan mode was used to measure three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectra of eps following the steps given in method s4 2 4 toxicity evaluation and microbial survival determination the toxicity of different water samples was evaluated by luminescent bacteria of vibrio qinghaiensis sp nov q67 bioassay as described in previous studies ma et al 1999 the detailed process is shown in method s5 the microbial survival ratio were assayed by the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit molecular the probes co usa the detailed process is shown in method s6 2 5 quantitative real time pcr qpcr and high throughput sequencing the sludge samples were collected from the middle part of all four egsb reactors at 0 1200 mg l aromatic compounds concentrations the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa was used to extract the genomic dna and the dna concentrations and the purity were determined by the nanodrop nd 1000 microspectrophotometry nanodrop co usa the five denitrifying function genes i e napa narg nirk nirs and nosz were quantified and the 16s rrna genes were sequenced at v3 v4 region samples were transported to tinygene bio tech co to analyze the qpcr and 16s rrna genes the detailed methods on qpcr and 16s rrna analysis are illustrated in method s7 and method s8 in supplementary materials moreover picrust followed the methods reported in previous studies langille et al 2013 ou et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 egsb reactors performance 3 1 1 denitrification performance and aromatic compounds removal fig 1 illustrates the concentrations of no3 no2 aromatic compounds and effluent toc toc eff in the 130 days operation in rctrl ran rph and rmix in the startup stage no3 eff no2 eff and toc eff were all in the same level of below 30 mg l this was related to the high denitrification performance 99 and toc removal efficiency 97 respectively the introduction of aromatic compounds at concentrations below 800 mg l showed slight effects on denitrification quantitatively no3 eff were observed to be lower than 25 115 and 105 mg l and toc removal was higher than 96 93 and 91 in ran rph and rmix respectively besides the high removal efficiency of aniline and phenol in these reactors were observed the effluent aniline concentrations aniline eff were less than 3 mg l with the removal efficiency of over 99 in ran and the residual phenol concentrations phenol eff were below detection limit in rph the concentration of aniline and phenol was both reduced to below 43 mg l in rmix the removal of toc and aromatic compounds supported relatively complete removal and conversion of organic pollutants at 1200 mg l aromatic compounds these reactors showed different removal performance ran and rmix exhibited stable performance in terms of denitrification and aromatic compounds removal the effluent concentrations of no3 toc and aromatic compounds were below 57 mg l 171 mg l and 64 mg l in these two reactors there was no significance difference in the removal of aniline and phenol in rmix and their removal efficiency were 96 and 98 in rmix respectively comparatively phenol at 1200 mg l showed more significant inhibition effects on denitrification in rph the phenol eff and no3 eff were in the range of 138 337 mg l and 0 145 mg l respectively and toc eff accumulated to be in rang of 14 338 mg l it was noted that the effluent no2 concentrations no2 eff were consistently below 1 mg l in rph and the common accumulation of no2 was not observed the variation trends of ph and orp were illustrated in fig s3 as for denitrifying bacteria the tolerable ph is in the range from 7 to 9 5 and the acidic ph potentially inhibits their growth and survival during these experiments the acidic wastewater at ph 4 was directly introduced into reactors and little variation in terms of pollutants removal was observed this may be attributed to the dilution and buffering effect upon the introduction of the acidic raw water into the reactors and this improved the adaption of the denitrifying bacteria to the acidic raw water additionally the denitrification process produces alkalinity eq 1 to neutralize the acidic influent it was noted that most high no3 wastewater exhibited the acidic character and this result was practically valuable to simplify the operation maintenance and reduce the chemicals cost for ph adjustment 1 2 n o 3 10 h 10 e n 2 2 o h 4 h 2 o the variation in the color of the effluents from three different reactors was observed fig s4 and their colorimetric color followed the sequence of rmix ran rph the low concentrations of residual aromatic compounds were determined in the effluents of ran 9 mg l rph 137 mg l and rmix 26 mg l aniline and 2 mg l phenol respectively this indicated that the appeared color was not correlated with residual aniline and phenol the dark yellow color has been reported during the denitrification process in the co existence of aniline which was attributed to the chemical reaction between nitrite and aromatic amines pereira et al 2011 moreover similar yellow pigment was observed in the media involved in aniline degradation with the occurrence of no3 reduction which was ascribed to the formation of a benzene diazonium salt via the reaction between aniline and no2 and its coupling with aniline in the para position to form the p amino azo benzene o neill et al 2000 therefore in this study aniline and no2 were assumed to contribute most to the strong light absorbance in yellow color range due to the formation of aniline oxidation intermediates with azo groups in the rmix reactor the simultaneous presence of aniline and phenol further complicated the reactions involved in and the higher colorimetric color was observed accordingly the biodegradation of azo dyes have been proved but strict anaerobic conditions is key factors to achieve decolorization chang and kuo 2000 in our experiments uncontrolled influent dissolved oxygen may be one of the reasons for unsuccessful decolorization in addition the high no3 concentrations in our reactors have strong inhibition effect on the reduction and cleavage of azo bonds jian et al 2001 in order to obtain better effluent and achieve decolorization of azo dyes it is necessary to adjust operating parameters the application of aerobic treatment process could be considered after egsb reactor treatment to further de mineralize or decomposed selvaraj et al 2021 3 1 2 effects of aromatic compounds on microbial cells toxicity assay was conducted using luminescent bacteria to examine the toxic effect of wastewater on microbial cells at the elevated concentrations of 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig s5 after denitrification the ratios of toxicity inhibition strongly decreased from 99 in different influent scenarios to 23 3 24 8 and 13 4 for rctrl ran and rph respectively however the ratio of toxicity inhibition was as high as 91 for the rmix effluent this result was related to the formation of toxic brown by products with azo groups in rmix it can severely inhibit enzyme activity and even lead to microbial death saratale et al 2011 additionally the potential effects of aromatic compounds on the growth and survival of denitrifying bacterial cell were explore by the ratios of live to dead cell rlive dead fig 2 rlive dead decreased from 2 21 to 1 79 in rph this indicated the slight effects of phenol on the survival of denitrifying bacteria which may inhibit denitrification in rph on the contrary rlive dead increased slightly from 3 12 to 3 68 and 2 66 to 3 61 in ran and rmix respectively besides there were the high percentage of live cells in ran 75 73 78 67 and rmix 72 70 78 33 these results were consistent with the results of denitrification performance and removal of aromatic compounds in ran rph and rmix fortunately the denitrifiers might exhibit good tolerance towards these intermediates to achieve good performance with regard to denitrification and toxic aromatic compounds degradation further we investigated the species transformation and intermediates formation using gc ms at the concentration of 1200 mg l aromatic compounds the formation of small molecule acids succinic acid was detected along with aniline and phenol after the bstfa derivatization pretreatment fig s6a and much less oxidation intermediates were observed as compared to the water samples in reactors in ran the acetanilide fig s6c was detected except aniline fig s6b it was the reversible acylation by product from the acetylation between aniline and acetic acid the conversion of aniline to acetanilide may reduce the toxic effects towards microorganisms and was the indicative of the microbial self protection effect lyons et al 1984 this was the reason behind the excellent denitrification under aniline stress likewise in rph reactor catechol fig s6e and undegraded phenol fig s6d were detected with bstfa derivatization pretreatment the formation of catechol is regarded as the first step involve in phenol biodegradation and more toxic to the microbial cells than phenol kumar et al 2005 the plentiful catechol might adversely inhibit the denitrification performance accordingly in rmix reactor rare intermediates were detected by gc ms even after the bstfa derivatization pretreatment this might be attributed to the difficulty in extracting these intermediates by dichloromethane this toxic oxidation intermediates may also be an important factor on inhibited denitrification 3 2 analysis of eps characteristics in different egsb reactors 3 2 1 effects of aromatic compounds on eps composition and the contents the different egsb reactors showed rather different trends in terms of eps contents variation fig 3 a with the elevated concentrations aromatic compounds from 0 to 1200 mg l the total eps protein polysaccharides dna contents increased from 54 52 67 03 and 71 84 mg g mlvss mixed liquid volatile suspended solids to 56 48 67 03 and 260 36 mg g mlvss in ran rph and rmix respectively fig s7 the increased eps secretion was the response of sludge to the high salinity stress wang et al 2013 and the extra introduction of toxic aromatic compounds at 1200 mg l further increased the eps contents this eps is an important diffusion barrier between the cell membrane and the toxic environment zhang et al 2016 and it can protect microbial cells and improve adaption towards extreme conditions he et al 2018 2021 in this study protein contribute to the highest total eps increase and the protein contents increased from 37 41 34 55 and 37 79 mg g mlvss to 42 49 227 21 and 112 46 mg g mlvss for ran rph and rmix fig s7 respectively these proteins mainly derived from functional proteins produced and released by live bacteria li and yang 2007 wang et al 2013 as well as the release of proteins from dead bacteria upon cytomembrane destruction he et al 2021 on the contrary with the introduction of aromatic compounds the contribution ratios of polysaccharides decreased from 18 1 33 2 and 25 0 to 12 9 9 2 and 15 8 in ran rph and rmix respectively fig 3a this increased the pn ps ratio which enabled sludge with better suspension performance lu et al 2015 and adversely affected the granular sludge stability mikkelsen and nielsen 2001 this change in sludge morphology was also reflected in the experiment at low phenol pressure the sludge particle size was relatively large and shown better settling properties fig s8a however under the 1200 mg l phenol pressure granular sludge showed the signs of disintegration which shown in relatively smaller particle size and floccular morphology fig s8b this potentially contributed to the unstable effluent quality at the late stage in rph which adversely affected the denitrification accordingly the different eps species i e soluble eps s eps lb eps and tb eps also showed variation after the exposure to 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig 3b after exposure of sludge to the aromatic compounds s eps and lb eps were increased whereas the ratios of tb eps decreased to from 77 1 84 6 and 88 0 to 68 4 35 5 and 54 2 in ran rph and rmix respectively this variation can be attributed to the species transformation among various eps species and adsorption of organic pollutants which through the entry and binding to the hydrophobic region of eps leading to the loosening of the sludge xu et al 2013 however the contribution of salinity cannot be ignored the microorganisms can exhibit high hydrophobicity under the long term salinity pressure muñoz sierra et al 2021 further β polysaccharides was viewed as the core of network like outer layer in which proteins dna and so on were embedded adav et al 2008 in this study the lowered proportion of polysaccharides was observed after the exposure to aromatic compounds and this contributed to the unstable eps structure and the transformation of tb eps to s eps and lb eps accordingly without the protection of dense tb eps microorganism would be directly impacted by aromatic compounds 3 2 2 eem spectra of eps three main peaks were observed in the eps eem spectra at 0 and 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig 4 the first peak peak a was identified at ex em of 258 278 302 352 regions iv and was associated with tryptophan protein like substances the second and third main peak i e peak b and peak c were located at ex em of 214 246 282 320 regions i and 224 242 300 344 regions ii and they were related to aromatic proteins these three fluorescence peaks showed different extent of either blue or red shift table 1 the location of tryptophan protein like substances was reported to be at ex em of 280 285 340 350 sheng and yu 2006 in the absence of aromatic compounds peak a was located at ex em 272 276 334 344 but the significant blue shift to ex em 258 286 302 352 was obtained after the addition of 1200 mg l aromatic compounds this might be due to the variation of eps components and the aromatic ring and conjugated bonds in chain structures zhu et al 2012 in the absence of aromatic compounds there existed peak a and peak c in s eps and lb eps samples whereas peak a and peak b were observed in tb eps samples tb eps exhibited higher peaks intensity than the other two fractions of s eps and lb eps fig 4a and table 1 this might be related to the aggregation character of eps being tightly distributed on microorganism surfaces upon the addition of aromatic compounds the peaks intensity of ran rph and rmix were observed to extremely increase compared to 0 mg l aromatic compounds fig 4b and table 1 the variation trends of peak b and peak c might be assigned to the adsorption of aromatic compounds onto eps which contains adsorption sites such as lipophilic substances and apolar groups towards aromatic compounds and their intermediates späth et al 1998 this effect contributed greatly to the significant increase of eps fluorescence intensity besides with the response to the aromatic compounds stress the peaks intensity followed the sequence of s eps lb eps tb eps and it was inferred that the contents of aromatic compounds in eps decreased with closing distance to cell membranes therefore herein this study eps played an important role in the migration and biodegradation of aromatic compounds and it affected the diffusion and mass transfer of pollutants and buffered their toxic effects accordingly sheng et al 2005 3 3 microbial community and function genes analysis 3 3 1 microbial diversity and community evolution the alpha α diversity index was illustrated in table s3 there showed little variation in terms of richness index and diversity index in rctrl comparatively with the elevated aniline and phenol concentrations in ran and rph the richness and diversity of community increased lightly as indicated from the change of otu ace chao shannon and simpson index in rmix α diversity index indicated the less significant richness and diversity of community than those in ran and rph toxic chemicals can show complicate effects on microbial community with elevated concentrations in our previous study and the species diversity was observed to increase to the maximum value at 9 5 mmol l hedp and then decreased at further elevated hedp concentrations to 30 mmol l koju et al 2020b venn diagram was used to further analyze and illustrated in fig 5 the shared number of otus was 175 at 0 mg l fig 5a and slightly increased to 187 at 1200 mg l aromatic compounds fig 5b the unique number of otus decreased from 4 to 3 in ran 11 to 7 in rph and 5 to 4 in rmix the insignificant otus variation indicated the similar microbial community and it was inferred that the original microorganisms have adapted to the aromatic compounds stress and exhibited good removal performance towards them by using the principal coordinate analysis pcoa based on the beta weighted unifrac beta β diversity were analyzed to investigate the effects of aromatic compounds concentrations on microbial community structure the principal component 1 pc1 explained 65 4 whereas pc1 and principal component 2 pc2 explained 81 7 of the microbial community variation fig 5c the sludge samples in each reactor clustered and showed insignificant difference even with elevated concentrations of aromatic compounds comparatively the microbial community structure was rather different and was highly dependent on different reactors scenarios in four reactors the seven phylum of proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes thermotogae chrysiogenetes deinococcus thermus and chloroflexi were the most abundant with the abundant values of 1 fig s9 among these phylum proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes contributed to the summative relative abundance of 68 0 proteobacteria was the most predominant phylum and it usually played the key role in treatment of both high no3 miao et al 2015 and saline wastewater ou et al 2018a in this study the proteobacteria abundance was stable in the range of 59 4 62 5 in rctrl the aromatic compounds exhibited different effects on proteobacteria abundance with elevated aniline concentrations from 0 to 1200 mg l the proteobacteria abundance decreased from 72 6 to 57 3 in ran r 0 83 whereas the corresponsive abundance increased from 48 8 to 54 1 r 0 70 and from 54 1 to 62 5 r 0 97 in rph and rmix respectively additionally the firmicutes abundance was stable to be 10 0 10 2 under aniline stress in ran and it decreased from 11 5 to 7 2 and 16 9 to 7 5 in rph and rmix respectively both phylum proteobacteria and firmicutes played important roles in the degradation of aromatic compounds in our study due to their potential to degrade organic pollutants jiang et al 2017 li et al 2019 further the low toc in effluents may be attributed to the high abundance of bacteroidetes due to its ability to remove acetic acid from wastewater fykse et al 2016 nelson et al 2011 deeper taxonomic classification was investigated at class level fig s10 the two dominant classes were identified to be gammaproteobacteria 17 7 25 0 and betaproteobacteria 19 1 30 1 both classes were associated with the removal of aromatic compounds and some communities of class gammaproteobacteria can metabolize aniline jiang et al 2017 and phenol li et al 2019 gammaproteobacteria abundance decreased from 30 6 to 24 5 due to the 1200 mg l aniline stress in ran which was similar with the results reported previously peng et al 2021 comparatively the gammaproteobacteria abundance increased from 12 1 to 18 2 and from 20 2 to 25 0 in rph and rmix respectively however rph showed the lowest total abundance of gammaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria table s4 and this may contribute to the incomplete degradation of phenol at 1200 mg l in addition to these two classes clostridia and bacteroidia contributed to the second largest abundance and they were closely related to organics degradation and organic acid formation shu et al 2015 based on pyrosequencing data relative abundance of 9 putative denitrifying genera were detected table 2 the relative abundance of these denitrifying genera decreased from 53 9 to 44 0 in ran increased from 34 3 to 47 2 in rmix and increased from 29 2 to 35 4 in rph with elevated concentrations of aromatic compounds from 0 mg l to 1200 mg l rph showed less abundance of denitrifiers than both ran and rmix possibly due to the less nitrogen groups in phenol molecular in these samples the two dominant genera halomonas and azoarcus fig 6 were widely occurred denitrifying bacteria halomonas usually exhibit good tolerance towards salts in high salinity condition miao et al 2015 ou et al 2018a and it can use phenol as the solo carbon source for denitrification munoz et al 2001 therefore halomonas may be important in the high denitrification and aromatic degradation performance in our study likewise azoarcus also involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds parales 2010 besides the thauera was the third dominant denitrifying bacteria and increased with aromatic compounds concentrations the genus thauera can reduce no3 to n2 xu et al 2018 and benefit denitrification with aromatic compounds as carbon sources ren et al 2021 3 3 2 variation of denitrifying function genes and metabolic pathways as indicated from q pcr results fig 7 nitrous reductase gene nosz showed the highest abundance in all samples among the tested genes comparatively the nosz abundance increased from 1 06 107 to 1 89 107 copies μl dna in rph r 0 90 and from 1 34 107 to 3 19 107 copies μl dna in rmix r 0 87 whereas decreased from 1 95 107 to 1 15 107 copies μl dna r 0 84 in ran this trend was consistent with that of gammaproteobacteria in class level and putative denitrifying genera nosz abundance was reported to be indicative of the potential denitrification activity petersen et al 2012 and the observed high values supported the highly efficient denitrification performance in these reactors additionally nosz usually coexisted with the nirs gene related to no2 reduction jones et al 2008 in this study the nirs abundance increased with aromatic compounds stress and the other no2 related genes of nirk showed lower abundance than nirs and rarely varied with aromatic compounds concentrations although nirs and nirk genes have same function in terms of nitrogen cycling their abundance was related to the habitat selection and nutrient environment miao et al 2015 under high aromatic compounds stress nirs may play a more important role than nirk in no2 reduction the increased nirs abundance explained the stably low no2 eff even at high no3 eff in the end period for rph reactor additionally the abundance of no3 reduction genes i e narg and napa were lower than other denitrifying genes in these reactors possibly due to the inhibitive effects of high salinity miao et al 2015 on the basis of 16s high throughput sequencing data picrust was used to predict the effects of aromatic compounds on microbial metabolic pathway 22 major kegg pathways level 2 with the abundant values of 1 was illustrated in fig 8 a the highest relative abundance of the genes related to membrane transport 11 6 12 1 and amino acid metabolism pathways 9 8 9 9 were observed additionally some functional protein was synthesized through amino acid metabolism and the release of which through membrane transporters was reported to keep osmotic pressure balance li et al 2017 this effect positively protected bacterial cells from high salinity and benefited their survival accordingly further the relative abundance of genes ranking third was related to carbohydrate metabolism 9 3 9 4 carbohydrate metabolism played important roles in the metabolism of the sodium acetate under aromatic compounds stress additionally xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism is the key metabolism to degrade some refractory toxic pollutants ma et al 2020 and the genes related to which contributed to the degradation of aniline and phenol to understand the functional genes associated with nitrogen removal the prediction of nitrogen metabolism using circos was illustrated in fig 8b the genes associated with nitrogen metabolism especially those related to denitrification complete nitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction showed high abundance in rctrl and nearly all the dark bands connected to rctrl circle however they were inhibited to some extent in other reactors of ran rph and rmix the bacteria in rctrl have the most abundance and greatest potential in regards to nitrogen metabolism and the toxic aromatic compounds negatively inhibited the abundance of nitrogen metabolizing genes 4 conclusions this study investigates the feasibility of hypersaline denitrification to simultaneously remove aromatic pollutants and no3 at high concentrations by continuous egsb reactors results of 130 days operation indicate the nearly complete denitrification performance of 99 and high toc removal of 97 under 3 salinity the aromatic compounds may be used as supplementary carbon sources with their removal efficiency in the orders of aniline 88 mixtures 95 phenol 72 and the ratios of live cells in ran and rmix are higher than that in rph the formation of different intermediate products such as succinic acid acetanilide catechol and azo compounds etc was detected by gc ms and these intermediates show different toxic effects on microbial activity as indicated by luminescent bacteria 3d eem spectra results indicate the more significant eps secretion and the adsorption of aromatic pollutants onto eps and these effects play key roles in protecting microbial cell against these toxic aromatic compounds halomonas and azoarcus were the main denitrifying bacteria in these reactors with the abundance of about 40 and were responsible for the simultaneous removal of no3 and aromatic compounds qrt pcr document the high abundance of nirs and nosz genes as the key functional genes associated with denitrification on the basis of these results the wastewaters containing toxic organics such as aniline and phenol are inferred to be potentially feasible carbon sources for denitrification even under high salinity stress in the future more intensive efforts may be attributed to the feasibility

16131,excessive sediment loss degrades freshwater quality and is prone to further elevation and variable source contributions due to the combined effect of extreme rainfall and differing land uses to quantify erosion and sediment source responses across scales this study integrated work at both field and catchment scale for two hydrologically contrasting winters 2018 19 and 2019 20 sediment load was estimated at the field scale grassland arable conversion system sediment source apportionment work was undertaken at the catchment scale 4 5 km2 and used alkanes and both free and bound fatty acid carbon isotope signatures as diagnostic fingerprints to distinguish sediment sources arable pasture woodland and stream banks sediment source apportionment based on bound fatty acids revealed a substantial shift in contributions from stream banks dominating 70 5 in winter 2018 19 to arable land dominating 52 7 in the extreme wet winter 2019 20 increases in sediment contributions from arable 3 9 times and pasture 2 4 times land at the catchment outlet during the winter 2019 20 were consistent with elevated sediment losses monitored at the field scale which indicated that low magnitude high frequency rainfall alone increased sediment loss even from pasture by 350 in contrast carbon isotope signatures of alkanes and free fatty acids consistently estimated stream banks as a dominant source i e 36 and 70 respectively for both winters regardless of prolonged rainfall in winter 2019 20 beyond quantifying the shifts in field scale sediment load and catchment scale sediment sources due to the changes in rainfall patterns our results demonstrate valuable insight into how the fate of biotracers in soil and sediment manifests in the δ13c values of homologues and in turn their role in information gain for estimating sediment source contributions discrepancies in the estimated sediment source contributions using different biotracers indicate that without a careful appreciation of their biogeochemical limitations erroneous interpretation of sediment source contributions can undermine management strategies for delivering more sustainable and resilient agriculture graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extreme rainfall bound fatty acids compound specific stable isotopes bayesian mixing model sediment source fingerprinting 1 introduction considerable research and policy interest continue to focus on mitigating agricultural water pollution including that associated with excessive fine grained 63 µm sediment collins et al 2020 soil erosion by water incurs a huge burden for global gdp sartori et al 2019 and water erosion is expected to increase 30 66 in the near future due to climate change borrelli et al 2020 excess sediment resulting from accelerated soil erosion by water can result in profound ecological impairment in aquatic ecosystems the nutrients and contaminants released from deposited fine sediment into the water column are a common reason why good ecological status ges is often not achieved in many waterbodies tye et al 2016 despite the implementation of best management practices bmps climate change is directly altering the trend and pattern of rainfall extremes leading to increased runoff which intensifies sediment generation processes e g soil detachment and sediment delivery in catchments li and fang 2016 thus extreme and or prolonged periods of heavy rainfall have been identified as a major driver of water quality impairment equally land use change management is also widely seen as a key driver for changing sediment source dynamics in river systems globally the effect of both heavy rainfall and land use change can have synergistic or antagonistic effects on soil erosion and sediment delivery however there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning the relative role of these critical factors in driving sediment source dynamics at the catchment scale disentangling these roles is very important for helping to optimise bmps sediment source fingerprinting is one method that helps elucidate catchment sediment source and export dynamics in the context of key land use change and climatic drivers see collins et al 2020 and references therein in recent times the use of vegetation based biomarkers hereafter biotracers especially long chain alkane and fatty acid specific stable isotopes has gained momentum within the sediment fingerprinting community due to their potential to help discriminate different land uses and sediment sources upadhayay et al 2017 a key characteristic of biotracers is that their stable isotope signature varies across vegetation due to differences in plant physiology and environmental factors reiffarth et al 2016 long chain alkanes and fatty acids fas are biosynthesised by plants and transferred to soil where they are considered to be relatively resistant to degradation largely because of their lower aqueous solubility and microbial inaccessibility alkanes do not contain a reactive functional group and as they are chemically inert they remain in soil aggregates as a part of soil organic matter in contrast fas are pervasive due to higher solubility than alkanes in soil and are firmly attached to soil particles due to the cooh functional group moving with sediment in association with minerals and or in an encapsulated form in water stable aggregates studies on sediment source apportionment have so far mainly focused on solvent extractable free alkanes and or fatty acids ffa concentrations and or their carbon isotope values reflecting mainly a plant leaf wax origin solvent extractable alkanes and fas do not include ester bound lipids and their carbon isotope values can be strongly indicative of recent land use and the associated vegetation they derive from bull et al 2000 however the use of biotracers in mixing models is not straight forward due to differences in biotracer attachment to soil and sediment and their degree of susceptibility to degradation during sediment transport and or after deposition which ultimately alters the original isotopic signature derived from contributing sources therefore a more systematic study of the use of different biotracers in isolation or in combination is needed ester bound lipids lipids release upon base hydrolysis after first removing solvent extractable compounds represent tightly incorporated lipids in soil microaggregates and mineral organic matrices mainly derived from plant biopolymers cutin and suberin these biotracers are more resistant to microbial degradation and may survive better during long distance or temporal duration fluvial transport than solvent extractable lipids feng et al 2015 therefore ester bound fatty acids also known as bound fas bfas may be more diagnostic of land use contributions to sediment than ffas nierop et al 2006 due to their more pronounced stability feng et al 2010 yet the application of bfa specific isotopes has received little attention in the context of sediment source apportionment using fingerprinting procedures despite the ongoing need to explore and test different fingerprint properties including biotracers in different geoclimatic contexts collins et al 2020 diefendorf and freimuth 2017 jansen and wiesenberg 2017 to date bfas and their isotopic compositions have been analysed predominantly in marine and lake sediments and not in fluvial samples elucidating the impact of land use and extreme wet weather on sediment source dynamics requires catchment scale work across multiple years to date and often driven by the logistical requirements and costs many sediment source apportionment studies have focused on a single season or year thereby not necessarily providing an opportunity to disentangle land use and hydroclimatic drivers given this research gap we investigated how hydroclimatic patterns and land use affected sediment source dynamics in a mixed land use agricultural catchment in south west england the specific objectives were 1 to assess the applicability of different biotracer alkanes ffas bfas carbon isotope signatures for quantifying sediment source contributions at catchment scale and 2 to quantify the relative role of extreme winter rainfall and land use on sediment source dynamics to achieve these objectives biotracer carbon isotope values were used to apportion the potential sources arable pasture woodland and stream banks of suspended sediment collected during the winter months october to march of both 2018 2019 winter 2018 19 and 2019 2020 winter 2019 20 these consecutive years provided ample opportunity to meet our objectives since the total rainfall during winter 2018 19 was 9 lower than the long term 1981 2010 winter period average i e 663 mm whereas it was 18 higher during winter 2019 20 indeed the month of february 2020 was the fifth wettest month recorded in the uk since 1862 and experienced 237 of the long term 1981 2010 average february rainfall tandon and schultz 2020 the study duration therefore encapsulated a relatively dry and a relatively wet winter period 2 materials and methods 2 1 study catchment characteristics this research was conducted in the cocktree sub catchment 4 5 km2 of the upper river taw in south west england fig 1 a the soil is classified as gleysol and cambisol with clay and silty clay loam dominated soil textures and moderately acidic soil ph the catchment surface has a predominantly northern aspect with a maximum slope of 15 5 permeability is moderately slow due to a subsurface clay layer and as a result saturation excess overland flow is very common in the catchment during winter which is often seasonally waterlogged long term 1981 2010 mean annual rainfall is 1053 mm north wyke with 63 occurring during the study defined winter period land use is dominated by grassland 62 on slopes ranging between 0 1 15 5 which comprise periodically ploughed and reseeded a mixture of rye grass and clover and permanent pasture silage cuts occur 2 to 3 times per year during the summer months and chemical fertilizer and manures slurry are typically spread to stimulate grass growth the grassland is used for low density grazing cattle and sheep which stops during the winter when livestock are housed to avoid poaching when soils are waterlogged arable farming 23 with slopes ranging between 0 2 12 6 consists of rotations dominated by winter cereals barley and wheat and maize ploughing for arable crops extends up to a depth of 30 cm and inorganic n p k fertilizers as well as manure slurry are applied at recommended rates based on routine soil analyses and agronomic advice semi natural woodland covers 15 of the catchment area on slopes ranging between 0 4 13 8 and is mainly located in the riparian zone fig 1a 2 2 suspended sediment and catchment source sampling suspended sediment samples were collected during winter 2018 19 and winter 2019 20 at the catchment outlet using phillips tubes phillips et al 2000 generally sediment samples were retrieved every two months but sediment was collected earlier when significant intervention was required to maintain the sediment traps visible large organic detritus was removed manually and sediment was settled in a dark cool room for 7 10 days excess water was siphoned off without disturbing the settled sediment the sediment samples were freeze dried in total there were eight sediment samples for winter 2018 19 and nine samples for winter 2019 20 equal masses of the sediment samples were combined to measure the particle size of sediment from the contrasting winters the absolute particle size distribution was measured using a lisst 100x after removing organic matter using h2o2 followed by dispersal of the particles in an ultrasonic water bath for 5 min approximately 90 of the sediment samples were finer than 63 µm fig s1 since the study catchment is ungauged it lacks flow and suspended sediment concentration data which hindered the estimation of sediment loads at the catchment scale four potential catchment sediment sources namely arable a pasture p woodland w and stream banks sb were selected a priori based on a reconnaissance walkover composite surface 0 to 5 cm soil samples comprising a mixture of 8 10 randomly collected sub samples that included loose soil in exposed areas were collected using a manual corer during november 2018 october 2019 soil samples from exposed stream banks were obtained from both bank profiles at any sampling site and here sub samples from 6 to 8 such profiles were composited all catchment source material samples were freeze dried milled and sieved using a 63 µm mesh 2 3 carbon and nitrogen content and bulk stable isotope ratio analyses source soil ph was measured at a 1 2 5 soil dry to water ratio before carbon c and nitrogen n stable isotope analysis soil and sediment samples were weighed into tin capsules and analysed using a carlo erba na2000 elemental analyser ce instruments wigan uk interfaced with a pdz europa 20 22 isotope ratio mass spectrometer sercon ltd crewe uk the isotopic results were expressed as natural abundance δ in parts per mil compared to international standards the elemental and isotopic reference standard was iar001 wheat flour from iso analytical calibrated against iaea n 1 and iaea ch6 n 1 79 c 40 46 δ15n 2 51 δ13c 25 99 the analytical precision for elemental and isotopic reference standards was 0 42 and 0 2 for c and 0 03 and 0 2 for n respectively 2 4 biotracer extraction and quantification total free lipids were extracted from soil and sediment samples 12 g spiked with fa c19 and alkane c34 with dichloromethane methanol 9 1 using accelerated solvent extraction dionex 350 with three extraction cycles at 100 c further details for the fa purification are reported in upadhayay et al 2020 to obtain the hydrocarbon fraction containing alkanes the neutral lipid fraction was blown down to dryness with n2 and redissolved in 2 ml hexane the samples were eluted through silica gel using 6 ml hexane and then blown down to dryness with n2 finally the samples were redissolved in 1 ml hexane for analyses hydrolysable fas were released from solvent extracted residues 1 g spiking with c19 fa by treatment with 0 5 m koh in methanol water 9 1 100 c for 2 h using a reflux method the supernatant solution was recovered after centrifugation and the residue washed twice with a dichloromethane methanol 9 1 v v mixture while extracts were combined to obtain bfas the solution was adjusted to 2 ph with 6 m hcl the aqueous solution was finally extracted with dichloromethane 3 times 2 ml the volume of recombined extract was reduced under nitrogen fas were methylated with 14 bf3 in methanol at 70 c for 30 min the concentrations of alkanes were quantified using an agilent 7890a gc with a flame ionization detector fid while fa free and bound concentrations were determined using an agilent 6890 n 5973 n gc mass spectrometer ms instrumental setup parameters are given in table s1 the alkanes and fas were identified by retention times distinctive odd even patterns and their characteristic mass spectrums and were quantified against the c34 alkane and c19 fa internal standard respectively the compound specific δ13c signatures of alkanes ffas and bfas were determined using a finnigan mat 6890 gc coupled to a finnigan mat delta plus irms via a combustion iii interface with oxidation reactor containing platinum copper oxide and nickel oxide at 940 c thermo fisher scientific bremen germany the δ13c ratio was determined relative to co2 reference gas of known δ13c and n5 5 grade purity boc guildford uk previously calibrated by iso analytical crewe uk the reference gas was injected directly to the source just prior to the alkane and fa peaks of interest and four times at the beginning and end of each run the δ13c was expressed relative to vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb during the runs alkane and fa compound mixtures b4 and f8 3 with known δ13c values indianna state university us were also analysed the δ13c values of fas were corrected for the contribution of δ13c values of the added methyl group during derivatisation the stability and linearity of the system were better than 0 06 the δ13c standard deviation from the standards was 0 35 2 5 estimation of field scale sediment loads in order to evaluate the impact of land use change and or heavy rainfall on soil erosion on pasture and arable land two hydrologically isolated fields 14 and 15 within the cocktree catchment were used fig 1a due to their proximity and hydrological data availability these fields are a part of the north wyke farm platform nwfp which was established to test the sustainability of sheep and beef grazing systems orr et al 2016 field 14 1 72 ha slope range 1 7 2 5 belongs to the so called blue treatment high sugar grass and white clover mix and field 15 1 54 ha slope range 2 5 2 9 belongs to the so called red treatment high sugar grass both fields were ploughed and reseeded in autumn 2017 and broadly represent the nature of local land use especially pasture land in the cocktree study catchment field 14 remained grassland while field 15 was converted to arable land in august 2019 to grow winter wheat flow and turbidity data for these fields for 2018 2020 were obtained from the nwfp portal https nwfp rothamsted ac uk turbidity was converted to suspended sediment concentration using the calibration curve described in pulley and collins 2020 sediment loads from the two fields were estimated using the loads tool marsh et al 2006 for the two contrasting winters and indirectly validated the changes in catchment scale sediment source apportionment during the study period 2 6 data processing and mixing model formulation the abundance µgg 1 soil of long chain odd number c23 c33 alkanes and even number c22 c32 ffas and bfas and their stable c isotope composition in soil and sediment were considered in this study various indices were calculated including total alkanes alk ffas ffa and bfas bfa odd over even pattern oep of alkanes and even over odd pattern of ffas and bfas text s1 statistical differences in bulk isotopes indices biotracer content and their isotope values in source and sediment samples were determined using analysis of variance anova followed by a tukey hsd test at p 0 05 correlations between biotracer content and bulk carbon and soil ph were assessed in biplots linear discriminant analysis was used to assess the performance of biotracers in differentiating the potential sediment sources to estimate the relative contributions of sources to winter period sediment samples long chain alkane ffa and bfa specific carbon stable isotope in isolation or in combinations and bulk isotope δ13c and δ15n values of sources and sediments were used as tracers in a concentration dependant bayesian tracer mixing model mixsiar a detailed description of mixsiar used in our sediment source apportionment is included in upadhayay et al 2017 and its mathematical explanation is detailed in stock et al 2018 because prolonged rainfall can lead to variations in soil erosion and hydrological connectivity the winter period was used as a covariate incorporated via a fixed effect in the mixing model additionally the mixsiar framework was formulated with prior information on each source contribution to sediment yield text s2 briefly the potential median sediment loads from the individual catchment sediment sources were estimated i e 80 56 40 and 1 tonne year 1 for a p sb and w respectively based on the areal coverage of each land use source and their reported field based typical median soil erosion rates and used as a prior information in mixsiar despite potential alterations of isotope values during sediment redistribution upadhayay et al 2021 we assumed such transformation occurred equally in all sources and used zero discrimination values in mixsiar the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameters in mixsiar were set as extreme chain length 3 000 000 burn 1 500 000 thin 500 chains 3 convergence of model runs was checked using gelman rubin and geweke diagnostic statistics estimates of sediment source contributions based on the various biotracers were assessed using hellinger distance based on brown et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 biogeochemical insights into sediment source discrimination 3 1 1 bulk carbon and nitrogen properties organic carbon oc and total nitrogen tn contents were much higher in the woodland 7 1 3 0 6 0 1 and pasture 5 1 1 1 0 5 0 1 compared to arable and stream banks the lower oc 2 3 0 4 and tn 0 3 0 1 p 0 001 in arable soils were attributed to the interactions between tillage operations and low oc inputs into the soil continuous tillage practices and application of nitrogenous fertilizer can enhance degradation of soil organic matter as well as reduce cutin and suberin derived compounds in the soil man et al 2021 similar oc and tn contents in woodland and pasture soils suggested that pasture management has not had a significant negative impact on these soil characteristics bulk c δ13cbulk and n δ15nbulk isotope values have been widely used to differentiate sediment sources and to trace biogeochemical cycling mahoney et al 2019 the cocktree catchment is dominated by c3 vegetation and this was reflected in δ13cbulk values 30 4 to 25 7 fig 2 the δ13cbulk differentiated soil from arable 27 7 0 3 and pasture 29 5 0 6 whereas the δ15nbulk distinguished soil from pasture or arable vs stream banks or woodland fig 2 table 1 differences also existed in the δ13cbulk and δ15nbulk values of pasture and stream bank sediment sources but these did not differentiate arable vs stream banks or arable vs pasture higher δ15nbulk in arable and pasture soils suggested the influence of organic fertilizer applications and soil denitrification processes 3 1 2 alkanes and fas and their isotopic compositions solvent extractable alkanes and fas are a part of soil organic matter fig 3 a derived from leaf wax and their variability preservation and distribution depends on vegetation characteristics soil properties and soil management jansen and wiesenberg 2017 in arable soils alk and ffa ranged from 3 6 to 48 9 µg g 1 soil and 13 to 62 8 µg g 1 respectively representing 13 41 and 9 19 of the abundance found in woodland soil and 26 57 and 22 26 of the abundance found in pasture soils these lipid compounds play a key role in soil aggregate stability lichtfouse et al 1998 and the lower content suggests that arable soil is more vulnerable to erosion compared with the other land uses low alkane and ffa content in the arable soils was likely attributable to soil erosion lower inputs from crops removal of above ground biomass as well as soil tillage facilitated mineralisation of these biotracers arable soil experiences significant perturbation during tillage operations which destroys the microaggregate fractions containing higher ffa content than the silt clay fractions tamura et al 2017 despite the marked variation in alkane and ffa contents their abundance was within the reported range of agricultural pasture and forest soils li et al 2018 wiesenberg et al 2004 the predominance of odd carbon number alkanes oep 5 and even carbon number ffas eop 4 fig 4 suggests these biotracers are derived from higher plants and are well preserved in these soils except in stream banks which is in common with the findings of li et al 2018 a significant higher oep in pasture and woodland soils suggests lower decomposition of alkanes in these soils compared to arable land and stream banks in contrast the eop of ffas showed a relatively invariant pattern across the catchment sediment sources the primary sources of long chain alkanes and ffas in soils have been shown to be leaf litter and farm yard manure bull et al 2000 upadhayay et al 2020 and their preservation in the woodland topsoil might be due to a lower soil ph 4 9 0 2 fig 3b because in acidic soils a strong association of fas with soil minerals occurs due to ligand exchange von lützow et al 2006 the significantly higher 5 times ffa content compared to alkanes in the soil samples fig s2 agrees with the results of wu et al 2019 who found fas can survive better during leaf litter degradation than alkanes the highest ffa alkane ratio 5 2 2 7 in arable soils suggests that either ffa degradation is slower than that of alkanes or that the alkane input into arable soil is notably lower fig s2 as land conversion has been shown to be associated with high alkane turnover rates in the first few years mendez millan et al 2014 we posit that the fas are better protected from biodegradation in soil the net effect on the loss of soil organic matter and biotracer content is most likely explained by the stimulation of oxidation and exposure of the originally inaccessible organic compounds to attack by soil microorganisms due to tillage operations on the arable soils the diagenetic alteration of biotracers leads to compositional changes hence biotracer composition does not provide robust information on the origin of sediment at catchment scale different biotracers from the same land use have different δ13c values because of their biosynthetic pathways and spatial heterogeneity in soil hydrology reiffarth et al 2016 like δ13cbulk values the 13c signatures of the biotracers including alkanes δ13calk 42 4 to 27 3 and ffas δ13cffa 40 1 to 33 1 are in the reported range of soil under c3 vegetation diefendorf and freimuth 2017 upadhayay et al 2020 wiesenberg et al 2004 the disconnection between δ13calk e g c29 and their biosynthetic precursor fas e g c30 fig s3 table s2 within the same land use suggests the influence of multiple fa input sources and diagenetic fractionation processes in the soil fang et al 2014 lichtfouse 2012 alkanes are biosynthesised during the brief period of leaf expansion while for fas this occurs throughout the entire growing season freimuth et al 2017 consequently the hydro edaphic conditions of a specific time of the year can be imprinted on the δ13calk values whereas δ13cffa values are more representative of year round hydro edaphic variations in the soil system in addition to biosynthetic variations in plants and variations in diagenetic processes in short these biotracers constantly undergo diagenesis in the soil which can impact on 13c enrichment and thereby variation in the δ13c values within a given sediment source these controls explain the higher variability in δ13cffa values compared with the other biotracers measured irrespective of sediment source long chain biotracers are produced by organisms other than plants in trace amounts dinel et al 1990 and thus these biotracer isotopic values have potential for land use differentiation robust sediment source discrimination using tracers is critically important for reliable estimation of sediment sources collins et al 2020 in this study good separation of sediment sources was achieved using the alkane ffa and bfa isotope values table 1 linear discriminant analysis indicated that δ13calk and δ13cffa values can distinguish the potential sediment sources with reasonable accuracy 75 and 69 respectively fig s4 however these tracers could not effectively distinguish arable vs pasture land probably due to the lack of significant inputs of biotracers to arable soil the mixing of subsoil and topsoil during tillage and a legacy effect of previous crops grass upadhayay et al 2020 notably the inclusion of the bulk tracer values in the tracer set significantly improved the accuracy of sediment source discrimination to 96 fig 5 however river sediment δ13cbulk values can be biased towards riparian vegetation marwick et al 2014 and δ15nbulk can transform unpredictably upadhayay et al 2021 and hence should be used cautiously in sediment source apportionment modelling 3 1 3 bfas and isotope compositions like alkanes and ffas bfa abundance was significantly lower in the arable land arable soil bfa ranged up to 7 9 to 31 µg g 1 soil 16 29 and 33 50 of the abundance found in woodland and pasture soils respectively the abundances of c22 c24 and c26 the main components of plant suberin feng et al 2010 were relatively unaffected by microbial degradation in the woodland and pasture source soils long chain bfas in soil may experience intense microbial transformation of the vegetation derived fas of different quality but they preserve in soil due to physico chemical stabilisation processes in soil suberin can be an important source of bfas due to its presence in root tissues removal of above ground biomass and relatively high resistance to biodegradation due to a high phenolic unit in its structure nierop et al 2006 lipids derived from roots may be degraded less than those derived from shoots nguyen tu et al 2020 and bfas are considered good indicators of the inputs and degradation of cutin and suberin biopolymers the bfa carbon isotope values δ13cbfa were relatively enriched compared to δ13cffa homologues and ranged from 39 5 to 26 8 larger isotopic differences occurred in c32 homologues regardless of sediment source while δ13cbfa values in arable soil were higher compared to ffas regardless of carbon chain length clear enrichment of 13c in bfas compared to ffas in arable soils and stream banks regardless of chain length table 1 implies that the arable soil contains highly processed bfas differences between the ffas and bfas suggests that diagenetic and heterotrophic reworking processes can significantly change long chain δ13cffa values in soil in line with our results yang et al 2020 found increasing fa stability with decreasing c chain length physical protection in soil aggregates wiesenberg et al 2010 as well as encapsulation within larger organic micro molecules lichtfouse 2012 can protect alkane and fa in soil from soil microbial degradation in general enrichment of δ13cbfa compared to δ13cffa might be related to 1 contribution from root tissues e g suberin 2 microbial decomposition of ffas and 3 addition of microbial necromass bfas provided good discrimination amongst the sampled sources fig 5c fig s4c reflecting the fact that these biotracers are considered more diagnostic for subsoil sources e g stream banks in our case than the ffas feng et al 2010 nierop et al 2006 despite the latter being regarded as having more powerful fingerprinting potential for land use sources due to a direct link with overlaying vegetation composition 3 2 progress in sediment source apportionment using different biotracers our work provided an opportunity to assess the utility of different biotracers for sediment source apportionment the biotracers unanimously suggested that the contribution of stream banks to winter 2018 19 sediment samples was high but the corresponding contributions to winter 2019 20 sediment differed depending on the biotracers fig 6 alkane based estimation suggested similar stream bank contributions 36 to both winter period sediments with arable 34 in winter 2018 19 and pasture 34 in winter 2019 20 as the second most important sources although the alkanes provided good source discrimination fig 5a fig s4a mixing model performance was poor and the precision of the estimated source proportions was lower wider credible intervals than using the other biotracers fig 6 the δ13calk data exhibited less influence on the estimated sediment source contributions hellinger distance close to zero table s3 compared to δ13cffa and δ13cbfa both ffas and bfas returned similar information on the source contributions in winter 2018 19 with the highest contribution from stream banks 76 and 71 respectively for winter 2019 20 sediment however ffa based estimation suggested that stream banks were still the primary sediment source 66 whereas bfa based estimation indicated that almost half 52 of the sampled sediment was derived from arable land despite the relatively high stream bank contributions estimated by bfas and ffas compared to other studies e g up to 55 evans et al 2017 bfas were judged to provide more realistic information based on field observations fig 1c narrow credible intervals and a hellinger distance close to 1 notably the choice of biotracers and mixing model structure can significantly impact on the accuracy and precision of estimated sediment source contributions fig 6 fig s5 composite fingerprints involving various biotracers can be highly promising for the apportionment of sediment sources that cannot be distinguished using other commonly used geochemical tracers in a catchment with complex land use to the best of our knowledge no previous study has characterized long chain alkane ffa and bfa abundance and corresponding δ13c values at catchment scale for apportioning sediment sources quantitatively the ways in which biotracers move through river catchments can cause their transformation which is of critical importance for sediment source apportionment physical chemical and biological factors can change during sediment transport leading to enchanced decomposition and mineralisation of biotracers within sediment de nijs and commeraat 2020 xiao et al 2018 and thereby alteration of the original isotopic composition inherited from the contributing sources upadhayay et al 2021 the contrasting sediment source composition estimated using the different biotracers fig 6 indicated that alkanes were not sensitive enough to apportion sediment sources correctly in fact alkanes cannot form strong bonds with soil and sediment due to their non functionalised apolar nature meaning that these biotracers are mostly protected by being enclosed within the intracellular space of clay minerals e g montmorillonite eltantawy and arnold 1972 this issue could be used to make an informed decision to reject alkanes as a robust biotracer for sediment source apportionment in contrast fas due to their mode of occurrence entrapment in microaggregates and direct organo mineral association preferentially remain 50 in the silt and clay size fraction angst et al 2018 and are less likely to be disturbed by aggregate breakdown during erosion because of this fine sediment sources in our study catchment were better represented by bfas nevertheless many processes can complicate the interpretation of any biotracer signatures in sediment these include selective leaching of alkanes or fas from plant litter and soils jandl et al 2013 leaf wax inputs from direct litter fall freimuth et al 2019 dry deposition of particulate waxes nelson et al 2018 or sorption desorption of biotracers in transit additionally the efficiency of time integrated sediment samplers for retaining very fine sediment during different flow conditions may introduce some degree of uncertainty in biotracer values it is not clear at this stage to what extent these processes introduce uncertainties in sediment source estimates and further research is certainly warranted here 3 3 land use change as a dominant driver of sediment dynamics during an extreme wet winter the magnitude of sediment flux is influenced by the intricate interactions between land use management and rainfall unsurprisingly arable land erosion was expected to be an important source of sediment in the extreme wet winter fig 6 given the relatively steep slopes median 4 5 exposure of bare tilled soils to erosive rainfall fig 1c as well as the role of conventional tillage practices for winter cereals in degrading soil structure and enhancing surface water runoff palmer and smith 2013 importantly the increase in arable land contributions during winter 2019 20 at the catchment outlet is strongly supported by field scale sediment load data from the nwfp that showed sediment loss from arable land was 4 6 times higher than that from adjacent pasture land fig 7 b this increase is explicitly attributed to the impact of land use conversion from grassland to arable land it should be noted that field 15 on the nwfp was new arable land which may not be fully representative of longer term arable land in the study catchment it is plausible that long term arable land can produce higher loss of sediment than arable land freshly converted from non marginal land due to higher compaction lower organic matter content and higher destruction of soil aggregates during long term tillage operations extreme rainfall alone in winter 2019 20 contributed a 3 5 times increase in sediment loss from pasture at field scale fig 7b despite the absence of grazing animals for most of the study months this is attributed to heavy rainfall increasing topsoil erosion and overland flow transport following strong establishment of surface pathway connectivity here our field scale data can be interpreted alongside the best guess of favis mortlock and boardman 1995 who suggested a 10 increase in winter rainfall could trigger a 150 increase in annual water erosion our data are in line with other studies both in the uk and around the world reporting that agricultural activities and land conversion to arable production are responsible for accelerated soil erosion evans et al 2017 prăvălie et al 2021 and that extreme rainfall increases erosion and sediment delivery even from land with recommended best management practices fiener et al 2019 although field 14 was assumed to represent the majority of pasture land in the study catchment it should be noted that our monitored field scale sediment loads on the nwfp may not be fully representative of the sediment loads from pasture or arable land in the study catchment due to variations in rainfall topography field size tillage intensity surface cover and sediment connectivity here it is noteworthy that substantial variability in rainfall and sediment loads amongst the nwfp field scale catchments has been reported by previous work zhang et al 2022 pulley and collins 2020 nevertheless our field scale data provided first hand information on the impact of heavy rainfall and or land use change on soil erosion for helping to corroborate the corresponding source contributions at larger scale we do acknowledge nonetheless that extrapolation of field scale data is challenged by the intrinsic variability and non linearity of erosion and sediment transport processes across scales kirkels et al 2014 rainfall amount is widely recognised as an important driver for runoff and sediment export at landscape scale baartman et al 2020 our study showed that the elevated low and high rain days 35 55 and 50 more days with 1 mm 5 mm 20 mm rainfall respectively fig 1b in winter 2019 20 compared with winter 2018 19 most likely enhanced sediment loss from pasture and arable land this can be attributed to a significant increase in saturation driven surface runoff as a result of prolonged low intensity rainfall fig s6 because antecedent soil hydrological conditions e g soil moisture content 50 in arable and pasture field fig 7 are an important control for hydro sedimentological responses mcmillan et al 2018 the catchment scale increase in pasture source contributions in winter 2019 20 compared to winter 2018 19 was about 1 order of magnitude lower than the corresponding monitored field scale increase in sediment load this clearly demonstrated that even well managed pasture is not resistance to the prolonged rainfall in terms of sediment loss and this can certainly increase sediment flux at the catchment scale disentangling the combined effects of prolonged rainfall and agricultural activities in increasing or decreasing sediment source contributions at the catchment scale is not straight forward nevertheless our field scale sediment loss monitoring on the nwfp provided a blueprint that heavy rainfall and land use interact non linearly and that their combined impact is highly detrimental the catchment 15 erosion rate increased 23 times in winter 2019 20 compared with winter 2018 19 to water and soil security 4 conclusions interactions between prolonged heavy rainfall and land use can elevate sediment loss and in turn this can undermine the efficacy of current best management practices for delivering sustainable agricultural intensification using and contrasting multiple biotracers in a fingerprinting procedure backed up by field scale monitoring of sediment loss from pasture and arable land on the one of the worlds most instrumented farm platforms our work shows a significant shift in both field scale erosion rates and catchment sediment source contributions during the wet winter 2019 20 compared to the relatively dry winter 2018 19 this shift underscores the current lack of resistance to perfect storms of extreme wet weather and land use risks in our lowland farmed landscapes in the uk effective transition of the uk s agricultural sector to help deliver more public goods and services clearly requires greater resilience to abiotic and indeed biotic stresses including those studied in this paper given projections of climate change some recent land use modelling ritchie et al 2019 suggests an expansion of the area under erosion prone crops e g cereals in our study area and the surrounding region of sw england our findings herein underscore the likely risk of significant environmental impacts under such scenarios unless the buffering capacity and resistance of agricultural landscapes is improved significantly clearly long term application of the approaches reported in this paper provide a robust means to monitor the impacts of any coordinated strategies to address the lack of resistance across scales through our application of multiple biotracers in the source fingerprinting component of the work herein we recommend the use of fas and especially bfas for source apportionment rather than alkanes further work is needed to test the conservative behaviour of the biotracers applied in this study and that work could include edge of field analysis using

16131,excessive sediment loss degrades freshwater quality and is prone to further elevation and variable source contributions due to the combined effect of extreme rainfall and differing land uses to quantify erosion and sediment source responses across scales this study integrated work at both field and catchment scale for two hydrologically contrasting winters 2018 19 and 2019 20 sediment load was estimated at the field scale grassland arable conversion system sediment source apportionment work was undertaken at the catchment scale 4 5 km2 and used alkanes and both free and bound fatty acid carbon isotope signatures as diagnostic fingerprints to distinguish sediment sources arable pasture woodland and stream banks sediment source apportionment based on bound fatty acids revealed a substantial shift in contributions from stream banks dominating 70 5 in winter 2018 19 to arable land dominating 52 7 in the extreme wet winter 2019 20 increases in sediment contributions from arable 3 9 times and pasture 2 4 times land at the catchment outlet during the winter 2019 20 were consistent with elevated sediment losses monitored at the field scale which indicated that low magnitude high frequency rainfall alone increased sediment loss even from pasture by 350 in contrast carbon isotope signatures of alkanes and free fatty acids consistently estimated stream banks as a dominant source i e 36 and 70 respectively for both winters regardless of prolonged rainfall in winter 2019 20 beyond quantifying the shifts in field scale sediment load and catchment scale sediment sources due to the changes in rainfall patterns our results demonstrate valuable insight into how the fate of biotracers in soil and sediment manifests in the δ13c values of homologues and in turn their role in information gain for estimating sediment source contributions discrepancies in the estimated sediment source contributions using different biotracers indicate that without a careful appreciation of their biogeochemical limitations erroneous interpretation of sediment source contributions can undermine management strategies for delivering more sustainable and resilient agriculture graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extreme rainfall bound fatty acids compound specific stable isotopes bayesian mixing model sediment source fingerprinting 1 introduction considerable research and policy interest continue to focus on mitigating agricultural water pollution including that associated with excessive fine grained 63 µm sediment collins et al 2020 soil erosion by water incurs a huge burden for global gdp sartori et al 2019 and water erosion is expected to increase 30 66 in the near future due to climate change borrelli et al 2020 excess sediment resulting from accelerated soil erosion by water can result in profound ecological impairment in aquatic ecosystems the nutrients and contaminants released from deposited fine sediment into the water column are a common reason why good ecological status ges is often not achieved in many waterbodies tye et al 2016 despite the implementation of best management practices bmps climate change is directly altering the trend and pattern of rainfall extremes leading to increased runoff which intensifies sediment generation processes e g soil detachment and sediment delivery in catchments li and fang 2016 thus extreme and or prolonged periods of heavy rainfall have been identified as a major driver of water quality impairment equally land use change management is also widely seen as a key driver for changing sediment source dynamics in river systems globally the effect of both heavy rainfall and land use change can have synergistic or antagonistic effects on soil erosion and sediment delivery however there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning the relative role of these critical factors in driving sediment source dynamics at the catchment scale disentangling these roles is very important for helping to optimise bmps sediment source fingerprinting is one method that helps elucidate catchment sediment source and export dynamics in the context of key land use change and climatic drivers see collins et al 2020 and references therein in recent times the use of vegetation based biomarkers hereafter biotracers especially long chain alkane and fatty acid specific stable isotopes has gained momentum within the sediment fingerprinting community due to their potential to help discriminate different land uses and sediment sources upadhayay et al 2017 a key characteristic of biotracers is that their stable isotope signature varies across vegetation due to differences in plant physiology and environmental factors reiffarth et al 2016 long chain alkanes and fatty acids fas are biosynthesised by plants and transferred to soil where they are considered to be relatively resistant to degradation largely because of their lower aqueous solubility and microbial inaccessibility alkanes do not contain a reactive functional group and as they are chemically inert they remain in soil aggregates as a part of soil organic matter in contrast fas are pervasive due to higher solubility than alkanes in soil and are firmly attached to soil particles due to the cooh functional group moving with sediment in association with minerals and or in an encapsulated form in water stable aggregates studies on sediment source apportionment have so far mainly focused on solvent extractable free alkanes and or fatty acids ffa concentrations and or their carbon isotope values reflecting mainly a plant leaf wax origin solvent extractable alkanes and fas do not include ester bound lipids and their carbon isotope values can be strongly indicative of recent land use and the associated vegetation they derive from bull et al 2000 however the use of biotracers in mixing models is not straight forward due to differences in biotracer attachment to soil and sediment and their degree of susceptibility to degradation during sediment transport and or after deposition which ultimately alters the original isotopic signature derived from contributing sources therefore a more systematic study of the use of different biotracers in isolation or in combination is needed ester bound lipids lipids release upon base hydrolysis after first removing solvent extractable compounds represent tightly incorporated lipids in soil microaggregates and mineral organic matrices mainly derived from plant biopolymers cutin and suberin these biotracers are more resistant to microbial degradation and may survive better during long distance or temporal duration fluvial transport than solvent extractable lipids feng et al 2015 therefore ester bound fatty acids also known as bound fas bfas may be more diagnostic of land use contributions to sediment than ffas nierop et al 2006 due to their more pronounced stability feng et al 2010 yet the application of bfa specific isotopes has received little attention in the context of sediment source apportionment using fingerprinting procedures despite the ongoing need to explore and test different fingerprint properties including biotracers in different geoclimatic contexts collins et al 2020 diefendorf and freimuth 2017 jansen and wiesenberg 2017 to date bfas and their isotopic compositions have been analysed predominantly in marine and lake sediments and not in fluvial samples elucidating the impact of land use and extreme wet weather on sediment source dynamics requires catchment scale work across multiple years to date and often driven by the logistical requirements and costs many sediment source apportionment studies have focused on a single season or year thereby not necessarily providing an opportunity to disentangle land use and hydroclimatic drivers given this research gap we investigated how hydroclimatic patterns and land use affected sediment source dynamics in a mixed land use agricultural catchment in south west england the specific objectives were 1 to assess the applicability of different biotracer alkanes ffas bfas carbon isotope signatures for quantifying sediment source contributions at catchment scale and 2 to quantify the relative role of extreme winter rainfall and land use on sediment source dynamics to achieve these objectives biotracer carbon isotope values were used to apportion the potential sources arable pasture woodland and stream banks of suspended sediment collected during the winter months october to march of both 2018 2019 winter 2018 19 and 2019 2020 winter 2019 20 these consecutive years provided ample opportunity to meet our objectives since the total rainfall during winter 2018 19 was 9 lower than the long term 1981 2010 winter period average i e 663 mm whereas it was 18 higher during winter 2019 20 indeed the month of february 2020 was the fifth wettest month recorded in the uk since 1862 and experienced 237 of the long term 1981 2010 average february rainfall tandon and schultz 2020 the study duration therefore encapsulated a relatively dry and a relatively wet winter period 2 materials and methods 2 1 study catchment characteristics this research was conducted in the cocktree sub catchment 4 5 km2 of the upper river taw in south west england fig 1 a the soil is classified as gleysol and cambisol with clay and silty clay loam dominated soil textures and moderately acidic soil ph the catchment surface has a predominantly northern aspect with a maximum slope of 15 5 permeability is moderately slow due to a subsurface clay layer and as a result saturation excess overland flow is very common in the catchment during winter which is often seasonally waterlogged long term 1981 2010 mean annual rainfall is 1053 mm north wyke with 63 occurring during the study defined winter period land use is dominated by grassland 62 on slopes ranging between 0 1 15 5 which comprise periodically ploughed and reseeded a mixture of rye grass and clover and permanent pasture silage cuts occur 2 to 3 times per year during the summer months and chemical fertilizer and manures slurry are typically spread to stimulate grass growth the grassland is used for low density grazing cattle and sheep which stops during the winter when livestock are housed to avoid poaching when soils are waterlogged arable farming 23 with slopes ranging between 0 2 12 6 consists of rotations dominated by winter cereals barley and wheat and maize ploughing for arable crops extends up to a depth of 30 cm and inorganic n p k fertilizers as well as manure slurry are applied at recommended rates based on routine soil analyses and agronomic advice semi natural woodland covers 15 of the catchment area on slopes ranging between 0 4 13 8 and is mainly located in the riparian zone fig 1a 2 2 suspended sediment and catchment source sampling suspended sediment samples were collected during winter 2018 19 and winter 2019 20 at the catchment outlet using phillips tubes phillips et al 2000 generally sediment samples were retrieved every two months but sediment was collected earlier when significant intervention was required to maintain the sediment traps visible large organic detritus was removed manually and sediment was settled in a dark cool room for 7 10 days excess water was siphoned off without disturbing the settled sediment the sediment samples were freeze dried in total there were eight sediment samples for winter 2018 19 and nine samples for winter 2019 20 equal masses of the sediment samples were combined to measure the particle size of sediment from the contrasting winters the absolute particle size distribution was measured using a lisst 100x after removing organic matter using h2o2 followed by dispersal of the particles in an ultrasonic water bath for 5 min approximately 90 of the sediment samples were finer than 63 µm fig s1 since the study catchment is ungauged it lacks flow and suspended sediment concentration data which hindered the estimation of sediment loads at the catchment scale four potential catchment sediment sources namely arable a pasture p woodland w and stream banks sb were selected a priori based on a reconnaissance walkover composite surface 0 to 5 cm soil samples comprising a mixture of 8 10 randomly collected sub samples that included loose soil in exposed areas were collected using a manual corer during november 2018 october 2019 soil samples from exposed stream banks were obtained from both bank profiles at any sampling site and here sub samples from 6 to 8 such profiles were composited all catchment source material samples were freeze dried milled and sieved using a 63 µm mesh 2 3 carbon and nitrogen content and bulk stable isotope ratio analyses source soil ph was measured at a 1 2 5 soil dry to water ratio before carbon c and nitrogen n stable isotope analysis soil and sediment samples were weighed into tin capsules and analysed using a carlo erba na2000 elemental analyser ce instruments wigan uk interfaced with a pdz europa 20 22 isotope ratio mass spectrometer sercon ltd crewe uk the isotopic results were expressed as natural abundance δ in

cycles at 100 c further details for the fa purification are reported in upadhayay et al 2020 to obtain the hydrocarbon fraction containing alkanes the neutral lipid fraction was blown down to dryness with n2 and redissolved in 2 ml hexane the samples were eluted through silica gel using 6 ml hexane and then blown down to dryness with n2 finally the samples were redissolved in 1 ml hexane for

5973 n gc mass spectrometer ms instrumental setup parameters are given in table s1 the alkanes and fas were identified by retention times distinctive odd even patterns and their characteristic mass

the δ13c ratio was determined relative to co2 reference gas of known δ13c and n5 5 grade purity boc guildford uk previously calibrated by iso analytical crewe uk the reference gas was injected directly to the source just prior to the alkane and fa peaks of interest and four times at the beginning and end of each run the δ13c was expressed relative to vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb during the runs alkane and fa compound mixtures b4 and f8 3 with known δ13c values indianna state university us were also analysed the δ13c values of fas were corrected for the contribution of δ13c values of the added methyl group during derivatisation the stability and linearity of the system were better than 0 06 the δ13c standard deviation from the standards was 0 35 2 5 estimation of field scale sediment loads in order to evaluate the impact of land use change and or heavy rainfall on soil erosion on pasture and arable land two hydrologically isolated fields 14 and 15 within the cocktree catchment were used fig 1a due to their proximity and hydrological data availability these fields are a part of the north wyke farm platform nwfp which was established to test the sustainability of sheep and beef grazing systems orr et al 2016 field 14 1 72 ha slope range 1 7 2 5 belongs to the so called blue treatment high sugar grass and white clover mix and field 15 1 54 ha slope range 2 5 2 9 belongs to the so called red treatment high sugar grass both fields were ploughed and reseeded in autumn 2017 and broadly represent the nature of local land use especially pasture land in the cocktree study catchment field 14 remained grassland while field 15 was converted to arable land in august 2019 to grow winter wheat flow and turbidity data for these fields for 2018 2020 were obtained from the nwfp portal https nwfp rothamsted ac uk turbidity was converted to suspended sediment concentration using the calibration curve described in pulley and collins 2020 sediment loads from the two fields were estimated using the loads tool marsh et al 2006 for the two contrasting winters and indirectly validated the changes in catchment scale sediment source apportionment during the study period 2 6 data

text s1 statistical differences in bulk isotopes indices biotracer content and their isotope values in source and sediment samples were determined using analysis of variance anova followed by a tukey hsd test at p 0 05 correlations between biotracer content and bulk carbon and soil ph were assessed in biplots linear discriminant analysis was used to assess the performance of biotracers in differentiating the potential sediment sources to estimate the relative contributions of sources to winter period sediment samples long chain alkane ffa and bfa specific carbon stable isotope in isolation or in combinations and bulk isotope δ13c and δ15n values of sources and sediments were used as tracers in a concentration dependant bayesian tracer mixing model mixsiar a detailed description of mixsiar used in our sediment source apportionment is included in upadhayay et al 2017 and its mathematical explanation is detailed in stock et al 2018 because prolonged rainfall can lead to variations in soil erosion and hydrological connectivity the winter period was used as a covariate incorporated via a fixed effect in the mixing model additionally the mixsiar framework was formulated with prior information on each source contribution to sediment yield text s2 briefly the potential median sediment loads from the individual catchment sediment sources were estimated i e 80 56 40 and 1 tonne year 1 for a p sb and w respectively based on the areal coverage of each land use source and their reported field based typical median soil erosion rates and used as a prior information in mixsiar despite potential alterations of isotope values during sediment redistribution upadhayay et al 2021 we assumed such transformation occurred equally in all sources and used zero discrimination values in mixsiar the markov chain monte carlo mcmc parameters in mixsiar were set as extreme chain length 3 000 000 burn 1 500 000 thin 500 chains 3 convergence of model runs was checked using gelman rubin and geweke diagnostic statistics estimates of sediment source contributions based on the various biotracers were assessed using hellinger distance based on brown et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 biogeochemical insights into sediment source discrimination 3 1 1 bulk carbon and nitrogen properties organic carbon oc and total nitrogen tn contents were much higher in the woodland 7 1 3 0 6 0 1 and pasture 5 1 1 1 0 5 0 1 compared to arable and stream banks the lower oc 2 3 0 4 and tn 0 3 0 1 p 0 001 in arable soils were attributed to the interactions between tillage operations and low oc inputs into the soil continuous tillage practices and application of nitrogenous fertilizer can enhance degradation of soil organic matter as well as reduce cutin and suberin derived compounds in the soil man et al 2021 similar oc and tn contents in woodland and pasture soils suggested that pasture management has not had a significant negative impact on these soil characteristics bulk c δ13cbulk and n δ15nbulk isotope values have been widely used to differentiate sediment sources and to trace biogeochemical cycling mahoney et al 2019 the cocktree catchment is dominated by c3 vegetation and this was reflected in δ13cbulk values 30 4 to 25 7 fig 2 the δ13cbulk differentiated soil from arable 27 7 0 3 and pasture 29 5 0 6 whereas the δ15nbulk distinguished soil from pasture or arable vs stream banks or woodland fig 2 table 1 differences also existed in the δ13cbulk and δ15nbulk values of pasture and stream bank sediment sources but these did not differentiate arable vs stream banks or arable vs pasture higher δ15nbulk in arable and pasture soils suggested the influence of organic fertilizer applications and soil denitrification processes 3 1 2 alkanes and fas and their isotopic compositions solvent extractable alkanes and fas are a part of soil organic matter fig 3 a derived from leaf wax and their variability preservation and distribution depends on vegetation characteristics soil properties and soil management jansen and wiesenberg 2017 in arable soils alk and ffa ranged from 3 6 to 48 9 µg g 1 soil and 13 to 62 8 µg g 1 respectively representing 13 41 and 9 19 of the abundance found in woodland soil and 26 57 and 22 26 of the abundance found in pasture soils these lipid compounds play a key role in soil aggregate stability lichtfouse et al 1998 and the lower content suggests that arable soil is more vulnerable to erosion compared with the other land uses low alkane and ffa content in the arable soils was likely attributable to soil erosion lower inputs from crops removal of above ground biomass as well as soil tillage facilitated mineralisation of these biotracers arable soil experiences significant perturbation during tillage operations which destroys the microaggregate fractions containing higher ffa content than the silt clay fractions tamura et al 2017 despite the marked variation in alkane and ffa contents their abundance was within the reported range of agricultural pasture and forest soils li et al 2018 wiesenberg et al 2004 the predominance of odd carbon number alkanes oep 5 and even carbon number ffas eop 4 fig 4 suggests these biotracers are derived from higher plants and are well preserved in these soils except in stream banks which is in common with the findings of li et al 2018 a significant higher oep in pasture and woodland soils suggests lower decomposition of alkanes in these soils compared to arable land and stream banks in contrast the eop of ffas showed a relatively invariant pattern across the catchment sediment sources the primary sources of long chain alkanes and ffas in soils have been shown to be leaf litter and farm yard manure bull et al 2000 upadhayay et al 2020 and their preservation in the woodland topsoil might be due to a lower soil ph 4 9 0 2 fig 3b because in acidic soils a strong association of fas with soil minerals occurs due to ligand exchange von lützow et al 2006 the significantly higher 5 times ffa content compared to alkanes in the soil samples fig s2 agrees with the results of wu et al 2019 who found fas can survive better during leaf litter degradation than alkanes the highest ffa alkane ratio 5 2 2 7 in arable soils suggests that either ffa degradation is slower than that of alkanes or that the alkane input into arable soil is notably lower fig s2 as land conversion has been shown to be associated with high alkane turnover rates in the first few years mendez millan et al 2014 we posit that the fas are better protected from biodegradation in soil the net effect on the loss of soil organic matter and biotracer content is most likely explained by the stimulation of oxidation and exposure of the originally inaccessible organic compounds to attack by soil microorganisms due to tillage operations on the arable soils the diagenetic alteration of biotracers leads to compositional changes hence biotracer composition does not provide robust information on the origin of sediment at catchment scale different biotracers from the same land use have different δ13c values because of their biosynthetic pathways and spatial heterogeneity in soil hydrology reiffarth et al 2016 like δ13cbulk values the 13c signatures of the biotracers including alkanes δ13calk 42 4 to 27 3 and ffas δ13cffa 40 1 to 33 1 are in the reported range of soil under c3 vegetation diefendorf and freimuth 2017 upadhayay et al 2020 wiesenberg et al 2004 the disconnection between δ13calk e g c29 and their biosynthetic precursor fas e g c30 fig s3 table s2 within the same land use suggests the influence of multiple fa input sources and diagenetic fractionation processes in the soil fang et al 2014 lichtfouse 2012 alkanes are biosynthesised during the brief period of leaf expansion while for fas this occurs throughout the entire growing season freimuth et al 2017 consequently the hydro edaphic conditions of a specific time of the year can be imprinted on the δ13calk values whereas δ13cffa values are more representative of year round hydro edaphic variations in the soil system in addition to biosynthetic variations in plants and variations in diagenetic processes in short these biotracers constantly undergo diagenesis in the soil which can impact on 13c enrichment and thereby variation in the δ13c values within a given sediment source these controls explain the higher variability in δ13cffa values compared with the other biotracers measured irrespective of sediment source long chain biotracers are produced by organisms other than plants in trace amounts dinel et al 1990 and thus these biotracer isotopic values have potential for land use differentiation robust sediment source discrimination using tracers is critically important for reliable estimation of sediment sources collins et al 2020 in this study good separation of sediment sources was achieved using the alkane ffa and bfa isotope values table 1 linear discriminant analysis indicated that δ13calk and δ13cffa values can distinguish the potential sediment sources with reasonable accuracy 75 and 69 respectively fig s4 however these tracers could not effectively distinguish arable vs pasture land probably due to the lack of significant inputs of biotracers to arable soil the mixing of subsoil and topsoil during tillage and a legacy effect of previous crops grass upadhayay et al 2020 notably the inclusion of the bulk tracer values in the tracer set significantly improved the accuracy of sediment source discrimination to 96 fig 5 however river sediment δ13cbulk values can be biased towards riparian vegetation marwick et al 2014 and δ15nbulk can transform unpredictably upadhayay et al 2021 and hence should be used cautiously in sediment source apportionment modelling 3 1 3 bfas and isotope compositions like alkanes and ffas bfa abundance was significantly lower in the arable land arable soil bfa ranged up to 7 9 to 31 µg g 1 soil 16 29 and 33 50 of the abundance found in woodland and pasture soils respectively the abundances of c22 c24 and c26 the main components of plant suberin feng et al 2010 were relatively unaffected by microbial degradation in the woodland and pasture source soils long chain bfas in soil may experience intense microbial transformation of the vegetation derived fas of different quality but they preserve in soil due to physico chemical stabilisation processes in soil suberin can be an important source of bfas due to its presence in root tissues removal of above ground biomass and relatively high resistance to biodegradation due to a high phenolic unit in its structure nierop et al 2006 lipids derived from roots may be degraded less than those derived from shoots nguyen tu et al 2020 and bfas are considered good indicators of the inputs and degradation of cutin and suberin biopolymers the bfa carbon isotope values δ13cbfa were relatively enriched compared to δ13cffa homologues and ranged from 39 5 to 26 8 larger isotopic differences occurred in c32 homologues regardless of sediment source while δ13cbfa values in arable soil were higher compared to ffas regardless of carbon chain length clear enrichment of 13c in bfas compared to ffas in arable soils and stream banks regardless of chain length table 1 implies that the arable soil contains highly processed bfas differences between the ffas and bfas suggests that diagenetic and heterotrophic reworking processes can significantly change long chain δ13cffa values in soil in line with our results yang et al 2020 found increasing fa stability with decreasing c chain length physical protection in soil aggregates wiesenberg et al 2010 as well as encapsulation within larger organic micro molecules lichtfouse 2012 can protect alkane and fa in soil from soil microbial degradation in general enrichment of δ13cbfa compared to δ13cffa might be related to 1 contribution from root tissues e g suberin 2 microbial decomposition of ffas and 3 addition of microbial necromass bfas provided good discrimination amongst the sampled sources fig 5c fig s4c reflecting the fact that these biotracers are considered more diagnostic for subsoil sources e g stream banks in our case than the ffas feng et al 2010 nierop et al 2006 despite the latter being regarded as having more powerful fingerprinting potential for land use sources due to a direct link with overlaying vegetation composition 3 2 progress in sediment source apportionment using different biotracers our work provided an opportunity to assess the utility of different biotracers for sediment source apportionment the biotracers unanimously suggested that the contribution of stream banks to winter 2018 19 sediment samples was high but the corresponding contributions to winter 2019 20 sediment differed depending on the biotracers fig 6 alkane based estimation suggested similar stream bank contributions 36 to both winter period sediments with arable 34 in winter 2018 19 and pasture 34 in winter 2019 20 as the second most important sources although the alkanes provided good source discrimination fig 5a fig s4a mixing model performance was poor and the precision of the estimated source proportions was lower wider credible intervals than using the other biotracers fig 6 the δ13calk data exhibited less influence on the estimated sediment source contributions hellinger distance close to zero table s3 compared to δ13cffa and δ13cbfa both ffas and bfas returned similar information on the source contributions in winter 2018 19 with the highest contribution from stream banks 76 and 71 respectively for winter 2019 20 sediment however ffa based estimation suggested that stream banks were still the primary sediment source 66 whereas bfa based estimation indicated that almost half 52 of the sampled sediment was derived from arable land despite the relatively high stream bank contributions estimated by bfas and ffas compared to other studies e g up to 55 evans et al 2017 bfas were judged to provide more realistic information based on field observations fig 1c narrow credible intervals and a hellinger distance close to 1 notably the choice of biotracers and mixing model structure can significantly impact on the accuracy and precision of estimated sediment source contributions fig 6 fig s5 composite fingerprints involving various biotracers can be highly promising for the apportionment of sediment sources that cannot be distinguished using other commonly used geochemical tracers in a catchment with complex land use to the best of our knowledge no previous study has characterized long chain alkane ffa and bfa abundance and corresponding δ13c values at catchment scale for apportioning sediment sources quantitatively the ways in which biotracers move through river catchments can cause their transformation which is of critical importance for sediment source apportionment physical chemical and biological factors can change during sediment transport leading to enchanced decomposition and mineralisation of biotracers within sediment de nijs and commeraat 2020 xiao et al 2018 and thereby alteration of the original isotopic composition inherited from the contributing sources upadhayay et al 2021 the contrasting sediment source composition estimated using the different biotracers fig 6 indicated that alkanes were not sensitive enough to apportion sediment sources correctly in fact alkanes cannot form strong bonds with soil and sediment due to their non functionalised apolar nature meaning that these biotracers are mostly protected by being enclosed within the intracellular space of clay minerals e g montmorillonite eltantawy and arnold 1972 this issue could be used to make an informed decision to reject alkanes as a robust biotracer for sediment source apportionment in contrast fas due to their mode of occurrence entrapment in microaggregates and direct organo mineral association preferentially remain 50 in the silt and clay size fraction angst et al 2018 and are less likely to be disturbed by aggregate breakdown during erosion because of this fine sediment sources in our study catchment were better represented by bfas nevertheless many processes can complicate the interpretation of any biotracer signatures in sediment these include selective leaching of alkanes or fas from plant litter and soils jandl et al 2013 leaf wax inputs from direct litter fall freimuth et al 2019 dry deposition of particulate waxes nelson et al 2018 or sorption desorption of biotracers in transit additionally the efficiency of time integrated sediment samplers for retaining very fine sediment during different flow conditions may introduce some degree of uncertainty in biotracer values it is not clear at this stage to what extent these processes introduce uncertainties in sediment source estimates and further research is certainly warranted here 3 3 land use change as a dominant driver of sediment dynamics during an extreme wet winter the magnitude of sediment flux is influenced by the intricate interactions between land use management and rainfall unsurprisingly arable land erosion was expected to be an important source of sediment in the extreme wet winter fig 6 given the relatively steep slopes median 4 5 exposure of bare tilled soils to erosive rainfall fig 1c as well as the role of conventional tillage practices for winter cereals in degrading soil structure and enhancing surface water runoff palmer and smith 2013 importantly the increase in arable land contributions during winter 2019 20 at the catchment outlet is strongly supported by field scale sediment load data from the nwfp that showed sediment loss from arable land was 4 6 times higher than that from adjacent pasture land fig 7 b this increase is explicitly attributed to the impact of land use conversion from grassland to arable land it should be noted that field 15 on the nwfp was new arable land which may not be fully representative of longer term arable land in the study catchment it is plausible that long term arable land can produce higher loss of sediment than arable land freshly converted from non marginal land due to higher compaction lower organic matter content and higher destruction of soil aggregates during long term tillage operations extreme rainfall alone in winter 2019 20 contributed a 3 5 times increase in sediment loss from pasture at field scale fig 7b despite the absence of grazing animals for most of the study months this is attributed to heavy rainfall increasing topsoil erosion and overland flow transport following strong establishment of surface pathway connectivity here our field scale data can be interpreted alongside the best guess of favis mortlock and boardman 1995 who suggested a 10 increase in winter rainfall could trigger a 150 increase in annual water erosion our data are in line with other studies both in the uk and around the world reporting that agricultural activities and land conversion to arable production are responsible for accelerated soil erosion evans et al 2017 prăvălie et al 2021 and that extreme rainfall increases erosion and sediment delivery even from land with recommended best management practices fiener et al 2019 although field 14 was assumed to represent the majority of pasture land in the study catchment it should be noted that our monitored field scale sediment loads on the nwfp may not be fully representative of the sediment loads from pasture or arable land in the study catchment due to variations in rainfall topography field size tillage intensity surface cover and sediment connectivity here it is noteworthy that substantial variability in rainfall and sediment loads amongst the nwfp field scale catchments has been reported by previous work zhang et al 2022 pulley and collins 2020 nevertheless our field scale data provided first hand information on the impact of heavy rainfall and or land use change on soil erosion for helping to corroborate the corresponding source contributions at larger scale we do acknowledge nonetheless that extrapolation of field scale data is challenged by the intrinsic variability and non linearity of erosion and sediment transport processes across scales kirkels et al 2014 rainfall amount is widely recognised as an important driver for runoff and sediment export at landscape scale baartman et al 2020 our study showed that the elevated low and high rain days 35 55 and 50 more days with 1 mm 5 mm 20 mm rainfall respectively fig 1b in winter 2019 20 compared with winter 2018 19 most likely enhanced sediment loss from pasture and arable land this can be attributed to a significant increase in saturation driven surface runoff as a result of prolonged low intensity rainfall fig s6 because antecedent soil hydrological conditions e g soil moisture content 50 in arable and pasture field fig 7 are an important control for hydro sedimentological responses mcmillan et al 2018 the catchment scale increase in pasture source contributions in winter 2019 20 compared to winter 2018 19 was about 1 order of magnitude lower than the corresponding monitored field scale increase in sediment load this clearly demonstrated that even well managed pasture is not resistance to the prolonged rainfall in terms of sediment loss and this can certainly increase sediment flux at the catchment scale disentangling the combined effects of prolonged rainfall and agricultural activities in increasing or decreasing sediment source contributions at the catchment scale is not straight forward nevertheless our field scale sediment loss monitoring on the nwfp provided a blueprint that heavy rainfall and land use interact non linearly and that their combined impact is highly detrimental the catchment 15 erosion rate increased 23 times in winter 2019 20 compared with winter 2018 19 to water and soil security 4 conclusions interactions between prolonged heavy rainfall and land use can elevate sediment loss and in turn this can undermine the efficacy of current best management practices for delivering sustainable agricultural intensification using and contrasting multiple biotracers in a fingerprinting procedure backed up by field scale monitoring of sediment loss from pasture and arable land on the one of the worlds most instrumented farm platforms our work shows a significant shift in both field scale erosion rates and catchment sediment source contributions during the wet winter 2019 20 compared to the relatively dry winter 2018 19 this shift underscores the current lack of resistance to perfect storms of extreme wet weather and land use risks in our lowland farmed landscapes in the uk effective transition of the uk s agricultural sector to help deliver more public goods and services clearly requires greater resilience to abiotic and indeed biotic stresses including those studied in this paper given projections of climate change some recent land use modelling ritchie et al 2019 suggests an expansion of the area under erosion prone crops e g cereals in our study area and the surrounding region of sw england our findings herein underscore the likely risk of significant environmental impacts under such scenarios unless the buffering capacity and resistance of agricultural landscapes is improved significantly clearly long term application of the approaches reported in this paper provide a robust means to monitor the impacts of any coordinated strategies to address the lack of resistance across scales through our application of multiple biotracers in the source fingerprinting component of the work herein we recommend the use of fas and especially bfas for source apportionment rather than alkanes further work is needed to test the conservative behaviour of the biotracers applied in this study and that work could include edge of field analysis using

16132,the presence of dissolved organic nitrogen don in biological nutrient removal bnr effluent has led to increased concern about its adverse effects on wastewater discharge and reuse applications previous studies have demonstrated efficient biological inorganic nitrogen removal in bnr under low dissolved oxygen do conditions however information on don is scarce this study investigated low do effects on don and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursor concentrations in bnr effluents identical bnr reactors consisting of an external real time do intelligent control system were operated at three different do concentrations 0 3 1 0 and 4 0 mgo2 l surprisingly significantly higher values of effluent don p 0 05 t test and ndma precursors p 0 01 t test were observed at lower do levels ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry analysis showed that molecules produced by microbes at low do levels exhibited high proteins amino sugars like and low normal oxidation state of carbon characteristics which possibly acted critical roles in ndma formation furthermore path analysis by partial least squares path modeling suggested that ndma formation potential had strong associations with microbe don network stability of microbe don co occurrence interactions r 0 979 p 0 01 these results highlight the necessity of reconsidering the feasibility of bnr systems operating at low do concentrations considering the adverse effects of don on wastewater discharge and reuse applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic nitrogen ndma dissolved oxygen biological wastewater treatment ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction the biological nutrient removal bnr process is one of the most common biotechnologies used to treat municipal wastewater dissolved organic nitrogen don is widely present in bnr effluents hu et al 2018 sattayatewa et al 2009 once diffused into the environment from wastewater treatment plants wwtps don can act as a substrate for microbial and algal growth in receiving waters which can lead to eutrophication sattayatewa et al 2009 it is also worth noting that a considerable amount of don has the greater potential to stimulate the algal growth than dissolved inorganic nitrogen din eom et al 2017 in addition don is also considered to be the precursor of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts particularly n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during wastewater chlorination the toxicity of these byproducts is much higher than that of carbonaceous disinfection byproducts lee et al 2007 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the presence of don in bnr effluent therefore not only affects the quality of wastewater effluent but also becomes a primary constraint for safe wastewater reuse since aeration in the bnr process can account for nearly half of the total electricity costs used at many wwtps previous studies have widely investigated the effect of low levels of dissolved oxygen do on the performance of bnr plants fitzgerald et al 2015 keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 according to the published literature nitrification can be maintained using low do concentrations on a lab scale fitzgerald et al 2015 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 and a pilot scale keene et al 2017 in the activated sludge reactors with 10 and 40 day solids retention times srts liu and wang 2013 demonstrated that complete nitrification was accomplished after long term operation with low do concentrations of 0 37 and 0 16 mgo2 l respectively it has been well demonstrated that high rate nitrification is attributed to the adaptation of activated sludge microbial communities to low do conditions keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 under long term low do condition nitrifier communities are enriched due to the inhibition of nitrifier endogenous decay liu and wang 2013 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria shifts into more competitive in utilizing don with increased oxygen affinity keene et al 2017 however previous studies have only focused on the shifts of microbial communities in bnr with low do concentrations as well as its related din removal characteristics and little is known about the don research has shown that changes in don and din are not necessarily coupled during bnr processes hu et al 2018 sattayatewa et al 2009 it is anticipated that the effect of low do concentrations on the removal characteristics of don is different from the effect on the removal characteristics of din furthermore several studies have shown that the normal microbial metabolism enables the variations of don components such as producing amino acids to the don antony et al 2017 czerwionka et al 2012 liao et al 2019 considering these thus microbial communities are expected to have functional importance for don variations at low do conditions wastewater effluent don is regarded as one of the most important sources of ndma precursors lee et al 2007 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 as don in wastewater is quite complex few studies have investigated the relationships between don characteristics and ndma precursors chang et al 2013 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 instead previous research has mainly focused on the individual ndma precursors such as dimethylamine quaternary amines cationic polymers and ion exchange resins pesticides herbicides and pharmaceuticals hanigan et al 2015 huang et al 2018 however these chemicals are detected at trace levels in wastewater and to date 70 of the don is unidentified chen et al 2014 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 in general efforts to identify specific precursors accounting for a significant fraction of ndma formation have been unsuccessful sgroi et al 2018 the characteristics of don are dependent upon its molecular composition recently high resolution mass spectrometry methods such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms and orbitrap ms have been the most efficacious tool for evaluating the detailed molecular composition of don allowing tens of thousands of unique organics in don to be identified xu et al 2020 using orbitrap ms analysis farré et al 2019 explored the correlation between the molecular composition of organics and the ndma formation potential and found that ndma formation potential is associated with compounds with high hydrogen saturation the objective of this research was to determine the effect of low do on the don concentrations and ndma formation potential in effluent from the bnr process don was analyzed by fticr ms to understand interactions between its molecular composition and ndma precursors and the origin of don with high ndma formation reactivity furthermore we assessed the adaptation of microbial communities to low do by 16s rrna sequencing and tried to achieve a mechanistic insight on the interactive relationships between don molecules ndma formation potential and microbial composition under low do functions by co occurrence network analysis and path analysis considering the adverse effects of don on wastewater discharge and reuse applications the results of this study help to gain comprehensive knowledge of the feasibility of bnr systems operating at low do concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup operation and monitoring the do below 2 0 mgo2 l was considered as low do conditions to inhibit the growth rate of nitrifiers and as a result previous studies selected do 2 0 mgo2 l as low do experimental conditions keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 previous reports determined do of 0 3 mgo2 l as the half saturation constant for ammonia oxidation fitzgerald et al 2015 keene et al 2017 and operated do average of 1 0 mgo2 l as a low do phase keene et al 2017 more importantly these two low do conditions have shown efficient high rate biological din removal in the previous research keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 thus two low do experimental groups with do of 0 3 mgo2 l and 1 0 mgo2 l were set in this study and another group with do of 4 0 mgo2 l a common value in lab scale pilot scale and full scale studies liu and wang 2013 was set as a control group in parallel six identical continuous flow bnr reactors anaerobic anoxic oxic process were operated at these three different do concentrations in oxic tanks and fed continuously with real wastewater a schematic of the bnr reactors is provided in the supporting information fig s1 consisting of anaerobic anoxic oxic and clarified tanks with the external recycle from clarifier to anaerobic tanks 50 influent and the internal recirculation from oxic to anoxic tanks 200 influent duplicate bnr reactors were used for each do condition each bnr reactor consisting of a 10 l plastic container with a working volume of 8 l was operated in the laboratory at a constant temperature of 25 c the quality of the real wastewater from a domestic wwtp in beijing china used as the influent for bnr reactors is shown in table 1 hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt are important parameters in the bnr systems excessive hrt causes organic matter depleting in anaerobic zone and decrease the denitrification efficiency in anoxic zone while too short hrt relates to the incomplete denitrification additionally a too long srt contributes to the sludge deterioration while a too short srt would induce the insufficient time for nitrifiers growth with poor nitrification efficiency thus these bnr systems were operated with a hrt of approximately 10 h and a srt of approximately 15 days to achieve a good condition for microorganisms the ph value for the influent is 7 4 on average the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss in oxic tanks of bnr reactors was approximately 3000 mg l the do concentration in the oxic tank of the bnr reactor was continuously monitored online using a hach do probe d53 hach corp usa and controlled with a programmed logic controller plc based on closed loop feedback control do in the bioreactor could be controlled at a set value the important criterion to confirm the steady state of reactor is to operate the reactors for more than three srts and achieve a constant effluent quality simsek et al 2016 thus each bnr in this study was operated for more than ten srts 150 days prior to monitoring the don to ensure the establishment of steady state conditions effluent samples were collected weekly after the conditions in each bnr reactor became stable the detailed description on sampling from the bnr reactors is presented in supporting information 2 2 don concentration measurement the don concentration was calculated as the residual of total dissolved nitrogen tdn minus the sum of the din after a dialysis based pretreatment hu et al 2018 previous studies and our application have validated that the dialysis based pretreatment is capable of increasing the measurement accuracy of don concentration with a good recovery 95 and only a slight loss 10 hu et al 2018 lee and westerhoff 2005 the din nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration was determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1100 usa epa of china 2016a epa of china 2016b the tdn was measured after persulfate digestion as the samples were oxidized to no3 n which was then quantified by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 usa epa of china 2016a 2 3 ndma formation potential test and ndma analysis the concentrations of ndma precursors in the effluent samples obtained from bnr reactors were analyzed by ndma formation potential tests detailed information on the method is provided elsewhere yoon et al 2011 briefly an excess chloramine solution prepared at ph 6 9 was added to react with effluent wastewater samples during the formation potential test the composite samples were stored in the dark for 10 days to provide a complete reaction of ndma precursors with chloramine to yield ndma n nitrosodimethylamine d6 ndma d6 supelco inc usa was added to the samples as a standard ndma was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms xevo tq waters usa 2 4 don extraction and molecular composition measurement don in bnr effluent was extracted by the solid phase extraction cartridge ppl supelco usa with a recovery rate of 61 5 68 8 which is similar as the reported values in wastewater zhang et al 2020 extracted don was analyzed by a 9 4 t fticr ms instrument bruker germany details of the setting parameters of the fticr ms instrument were in accordance with those of previous study hu et al 2018 the generated formulas were validated by

activated sludge from oxic tanks at steady state conditions of the bnr systems after operating 150 days activated sludge was collected from oxic tanks in triplicate dna extraction and sequencing

medicals ca usa following by sequencing analysis v3 v4 region by illumina miseq sequencing platform and data analysis by mothur liao et al 2019 2 6 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation

operating for more than ten srts 150 days the steady state effluent quality was obtained in six reactors as reported previously keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 complete nitrification under low do conditions can be also achieved in our study ammonia and nitrite removal efficiencies 94 fig s2 while effluent din has a slight increase as the do concentrations decreased from 4 0 mgo2 l to 0 3 mgo2 l 7 54 0 22 mg l at 4 0 mgo2 l 7 70 0 31 mg l at 1 0 mgo2 l and 7 92 0 52 mg l at 0 3 mgo2 l this increase was not statistically significant p 0 05 t test fig 1 a this indicated that comparing to the common condition 4 0 mgo2 l low do conditions 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l did not impact din removal significantly previous studies demonstrated that in conventional bnr systems the long term adaptation of nitrifiers to low do conditions can offset the adverse effects of short term low do conditions on nitrification performance and din removal keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 thus our preliminary investigations on bnr reactors at different do conditions have the consistent results with relevant studies keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 revealing the high rate low do nitrification can be achieved in low do bnr systems 3 2 effluent don and ndma precursor concentrations the distribution of effluent don for bnr reactors with different do conditions in the oxic tank are presented in fig 1b effluent don increased as the do concentrations decreased from 4 0 mgo2 l to 0 3 mgo2 l the concentration of effluent don derived from bnr reactor at do of 4 0 mgo2 l was 0 76 mg l in contrast the bnr reactors at low do 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l had significantly t test both p 0 01 higher effluent don concentrations which were 3 71 mg l and 2 20 mg l respectively the effluent don concentrations from bnr reactor at low do concentrations were also higher than those reported in effluent from full scale bnr wwtps 0 7 1 9 mg l with do 2 0 mgo2 l in the aerobic stage czerwionka et al 2012 merlo et al 2012 mekinia et al 2009 pagilla et al 2008 suggesting the inefficiency of bnr process at low do conditions in mitigating effluent don ndma formation potential was 448 ngndma l with the normalized value of 590 ngndma mgdon in effluent from bnr reactors at do of 4 0 mgo2 l interestingly ndma formation potential of effluent from bnr reactors under low do 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l conditions were significantly higher t test both p 0 05 than those at do of 4 0 mgo2 l regardless of the absolute ndma formation potential or its normalized value fig 1c it showed 5020 ngndma l 1353 ngndma mgdon at 0 3 mgo2 l and 4350 ngndma l 1977 ngndma mgdon at 1 0 mgo2 l since don is considered as the ndma precursors higher don concentrations under low do conditions may contribute to more nitrosation or reactions with chloramines to increase the ndma formation potential the application of chloramine in the formation potential test enables the maximization of ndma formation to decrease analytical problems mitch et al 2003 moreover the formation potential test via chloramine is a considerable common method to detect the ndma precursors with the wide applicability for various wastewater quality mccurry et al 2014 mitch et al 2003 although ndma formation potential test by chloramine may lead to higher measured values deviations between actual and measured values have not significant influence on explaining ndma formation potential under different do conditions considering these bnr effluent samples were chloraminated in this study rather than chlorinated effluent don of the bnr system is mainly divided into two groups based on the different sources influent derived don compounds from influent that are recalcitrant to the biotreatment and microbe derived don compounds that are produced from microbial metabolism in the biological treatment processes such as the nitrogen enriched macromolecules in soluble microbial products smps hu et al 2020 krasner et al 2009 according to previous research smps would accumulate significantly in the bioreactor under low do conditions e g 1 0 mgo2 l lu et al 2001 we therefore speculate that high effluent don and ndma precursors observed at low do conditions in this study may be attributed to the accumulation of smp based nitrogenous organic compounds this hypothesis will be further confirmed in the following section 3 3 interactions between the effluent don molecular composition and ndma precursors previous studies have found that ndma formation is related to the chemical characteristics of don krasner et al 2009 kristiana et al 2013 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 qi et al 2014 high resolution mass spectrometry fticr ms was applied to picture the molecular characteristics of effluent don from bnr reactors under different do conditions and understand interactions between the molecular composition of don and ndma precursors a total of 7445 molecular formulas were identified by fticr ms as don compounds the averaged characteristics of don molecular formulas in the test samples were shown in table s1 the high resolution ms data of don was visualized in a van krevelen diagram where formulas aligned at a certain point are related to a specific class of compounds yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 as shown in fig s3 the black solid lines across each plot separate the different classifications of don compounds for lipids proteins amino sugars unsaturated hydrocarbons lignin tannins carbohydrates and condensed aromatics the contribution of each compound classes was shown in fig 2 a farré et al 2019 have claimed that ndma formation potential in natural waters is associated with compounds with high hydrogen saturation h c 1 5 including lipids proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates like compounds the percentage of molecules in the h c 1 5 region was 22 81 49 45 and 53 54 at do concentrations of 4 0 mgo2 l 1 0 mgo2 l and 0 3 mgo2 l respectively fig 2b which showed a similar trend to the change of ndma formation potential in our study fig 1c interestingly spearman s rank correlation analysis showed that 73 6 of molecules positively associated with ndma precursors were proteins amino sugars like don fig 3 chen et al 2021 have suggested that the features of potential ndma precursors were more reduced e g proteins amino sugars like compounds via fticr ms protein like materials in wastewater drinking water and stream waters have also been found to correlate well with the bulk ndma formation potential roccaro et al 2020 uzun et al 2020 yang et al 2015 our findings argued that the compounds with high hydrogen saturation h c 1 5 especially the proteins amino sugars like don molecules are more prone to form ndma during chloramination and might make a large contribution to variations of ndma precursors concentrations among effluent don samples from bnr reactors with different do conditions 3 4 the origin of don with high reactivity in forming ndma microbes are generally thought of as don consumers but they can also be important remineralizers and producers of nitrogenous organic molecules antony et al 2017 such as smp based nitrogenous organic compounds smps include utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps xie et al 2016 prior studies have reported that uaps were mainly composed of proteins tian et al 2011 and could be readily reutilized as carbon source by microbes under aerobic conditions ni et al 2010 ni et al 2011 baps contain more carbohydrates and are less biodegradable than uaps ma et al 2015 fig 4 and table 2 showed changes of don compounds between the influent and effluent from bnr reactors under different do conditions under low do conditions 31 45 34 65 of the produced molecules was proteins amino sugars like compounds while only 6 66 7 70 was carbohydrates like compounds comparatively at a do concentration of 4 0 mgo2 l only 8 88 of the produced molecules were proteins amino sugars like compounds and 9 82 were carbohydrates like compounds table 2 the higher relative abundance of proteins amino sugars like produced don at low do conditions indicated that more uaps were accumulated due to the oxygen limitations uaps have been proven to have higher ndma formation potential than baps ma et al 2015 hence the elevated reactivity of effluent don in forming ndma at low do conditions may be attributable to the accumulation of uaps the normal oxidation state of carbon nosc was used to reflect the redox potential of a given formula and indicate whether microbial oxidation of organic compounds is thermodynamically favorable boye et al 2017 a positive value of nosc implies the oxidized compound while a negative nosc value represents the reduced compound previous studies have indicated that highly reduced organic compounds with lower nosc are preferentially preserved because they provide insufficient energy to sustain microbial respiratory growth with available electron acceptor leading the microbial oxidation of these materials thermodynamically unfavorable boye et al 2017 in our results fig s4 the average nosc of produced don from bnr reactor at do of 4 0 mgo2 l was 0 17 however nosc of produced don under low do 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l conditions were 0 31 and 0 19 respectively the apparently lower average nosc indicated that don produced in bnr reactors at low do conditions was less oxidized thus deciphering the build up of uap based nitrogenous organic compounds in summary we suggest that the low do conditions would retard the microbial oxidation process leading to the accumulation of reduced don molecules such as proteins amino sugars like compounds with negative nosc these molecules were mainly produced by microbes and associated with uap which would possibly play a critical role in ndma formation 3 5 co occurrence networks of microbial compositions and don molecules in agree with previous studies keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 liu et al 2021 reactors in different do conditions 4 0 1 0 and 0 3 mgo2 l had significant different microbial communities fig s5 phylum level all of microbial compositions in different do were mainly composed of actinobacteriota 21 4 30 4 proteobacteria 20 2 24 4 chloroflexi 10 6 15 3 and firmicutes 3 5 22 9 with distinctions in the abundance and diversity of functional microbes among them firmicutes significantly increased under low do conditions 3 5 4 0 mgo2 l 17 0 1 0 mgo2 l 22 9 0 3 mgo2 l while the other dominant bacteria at the phylum level decreased fig s5 members of firmicutes involve in a series of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria which enable various enzyme generation xie et al 2021 moreover actinobacteriota proteobacteria and chloroflexi are involved in statues of activated sludge or functions of pollutant removal which are important functional bacteria wang et al 2021 xie et al 2021 these results indicated that low do conditions became a selection factor affecting abundance of functional bacteria for these dominant bacteria firmicutes increased under low do and occupied niches with actinobacteriota proteobacteria and chloroflexi followed by the depression of their organics removal functions it means that as a kind of organics don degradation may be decreased additionally the strengthening metabolism activities by increased firmicutes could lead to the excretion of nitrogen containing metabolites thus effluent don under low do may be the result of the increased production process and the decreased degradation process accordingly effluent don may be a result of microbial community shifts under low do conditions to understand the microbial mechanism in this process the co occurrence positive and co exclusion negative relationships between microbes and don molecules under low do effects were explored by network analysis significant p 0 05 and strong r 0 9 or r 0 9 microbe don interactions were shown in fig 5 the network consisted of 14477 edges and 6267 nodes it is noteworthy that 91 7 don molecule nodes 5751 in 6223 don molecule connecting with microbes were belonged to produced don fig 4 produced don was identified as the new molecules in bnr reactors which was derived from microbial activities antony et al 2017 this result confirmed that microbes determined the generation of microbe original don molecules under the low do conditions furthermore co occurrence relationships positive 63 7 were more than co exclusion relationships negative 36 3 in the microbe don interactions differences on don molecular compositions were identified when the network was categorized into 6 modules marked as m0 m5 according to the topological characteristics in the microbe don interactions it indicated that proteins amino sugars like don were prone to exist in modules with high proportions of co occurrence relationships e g m5 fig 5 while modules with high proportions of co exclusion relationships e g m1 assembled less proteins amino sugars like molecules that is the co occurrence relationships appeared to have close associations with proteins amino sugars like molecules thus these results further suggested that the ratios of co occurrence and co exclusion relationships in the microbe don interactions were responsible for changes in don molecular compositions under the low do effects it indicated that microbes in the co occurrence relationships are prone to generate proteins amino sugars like don considering this under low do the increase of specific bacteria in the co occurrence relationships may induce more proteins amino sugars like don molecules by the corresponding metabolism activities as a result don characteristics in effluents changed the positive associations between ndma precursors and proteins amino sugars like don have been illustrated previously fig 3 in this context it is reasonable to deduce that low do reconstructed microbe don interactions via mediating ratios of co occurrence and co exclusion relationships and thus dictated effluent ndma formation potential by microbe triggered variations in effluent don molecular compositions 3 6 qualitative and quantitative response relationships among do microbes don molecules and ndma formation potential to further confirm our inference pls pm was used to quantify the indirect and direct interactions among variables do microbial community structure microbial community diversity don molecular characteristics and ndma formation potential fig 6 additionally microbe don network stability achieved by co occurrence network of microbes and don reflecting the invariability of function to degrade don was considered together with other variables the pls pm model further verified that 1 do concentrations strongly influenced microbial compositions microbial community structure r 0 982 p 0 01 microbial community diversity r 0 991 p 0 01 and microbe don network stability r 0 979 p 0 01 2 don molecular characteristics appeared mostly dependent on microbes by strongly associating with microbial community diversity r 0 729 p 0 05 and 3 the determinant effects were directed from don molecular characteristics and toward ndma formation potential r 0 900 p 0 05 based on results of pls pm analysis the close interactions between do and microbial compositions were further confirmed which were consistent with previous investigations that low do conditions enable the shift of microbial communities keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 liu et al 2021 however the correlations between microbial compositions and ndma formation potential are not significant microbial community structure r 0 051 p 0 05 microbial community diversity r 0 330 p 0 05 it suggested that the shift of microbial compositions was not the main and direct contributor for low do effects on ndma formation potential the low do effects on ndma formation potential may be involved in another significant pathway combined with close correlations in pls pm another significant pathway mechanistical understanding of the low do effects on ndma formation potential and their associations with don can be achieved the direct biological effects of low do on microbial communities in bnr reactors were delivered along do microbial community diversity don molecular characteristics and ndma formation potential linkages to ndma formation potential this interaction is similar as previous reported relationships among low do microbes and din removal efficiency fitzgerald et al 2015 keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 indicating that there is a chain to transport the low do effects in the constructed chain by pls pm analysis don molecules were shown to transport the biological effects of low do to ndma formation potential in the final step these pathways supported that under low do conditions microbes had the joint effects on effluent ndma formation potential via changes in don molecular compositions moreover the relative importance of different contents in microbes were different and microbial community diversity had more important influences in the interactive pathways 3 7 implications for wwtps with the bnr processes it is widely recognized that long term low do strategy enable reduce the energy costs with a stable and satisfying din removal efficiency keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 based on controlled bnr reactors studies however we found that a high probability that low do bnr reactors have higher effluent don concentrations which also showed greater ndma formation potential thus the merit of reducing energy cost by low do conditions with the stable and efficient din removal performance compared to high do conditions may be offset by a small yet potent source of potential ndma precursors in this case whether low do strategy should be encouraged is needed to reconsider additionally findings in this study reveal the significance to focus on the health risk and burden from low do strategy to subsequent direct potable water reuse with water quality and quantity rapidly declining wastewater reclamation has been an important approach to achieve sustainable water resource management wwtp effluents can be reused in direct potable uses after advanced treatment processes conventional direct potable reuse or upstream wwtp effluents present in practically water source for drinking water production de facto direct potable reuse diana et al 2019 dotson et al 2009 in both cases it is needed to minimize impacts of don from bnr system on direct potable reuse for conventional potable reuse efforts can be made to establish improve advanced treatment processes after the bnr process tertiary treatment processes in wwtps to decrease don and its ndma formation potential some potable water reuse treatment processes on nitrogenous organic matter removal can be adopted for example it is reported that nitrogenous organic compounds can be removed by ozonation and biofiltration krasner et al 2012 kristiana et al 2013 phungsai et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus ozone and sand granular activated carbon filter may minimize the effluent don and its ndma formation potential in advanced treatment processes for direct potable water reuse for de facto direct potable reuse it is required to carefully consider the low do strategy if a low do strategy replaces the existed aeration operations there may have a great level of don and ndma formation potential in bnr system effluents and the adverse chain effects of wwtps without advanced treatment processes on drinking water 4 conclusions this study investigated the low do effects on effluent don and ndma precursor from bnr systems and combined fticr ms analysis and microbe don co occurrence analysis as well as path analysis to provide a mechanistic insight in the low do effects the main conclusions of this study are as follows the adverse effects of low do conditions on controlling effluent don and ndma formation potential cannot be negligible without significant difference p 0 05 t test in din removal efficiency at do of 4 0 1 0 or 0 3 mgo2 l completed nitrification can be achieved at low do conditions however low do conditions 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l caused a significant increase p 0 05 t test in don and ndma precursors controlling effluent proteins amino sugars like don may be of benefit for decreasing ndma formation potential 73 6 positive relationships between ndma precursors and don molecules were attributed to proteins amino sugars like don which was considered as the main contributor for ndma precursors the accumulation of microbe derived don was the important reason for increased trends of don with high reactivity in forming ndma more proteins amino sugars like don molecules produced at low do conditions presenting a low redox potential to be re utilized in microbial oxidation the increased proteins amino sugars like don molecules with a low re utilization rate resulted in high effluent proteins amino sugars like don mechanistically the direct low do effects on microbes were firstly delivered through the linkages among do microbial community diversity don molecular characteristics and ndma formation potential and then affected ndma formation potential there are two sides of low do strategies on nitrogen removal the favorable and adverse effects of low do

16132,the presence of dissolved organic nitrogen don in biological nutrient removal bnr effluent has led to increased concern about its adverse effects on wastewater discharge and reuse applications previous studies have demonstrated efficient biological inorganic nitrogen removal in bnr under low dissolved oxygen do conditions however information on don is scarce this study investigated low do effects on don and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursor concentrations in bnr effluents identical bnr reactors consisting of an external real time do intelligent control system were operated at three different do concentrations 0 3 1 0 and 4 0 mgo2 l surprisingly significantly higher values of effluent don p 0 05 t test and ndma precursors p 0 01 t test were observed at lower do levels ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry analysis showed that molecules produced by microbes at low do levels exhibited high proteins amino sugars like and low normal oxidation state of carbon characteristics which possibly acted critical roles in ndma formation furthermore path analysis by partial least squares path modeling suggested that ndma formation potential had strong associations with microbe don network stability of microbe don co occurrence interactions r 0 979 p 0 01 these results highlight the necessity of reconsidering the feasibility of bnr systems operating at low do concentrations considering the adverse effects of don on wastewater discharge and reuse applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic nitrogen ndma dissolved oxygen biological wastewater treatment ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction the biological nutrient removal bnr process is one of the most common biotechnologies used to treat municipal wastewater dissolved organic nitrogen don is widely present in bnr effluents hu et al 2018 sattayatewa et al 2009 once diffused into the environment from wastewater treatment plants wwtps don can act as a substrate for microbial and algal growth in receiving waters which can lead to eutrophication sattayatewa et al 2009 it is also worth noting that a considerable amount of don has the greater potential to stimulate the algal growth than dissolved inorganic nitrogen din eom et al 2017 in addition don is also considered to be the precursor of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts particularly n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during wastewater chlorination the toxicity of these byproducts is much higher than that of carbonaceous disinfection byproducts lee et al 2007 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the presence of don in bnr effluent therefore not only affects the quality of wastewater effluent but also becomes a primary constraint for safe wastewater reuse since aeration in the bnr process can account for nearly half of the total electricity costs used at many wwtps previous studies have widely investigated the effect of low levels of dissolved oxygen do on the performance of bnr plants fitzgerald et al 2015 keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 according to the published literature nitrification can be maintained using low do concentrations on a lab scale fitzgerald et al 2015 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 and a pilot scale keene et al 2017 in the activated sludge reactors with 10 and 40 day solids retention times srts liu and wang 2013 demonstrated that complete nitrification was accomplished after long term operation with low do concentrations of 0 37 and 0 16 mgo2 l respectively it has been well demonstrated that high rate nitrification is attributed to the adaptation of activated sludge microbial communities to low do conditions keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 under long term low do condition nitrifier communities are enriched due to the inhibition of nitrifier endogenous decay liu and wang 2013 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria shifts into more competitive in utilizing don with increased oxygen affinity keene et al 2017 however previous studies have only focused on the shifts of microbial communities in bnr with low do concentrations as well as its related din removal characteristics and little is known about the don research has shown that changes in don and din are not necessarily coupled during bnr processes hu et al 2018 sattayatewa et al 2009 it is anticipated that the effect of low do concentrations on the removal characteristics of don is different from the effect on the removal characteristics of din furthermore several studies have shown that the normal microbial metabolism enables the variations of don components such as producing amino acids to the don antony et al 2017 czerwionka et al 2012 liao et al 2019 considering these thus microbial communities are expected to have functional importance for don variations at low do conditions wastewater effluent don is regarded as one of the most important sources of ndma precursors lee et al 2007 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 as don in wastewater is quite complex few studies have investigated the relationships between don characteristics and ndma precursors chang et al 2013 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 instead previous research has mainly focused on the individual ndma precursors such as dimethylamine quaternary amines cationic polymers and ion exchange resins pesticides herbicides and pharmaceuticals hanigan et al 2015 huang et al 2018 however these chemicals are detected at trace levels in wastewater and to date 70 of the don is unidentified chen et al 2014 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 in general efforts to identify specific precursors accounting for a significant fraction of ndma formation have been unsuccessful sgroi et al 2018 the characteristics of don are dependent upon its molecular composition recently high resolution mass spectrometry methods such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms and orbitrap ms have been the most efficacious tool for evaluating the detailed molecular composition of don allowing tens of thousands of unique organics in don to be identified xu et al 2020 using orbitrap ms analysis farré et al 2019 explored the correlation between the molecular composition of organics and the ndma formation potential and found that ndma formation potential is associated with compounds with high hydrogen saturation the objective of this research was to determine the effect of low do on the don concentrations and ndma formation potential in effluent from the bnr process don was analyzed by fticr ms to understand interactions between its molecular composition and ndma precursors and the origin of don with high ndma formation reactivity furthermore we assessed the adaptation of microbial communities to low do by 16s rrna sequencing and tried to achieve a mechanistic insight on the interactive relationships between don molecules ndma formation potential and microbial composition under low do functions by co occurrence network analysis and path analysis considering the adverse effects of don on wastewater discharge and reuse applications the results of this study help to gain comprehensive knowledge of the feasibility of bnr systems operating at low do concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup operation and monitoring the do below 2 0 mgo2 l was considered as low do conditions to inhibit the growth rate of nitrifiers and as a result previous studies selected do 2 0 mgo2 l as low do experimental conditions keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 previous reports determined do of 0 3 mgo2 l as the half saturation constant for ammonia oxidation fitzgerald et al 2015 keene et al 2017 and operated do average of 1 0 mgo2 l as a low do phase keene et al 2017 more importantly these two low do conditions have shown efficient high rate biological din removal in the previous research keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 thus two low do experimental groups with do of 0 3 mgo2 l and 1 0 mgo2 l were set in this study and another group with do of 4 0 mgo2 l a common value in lab scale pilot scale and full scale studies liu and wang 2013 was set as a control group in parallel six identical continuous flow bnr reactors anaerobic anoxic oxic process were operated at these three different do concentrations in oxic tanks and fed continuously with real wastewater a schematic of the bnr reactors is provided in the supporting information fig s1 consisting of anaerobic anoxic oxic and clarified tanks with the external recycle from clarifier to anaerobic tanks 50 influent and the internal recirculation from oxic to anoxic tanks 200 influent duplicate bnr reactors were used for each do condition each bnr reactor consisting of a 10 l plastic container with a working volume of 8 l was operated in the laboratory at a constant temperature of 25 c the quality of the real wastewater from a domestic wwtp in beijing china used as the influent for bnr reactors is shown in table 1 hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt are important parameters in the bnr systems excessive hrt causes organic matter depleting in anaerobic zone and decrease the denitrification efficiency in anoxic zone while too short hrt relates to the incomplete denitrification additionally a too long srt contributes to the sludge deterioration while a too short srt would induce the insufficient time for nitrifiers growth with poor nitrification efficiency thus these bnr systems were operated with a hrt of approximately 10 h and a srt of approximately 15 days to achieve a good condition for microorganisms the ph value for the influent is 7 4 on average the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss in oxic tanks of bnr reactors was approximately 3000 mg l the do concentration in the oxic tank of the bnr reactor was continuously monitored online using a hach do probe d53 hach corp usa and controlled with a programmed logic controller plc based on closed loop feedback control do in the bioreactor could be controlled at a set value the important criterion to confirm the steady state of reactor is to operate the reactors for more than three srts and achieve a constant effluent quality simsek et al 2016 thus each bnr in this study was operated for more than ten srts 150 days prior to monitoring the don to ensure the establishment of steady state conditions effluent samples were collected weekly after the conditions in each bnr reactor became stable the detailed description on sampling from the bnr reactors is presented in supporting information 2 2 don concentration measurement the don concentration was calculated as the residual of total dissolved nitrogen tdn minus the sum of the din after a dialysis based pretreatment hu et al 2018 previous studies and our application have validated that the dialysis based pretreatment is capable of increasing the measurement accuracy of don concentration with a good recovery 95 and only a slight loss 10 hu et al 2018 lee and westerhoff 2005 the din nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration was determined by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1100 usa epa of china 2016a epa of china 2016b the tdn was measured after persulfate digestion as the samples were oxidized to no3 n which was then quantified by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 usa epa of china 2016a 2 3 ndma formation potential test and ndma analysis the concentrations of ndma precursors in the effluent samples obtained from bnr reactors were analyzed by ndma formation potential tests detailed information on the method is provided elsewhere yoon et al 2011 briefly an excess chloramine solution prepared at ph 6 9 was added to react with effluent wastewater samples during the formation potential test the composite samples were stored in the dark for 10 days to provide a complete reaction of ndma precursors with chloramine to yield ndma n nitrosodimethylamine d6 ndma d6 supelco inc usa was added to the samples as a standard ndma was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms xevo tq waters usa 2 4 don extraction and molecular composition measurement don in bnr effluent was extracted by the solid phase extraction cartridge ppl supelco usa with a recovery rate of 61 5 68 8 which is similar as the reported values in wastewater zhang et al 2020 extracted don was analyzed by a 9 4 t fticr ms instrument bruker germany details of the setting parameters of the fticr ms instrument were in accordance with those of previous study hu et al 2018 the generated formulas were validated by

activated sludge from oxic tanks at steady state conditions of the bnr systems after operating 150 days activated sludge was collected from oxic tanks in triplicate dna extraction and sequencing

medicals ca usa following by sequencing analysis v3 v4 region by illumina miseq sequencing platform and data analysis by mothur liao et al 2019 2 6 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied to explore associations between don formulas and ndma precursors co occurrence networks were established to link don formulas and microbial compositions furthermore path analysis by partial least squares path modeling pls pm was conducted in do concentrations don molecules ndma formation potential and microbial compositions to illustrate their direct indirect and interactive effects in the systems detailed on spearman s rank correlation analysis network analysis and pls pm were described in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 bnr reactor performance after operating for more than ten srts 150 days the steady state effluent quality was obtained in six reactors as reported previously keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 complete nitrification under low do conditions can be also achieved in our study ammonia and nitrite removal efficiencies 94 fig s2 while effluent din has a slight increase as the do concentrations decreased from 4 0 mgo2 l to 0 3 mgo2 l 7 54 0 22 mg l at 4 0 mgo2 l 7 70 0 31 mg l at 1 0 mgo2 l and 7 92 0 52 mg l at 0 3 mgo2 l this increase was not statistically significant p 0 05 t test fig 1 a this indicated that comparing to the common condition 4 0 mgo2 l low do conditions 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l did not impact din removal significantly previous studies demonstrated that in conventional bnr systems the long term adaptation of nitrifiers to low do conditions can offset the adverse effects of short term low do conditions on nitrification performance and din removal keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 thus our preliminary investigations on bnr reactors at different do conditions have the consistent results with relevant studies keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 waki et al 2018 revealing the high rate low do nitrification can be achieved in low do bnr systems 3 2 effluent don and ndma precursor concentrations the distribution of effluent don for bnr reactors with different do conditions in the oxic tank are presented in fig 1b effluent don increased as the do concentrations decreased from 4 0 mgo2 l to 0 3 mgo2 l the concentration of effluent don derived from bnr reactor at do of 4 0 mgo2 l was 0 76 mg l in contrast the bnr reactors at low do 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l had significantly t test both p 0 01 higher effluent don concentrations which were 3 71 mg l and 2 20 mg l respectively the effluent don concentrations from bnr reactor at low do concentrations were also higher than those reported in effluent from full scale bnr wwtps 0 7 1 9 mg l with do 2 0 mgo2 l in the aerobic stage czerwionka et al 2012 merlo et al 2012 mekinia et al 2009 pagilla et al 2008 suggesting the inefficiency of bnr process at low do conditions in mitigating effluent don ndma formation potential was 448 ngndma l with the normalized value of 590 ngndma mgdon in effluent from bnr reactors at do of 4 0 mgo2 l interestingly ndma formation potential of effluent from bnr reactors under low do 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l conditions were significantly higher t test both p 0 05 than those at do of 4 0 mgo2 l regardless of the absolute ndma formation potential or its normalized value fig 1c it showed 5020 ngndma l 1353 ngndma mgdon at 0 3 mgo2 l and 4350 ngndma l 1977 ngndma mgdon at 1 0 mgo2 l since don is considered as the ndma precursors higher don concentrations under low do conditions may contribute to more nitrosation or reactions with chloramines to increase the ndma formation potential the application of chloramine in the formation potential test enables the maximization of ndma formation to decrease analytical problems mitch et al 2003 moreover the formation potential test via chloramine is a considerable common method to detect the ndma precursors with the wide applicability for various wastewater quality mccurry et al 2014 mitch et al 2003 although ndma formation potential test by chloramine may lead to higher measured values deviations between actual and measured values have not significant influence on explaining ndma formation potential under different do conditions considering these bnr effluent samples were chloraminated in this study rather than chlorinated effluent don of the bnr system is mainly divided into two groups based on the different sources influent derived don compounds from influent that are recalcitrant to the biotreatment and microbe derived don compounds that are produced from microbial metabolism in the biological treatment processes such as the nitrogen enriched macromolecules in soluble microbial products smps hu et al 2020 krasner et al 2009 according to previous research smps would accumulate significantly in the bioreactor under low do conditions e g 1 0 mgo2 l lu et al 2001 we therefore speculate that high effluent don and ndma precursors observed at low do conditions in this study may be attributed to the accumulation of smp based nitrogenous organic compounds this hypothesis will be further confirmed in the following section 3 3 interactions between the effluent don molecular composition and ndma precursors previous studies have found that ndma formation is related to the chemical characteristics of don krasner et al 2009 kristiana et al 2013 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 qi et al 2014 high resolution mass spectrometry fticr ms was applied to picture the molecular characteristics of effluent don from bnr reactors under different do conditions and understand interactions between the molecular composition of don and ndma precursors a total of 7445 molecular formulas were identified by fticr ms as don compounds the averaged characteristics of don molecular formulas in the test samples were shown in table s1 the high resolution ms data of don was visualized in a van krevelen diagram where formulas aligned at a certain point are related to a specific class of compounds yuan et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 as shown in fig s3 the black solid lines across each plot separate the different classifications of don compounds for lipids proteins amino sugars unsaturated hydrocarbons lignin tannins carbohydrates and condensed aromatics the contribution of each compound classes was shown in fig 2 a farré et al 2019 have claimed that ndma formation potential in natural waters is associated with compounds with high hydrogen saturation h c 1 5 including lipids proteins amino sugars and carbohydrates like compounds the percentage of molecules in the h c 1 5 region was 22 81 49 45 and 53 54 at do concentrations of 4 0 mgo2 l 1 0 mgo2 l and 0 3 mgo2 l respectively fig 2b which showed a similar trend to the change of ndma formation potential in our study fig 1c interestingly spearman s rank correlation analysis showed that 73 6 of molecules positively associated with ndma precursors were proteins amino sugars like don fig 3 chen et al 2021 have suggested that the features of potential ndma precursors were more reduced e g proteins amino sugars like compounds via fticr ms protein like materials in wastewater drinking water and stream waters have also been found to correlate well with the bulk ndma formation potential roccaro et al 2020 uzun et al 2020 yang et al 2015 our findings argued that the compounds with high hydrogen saturation h c 1 5 especially the proteins amino sugars like don molecules are more prone to form ndma during chloramination and might make a large contribution to variations of ndma precursors concentrations among effluent don samples from bnr reactors with different do conditions 3 4 the origin of don with high reactivity in forming ndma microbes are generally thought of as don consumers but they can also be important remineralizers and producers of nitrogenous organic molecules antony et al 2017 such as smp based nitrogenous organic compounds smps include utilization associated products uaps and biomass associated products baps xie et al 2016 prior studies have reported that uaps were mainly composed of proteins tian et al 2011 and could be readily reutilized as carbon source by microbes under aerobic conditions ni et al 2010 ni et al 2011 baps contain more carbohydrates and are less biodegradable than uaps ma et al 2015 fig 4 and table 2 showed changes of don compounds between the influent and effluent from bnr reactors under different do conditions under low do conditions 31 45 34 65 of the produced molecules was proteins amino sugars like compounds while only 6 66 7 70 was carbohydrates like compounds comparatively at a do concentration of 4 0 mgo2 l only 8 88 of the produced molecules were proteins amino sugars like compounds and 9 82 were carbohydrates like compounds table 2 the higher relative abundance of proteins amino sugars like produced don at low do conditions indicated that more uaps were accumulated due to the oxygen limitations uaps have been proven to have higher ndma formation potential than baps ma et al 2015 hence the elevated reactivity of effluent don in forming ndma at low do conditions may be attributable to the accumulation of uaps the normal oxidation state of carbon nosc was used to reflect the redox potential of a given formula and indicate whether microbial oxidation of organic compounds is thermodynamically favorable boye et al 2017 a positive value of nosc implies the oxidized compound while a negative nosc value represents the reduced compound previous studies have indicated that highly reduced organic compounds with lower nosc are preferentially preserved because they provide insufficient energy to sustain microbial respiratory growth with available electron acceptor leading the microbial oxidation of these materials thermodynamically unfavorable boye et al 2017 in our results fig s4 the average nosc of produced don from bnr reactor at do of 4 0 mgo2 l was 0 17 however nosc of produced don under low do 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l conditions were 0 31 and 0 19 respectively the apparently lower average nosc indicated that don produced in bnr reactors at low do conditions was less oxidized thus deciphering the build up of uap based nitrogenous organic compounds in summary we suggest that the low do conditions would retard the microbial oxidation process leading to the accumulation of reduced don molecules such as proteins amino sugars like compounds with negative nosc these molecules were mainly produced by microbes and associated with uap which would possibly play a critical role in ndma formation 3 5 co occurrence networks of microbial compositions and don molecules in agree with previous studies keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 liu et al 2021 reactors in different do conditions 4 0 1 0 and 0 3 mgo2 l had significant different microbial communities fig s5 phylum level all of microbial compositions in different do were mainly composed of actinobacteriota 21 4 30 4 proteobacteria 20 2 24 4 chloroflexi 10 6 15 3 and firmicutes 3 5 22 9 with distinctions in the abundance and diversity of functional microbes among them firmicutes significantly increased under low do conditions 3 5 4 0 mgo2 l 17 0 1 0 mgo2 l 22 9 0 3 mgo2 l while the other dominant bacteria at the phylum level decreased fig s5 members of firmicutes involve in a series of aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria which enable various enzyme generation xie et al 2021 moreover actinobacteriota proteobacteria and chloroflexi are involved in statues of activated sludge or functions of pollutant removal which are important functional bacteria wang et al 2021 xie et al 2021 these results indicated that low do conditions became a selection factor affecting abundance of functional bacteria for these dominant bacteria firmicutes increased under low do and occupied niches with actinobacteriota proteobacteria and chloroflexi followed by the depression of their organics removal functions it means that as a kind of organics don degradation may be decreased additionally the strengthening metabolism activities by increased firmicutes could lead to the excretion of nitrogen containing metabolites thus effluent don under low do may be the result of the increased production process and the decreased degradation process accordingly effluent don may be a result of microbial community shifts under low do conditions to understand the microbial mechanism in this process the co occurrence positive and co exclusion negative relationships between microbes and don molecules under low do effects were explored by network analysis significant p 0 05 and strong r 0 9 or r 0 9 microbe don interactions were shown in fig 5 the network consisted of 14477 edges and 6267 nodes it is noteworthy that 91 7 don molecule nodes 5751 in 6223 don molecule connecting with microbes were belonged to produced don fig 4 produced don was identified as the new molecules in bnr reactors which was derived from microbial activities antony et al 2017 this result confirmed that microbes determined the generation of microbe original don molecules under the low do conditions furthermore co occurrence relationships positive 63 7 were more than co exclusion relationships negative 36 3 in the microbe don interactions differences on don molecular compositions were identified when the network was categorized into 6 modules marked as m0 m5 according to the topological characteristics in the microbe don interactions it indicated that proteins amino sugars like don were prone to exist in modules with high proportions of co occurrence relationships e g m5 fig 5 while modules with high proportions of co exclusion relationships e g m1 assembled less proteins amino sugars like molecules that is the co occurrence relationships appeared to have close associations with proteins amino sugars like molecules thus these results further suggested that the ratios of co occurrence and co exclusion relationships in the microbe don interactions were responsible for changes in don molecular compositions under the low do effects it indicated that microbes in the co occurrence relationships are prone to generate proteins amino sugars like don considering this under low do the increase of specific bacteria in the co occurrence relationships may induce more proteins amino sugars like don molecules by the corresponding metabolism activities as a result don characteristics in effluents changed the positive associations between ndma precursors and proteins amino sugars like don have been illustrated previously fig 3 in this context it is reasonable to deduce that low do reconstructed microbe don interactions via mediating ratios of co occurrence and co exclusion relationships and thus dictated effluent ndma formation potential by microbe triggered variations in effluent don molecular compositions 3 6 qualitative and quantitative response relationships among do microbes don molecules and ndma formation potential to further confirm our inference pls pm was used to quantify the indirect and direct interactions among variables do microbial community structure microbial community diversity don molecular characteristics and ndma formation potential fig 6 additionally microbe don network stability achieved by co occurrence network of microbes and don reflecting the invariability of function to degrade don was considered together with other variables the pls pm model further verified that 1 do concentrations strongly influenced microbial compositions microbial community structure r 0 982 p 0 01 microbial community diversity r 0 991 p 0 01 and microbe don network stability r 0 979 p 0 01 2 don molecular characteristics appeared mostly dependent on microbes by strongly associating with microbial community diversity r 0 729 p 0 05 and 3 the determinant effects were directed from don molecular characteristics and toward ndma formation potential r 0 900 p 0 05 based on results of pls pm analysis the close interactions between do and microbial compositions were further confirmed which were consistent with previous investigations that low do conditions enable the shift of microbial communities keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 liu et al 2021 however the correlations between microbial compositions and ndma formation potential are not significant microbial community structure r 0 051 p 0 05 microbial community diversity r 0 330 p 0 05 it suggested that the shift of microbial compositions was not the main and direct contributor for low do effects on ndma formation potential the low do effects on ndma formation potential may be involved in another significant pathway combined with close correlations in pls pm another significant pathway mechanistical understanding of the low do effects on ndma formation potential and their associations with don can be achieved the direct biological effects of low do on microbial communities in bnr reactors were delivered along do microbial community diversity don molecular characteristics and ndma formation potential linkages to ndma formation potential this interaction is similar as previous reported relationships among low do microbes and din removal efficiency fitzgerald et al 2015 keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 indicating that there is a chain to transport the low do effects in the constructed chain by pls pm analysis don molecules were shown to transport the biological effects of low do to ndma formation potential in the final step these pathways supported that under low do conditions microbes had the joint effects on effluent ndma formation potential via changes in don molecular compositions moreover the relative importance of different contents in microbes were different and microbial community diversity had more important influences in the interactive pathways 3 7 implications for wwtps with the bnr processes it is widely recognized that long term low do strategy enable reduce the energy costs with a stable and satisfying din removal efficiency keene et al 2017 liu and wang 2013 based on controlled bnr reactors studies however we found that a high probability that low do bnr reactors have higher effluent don concentrations which also showed greater ndma formation potential thus the merit of reducing energy cost by low do conditions with the stable and efficient din removal performance compared to high do conditions may be offset by a small yet potent source of potential ndma precursors in this case whether low do strategy should be encouraged is needed to reconsider additionally findings in this study reveal the significance to focus on the health risk and burden from low do strategy to subsequent direct potable water reuse with water quality and quantity rapidly declining wastewater reclamation has been an important approach to achieve sustainable water resource management wwtp effluents can be reused in direct potable uses after advanced treatment processes conventional direct potable reuse or upstream wwtp effluents present in practically water source for drinking water production de facto direct potable reuse diana et al 2019 dotson et al 2009 in both cases it is needed to minimize impacts of don from bnr system on direct potable reuse for conventional potable reuse efforts can be made to establish improve advanced treatment processes after the bnr process tertiary treatment processes in wwtps to decrease don and its ndma formation potential some potable water reuse treatment processes on nitrogenous organic matter removal can be adopted for example it is reported that nitrogenous organic compounds can be removed by ozonation and biofiltration krasner et al 2012 kristiana et al 2013 phungsai et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 thus ozone and sand granular activated carbon filter may minimize the effluent don and its ndma formation potential in advanced treatment processes for direct potable water reuse for de facto direct potable reuse it is required to carefully consider the low do strategy if a low do strategy replaces the existed aeration operations there may have a great level of don and ndma formation potential in bnr system effluents and the adverse chain effects of wwtps without advanced treatment processes on drinking water 4 conclusions this study investigated the low do effects on effluent don and ndma precursor from bnr systems and combined fticr ms analysis and microbe don co occurrence analysis as well as path analysis to provide a mechanistic insight in the low do effects the main conclusions of this study are as follows the adverse effects of low do conditions on controlling effluent don and ndma formation potential cannot be negligible without significant difference p 0 05 t test in din removal efficiency at do of 4 0 1 0 or 0 3 mgo2 l completed nitrification can be achieved at low do conditions however low do conditions 0 3 and 1 0 mgo2 l caused a significant increase p 0 05 t test in don and ndma precursors controlling effluent proteins amino sugars like don may be of benefit for decreasing ndma formation potential 73 6 positive relationships between ndma precursors and don molecules were attributed to proteins amino sugars like don which was considered as the main contributor for ndma precursors the accumulation of microbe derived don was the important reason for increased trends of don with high reactivity in forming ndma more proteins amino sugars like don molecules produced at low do conditions presenting a low redox potential to be re utilized in microbial oxidation the increased proteins amino sugars like don molecules with a low re utilization rate resulted in high effluent proteins amino sugars like don mechanistically the direct low do effects on microbes were firstly delivered through the linkages among do microbial community diversity don molecular characteristics and ndma formation potential and then affected ndma formation potential there are two sides of low do strategies on nitrogen removal the favorable and adverse effects of low do conditions in bnr systems should be simultaneously considered in further operations in wastewater treatment processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial

16133,in this study a mathematical framework was developed to describe aerobic granulation based on 6 main mechanisms microbial selection selective wasting maximizing transport of substrate into the biofilm selective feeding substrate type and breakage a numerical model was developed using four main components a 1d convection dispersion model to describe the flow dynamics in a reactor a reaction diffusion model describing the essential conversions for granule growth a setting model to track granules during settling and feeding and a population model containing up to 100 000 clusters of granules to model the stochastic behaviour of the granulation process with this approach the model can explain the dynamics of the granulation process observed in practice this includes the presence of a lag phase and a granulation phase selective feeding was identified as an important mechanism that was not yet reported in literature when aerobic granules are grown from activated sludge flocs a lag phase occurs in which not many granules are formed followed by a granulation phase in which granules rapidly appear the ratio of granule forming to non granule forming substrate together with the feast famine ratio determine if the transition from the lag phase to the granulation phase is successful the efficiency of selective wasting and selective feeding both determine the rate of this transition brake up of large granules into smaller well settling particles was shown to be an important source for new granules the granulation process was found to be the combined result from all 6 mechanisms and if conditions for either one are not optimal other mechanisms can to some extent compensate this model provides a theoretical framework to analyse the different relevant mechanisms for aerobic granular sludge formation and can form the basis for a comprehensive model that includes detailed nutrient removal aspects keywords granule formation aerobic granular sludge sensitivity

technology for biological treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater microbial aggregates of aerobic granular sludge are large compared to conventional activated sludge allowing for a more efficient treatment process although the technology was invented more than 20 years ago heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 and the first full scale applications treating sewage started to appear from 2005 under the trade name nereda giesen et al 2013 there is no consensus in literature on the underlying mechanisms for aerobic granulation and the process is influenced by many factors winkler et al 2018 factors often described are hydrodynamic shear liu and tay 2002 tay et al 2001 wu et al 2020 physical selection on settling velocity van dijk et al 2020 mcswain et al 2004 the flow regime during contact of the sludge with influent haaksman et al 2022 lochmatter and holliger 2014 rocktäschel et al 2013 dissolved oxygen concentration mosquera corral et al 2005 feast famine ratio beun et al 2002 cofré et al 2018 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 influent substrate composition layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015a organic loading rate iorhemen and liu 2021 quorum sensing wang et al 2017 and aggregation through eps liu et al 2010 it is unclear which factors matter most and how their interplay is affected by the process conditions applied a framework for biofilm morphology has been proposed picioreanu et al 1998 but this framework only explains granule stability on the micro scale but it cannot explain granulation dynamics on a reactor scale for anaerobic granular sludge such a framework has been developed beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 but this framework is not as such applicable for aerobic granular sludge when a ags reactor is seeded with activated sludge under the right circumstances granular sludge will develop from flocculent sludge in practice this granulation process shows dynamics that are not easily explained the granulation process commonly has a lag phase in which not much change in the granulation grade biomass fraction of the granules seems to happen secondly there is the granulation phase in which granules start to appear in the reactor and the granulation grade increases fig 1 the reason behind the lag phase and the trigger for the sudden start of granulation is unclear we hypothesize that there are six main mechanisms that are of most importance for successful granulation fig 2 microbial selection is important for the formation of granules it has been shown that a stable dense biofilm can be best achieved when the uptake rate of substrates is lower than the transport rate of the substrates into the granules van loosdrecht et al 2002 therefore the process is optimized towards organisms that anaerobically sequester readily biodegradable substrate by converting it into storage polymers and subsequently utilizing these polymers for aerobic growth de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 nicholls and osborn 1979 smolders et al 1994 this effectively separates the substrate uptake and the growth into two processes called feast and famine phosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao are examples of species that can make this split and these organisms are commonly observed in full scale aerobic granular sludge processes ali et al 2019 not all substrates can be sequestered anaerobically into storage polymers for aerobic growth of bacteria in the granules we call these substrates non granule forming substrates n gfs substrates that can lead to growth of aerobic granules e g volatile fatty acids but also readily biodegradable substrates that can be converted anaerobically we call granule forming substrates gfs physical selection is also an important driver for growing aerobic granular sludge beun et al 2002 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 morgenroth et al 1997 qin et al 2004 ags has advantageous settling properties compared to activated sludge flocs heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 in ags reactors flocs will always be present to some extent pronk et al 2015b as not all carbon sources present in sewage can be converted to storage polymers during anaerobic feeding layer et al 2020 therefore it is needed to preferentially remove the flocculent sludge fraction with the excess sludge to give granules a competitive advantage this is achieved by using the differential settling velocity between flocculent and granular sludge van dijk et al 2020 liu et al 2005 this is called the physical selection pressure another well known driver is maximizing transport of substrate into the biofilm higher substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid result in a deeper penetration of the substrate in the biofilm arvin and harremoes 1990 this helps to grow and support a thicker biofilm in ags reactors a higher substrate concentration is achieved by either pulse feeding at the start beun et al 2002 or more practical relevant by plug flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015b this gives a competitive advantage for larger granules larger granules settle faster than smaller granules and flocs and therefore accumulate at the bottom of the settled sludge bed van dijk et al 2020 feeding from the bottom therefore results in a longer contact time with the influent and contact with higher substrate concentrations for the larger granules as a result they will have more opportunity for growth than smaller fraction hence the term selective feeding aerobic granules go through a typical life cycle that has a strong influence on the granulation process and reactor performance when an ags reactor is seeded with activated sludge flocs these flocs will first form proto granules flocs and proto granules share similar bulk settling properties an important difference is that the proto granules already have the granular morphology but are smaller than 200 µm which is considered to be the minimum size for an aggregate to be called an aerobic granule de kreuk et al 2007a proto granules already have been observed in conventional activated sludge processes especially in systems with high anaerobic food to mass ratios unmixed in line fermentation and a high influent soluble cod fraction wei et al 2020 proto granules are embedded in the floc matrix and settle together with the flocculent material biological conversions in proto granules are comparable to conversions in flocs because the small radius of the proto granules allows for full penetration with oxygen simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd thus will be limited to very low do conditions when proto granules grow out into small granules 200 µm these small granules will settle significant faster and independent of the flocculent mass the result is that small granules can experience the benefits regarding sludge selection remain longer in the reactor with selective wasting and receive more influent with bottom feeding when the granules continue to grow the biofilm kinetics become more pronounced and full penetration of oxygen is less likely and snd will increase large granules 1000 µm are more susceptible to breakage de graaff et al 2020 when a granule breaks into smaller pieces some will be spilled and others will become a seed for new granules restarting the granule life cycle thus we hypothesized that breakage of granules is an integral part of the granulation process similar as proposed for anaerobic sludge beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 the aforementioned factors for aerobic granulation are not absolute for example only part of the substrate of domestic wastewater can be taken up anaerobically by the ags directly or after fermentation still it is possible to grow ags on the complex composition of domestic wastewater layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015b the selection pressure applied in full scale reactors will be less effective than in lab reactors because of less favourable h d ratios and other scaling factors apparently the favourable mechanisms can be allowed to be non optimally implemented to a certain extent without harming the granulation process it is however unclear how the different mechanisms influence one another positively or negatively if the process conditions become less favourable analysis of the quantitative interplay between the aforementioned mechanisms in combination with varying process conditions requires a mathematical modelling approach a mature granular bed in practice exists of a collection of granules with sizes up to 5 mm van dijk et al 2020 for the purpose of this study a framework was required in which the lifecycle of granules could be tracked simulated granules should be allowed to have different time variable spatial positions in the reactor and should be exposed to different bulk liquid conditions within a cycle and from one cycle to the next this approach is required to capture the stochastic properties of an ags system several models are available describing the ags process with different emphases baeten et al 2019 models that describe granulation as the development of a characteristic mean granule size ni et al 2010 yang et al 2004 or assume a single granule size to study for example microbial speciation in granules and nutrient removal de kreuk et al 2007b xavier et al 2007 are not suitable for the purpose of this study the same holds for models that assume successful granulation using a fixed granule size distribution to investigate reactor performance dold et al 2019 layer et al 2020 models with a dynamic granule size distribution beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 li and li 2009 often use a population balance model pbm to describe the number of granules in a certain size class and the processes that influence these amounts i e growth and detachment via transitions from or to another size class however the available pbms are only suited for completely mixed reactors not for typical ags reactors with combined spatial and temporal differences between the conditions experienced by aggregates we hypothesized that the process for aerobic granulation can be described by six mechanisms fig 2 with a minimal required description of the biological conversions tracking the development of individual granule clusters in the reactor over time in this study we aimed to understand the underlying principles for aerobic granulation a mathematical model was constructed that describes the full life cycle of aerobic granules we performed a sensitivity analysis on the six mechanisms proposed and we evaluated their individual contribution to the granulation process 2 methodology a model was developed integrating several sub models describing all the proposed mechanisms responsible for the granulation process the main process steps in current full scale ags reactors according to the nereda concept are the feeding phase in which fresh influent is fed to the reactor from the bottom the reaction phase where the wastewater is cleaned by different aeration strategies and finally the settling and decanting phase in which the selective wasting takes place in full scale applications feeding and effluent decanting happens simultaneously giesen et al 2013 pronk et al 2015b 2 1 theoretical background 2 1 1 biomass morphology the morphology of biofilms is dependent on a combination of convection diffusion reaction growth and detachment picioreanu et al 2000a all biomass clusters are assumed to have constant smooth and spherical morphology with a constant density this specific biofilm morphology occurs when substrate uptake is limited by the maximum biomass specific uptake rate and not by transport picioreanu et al 2000b since substrate uptake anaerobic is uncoupled from growth aerobic in full scale ags a smooth spherical biofilm morphology was assumed for all simulations wherever the distinction is made between flocs and granules this is solely based on the sludge particle diameter the smallest particles of 100 µm are referred to as flocs while all larger particles are considered proto granules 2 1 2 microbial ecology the microbial population differs over the radius of the biofilm due to concentration gradients of substrates picioreanu et al 1998 different organisms present in the biofilm are responsible for processes like nitrification denitrification and phosphate removal de kreuk et al 2005 winkler et al 2013 however since the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the different mechanisms on the growth of aerobic granules the biomass clusters are assumed to have constant ecology furthermore biomass formation in wastewater treatment plants is mostly related to cod conversions no nitrogen and phosphorus conversions are considered in the model as they contribute marginally to biomass formation all modelled biomass can store cod anaerobically as storage polymers therefore only the conversions of cod into storage polymers and storage polymers into biomass were simulated to describe granular growth 2 1 3 biological fate of cod types in wastewater the chemical oxygen demand cod present in domestic wastewater can be divided in multiple fractions henze 1992 these fractions can be divided based on the availability for biological conversions layer et al 2019 the soluble and suspended inert cod and inorganic solids are not available for any biological conversion and are thus disregarded in this model both the soluble readily biodegradable cod and the colloid fast hydrolysable cod are available for anaerobic conversion into storage polymers and are thus categorized as gfs the suspended slowly hydrolysable cod is available for biological conversions but not for anaerobic storage and are categorized as n gfs a schematic representation is shown in fig 4 2 2 model description 2 2 1 components four mathematical models were combined to perform a sensitivity analysis on the hypothesized main mechanisms for aerobic granulation see also fig 4 the four model components are described below a more detailed description can be found in the appendix 1 cluster based biomass population model an ags reactor typically contains a dynamic distribution of granule sizes all of different age shape and ecology to capture the probability of granules of similar size to be at the different locations in the reactor at the same time a cluster based approach was used the sludge population was discretized into clusters of aggregates with the same diameter where each simulated cluster represented the same amount of physical biomass in the reactor the amount of biomass represented by a cluster scaled linearly with the surface area of the simulated reactor since the spatial gradients in an ags reactor are mainly 1d i e over the height a convergence analysis showed that a discretization of 1 75 10 2 simulated mass per real mass per reactor area kg kg m 2 yielded a discretization independent solution this resulted in 10 000 clusters at start up in the reference case with only flocs of 100 µm and the population increased to 100 000 upon successful granulation new clusters were formed from n gfs as clusters with a diameter of 100 µm the clusters could be subjected to the following mechanisms growth in the reaction phase the diameter of each cluster of particles grew according to the amount of pha formed during the anaerobic feeding phase this resulted in a different increase in volume for each cluster of granules the increase was based on an apparent yield coefficient including decay and a constant biomass concentration in the granule resulting in a constant vss tss ratio all pha was assumed to be consumed and converted to new biomass without any time dependence in the reaction phase see appendix b breakage the larger aerobic granules become the more likely they will break up into smaller pieces de graaff et al 2020 in the model granule clusters larger than 3 mm have an increasing chance of breaking increasing to 99 for granules larger than 5 mm breakage leads to two clusters with random diameter between 100 µm and the original diameter with a combined biomass equal to the original cluster see appendix b redistribution if a cluster of granules exceeded the maximum amount of represented real biomass it was split into two clusters of granules with same diameter each cluster would represent half of the original biomass wasting biomass discharge from the reactor was performed by the removal of number of complete clusters clusters were selected depending on the wasting method used a mixed sample for mlss control or based on settling velocity for selective wasting 2 bulk liquid solute mass balance the anaerobic feeding in an ags sequencing batch reactor sbr is mainly a 1d process since reactors are fed from the bottom and the process is designed to get an optimal plug flow some axial mixing does occur van dijk et al 2018 therefore the concentration profile of gfs during feeding was described by an 1d convection dispersion model degaleesan and dudukovic 1998 van dijk et al 2018 it was solved with one way coupling to the settling model since during the feeding phase granules will still be settling and partially fluidize the calculated effective voidage is thus dynamic and will hence influence the local fluid velocity 3 biofilm solute mass balance the flux of gfs into a granule depends on the local concentration in the bulk liquid surrounding the granule and the rate of mass transfer which varies over the height of the reactor it is in turn affected by the rate of diffusion in the granules and rate of reaction of gfs to pha furthermore anaerobic storage capacity of pha is limited by a maximum pha content used as a simplification for depletion of glycogen de kreuk et al 2007b the dynamic mass balances of gfs and pha were modelled using a 1d radial reaction diffusion model for each cluster of particles solved fully coupled to the bulk liquid mass balance the combined processes in the bulk liquid phase biofilm phase and the settling model determined the total amount of storage polymer per cluster of granule after the feeding phase 4 settling model the settling velocity of a granule depends on the physical properties of the granule i e size and density and the biomass concentration in the near vicinity of the granule as a result every granule will have a unique settling velocity eventually determining the position in the reactor during feeding to describe this settling behaviour we used the van dijk settling model van dijk et al 2020 and adapted it to describe the settling and fluidization of clusters of granules the model was also adapted to better describe the settling of flocs and proto granules the latter involved a change in the calculation of the expansion index which is now calculated based on the archimedes number 2 2 2 cycle build up a typical nereda cycle was simulated in the model this typical cycle has a duration of 6 h and consists of 60 min of anaerobic feeding and decanting 270 min of reaction time and 30 min for settling and wasting of biomass these typical values could vary in the scenario s fig 3 shows the different processes being modelled in the different phases of the cycle 2 3 size distribution the granule size distribution of the sludge in the nereda reactor used as reference in fig 1 was measured over time to determine the granule size distribution 1 l of sample was poured over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 212 425 630 1000 1400 and 2000 µm a mixed sample of 100 ml was filtered for the determination of the total dry weight the obtained granular biomass of the different sieve fractions and the mixed sample were dried at 105 c until no change in weight was detected anymore then the sieve fractions are grouped together small granules are the sum of 212 425 and 630 µm large granules are the sum of 1000 1400 and 2000 µm and the concentration of proto granules and flocs is obtained by subtracting the sum of all granule fractions from the concentration of the mixed sample 3 results and discussion a sensitivity analysis was done to compare the influence of the major mechanisms on the granulation process the main results for all scenarios are summarized in table 1 and fig 5 3 1 reference case a reference case was defined and the different scenarios in the sensitivity analysis were compared to this reference case the reference case was a full scale reactor with a water depth of 6 m that was seeded with 2 g l 1 of flocs of 100 µm the selection pressure at the start was 3 m h 1 and it was slowly increased whenever the sludge concentration reached 3 0 g l 1 the reactor was fed from the bottom of the reactor with a péclet number of 250 the exchange ratio was 25 and there were no rain weather conditions or other variation to the influent flow or composition the reactor was fed four batches per day containing 500 mg l 1 of cod which was composed of 200 mg l 1 granule forming substrate and 300 mg l 1 non granule forming substrate the feeding time was 60 min feeding and decanting was done simultaneously as is normal for full scale ags installations for analyses the particles in the reactor are classified in three main types the proto granules which are particles in the range of 100 to 200 µm these particles have the granular morphology but settling behaviour is floc like so they are not able to separate from the sludge matrix flocs are mathematically treated similar to the proto granules because they both have the same floc like behaviour in the model a floc is represented by particles of 100 µm and smaller small granules are particles in the range of 200 to 1000 µm these particles larger than 200 µm are aerobic granules according to the definition of ags de kreuk et al 2007a these granules settle better than the proto granule fraction and are small enough to be fully penetrated with substrate acetate and oxygen particles larger than 1000 µm are called large granules these granules settle very quickly and accumulate near the bottom of the reactor during the feeding phase large granules are large enough to only be partially penetrated with substrates the granulation process in the reference case is shown in fig 5 since the reactor is seeded with particles of 100 µm it takes time before the first small granules appear in the reactor all proto granules have the same bulk like settling behaviour so selective wasting has no effect yet this means every particle has the same chance of being wasted until this point the growth of the granules is based on chance the proto granules will not not receive substrate every cycle the substrate load depends on the position in the sludge bed the volumetric exchange ratio and the amount of sequestered substrate by the particles beneath it over the course of multiple cycles the combination of these factors will determine whether a proto granule will receive enough substrate to grow into a small granule before it is spilled after 90 d the first small granules appear and these granules settle faster than the proto granules this gives these granules a competitive advantage the granules will be fed more frequently because they settle towards the bottom of the reactor this can be seen as a race towards the substrate the fastest settling granule will always win the race and can take up a maximum amount of substrate on top of this the fastest settling granule will also be spilled less likely in the selective wasting from the top of the settled sludge bed larger granules therefore have a double benefit they receive more substrate and they are less likely to be spilled this process is also visible in fig 5 small granules dominate the population in the reactor a few weeks after the first small granules appeared in the simulation the first large granules appear after 165 d these granules have better settling properties then the small granules the largest ones having settling velocities well over 100 m h 1 this means the large granules will reach the bottom of the reactor in several minutes and they will be fed every cycle the chance of being spilled through selective wasting is close to zero because the settling velocity of large granules is much larger than the maximum applied selection pressure of 6 m h 1 this is a matter of the winner takes it all the large granules will accumulate most of the granule forming substrate fig 6 essentially leading to the extinction of the proto granules the end of the lag phase is defined as the moment the biomass concentration increases more than 10 above the target concentration of 3 g l 1 this means the maximum selection pressure of 6 m h 1 is reached and due to the increasing amount of granules the biomass concentrations keeps increasing the reference case has a lag phase of 193 d the end of the lag phase marks the start of the granulation phase which ends when the target biomass concentration of 8 g l 1 is reached hereafter the biomass concentration is kept on 8 g l 1 through mixed wasting in the aeration phase the duration of the granulation phase was 58 d see table 1 the granulation process in the reference case is very similar to what is observed in practice fig 1 it shows a similar apparent steady state in the lag phase after which large granules appear in the granulation phase granulation in practice shows a bit more variation due to processes that are not taken into account in the model such as rain weather events load variations and temperature variations but the overall process compares well 3 2 microbial selection the effect of changing feast famine conditions was shown by shortening the anaerobic feeding time thus limiting the anaerobic uptake of granule forming substrate since the batch size and thus the loading rate was kept constant shortening the feeding time resulted in a higher feed flow velocity in the reference case the anaerobic feeding time was 60 min which was reduced to 30 min and 15 min the shorter feeding time has a clear effect on the duration of the lag phase which was 193 d in the reference case and was increased to 290 d in the case with a 15 min feeding phase table 1 the granulation phase was a bit faster when the feeding phase was shortened reducing from 58 to 42 d the final granule size distribution after 365 d was quite similar the difference in the lag phase is a consequence of the higher up flow velocity and the shorter contact time in the scenarios a consequence of the higher up flow velocity is a larger sludge bed expansion leading to less proto granules in contact with the influent the shorter contact time also leads to less uptake of substrate by the particles as a result less proto granules grow towards small granules due to the more even distribution of the residual granule forming substrate left over after the feeding phase in the granulation phase the bed expansion is not an issue anymore because small granules can settle faster than flocs and proto granules so the substrate rich influent is more effectively in contact with the largest granule size fraction the higher up flow velocity causes a distribution of the gfs to be more skewed towards the small granules as a result small granules are converted into larger granules more quickly slightly reducing length of the granulation phase overall the duration of the feast period is especially important in the lag phase which is shortened by a longer feast period at equal daily volumetric loading rates in the granulation period the duration of the feast period is of less importance and might even provide a means to control the granule size distribution 3 3 selective wasting the contribution of selective wasting to the aerobic granulation process was shown by switching from selective wasting to mixed wasting in selective wasting the slowest settling biomass is removed from the top of the sludge bed while faster settling particles remain in the reactor in mixed wasting the biomass concentration is kept constant by wasting both fast and slow settling biomass all particles having the same chance to get wasted the mixed wasting is representative for the situation in a conventional activated sludge process the biomass was wasted to maintain a concentration of 3 g l 1 this mixed wasting did not lead to a significant granular fraction although after 98 d the first small granules appeared in the reactor some large granules were present at the end of the simulation although their contribution was small 0 3 g l 1 and with insufficient effect on the settleability to allow for an increase in mlss this scenario clearly shows the importance of selective wasting because without it significant granulation does not happen it also shows the drive towards granulation from the other mechanisms in the reactor although the granules are not preferentially maintained in the reactor as they are randomly wasted new granules are constantly formed due to spread in anaerobic distribution of gfs this might explain why small granules are observed in many conventional activated sludge systems wei et al 2020 even without selective wasting some growth of granules can happen when the other drivers for granulation are sufficiently present in the reactor however selective wasting is essential to drive the sludge towards full granulation 3 4 concentration gradients to show the positive effect of upwards plug flow feeding on the granule formation in the simulation the plug flow feeding was removed the reactor was changed into an ideally mixed reactor during the feeding period in full scale ags reactor feeding and decanting is done simultaneously which is possible because of the plug flow van dijk et al 2018 when the reactor would be ideally mixed during feeding biomass would wash out resulting in poor effluent quality for a good comparison between the scenarios in the simulation biomass was not allowed to leave the reactor with the effluent the results show a strong shift towards smaller granules compared to the reference case the duration of the lag phase was only slightly longer 205 d compared to 193 d also the duration of granulation phase was very similar the real difference is visible in the granule size distribution at the end of the simulation without the plug flow feeding no large granules appeared in the reactor and the average granule size was 703 µm compared to 1371 µm in the reference case this shift towards smaller granules is caused by several different processes lower substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid limit the diffusion depth of substrate into the granules this results in slower granule growth also all substrate is distributed evenly over all particles where in the reference case the best settling fraction receives most of the substrate pilot scale work with anaerobic pulse feeding of municipal wastewater showed a smaller mean granule size compared to the plug flow of full scale bottom fed reactors rocktäschel et al 2015 because the other mechanisms for granulation are still present microbial selection selective wasting and granule forming substrate the system can still achieve a high granulation grade but only with small granules 3 5 selective feeding the effect of the selective feeding was shown by removing the differences in settling velocity between the different particle sizes during the feeding phase as a result all particles have the same chance to be exposed to substrate regardless of their settling properties while the concentration gradient resulting from the plug flow was kept intact the effect is most noticeable in the duration of the lag phase which takes 275 d compared to 193 d in the reference case the duration of granulation phase is comparable with the reference case but the granulation phase starts without any large granules present in the end the average granule size is slightly smaller than in the reference case this outcome indicates that whether a system transitions from the lag phase to the granulation phase is not only determined by the formation of some small granules that settle faster than proto granules and flocs the ability to exploit the faster settling properties of small granules for the uptake of gfs is key in accelerating the transition from the lag phase to the granulation phase and of the granulation phase itself the selective feeding can thus be seen as a race to the substrate the best settling granules will have the longest exposure to the substrate and will see the highest concentration gradients because the settling properties of granules get better as they get larger selective feeding allows for an increase substrate utilization with an increasing granule size removing selective feeding from the simulation shows as expected a shift towards smaller granules although in the end large granules still appear in the reactor selective feeding is an important driver for granulation which has not been recognized before in literature 3 6 granule forming substrate in the model non granule forming substrate will always lead to the formation of flocs and granule forming substrate can lead to the formation of granules if it is converted into storage polymers especially in the lag phase the ratio between gfs and n gfs will influence the chance of proto granules to grow into small granules when too many flocs are formed compared to the growth of the proto granules the proto granules will get spilled before they grow into small granules and can preferentially be retained in the reactor this is clearly shown in the scenario where the gfs was reduced from 200 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 i e decreased from 40 to 20 of the influent cod under these conditions the lag phase does not finish in the 365 d of simulation although some small granules appear in the reactor the maximum granule size is 736 µm the average granule size is only 110 µm and the simulation clearly shows a shift towards flocs in the lag phase in the model transport and conversion characteristics of gfs were modelled as acetate which is the most abundant granule forming substrate in municipal wastewater treatment gfs is derived from the fatty acids in the influent supplemented with the fatty acids formed by fermentation and hydrolysis of more complex influent cod layer et al 2019 toja ortega et al 2021 the amount of gfs is in this context partly depending on the process conditions fermentation and hydrolysis were not included in the presented modelling framework since for this sensitivity analysis the origin of the gfs is not important the amount of gfs will determine if the wastewater is suitable for ags for future modelling and better design of ags processes these fermentation and hydrolysis processes will need better characterization in order to include them in a reliable manner in aerobic granular sludge simulation platforms 3 7 breakage granules will eventually break into smaller pieces in the model the chance of breaking is coupled to the granule size larger granules have higher chance of breaking the resulting pieces can become a seed for new granules in the simulations the origin of granules floc or breakage was monitored at the start all granules originate from flocs when large granules appear in the reactor an increasing fraction of the biomass originates from broken up granules at the end of the simulation after 365 d almost 20 originates from broken up large granules this process can be seen as a bypass of the lag phase some pieces will be larger than proto granules and can develop into new granules without going through the stochastic growth process of the proto granules in this work the probability of breakage was increased with increasing granule size based on a decreasing granule strength as was reported by de graaff et al 2020 the granule size beyond which a granule would have a definite probability to break up was based on the maximum granule size observed in full scale nereda van dijk et al 2020 granules can break up in two parts of random volume adding up to the volume of the original granule in practice breakage into multiple parts as well as attrition will occur beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 reality is clearly more complicated than the implementation used for the sensitivity analysis in this study however all implementations would have the same qualitative effect as was observed in this study determining the maximum granule size and generate nuclei of varying size for granulation to continue for a part the breakage of large granules will be a driver for the acceleration of the granulation process in the granulation phase breakage of granules has a similar effect as adding an external seed of granules to a reactor pijuan et al 2011 both act as a source of new granules bypassing the slow stochastic process of growing small granules out of flocs and proto granules so during start up of ags systems in practice a granular seed could speed up start up times significantly 3 8 model validity various mathematical models have been developed to describe biofilm growth wanner and reichert 1996 and biochemical conversions in partially aerobic reactors for wastewater treatment henze et al 1999 for the sensitivity analysis presented here we opted to implement only conversions required to capture the basic dynamics a mechanism has on distribution of biomass over the size classes of granules the model was intended for systems with an anaerobic feast phase and an aerobic famine phase only heterotrophic growth was assumed with a constant vss tss ratio using two substrates n gfs and gfs and an apparent yield for growth modelling decay and growth combined consequently the active biomass density was constant homogeneous over the radius of a granule and independent of the historical substrate loading rate of a cluster this history could also not impact the storage capacity of pha regardless of these simplifications the model was able to describe the principle behaviour of the granulation process consisting of a lag phase and a granulation phase without focus on mimicking actual reactor performance in the future the model could be extended to incorporate biological nutrient removal to investigate the effects of the mechanisms on reactor performance 3 9 further analysis the sensitivity analysis performed in this study shows how delicate the start up is of a ags reactor from flocs the lag phase that is seen in practice can be explained by the slow stochastic process of turning flocs into proto granules and proto granules into small granules selective wasting is an important mechanism for granulation but in the lag phase because of the entrapment of proto granules in the sludge flocs it has a limited effect granules are only selectively retained in the reactor when they settle faster than the flocculent sludge fraction so the selective wasting only starts to be effective when small granules appear in the reactor the lag phase seems to be mainly driven by the presence of granule forming substrate and the ratio between proto granule growth and production of new flocs the latter is important for the retention time distribution of the proto granules both flocs and proto granules will have a different age the distribution of age needs to allow for small granules to be formed so the maximum retention time in distribution determines if and how fast small granules are formed in the granulation phase the other mechanisms become more important for the granulation process large granules will not be spilled through the selective wasting and will only disappear from the reactor through breakage the largest granules receive the highest amount of substrate because of the selective feeding their substrate uptake capacity combined with their abundance is large enough to take up all the substrate as a consequence only a limited amount of granule forming substrate is available for the flocs and proto granules in a mature granular bed the large granules will filter out all substrate from the influent at the bottom of the reactor it is a matter of the winner takes it all as can be seen in fig 7 where we used a lorenz curve to visualize this process in economics the lorenz curve lorenz 1905 is used to visualize the inequality of the wealth distribution we used it to visualize the inequality in the substrate sequestered by the granules the accompanying gini coefficients gini 1912 are also shown in the plot the cumulative amount of substrate taken up by the granules was plotted versus the cumulative amount of granules the diagonal line would represents a completely even distribution of the substrate over all granules the lorenz curve at 3 different days is plotted at the start of the simulation there is some inequality but this is caused by the batch size that is smaller than the bed height at the end of the lag phase there is already a large inequality with a gini coefficient increasing from 0 354 to 0 952 indicating a large change in substrate distribution so at the end of the lag phase already a large part of the substrate is sequestered by a small part of the granules at the end of the granulation phase the inequality is even larger with a gini coefficient of 0 998 indicating that only a small fraction of granules sequester almost all the substrate clearly showing the effect of the selective feeding 3 10 practical implications growing granules from activated sludge flocs in a full scale reactor can be a lengthy process as shown in fig 1 the model shows that a lag phase is a natural part of the granulation process in practice reactors are often seeded with ags from other plants to shorten the lag phase seeding is a method to break out of the stochastic processes that dominate the length of the lag phase besides providing insights on the granulation process the model can help to optimize the start up process and find an optimum between cost for seeding and length of the start up process the model can also be used to optimize the start up strategy regarding selective wasting applied batch size and cycle times when in the future the model is extended with a more elaborate biological model it can also be used to investigate the effect of granule size distribution on conversion rates and effluent quality 4 conclusion a model was developed to provide a theoretical framework to analyse the different relevant mechanisms for aerobic granular sludge formation which can form the basis for a comprehensive model that includes detailed nutrient removal aspects the insights from this study can be used to further improve the granule formation in ags reactors the model describes the dynamics of a lag and a granulation phase found in practice selective feeding and breakage of large granules were identified as important mechanisms not reported in literature granulation is a combined result from 6 mechanisms allowing a sub optimal mechanism to be compensated by the other mechanisms the gfs n gfs ratio and feast famine ratio are the most important mechanisms in determining whether a system can transition from the lag phase to the granulation phase selective wasting and selective feeding mainly determine whether the transition from lag to the granulation phase will occur and at which rate breaking of granules can have a positive effect on granulation similar to seeding of reactors with granules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

surrounded by lots of small granules or flocs d avg i will approach the size of the flocs in this case leading to a very low value of ε e j for the large granule the resulting low value of d avg i d j makes the large granules stop settling all together to cope with these rare cases the value of ε e j is set to ε l when ε e j ε l 0 1 in the original model the ratio between the fluidizing velocity and the terminal velocity was found to be 0 5 after calibration with a single fraction between 1 0 and 2 0 mm in this study we found that a value of 0 8 would give a better estimate for the smallest size fraction 100 and 200 µm and still agree with the original data a similar correction was made for the calculation of the expansion index in the current model this was calculated based on the

aerobic reaction phase processes taking place during the reaction phase were not modelled with time dependence nor with a spatial dependence but as a sequence of events first the residual gfs that was not stored anaerobically was distributed over all existing clusters based on specific biofilm surface area next the diameter of all clusters was increased due to growth based on an apparent yield i e including loss from decay all n gfs fed during the anaerobic phase was subsequently converted into new flocs the final step was breakage of particles this is different from the time dependent approach often used in single biofilm modelling wanner and reichert 1996 but the simplification was justified due to the requirement of a discrete cluster based approach mixed wasting of sludge was applied for mlss control at the end of the aeration phase appendix c model solution model equations for the sludge movement were computed using an explicit forward euler approach anaerobic feeding phase and settling phase solute mass balances in the bulk liquid and biofilm phases were discretized using finite differencing with an implicit crank nicholson scheme central difference in space average in time the source term representing biological conversion in the biofilm mass balance was discretized using an explicit forward euler approach the mass balances in both liquid and biofilm phases were solved anaerobic feeding phase fully coupled using lu decomposition followed by forward and back substitution as outlined by koester et al 1993 operations on the sludge cluster population were performed during the reaction phase the end of each phase appendix d calculation of lorenz curve and gini coefficient for substrate distribution a well known method of analysing the inequality is the gini coefficient gini 1912 this gini coefficient quantifies the inequality using the lorenz curve which plots the cumulative fraction of the total income y axis earned by a population fraction sorted x axis lorenz 1905 the gini coefficient is determined by the ratio of the area between the equality line and the lorenz curve and the area between the lorenz curve to utilize the gini coefficient for the quantitative analysis of the distribution of gfs in the feeding phase the amount of gfs accumulated as storage polymers by each cluster was calculated weighted by the number of granules g

16133,in this study a mathematical framework was developed to describe aerobic granulation based on 6 main mechanisms microbial selection selective wasting maximizing transport of substrate into the biofilm selective feeding substrate type and breakage a numerical model was developed using four main components a 1d convection dispersion model to describe the flow dynamics in a reactor a reaction diffusion model describing the essential conversions for granule growth a setting model to track granules during settling and feeding and a population model containing up to 100 000 clusters of granules to model the stochastic behaviour of the granulation process with this approach the model can explain the dynamics of the granulation process observed in practice this includes the presence of a lag phase and a granulation phase selective feeding was identified as an important mechanism that was not yet reported in literature when aerobic granules are grown from activated sludge flocs a lag phase occurs in which not many granules are formed followed by a granulation phase in which granules rapidly appear the ratio of granule forming to non granule forming substrate together with the feast famine ratio determine if the transition from the lag phase to the granulation phase is successful the efficiency of selective wasting and selective feeding both determine the rate of this transition brake up of large granules into smaller well settling particles was shown to be an important source for new granules the granulation process was found to be the combined result from all 6 mechanisms and if conditions for either one are not optimal other mechanisms can to some extent compensate this model provides a theoretical framework to analyse the different relevant mechanisms for aerobic granular sludge formation and can form the basis for a comprehensive model that includes detailed nutrient removal aspects keywords granule formation aerobic granular sludge sensitivity

technology for biological treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater microbial aggregates of aerobic granular sludge are large compared to conventional activated sludge allowing for a more efficient treatment process although the technology was invented more than 20 years ago heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 and the first full scale applications treating sewage started to appear from 2005 under the trade name nereda giesen et al 2013 there is no consensus in literature on the underlying mechanisms for aerobic granulation and the process is influenced by many factors winkler et al 2018 factors often described are hydrodynamic shear liu and tay 2002 tay et al 2001 wu et al 2020 physical selection on settling velocity van dijk et al 2020 mcswain et al 2004 the flow regime during contact of the sludge with influent haaksman et al 2022 lochmatter and holliger 2014 rocktäschel et al 2013 dissolved oxygen concentration mosquera corral et al 2005 feast famine ratio beun et al 2002 cofré et al 2018 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 influent substrate composition layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015a organic loading rate iorhemen and liu 2021 quorum sensing wang et al 2017 and aggregation through eps liu et al 2010 it is unclear which factors matter most and how their interplay is affected by the process conditions applied a framework for biofilm morphology has been proposed picioreanu et al 1998 but this framework only explains granule stability on the micro scale but it cannot explain granulation dynamics on a reactor scale for anaerobic granular sludge such a framework has been developed beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 but this framework is not as such applicable for aerobic granular sludge when a ags reactor is seeded with activated sludge under the right circumstances granular sludge will develop from flocculent sludge in practice this granulation process shows dynamics that are not easily explained the granulation process commonly has a lag phase in which not much change in the granulation grade biomass fraction of the granules seems to happen secondly there is the granulation phase in which granules start to appear in the reactor and the granulation grade increases fig 1 the reason behind the lag phase and the trigger for the sudden start of granulation is unclear we hypothesize that there are six main mechanisms that are of most importance for successful granulation fig 2 microbial selection is important for the formation of granules it has been shown that a stable dense biofilm can be best achieved when the uptake rate of substrates is lower than the transport rate of the substrates into the granules van loosdrecht et al 2002 therefore the process is optimized towards organisms that anaerobically sequester readily biodegradable substrate by converting it into storage polymers and subsequently utilizing these polymers for aerobic growth de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 nicholls and osborn 1979 smolders et al 1994 this effectively separates the substrate uptake and the growth into two processes called feast and famine phosphate accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao are examples of species that can make this split and these organisms are commonly observed in full scale aerobic granular sludge processes ali et al 2019 not all substrates can be sequestered anaerobically into storage polymers for aerobic growth of bacteria in the granules we call these substrates non granule forming substrates n gfs substrates that can lead to growth of aerobic granules e g volatile fatty acids but also readily biodegradable substrates that can be converted anaerobically we call granule forming substrates gfs physical selection is also an important driver for growing aerobic granular sludge beun et al 2002 de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 morgenroth et al 1997 qin et al 2004 ags has advantageous settling properties compared to activated sludge flocs heijnen and van loosdrecht 1998 morgenroth et al 1997 in ags reactors flocs will always be present to some extent pronk et al 2015b as not all carbon sources present in sewage can be converted to storage polymers during anaerobic feeding layer et al 2020 therefore it is needed to preferentially remove the flocculent sludge fraction with the excess sludge to give granules a competitive advantage this is achieved by using the differential settling velocity between flocculent and granular sludge van dijk et al 2020 liu et al 2005 this is called the physical selection pressure another well known driver is maximizing transport of substrate into the biofilm higher substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid result in a deeper penetration of the substrate in the biofilm arvin and harremoes 1990 this helps to grow and support a thicker biofilm in ags reactors a higher substrate concentration is achieved by either pulse feeding at the start beun et al 2002 or more practical relevant by plug flow feeding from the bottom of the reactor de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 pronk et al 2015b this gives a competitive advantage for larger granules larger granules settle faster than smaller granules and flocs and therefore accumulate at the bottom of the settled sludge bed van dijk et al 2020 feeding from the bottom therefore results in a longer contact time with the influent and contact with higher substrate concentrations for the larger granules as a result they will have more opportunity for growth than smaller fraction hence the term selective feeding aerobic granules go through a typical life cycle that has a strong influence on the granulation process and reactor performance when an ags reactor is seeded with activated sludge flocs these flocs will first form proto granules flocs and proto granules share similar bulk settling properties an important difference is that the proto granules already have the granular morphology but are smaller than 200 µm which is considered to be the minimum size for an aggregate to be called an aerobic granule de kreuk et al 2007a proto granules already have been observed in conventional activated sludge processes especially in systems with high anaerobic food to mass ratios unmixed in line fermentation and a high influent soluble cod fraction wei et al 2020 proto granules are embedded in the floc matrix and settle together with the flocculent material biological conversions in proto granules are comparable to conversions in flocs because the small radius of the proto granules allows for full penetration with oxygen simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd thus will be limited to very low do conditions when proto granules grow out into small granules 200 µm these small granules will settle significant faster and independent of the flocculent mass the result is that small granules can experience the benefits regarding sludge selection remain longer in the reactor with selective wasting and receive more influent with bottom feeding when the granules continue to grow the biofilm kinetics become more pronounced and full penetration of oxygen is less likely and snd will increase large granules 1000 µm are more susceptible to breakage de graaff et al 2020 when a granule breaks into smaller pieces some will be spilled and others will become a seed for new granules restarting the granule life cycle thus we hypothesized that breakage of granules is an integral part of the granulation process similar as proposed for anaerobic sludge beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 the aforementioned factors for aerobic granulation are not absolute for example only part of the substrate of domestic wastewater can be taken up anaerobically by the ags directly or after fermentation still it is possible to grow ags on the complex composition of domestic wastewater layer et al 2019 pronk et al 2015b the selection pressure applied in full scale reactors will be less effective than in lab reactors because of less favourable h d ratios and other scaling factors apparently the favourable mechanisms can be allowed to be non optimally implemented to a certain extent without harming the granulation process it is however unclear how the different mechanisms influence one another positively or negatively if the process conditions become less favourable analysis of the quantitative interplay between the aforementioned mechanisms in combination with varying process conditions requires a mathematical modelling approach a mature granular bed in practice exists of a collection of granules with sizes up to 5 mm van dijk et al 2020 for the purpose of this study a framework was required in which the lifecycle of granules could be tracked simulated granules should be allowed to have different time variable spatial positions in the reactor and should be exposed to different bulk liquid conditions within a cycle and from one cycle to the next this approach is required to capture the stochastic properties of an ags system several models are available describing the ags process with different emphases baeten et al 2019 models that describe granulation as the development of a characteristic mean granule size ni et al 2010 yang et al 2004 or assume a single granule size to study for example microbial speciation in granules and nutrient removal de kreuk et al 2007b xavier et al 2007 are not suitable for the purpose of this study the same holds for models that assume successful granulation using a fixed granule size distribution to investigate reactor performance dold et al 2019 layer et al 2020 models with a dynamic granule size distribution beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 li and li 2009 often use a population balance model pbm to describe the number of granules in a certain size class and the processes that influence these amounts i e growth and detachment via transitions from or to another size class however the available pbms are only suited for completely mixed reactors not for typical ags reactors with combined spatial and temporal differences between the conditions experienced by aggregates we hypothesized that the process for aerobic granulation can be described by six mechanisms fig 2 with a minimal required description of the biological conversions tracking the development of individual granule clusters in the reactor over time in this study we aimed to understand the underlying principles for aerobic granulation a mathematical model was constructed that describes the full life cycle of aerobic granules we performed a sensitivity analysis on the six mechanisms proposed and we evaluated their individual contribution to the granulation process 2 methodology a model was developed integrating several sub models describing all the proposed mechanisms responsible for the granulation process the main process steps in current full scale ags reactors according to the nereda concept are the feeding phase in which fresh influent is fed to the reactor from the bottom the reaction phase where the wastewater is cleaned by different aeration strategies and finally the settling and decanting phase in which the selective wasting takes place in full scale applications feeding and effluent decanting happens simultaneously giesen et al 2013 pronk et al 2015b 2 1 theoretical background 2 1 1 biomass morphology the morphology of biofilms is dependent on a combination of convection diffusion reaction growth and detachment picioreanu et al 2000a all biomass clusters are assumed to have constant smooth and spherical morphology with a constant density this specific biofilm morphology occurs when substrate uptake is limited by the maximum biomass specific uptake rate and not by transport picioreanu et al 2000b since substrate uptake anaerobic is uncoupled from growth aerobic in full scale ags a smooth spherical biofilm morphology was assumed for all simulations wherever the distinction is made between flocs and granules this is solely based on the sludge particle diameter the smallest particles of 100 µm are referred to as flocs while all larger particles are considered proto granules 2 1 2 microbial ecology the microbial population differs over the radius of the biofilm due to concentration gradients of substrates picioreanu et al 1998 different organisms present in the biofilm are responsible for processes like nitrification denitrification and phosphate removal de kreuk et al 2005 winkler et al 2013 however since the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the different mechanisms on the growth of aerobic granules the biomass clusters are assumed to have constant ecology furthermore biomass formation in wastewater treatment plants is mostly related to cod conversions no nitrogen and phosphorus conversions are considered in the model as they contribute marginally to biomass formation all modelled biomass can store cod anaerobically as storage polymers therefore only the conversions of cod into storage polymers and storage polymers into biomass were simulated to describe granular growth 2 1 3 biological fate of cod types in wastewater the chemical oxygen demand cod present in domestic wastewater can be divided in multiple fractions henze 1992 these fractions can be divided based on the availability for biological conversions layer et al 2019 the soluble and suspended inert cod and inorganic solids are not available for any biological conversion and are thus disregarded in this model both the soluble readily biodegradable cod and the colloid fast hydrolysable cod are available for anaerobic conversion into storage polymers and are thus categorized as gfs the suspended slowly hydrolysable cod is available for biological conversions but not for anaerobic storage and are categorized as n gfs a schematic representation is shown in fig 4 2 2 model description 2 2 1 components four mathematical models were combined to perform a sensitivity analysis on the hypothesized main mechanisms for aerobic granulation see also fig 4 the four model components are described below a more detailed description can be found in the appendix 1 cluster based biomass population model an ags reactor typically contains a dynamic distribution of granule sizes all of different age shape and ecology to capture the probability of granules of similar size to be at the different locations in the reactor at the same time a cluster based approach was used the sludge population was discretized into clusters of aggregates with the same diameter where each simulated cluster represented the same amount of physical biomass in the reactor the amount of biomass represented by a cluster scaled linearly with the surface area of the simulated reactor since the spatial gradients in an ags reactor are mainly 1d i e over the height a convergence analysis showed that a discretization of 1 75 10 2 simulated mass per real mass per reactor area kg kg m 2 yielded a discretization independent solution this resulted in 10 000 clusters at start up in the reference case with only flocs of 100 µm and the population increased to 100 000 upon successful granulation new clusters were formed from n gfs as clusters with a diameter of 100 µm the clusters could be subjected to the following mechanisms growth in the reaction phase the diameter of each cluster of particles grew according to the amount of pha formed during the anaerobic feeding phase this resulted in a different increase in volume for each cluster of granules the increase was based on an apparent yield coefficient including decay and a constant biomass concentration in the granule resulting in a constant vss tss ratio all pha was assumed to be consumed and converted to new biomass without any time dependence in the reaction phase see appendix b breakage the larger aerobic granules become the more likely they will break up into smaller pieces de graaff et al 2020 in the model granule clusters larger than 3 mm have an increasing chance of breaking increasing to 99 for granules larger than 5 mm breakage leads to two clusters with random diameter between 100 µm and the original diameter with a combined biomass equal to the original cluster see appendix b redistribution if a cluster of granules exceeded the maximum amount of represented real biomass it was split into two clusters of granules with same diameter each cluster would represent half of the original biomass wasting biomass discharge from the reactor was performed by the removal of number of complete clusters clusters were selected depending on the wasting method used a mixed sample for mlss control or based on settling velocity for selective wasting 2 bulk liquid solute mass balance the anaerobic feeding in an ags sequencing batch reactor sbr is mainly a 1d process since reactors are fed from the bottom and the process is designed to get an optimal plug flow some axial mixing does occur van dijk et al 2018 therefore the concentration profile of gfs during feeding was described by an 1d convection dispersion model degaleesan and dudukovic 1998 van dijk et al 2018 it was solved with one way coupling to the settling model since during the feeding phase granules will still be settling and partially fluidize the calculated effective voidage is thus dynamic and will hence influence the local fluid velocity 3 biofilm solute mass balance the flux of gfs into a granule depends on the local concentration in the bulk liquid surrounding the granule and the rate of mass transfer which varies over the height of the reactor it is in turn affected by the rate of diffusion in the granules and rate of reaction of gfs to pha furthermore anaerobic storage capacity of pha is limited by a maximum pha content used as a simplification for depletion of glycogen de kreuk et al 2007b the dynamic mass balances of gfs and pha were modelled using a 1d radial reaction diffusion model for each cluster of particles solved fully coupled to the bulk liquid mass balance the combined processes in the bulk liquid phase biofilm phase and the settling model determined the total amount of storage polymer per cluster of granule after the feeding phase 4 settling model the settling velocity of a granule depends on the physical properties of the granule i e size and density and the biomass concentration in the near vicinity of the granule as a result every granule will have a unique settling velocity eventually determining the position in the reactor during feeding to describe this settling behaviour we used the van dijk settling model van dijk et al 2020 and adapted it to describe the settling and fluidization of clusters of granules the model was also adapted to better describe the settling of flocs and proto granules the latter involved a change in the calculation of the expansion index which is now calculated based on the archimedes number 2 2 2 cycle build up a typical nereda cycle was simulated in the model this typical cycle has a duration of 6 h and consists of 60 min of anaerobic feeding and decanting 270 min of reaction time and 30 min for settling and wasting of biomass these typical values could vary in the scenario s fig 3 shows the different processes being modelled in the different phases of the cycle 2 3 size distribution the granule size distribution of the sludge in the nereda reactor used as reference in fig 1 was measured over time to determine the granule size distribution 1 l of sample was poured over a series of sieves with different mesh sizes 212 425 630 1000 1400 and 2000 µm a mixed sample of 100 ml was filtered for the determination of the total dry weight the obtained granular biomass of the different sieve fractions and the mixed sample were dried at 105 c until no change in weight was detected anymore then the sieve fractions are grouped together small granules are the sum of 212 425 and 630 µm large granules are the sum of 1000 1400 and 2000 µm and the concentration of proto granules and flocs is obtained by subtracting the sum of all granule fractions from the concentration of the mixed sample 3 results and discussion a sensitivity analysis was done to compare the influence of the major mechanisms on the granulation process the main results for all scenarios are summarized in table 1 and fig 5 3 1 reference case a reference case was defined and the different scenarios in the sensitivity analysis were compared to this reference case the reference case was a full scale reactor with a water depth of 6 m that was seeded with 2 g l 1 of flocs of 100 µm the selection pressure at the start was 3 m h 1 and it was slowly increased whenever the sludge concentration reached 3 0 g l 1 the reactor was fed from the bottom of the reactor with a péclet number of 250 the exchange ratio was 25 and there were no rain weather conditions or other variation to the influent flow or composition the reactor was fed four batches per day containing 500 mg l 1 of cod which was composed of 200 mg l 1 granule forming substrate and 300 mg l 1 non granule forming substrate the feeding time was 60 min feeding and decanting was done simultaneously as is normal for full scale ags installations for analyses the particles in the reactor are classified in three main types the proto granules which are particles in the range of 100 to 200 µm these particles have the granular morphology but settling behaviour is floc like so they are not able to separate from the sludge matrix flocs are mathematically treated similar to the proto granules because they both have the same floc like behaviour in the model a floc is represented by particles of 100 µm and smaller small granules are particles in the range of 200 to 1000 µm these particles larger than 200 µm are aerobic granules according to the definition of ags de kreuk et al 2007a these granules settle better than the proto granule fraction and are small enough to be fully penetrated with substrate acetate and oxygen particles larger than 1000 µm are called large granules these granules settle very quickly and accumulate near the bottom of the reactor during the feeding phase large granules are large enough to only be partially penetrated with substrates the granulation process in the reference case is shown in fig 5 since the reactor is seeded with particles of 100 µm it takes time before the first small granules appear in the reactor all proto granules have the same bulk like settling behaviour so selective wasting has no effect yet this means every particle has the same chance of being wasted until this point the growth of the granules is based on chance the proto granules will not not receive substrate every cycle the substrate load depends on the position in the sludge bed the volumetric exchange ratio and the amount of sequestered substrate by the particles beneath it over the course of multiple cycles the combination of these factors will determine whether a proto granule will receive enough substrate to grow into a small granule before it is spilled after 90 d the first small granules appear and these granules settle faster than the proto granules this gives these granules a competitive advantage the granules will be fed more frequently because they settle towards the bottom of the reactor this can be seen as a race towards the substrate the fastest settling granule will always win the race and can take up a maximum amount of substrate on top of this the fastest settling granule will also be spilled less likely in the selective wasting from the top of the settled sludge bed larger granules therefore have a double benefit they receive more substrate and they are less likely to be spilled this process is also visible in fig 5 small granules dominate the population in the reactor a few weeks after the first small granules appeared in the simulation the first large granules appear after 165 d these granules have better settling properties then the small granules the largest ones having settling velocities well over 100 m h 1 this means the large granules will reach the bottom of the reactor in several minutes and they will be fed every cycle the chance of being spilled through selective wasting is close to zero because the settling velocity of large granules is much larger than the maximum applied selection pressure of 6 m h 1 this is a matter of the winner takes it all the large granules will accumulate most of the granule forming substrate fig 6 essentially leading to the extinction of the proto granules the end of the lag phase is defined as the moment the biomass concentration increases more than 10 above the target concentration of 3 g l 1 this means the maximum selection pressure of 6 m h 1 is reached and due to the increasing amount of granules the biomass concentrations keeps increasing the reference case has a lag phase of 193 d the end of the lag phase marks the start of the granulation phase which ends when the target biomass concentration of 8 g l 1 is reached hereafter the biomass concentration is kept on 8 g l 1 through mixed wasting in the aeration phase the duration of the granulation phase was 58 d see table 1 the granulation process in the reference case is very similar to what is observed in practice fig 1 it shows a similar apparent steady state in the lag phase after which large granules appear in the granulation phase granulation in practice shows a bit more variation due to processes that are not taken into account in the model such as rain weather events load variations and temperature variations but the overall process compares well 3 2 microbial selection the effect of changing feast famine conditions was shown by shortening the anaerobic feeding time thus limiting the anaerobic uptake of granule forming substrate since the batch size and thus the loading rate was kept constant shortening the feeding time resulted in a higher feed flow velocity in the reference case the anaerobic feeding time was 60 min which was reduced to 30 min and 15 min the shorter feeding time has a clear effect on the duration of the lag phase which was 193 d in the reference case and was increased to 290 d in the case with a 15 min feeding phase table 1 the granulation phase was a bit faster when the feeding phase was shortened reducing from 58 to 42 d the final granule size distribution after 365 d was quite similar the difference in the lag phase is a consequence of the higher up flow velocity and the shorter contact time in the scenarios a consequence of the higher up flow velocity is a larger sludge bed expansion leading to less proto granules in contact with the influent the shorter contact time also leads to less uptake of substrate by the particles as a result less proto granules grow towards small granules due to the more even distribution of the residual granule forming substrate left over after the feeding phase in the granulation phase the bed expansion is not an issue anymore because small granules can settle faster than flocs and proto granules so the substrate rich influent is more effectively in contact with the largest granule size fraction the higher up flow velocity causes a distribution of the gfs to be more skewed towards the small granules as a result small granules are converted into larger granules more quickly slightly reducing length of the granulation phase overall the duration of the feast period is especially important in the lag phase which is shortened by a longer feast period at equal daily volumetric loading rates in the granulation period the duration of the feast period is of less importance and might even provide a means to control the granule size distribution 3 3 selective wasting the contribution of selective wasting to the aerobic granulation process was shown by switching from selective wasting to mixed wasting in selective wasting the slowest settling biomass is removed from the top of the sludge bed while faster settling particles remain in the reactor in mixed wasting the biomass concentration is kept constant by wasting both fast and slow settling biomass all particles having the same chance to get wasted the mixed wasting is representative for the situation in a conventional activated sludge process the biomass was wasted to maintain a concentration of 3 g l 1 this mixed wasting did not lead to a significant granular fraction although after 98 d the first small granules appeared in the reactor some large granules were present at the end of the simulation although their contribution was small 0 3 g l 1 and with insufficient effect on the settleability to allow for an increase in mlss this scenario clearly shows the importance of selective wasting because without it significant granulation does not happen it also shows the drive towards granulation from the other mechanisms in the reactor although the granules are not preferentially maintained in the reactor as they are randomly wasted new granules are constantly formed due to spread in anaerobic distribution of gfs this might explain why small granules are observed in many conventional activated sludge systems wei et al 2020 even without selective wasting some growth of granules can happen when the other drivers for granulation are sufficiently present in the reactor however selective wasting is essential to drive the sludge towards full granulation 3 4 concentration gradients to show the positive effect of upwards plug flow feeding on the granule formation in the simulation the plug flow feeding was removed the reactor was changed into an ideally mixed reactor during the feeding period in full scale ags reactor feeding and decanting is done simultaneously which is possible because of the plug flow van dijk et al 2018 when the reactor would be ideally mixed during feeding biomass would wash out resulting in poor effluent quality for a good comparison between the scenarios in the simulation biomass was not allowed to leave the reactor with the effluent the results show a strong shift towards smaller granules compared to the reference case the duration of the lag phase was only slightly longer 205 d compared to 193 d also the duration of granulation phase was very similar the real difference is visible in the granule size distribution at the end of the simulation without the plug flow feeding no large granules appeared in the reactor and the average granule size was 703 µm compared to 1371 µm in the reference case this shift towards smaller granules is caused by several different processes lower substrate concentrations in the bulk liquid limit the diffusion depth of substrate into the granules this results in slower granule growth also all substrate is distributed evenly over all particles where in the reference case the best settling fraction receives most of the substrate pilot scale work with anaerobic pulse feeding of municipal wastewater showed a smaller mean granule size compared to the plug flow of full scale bottom fed reactors rocktäschel et al 2015 because the other mechanisms for granulation are still present microbial selection selective wasting and granule forming substrate the system can still achieve a high granulation grade but only with small granules 3 5 selective feeding the effect of the selective feeding was shown by removing the differences in settling velocity between the different particle sizes during the feeding phase as a result all particles have the same chance to be exposed to substrate regardless of their settling properties while the concentration gradient resulting from the plug flow was kept intact the effect is most noticeable in the duration of the lag phase which takes 275 d compared to 193 d in the reference case the duration of granulation phase is comparable with the reference case but the granulation phase starts without any large granules present in the end the average granule size is slightly smaller than in the reference case this outcome indicates that whether a system transitions from the lag phase to the granulation phase is not only determined by the formation of some small granules that settle faster than proto granules and flocs the ability to exploit the faster settling properties of small granules for the uptake of gfs is key in accelerating the transition from the lag phase to the granulation phase and of the granulation phase itself the selective feeding can thus be seen as a race to the substrate the best settling granules will have the longest exposure to the substrate and will see the highest concentration gradients because the settling properties of granules get better as they get larger selective feeding allows for an increase substrate utilization with an increasing granule size removing selective feeding from the simulation shows as expected a shift towards smaller granules although in the end large granules still appear in the reactor selective feeding is an important driver for granulation which has not been recognized before in literature 3 6 granule forming substrate in the model non granule forming substrate will always lead to the formation of flocs and granule forming substrate can lead to the formation of granules if it is converted into storage polymers especially in the lag phase the ratio between gfs and n gfs will influence the chance of proto granules to grow into small granules when too many flocs are formed compared to the growth of the proto granules the proto granules will get spilled before they grow into small granules and can preferentially be retained in the reactor this is clearly shown in the scenario where the gfs was reduced from 200 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 i e decreased from 40 to 20 of the influent cod under these conditions the lag phase does not finish in the 365 d of simulation although some small granules appear in the reactor the maximum granule size is 736 µm the average granule size is only 110 µm and the simulation clearly shows a shift towards flocs in the lag phase in the model transport and conversion characteristics of gfs were modelled as acetate which is the most abundant granule forming substrate in municipal wastewater treatment gfs is derived from the fatty acids in the influent supplemented with the fatty acids formed by fermentation and hydrolysis of more complex influent cod layer et al 2019 toja ortega et al 2021 the amount of gfs is in this context partly depending on the process conditions fermentation and hydrolysis were not included in the presented modelling framework since for this sensitivity analysis the origin of the gfs is not important the amount of gfs will determine if the wastewater is suitable for ags for future modelling and better design of ags processes these fermentation and hydrolysis processes will need better characterization in order to include them in a reliable manner in aerobic granular sludge simulation platforms 3 7 breakage granules will eventually break into smaller pieces in the model the chance of breaking is coupled to the granule size larger granules have higher chance of breaking the resulting pieces can become a seed for new granules in the simulations the origin of granules floc or breakage was monitored at the start all granules originate from flocs when large granules appear in the reactor an increasing fraction of the biomass originates from broken up granules at the end of the simulation after 365 d almost 20 originates from broken up large granules this process can be seen as a bypass of the lag phase some pieces will be larger than proto granules and can develop into new granules without going through the stochastic growth process of the proto granules in this work the probability of breakage was increased with increasing granule size based on a decreasing granule strength as was reported by de graaff et al 2020 the granule size beyond which a granule would have a definite probability to break up was based on the maximum granule size observed in full scale nereda van dijk et al 2020 granules can break up in two parts of random volume adding up to the volume of the original granule in practice breakage into multiple parts as well as attrition will occur beeftink and van den heuvel 1990 reality is clearly more complicated than the implementation used for the sensitivity analysis in this study however all implementations would have the same qualitative effect as was observed in this study determining the maximum granule size and generate nuclei of varying size for granulation to continue for a part the breakage of large granules will be a driver for the acceleration of the granulation process in the granulation phase breakage of granules has a similar effect as adding an external seed of granules to a reactor pijuan et al 2011 both act as a source of new granules bypassing the slow stochastic process of growing small granules out of flocs and proto granules so during start up of ags systems in practice a granular seed could speed up start up times significantly 3 8 model validity various mathematical models have been developed to describe biofilm growth wanner and reichert 1996 and biochemical conversions in partially aerobic reactors for wastewater treatment henze et al 1999 for the sensitivity analysis presented here we opted to implement only conversions required to capture the basic dynamics a mechanism has on distribution of biomass over the size classes of granules the model was intended for systems with an anaerobic feast phase and an aerobic famine phase only heterotrophic growth was assumed with a constant vss tss ratio using two substrates n gfs and gfs and an apparent yield for growth modelling decay and growth combined consequently the active biomass density was constant homogeneous over the radius of a granule and independent of the historical substrate loading rate of a cluster this history could also not impact the storage capacity of pha regardless of these simplifications the model was able to describe the principle behaviour of the granulation process consisting of a lag phase and a granulation phase without focus on mimicking actual reactor performance in the future the model could be extended to incorporate biological nutrient removal to investigate the effects of the mechanisms on reactor performance 3 9 further analysis the sensitivity analysis performed in this study shows how delicate the start up is of a ags reactor from flocs the lag phase that is seen in practice can be explained by the slow stochastic process of turning flocs into proto granules and proto granules into small granules selective wasting is an important mechanism for granulation but in the lag phase because of the entrapment of proto granules in the sludge flocs it has a limited effect granules are only selectively retained in the reactor when they settle faster than the flocculent sludge fraction so the selective wasting only starts to be effective when small granules appear in the reactor the lag phase seems to be mainly driven by the presence of granule forming substrate and the ratio between proto granule growth and production of new flocs the latter is important for the retention time distribution of the proto granules both flocs and proto granules will have a different age the distribution of age needs to allow for small granules to be formed so the maximum retention time in distribution determines if and how fast small granules are formed in the granulation phase the other mechanisms become more important for the granulation process large granules will not be spilled through the selective wasting and will only disappear from the reactor through breakage the largest granules receive the highest amount of substrate because of the selective feeding their substrate uptake capacity combined with their abundance is large enough to take up all the substrate as a consequence only a limited amount of granule forming substrate is available for the flocs and proto granules in a mature granular bed the large granules will filter out all substrate from the influent at the bottom of the reactor it is a matter of the winner takes it all as can be seen in fig 7 where we used a lorenz curve to visualize this process in economics the lorenz curve lorenz 1905 is used to visualize the inequality of the wealth distribution we used it to visualize the inequality in the substrate sequestered by the granules the accompanying gini coefficients gini 1912 are also shown in the plot the cumulative amount of substrate taken up by the granules was plotted versus the cumulative amount of granules the diagonal line would represents a completely even distribution of the substrate over all granules the lorenz curve at 3 different days is plotted at the start of the simulation there is some inequality but this is caused by the batch size that is smaller than the bed height at the end of the lag phase there is already a large inequality with a gini coefficient increasing from 0 354 to 0 952 indicating a large change in substrate distribution so at the end of the lag phase already a large part of the substrate is sequestered by a small part of the granules at the end of the granulation phase the inequality is even larger with a gini coefficient of 0 998 indicating that only a small fraction of granules sequester almost all the substrate clearly showing the effect of the selective feeding 3 10 practical implications growing granules from activated sludge flocs in a full scale reactor can be a lengthy process as shown in fig 1 the model shows that a lag phase is a natural part of the granulation process in practice reactors are often seeded with ags from other plants to shorten the lag phase seeding is a method to break out of the stochastic processes that dominate the length of the lag phase besides providing insights on the granulation process the model can help to optimize the start up process and find an optimum between cost for seeding and length of the start up process the model can also be used to optimize the start up strategy regarding selective wasting applied batch size and cycle times when in the future the model is extended with a more elaborate biological model it can also be used to investigate the effect of granule size distribution on conversion rates and effluent quality 4 conclusion a model was developed to provide a theoretical framework to analyse the different relevant mechanisms for aerobic granular sludge formation which can form the basis for a comprehensive model that includes detailed nutrient removal aspects the insights from this study can be used to further improve the granule formation in ags reactors the model describes the dynamics of a lag and a granulation phase found in practice selective feeding and breakage of large granules were identified as important mechanisms not reported in literature granulation is a combined result from 6 mechanisms allowing a sub optimal mechanism to be compensated by the other mechanisms the gfs n gfs ratio and feast famine ratio are the most important mechanisms in determining whether a system can transition from the lag phase to the granulation phase selective wasting and selective feeding mainly determine whether the transition from lag to the granulation phase will occur and at which rate breaking of granules can have a

individual clusters of granules of the same size j b 10 v j k v f j ε e j n j 2 ρ b j ρ bed i ρ b j ρ l furthermore every cluster of granules instead of classes experienced an apparent voidage

represents the individual granule instead of the granule class b 11 ε e j 1 1 d avg i d j 1 ε l 1 3 1 3 similarly the average granule diameter can be calculated based on groups of similarly sized granules at the same height in the reactor b 12 d avg i j 1 n i c j d j 1 ε l although this approach works well for classes of granules the model outcome is unrealistic when a large granule is surrounded by lots of small granules or flocs d avg i will approach the size of the flocs in this case leading to a very low value of ε e j for the large granule the resulting low value of d avg i d j makes the large granules stop settling all together to cope with these rare cases the value of ε e j is set to ε l when ε e j ε l 0 1 in the original model the ratio between the fluidizing velocity and the terminal velocity was found to be 0 5 after calibration with a single fraction between 1 0 and 2 0 mm in this study we found that a value of 0 8 would give a better estimate for the smallest size fraction 100 and 200 µm and still agree with the original data a similar correction was made for the calculation of the expansion index in the current model this was calculated based on the archimedes number andalib et al 2012 b 13 n j 1 9 143 10 6 ar 0 7728 0 2 the position of a cluster of granules during feeding or settling i e v in 0 was modelled as follows b 14 d x j d t v j v in growth of granules within a cluster during each reaction phase the volume and thus the diameter of a granule cluster was increased according to the amount of gfs accumulated as storage polymers during

aerobic reaction phase processes taking place during the reaction phase were not modelled with time dependence nor with a spatial dependence but as a sequence of events first the residual gfs that was not stored anaerobically was distributed over all existing clusters based on specific biofilm surface area next the diameter of all clusters was increased due to growth based on an apparent yield i e including loss from decay all n gfs fed during the anaerobic phase was subsequently converted into new flocs the final step was breakage of particles this is different from the time dependent approach often used in single biofilm modelling wanner and reichert 1996 but the simplification was justified due to the requirement of a discrete cluster based approach mixed wasting of sludge was applied for mlss control at the end of the aeration phase appendix c model solution model equations for the sludge movement were computed using an explicit forward euler approach anaerobic feeding phase and settling phase solute mass balances in the bulk liquid and biofilm phases were discretized using finite differencing with an implicit crank nicholson scheme central difference in space average in time the source term representing biological conversion in the biofilm mass balance was discretized using an explicit forward euler approach the mass balances in both liquid and biofilm phases were solved anaerobic feeding phase fully coupled using lu decomposition followed by forward and back substitution as outlined by koester et al 1993 operations on the sludge cluster population were performed during the reaction phase the end of each phase appendix d calculation of lorenz curve and gini coefficient for substrate distribution a well known method of analysing the inequality is the gini coefficient gini 1912 this gini coefficient quantifies the inequality using the lorenz curve which plots the cumulative fraction of the total income y axis earned by a population fraction sorted x axis lorenz 1905 the gini coefficient is determined by the ratio of the area between the equality line and the lorenz curve and the area between the lorenz curve to utilize the gini coefficient for the quantitative analysis of the distribution of gfs in the feeding phase the amount of gfs accumulated as storage polymers by each cluster was calculated weighted by the number of granules g represented by a simulated cluster j before calculation the clusters were sorted based on the amount of accumulated gfs from low to high the y axis of the lorenz curve was defined as d 1 y j m 1 j g m

16134,electro peroxone ep reaction has been considered as a promising process for real effluent treatments however the use of the technology in natural water conditions is limited by low electrical conductivity and high operating costs herein a novel electrochemical system was designed to overcome this constrain by coupling ep with a solid polymer electrolyte ep spe performances of ep spe system were thoroughly evaluated by comparing the decomposition and energy efficiencies of various plasticizers in different systems the ep spe system achieved 50 of pollutants mineralization in only 10 min with the electrolysis energy consumption of 1 0 kwh m 3 while the conventional ep system not adding salt compounds cep n as need 30 60 min to reach 50 of pollutants mineralization with 3 8 26 6 kwh m 3 kinetics and mechanisms of ep spe were investigated in detail while electronic paramagnetic resonance epr detection and kinetic model revealed the occurrence transient concentration and degradation contribution of reactive oxidizing species ros furthermore tests of variety of spes and natural waters demonstrated universal applicability of ep spe additionally ep spe did not show any performance deterioration after 15 runs therefore this work provides a feasible technology for plasticizer purification in natural water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solid polymer electrolyte electro peroxone plasticizers dimethyl phthalate natural water 1 introduction the global plastic production and consumption is continuously increasing okoffo et al 2021 as plastics play an essential part in every sector of economy all over the world zeenat elahi et al 2021 however plasticizers released from plastic products have emerged as persistent water pollutants ren et al 2020 and aroused increasing concerns because of their adverse effects on the endocrine system of human beings demeneix 2020 even though some plasticizers have been subject to regulatory actions in many countries for controlling plastic pollution kim et al 2021 plasticizers still exist widely in natural waters advanced oxidation processes aops have been considered as an efficient and environmentally friendly technology to eliminate pollutants coha et al 2021 domingues et al 2021 wu et al 2021 among them an electro peroxone ep process is effective for facile generation of hydroxyl radicals oh in a high yield to remove organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals yang et al 2021 yao et al 2016 dyes cornejo et al 2021 ghalebizade and ayati 2020 and plasticizers hou et al 2016 in the ep process h2o2 can be generated in situ from o2 by electrochemistry at the cathode eq 1 from a sparged ozone generator effluent o2 and o3 gas mixture and then h2o2 reacts with the sparged o3 to produce oh eq 2 which can in turn effectively oxidize organic pollutants li et al 2014 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 2 o 3 2 oh 3 o 2 however a general disadvantage of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops is the addition of salt compounds such as na2so4 bensalah et al 2020 liang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 k2so4 zhang et al 2022 nacl rajasekhar et al 2021 and na2sio3 guo et al 2021a as a supporting electrolyte to decrease water resistivity and cell voltage from an application point of view the addition of chemicals to the solution leads to a strong increase of operating costs and a more difficult procedure since it can cause the formation of secondary pollutants ma et al 2018 a possible alternative is the reduction of the distance between electrodes into a microscale as occurred in the microreactors clematis and panizza 2021 which can be achieved by sandwiching a separator between the anode and cathode in this study a solid polymer electrolyte spe is selected and used as the separator to maintain the gap electrode in a micron scale and avoid short circuit issues promising results in electrochemical organic oxidation have been reported in the past few years clematis et al 2017 tasca et al 2020 2019 xia et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless the spe substitution of supporting electrolytes in ep has not been reported in this paper a novel system ep spe system by coupling ep

including one from yangtze river one from east lake a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and groundwater in wuhan the main water quality parameters of the water matrices are summarized in table 1 to facilitate the evaluation of micropollutant abatement during ep spe system we spiked plasticizers including dmp dep 2 cp and pe in the real water samples to achieve an initial concentration of 20 mg l for each micropollutant 2 2 ozonation electrolysis and ep spe treatments ozonation electrolysis and ep spe treatments of 150 ml plasticizers dmp dep pe and 2 cp were conducted in a high purity quartz reactor in these experiments a high initial concentration of plasticizers 20 mg l 1 was used to facilitate the evaluation of the effects of main operating factors on the process efficiency during the treatments for ozonation and ep spe treatments an ozone generator 3s t10 d tonglin techonlogy co china was used to produce o3 from pure o2 gas 99 9 o3 concentration

flow rate of 0 4 l mi n 1 both the electrolysis and ep spe treatments were conducted under galvanostatic conditions using a dc power supply it6863a itech electronic co ltd china the heart of the installation was constructed by sandwiching a solid polymer electrolyte spe nafion n324 sci materials hub between a 15 cm2 3 cm 5 cm graphite plate anode and a graphite felt cathode ep spe system in some experiments the spe was substituted by a teflon board cep nas in simulation of real water σ 0 33 ms c m 1 1 mmol l 1 na2so4 was added to the system while the electrolyte in conventional e peroxone systems cep as as salt is added to the system as a supporting electrolyte is usually 0 1 mol l 1 na2so4 the electrolysis treatment was initiated by switching on the dc power supply while the ozone generator was off for ep spe treatments the dc power supply and the ozone generator were turned on simultaneously the o2 and o3 mixture from the ozone generator was bubbled into the reactor at 0

results 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of gas phase o3 at the gas inlet of the reactor was monitored using an ozone analyzer 3s j5000 tonglin technology co china during the ep spe process the ozone concentration in the aqueous phase was measured by the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 the concentration of h2o2 in solution was detected by the potassium titanium iv oxalate method

taken from the ep spe system respectively 2 4 model development during ep spe o3 oh and o 2 exposures were measured to represent their oxidation capacity in the system guo et al 2021b the o3 exposure

and discussion 3 1 comparison of electrolysis ozonation and ep spe treatments of dmp degradation of dmp in electrolysis ozonation and ep spe processes are compared in fig 1 a negligible degradation of dmp was observed after 30 min in the electrolysis process indicating that dmp elimination by graphite felt adsorption and direct oxidation by electrolysis was insufficient approximately 98 of dmp was degraded in ozonation process after 30 min in contrast rapid dmp degradation occurred in ep spe process and 100 of dmp removal was achieved within 15 min the linear relationship between ln c c0 and reaction time suggested that dmp degradation in these processes followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s6 the apparent rate constant of dmp degradation was significantly enhanced in the ep spe process k obs 0 486 min 1 compared with that in the electrolysis k obs 0 007 min 1 and ozonation k obs 0 137 min 1 previous studies have reported that some oxidation intermediates of dmp have higher toxicity zhang et al 2021 high degrees of mineralization of dmp and its degradation intermediates are therefore desirable to minimize the potential environmental threat of the effluents fig 1 b shows that complete toc mineralization was achieved after 120 min for ep spe treatment in comparison only 12 33 and 8 82 tocs were removed from the solution after 120 min by ozonation and electrolysis treatments respectively among them the energy consumption of each part of the three processes was discussed in detail in text s3 the rapid degradation and complete mineralization of dmp in the ep spe process may stem from the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species a radical trapping and visualization technique by epr was used to investigate the evolution of ros involved in the ep spe and ozonation systems fig 1 c e depicts that no obvious characteristic peaks of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals were observed in ozonation processes however the three characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 with intensity ratios of 1 1 1 were captured indicating the existence of singlet oxygen the signals of dmpo oh dmpo o 2 and temp 1o2 were observed in the ep spe system indicating that hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were generated which contributed to the rapid degradation of dmp however the peak strength of singlet oxygen decreased significantly which may be caused by the reaction eq 8 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 since 1o2 exhibits similar selectivity toward organics as o3 frank et al 1987 1o2 will contribute negligibly to the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants furthermore the oxidation capacity and concentration of o3 are higher than 1o2 therefore 1o2 also plays a minor role in the abatement of ozone reactive micropollutants compared to o3 frank et al 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall the contribution of 1o2 for dmp mineralization in the ep spe system was negligible 8 1 o 2 e aq o 2 therefore the high mineralization efficiency of dmp in ep spe process can be attributed to the significant production of oh and o 2 in contrast mineralization of dmp and its degradation intermediates by electrolysis was limited due to water oxygen eq 9 and gas film formation on the anode surface hou et al 2016 as for ozonation although o3 could destruct 98 of dmp in 30 min the amounts of oh and o 2 generated by o3 were not enough to make dmp mineralization 9 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 3 2 effects of operating parameters on dmp degradation and toc mineralization to get more insights into ep spe treatment of dmp we evaluated systematically the effects of important operating parameters such as o3 concentration solution ph and current on the process performance fig 2 a shows that increasing o3 concentration in the sparged gas enhanced dmp degradation in the ep spe process from 96 21 to 100 two possible mechanisms may explain the o3 dosage dependent effect the first one is that increasing the o3 concentration in the sparged gas can facilitate o3 transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase and enhance o3 exposure hou et al 2016 since ozonation can effectively remove dmp fig 1 a therefore increasing o3 exposure promoted the ozonation process of dmp for the same reason dmp degraded by ozone oxidation alone also increased with o3 concentration in the sparged gas from 72 7 to 99 2 fig s7 the other reasonable mechanism could be that increasing the gas phase o3 concentration would enhance production of radicals including oh and o 2 eq 10 yao et al 2021 generated from the reactions of o3 with h 2 o 2 produced by o2 at the cathode eq 1 jiang et al 2018 the difference of dmp mineralization in these two systems confirmed the mechanism as shown in fig 2 b increasing the o3 concentration in the sparged gas also enhanced toc mineralization in the ep spe process and complete mineralization could be achieved at 40 mg l 1 o3 while the dmp mineralization by ozone oxidation alone with 40 mg l 1 o3 was only 12 3 fig 1 b the results indicated that the rate of radicals produced by ep spe process was significantly higher than that of ozonation 10 o 3 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h o 2 to investigate the effect of ph on dmp degradation and toc mineralization we adjusted the solution ph to different initial values between 3 and 9 using h2so4 or naoh before commencing the ep spe treatment and maintained at their initial ph values throughout the whole process the result showed that dmp degradation and toc mineralization were ph dependent the degradation rate constant of dmp reached a minimum of 0 255 min 1 at ph 3 and a further increase in ph almost doubled the degradation rate constant yet the values remained very close to each other fig 3 a the toc mineralization of dmp also varied with ph and the mineralization was the highest at neutral ph and reduced considerably at ph 3 fig 3 b the solution ph has very complex effects on ep spe processes as ph influences the solubility of o3 in water and the type and concentration of radicals wu et al 2019 acidic solution will inhibit the conversion of the gaseous o3 into the aqueous o3 yao et al 2021 thus the rates of dmp degradation and toc mineralization decreased considerably at ph 3 it is well known that decomposition of aqueous o3 to ho 2 conjugated base of h2o2 eq 11 is considerably enhanced at alkaline ph gunten 2003 thereby increasing the amount of oh eq 12 kishimoto et al 2005 however it may also become a quenching reagent to consumes oh eq 13 li et al 2014 in the ep spe process as a result these side reactions would lead to a decrease in pollutant degradation efficiency this may account for the lower toc mineralization at ph 9 than at ph 7 11 o 3 o h ho 2 o 2 12 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 13 ho 2 oh o 2 h o h current density is also a common factor influencing dmp removal with an increase of the current density both dmp degradation and mineralization are strengthened fig 4 a and c this can be explained as the greater the current density the greater the amount of instantaneous h 2 o 2 which can react with o3 to produce more oh and o 2 eq 10 however when the current density increases from 10 to 15 ma cm 2 the degradation rate constant decreases slightly from 0 486 to 0 463 min 1 fig 4 a the high current density would give rise to some side reactions at cathode such as four electron reduction of o2 into h2o eq 14 and h2 evolution eq 15 li et al 2018 meanwhile the increase of voltage could also promote o3 depletion eq 16 haynes 2014 in addition a higher current density will lead to higher energy consumption compared with j 10 ma cm 2 the energy consumption of degradation and mineralization at j 15 ma cm 2 increases by 4 6 times 3 7 vs 0 8 kwh m 3 with 100 of degradation in 30 min and 2 times 23 5 vs 10 9 kwh m 3 with 100 of mineralization in 120 min respectively fig 4 b and d the ep spe processes were therefore carried out at 10 ma cm 2 in a cost effective way for most of the experiments 14 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 15 2 h 2 e h 2 16 o 3 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h o 2 3 3 comparison of energy efficiency in three ep systems to further evaluate dmp mineralization and energy efficiency in the ep spe system we conducted degradation and mineralization of dmp in control systems cep nas and conventional e peroxone system cep as for comparison as shown in fig 5 a like the ep spe system dmp can be degraded completely in the control systems cep nas and cep as in 15 min and the degradation rates of dmp in cep nas and cep as systems were 0 444 and 0 595 min 1 respectively however the mineralization of dmp was much lower compared to the ep spe system and can only reach 70 in 120 min in the control systems fig 5 c the varied dmp degradation and mineralization performance may be due to the different amounts of reactive species generated in the three different systems and will be further discussed in section 3 4 furthermore we found that the energy consumption of dmp degradation and mineralization were exceedingly different in three systems as illustrated in fig 5 b and d the ep spe system achieved the lowest degradation energy consumption of 0 8 kwh m 3 with 100 of dmp degradation in 15 min 7 8 kwh m 3 in the cep nas system and 2 4 kwh m 3 in the cep as system and 50 of toc removal efficiency with mineralization energy consumption of 1 0 kwh m 3 in only 10 min while it took 60 min with 26 6 kwh m 3 in the cep nas system and 30 min with 3 8 kwh m 3 in the cep as system to reach 50 of toc removal efficiency this result can be attributed to the lowest cell voltage of 4 8 v 8 2 v in the cep as system and 30 2 v in the cep nas system caused by the highest conductivity σ of 167 6 ms c m 1 simple conversion from ρ ep spe in the ep spe system σ cep as 15 82 ms c m 1 and σ cep nas 0 33 ms c m 1 detailed information in table s4 therefore the energy consumption of degradation and mineralization of dmp in the ep spe system was 3 0 times and 3 8 times lower than those in the cep as system respectively the ep spe system not only improved efficiency but also reduced energy consumption as against the conventional e peroxone system during dmp degradation and mineralization even more in the same level of electrical conductivity as to that of natural water the ep spe system could reduce the energy consumption of dmp degradation and mineralization by 9 8 times and 26 6 times respectively compared with the cep nas system 3 4 evaluation of ros in the ep spe cep nas and cep as system in avoiding a change of the reaction mechanisms of ep spe low concentration p cba 0 25 mmol l 1 and dep 0 1 mmol l 1 were spiked as probes to measure oh and o 2 exposure during ep spe based on the concentration curve of o3 and the depletion curves of p cba and dep observed during ep spe processes o3 oh and o 2 exposures during the two processes were obtained using eqs 4 6 and shown in fig 6 the exposures of o3 and oh increase with the duration of whole process of ep spe but o 2 exposure reaches a relatively stable level after 12 min manifesting that o 2 is consumed in the system eqs 17 19 guo et al 2021c 17 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 k 1 1 6 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 18 o

oh to o 3 exposure ratio of o 2 to o 3 exposure and ratio of o 2 to oh exposure have been defined as r ct r so and r sh respectively eqs 20 22 similar observations have been reported in previous studies elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021c because the r ct r so and r sh are constant and independent of the reaction time they also represent the ratios of transient o 3 oh and o 2 concentrations at any time during ep spe process elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021b as shown in fig 6 c the r ct r so and r sh values were 2 48 1 0 9 2 59 1 0 7 and 104 4 during ep spe process respectively based on the constant r ct and r so values and o 3 concentrations observed the evolutions of oh and o 2 concentrations during the ep spe are modelled using eqs 21 and 22 and shown in fig 6 d 20 r ct oh dt o 3 dt oh o 3 21 r so o 2 dt o 3 dt o 2 o 3 22 r sh o 2 dt oh dt o 2 oh fig 6 d shows oh and o 2 concentrations remain constantly during the ep spe process over the entire reaction period the transient concentrations of o 3 oh and o 2 were 0 33 8 11 1 0 10 and 8 47 1 0 8 mmol l 1 table s5 respectively meanwhile the transient concentration of o 2 was 104 4 times higher than that of oh the higher amounts of o 2 compared to oh can be explained by the larger generation rates than consumption rates eqs 23 25 kishimoto et al 2005 the model simulated attenuation process correlates well with the experimentally measured values for both processes fig s8 this confirmed that the calculated values of oh and o 2 concentrations were accurate and the kinetics calculation was feasible consequently the main radical produced in the ep spe system is o 2 these simulation results agree with the epr analysis fig 1 c e 23 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 k 1 3 0 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 24 oh o 3 o 2 ho 2 k 2 5 0 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 25 oh oh h 2 o 2 k 3 5 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 according to the analysis of the three systems ep spe cep nas and cep as in section 3 3 above the varied dmp degradation and mineralization in different systems may be resulted from the different amounts of oxidative species therefore the variations of major oxidative species o 3 oh and o 2 in control systems were also investigated as shown in fig 7 e and f r ct r so and r sh are 2 37 1 0 9 1 28 1 0 7 and 54 0 in cep nas respectively while they are 3 36 1 0 9 1 37 1 0 7 and 40 8 in cep as respectively thus the transient concentrations of o 3 oh and o 2 were calculated to be 0 34 8 05 1 0 10 and 4 36 1 0 8 mmol l 1 in cep nas respectively and 0 32 1 09 1 0 9 and 4 43 1 0 8 mmol l 1 in cep as respectively table s5 obviously the concentrations of the radicals in the two control systems have changed as different reactions caused by different electrode polarizations owing to different cell voltages 8 2 v in cep as system 30 2 v in cep nas system and 4 8 v in ep spe system for instance the main reaction was four electron reduction of o2 into h2o eq 14 in cep as system while the h2 evolution reaction eq 15 occurred in the cep nas system the reaction of generating h2o2 by the two electron reduction of o2 at cathode was inhibited fig s9 which results in a decrease in the content of o 2 eq 10 therefore the transient concentration of o 2 in cep as system 4 43 1 0 8 mmol l 1 and cep nas system 4 36 1 0 8 mmol l 1 were much lower than that in ep spe system 8 47 1 0 8 mmol l 1 however the transient concentration of oh only changed slightly 1 09 1 0 9 mmol l 1 in cep as system 8 05 1 0 10 mmol l 1 in cep nas system and 8 11 1 0 10 mmol l 1 in cep nas system table s5 because oh could also be produced by o 3 eqs 18 and 19 which would be produced directly at cathode in high cell voltage eq 26 xia et al 2017 this may be the possible reason for the different dmp degradation and mineralization in the two control groups 26 o 3 e o 3 3 5 effects of variety of spes and plasticizers on ep spe performance for further confirmation of the performances of ep spe system for wastewater treatment decomposition tests of different plasticizers were carried out in the ep spe system as shown in fig 8 a all the tested plasticizers can be degraded completely in 30 min and the degradation rates of 2 cp pe dep and dmp were 0 959 0 907 0 153 and 0 485 min 1 respectively due to the different second order rate constants of reactive species with the organic compounds table 2 in addition the mineralization rates of the organic pollutants reached above 80 except dep at 20 24 fig 8 b overall the ep spe system exhibited high degradation and mineralization efficiencies of plasticizers according to the previous research we also evaluated the contribution of ros to plasticizers we estimated the relative contributions of oh reaction f oh o3 oxidation f o 3 and o 2 oxidation f o 2 to plasticizers abatement using eqs 27 29 fig s10 the results revealed that o3 made the greatest contribution to 2 cp and pe degradation while oh is the predominant contributor to dep and dmp degradation in ep spe process 27 f o 3 k o 3 o 3 dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 28 f oh k oh oh dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt 29 f o 2 k o 2 o 2 dt k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt k o 2 o 2 dt for an optimal spe the influence of different spes on the performance of ep system was also tested four spes nafion n324 nafion n438 nafion n117 and nafion n115 were selected for comparative tests and their properties are listed in table s6 as shown in fig 9 a nafion n324 achieved the best performance in dmp decomposition with the fastest k obs 0 486 mi n 1 degradation rate and highest mineralization of dmp in 60 min 90 fig 9 b due to its lowest resistivity table s6 although nafion n117 and nafion n438 had similar resistivity the rigidity of nafion n117 was worse than that of nafion n438 which made it difficult for anode and cathode to fit tightly with spe fig s11 thus increasing the voltage and energy consumption 3 5 vs 2 7 kwh m 3 fig 9 b despite that all four spes exhibited excellent performances 3 6 effects of water matrices on dmp degradation and mineralization by ep spe process in evaluation of the application potential of ep spe processes decomposition of dmp in ep spe system was carried out in real water samples of yangtze river east lake secondary effluent and groundwater as shown in fig 10 a the degradation of dmp could reach above 98 in the different natural waters within 30 min and the rate constants of dmp in the yangtze river east lake secondary effluent and groundwater were 0 420 0 335 0 454 and 0 466 min 1 respectively meanwhile the mineralization rates of dmp in the four real water matrices were 31 31 26 58 26 53 and 82 18 respectively fig 10 b among them the effect of chloride was negligible due to its low concentration yao et al 2019 while hco 3 k oh hco 3 8 5 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 might quench the hydroxyl radical to result in less amount of reactive species leading to a poor oxidation efficiency of plasticizer moreover the total organic carbon values toc were 58 55 86 9 53 75 and 19 5 mg l 1 in yangtze river east lake secondary effluent and groundwater respectively the dissolved organic pollutants dom and dmp compete with the produced radicals in the system thus weakening the dmp mineralization therefore the treatment efficiency of dmp in real water was highly dependent on the background matters the lower the concentration of bicarbonate and dom the higher removal rate of plasticizers the results suggest that the promising ep spe system is highly efficient to eliminate the plasticizers in water especially in groundwater 3 7 stability tests in practical applications the stability of the system is of great significance the stability of ep spe was therefore evaluated through cycles of dmp degradation as described in figs 11 and s12 dmp removal efficiency remained 100 and the degradation rate decreased by 8 7 from 0 537 min 1 to 0 490 min 1 after 15 runs indicating that the ep spe system exhibited obvious advantages in dmp degradation including high removal efficiency constant degradation rates and high stability 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that e peroxone combined with spe ep spe system is promising for efficient removals of plasticizers dmp can be effectively degraded and mineralized by the ep spe processes under a variety of tested conditions the kinetic calculations based on probes p cba and dep revealed that the ratios among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations remain almost constant over the entire reaction time in the ep spe system thus the transient concentrations of oh and o 2 can be calculated based on the detected o 3 concentrations and relative contributions of the various reactive species to plasticizers decomposition can be quantified even though the concentrations of o 2 in ep spe system was two orders of magnitude higher than oh the reaction rate of the plasticizer with o 2 is quite low compared to that with oh so oh still plays a dominant role in plasticizer degradation what is more the novel ep spe system shows a lower energy consumption and better mineralization than cep as system thus the ep spe system provides a promising technique for the control and

16134,electro peroxone ep reaction has been considered as a promising process for real effluent treatments however the use of the technology in natural water conditions is limited by low electrical conductivity and high operating costs herein a novel electrochemical system was designed to overcome this constrain by coupling ep with a solid polymer electrolyte ep spe performances of ep spe system were thoroughly evaluated by comparing the decomposition and energy efficiencies of various plasticizers in different systems the ep spe system achieved 50 of pollutants mineralization in only 10 min with the electrolysis energy consumption of 1 0 kwh m 3 while the conventional ep system not adding salt compounds cep n as need 30 60 min to reach 50 of pollutants mineralization with 3 8 26 6 kwh m

contribution of reactive oxidizing species ros furthermore tests of variety of spes and natural waters demonstrated universal applicability of ep spe additionally ep spe did not show any performance deterioration after 15 runs therefore this work provides a feasible technology for plasticizer purification in natural water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords solid polymer electrolyte electro peroxone plasticizers dimethyl phthalate natural water 1 introduction the global plastic production and consumption is continuously increasing okoffo et al 2021 as plastics play an essential part in every sector of economy all over the world zeenat elahi et al 2021 however plasticizers released from plastic products have emerged as persistent water pollutants ren et al 2020 and aroused increasing concerns because of their adverse effects on the endocrine system of human beings demeneix 2020 even though some plasticizers have been subject to regulatory actions in many countries for controlling plastic pollution kim et al 2021 plasticizers still exist widely in natural waters advanced oxidation processes aops have been considered as an efficient and environmentally friendly technology to eliminate pollutants coha et al 2021 domingues et al 2021 wu et al 2021 among them an electro peroxone ep process is effective for facile generation of hydroxyl radicals oh in a high yield to remove organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals yang et al 2021 yao et al 2016 dyes cornejo et al 2021 ghalebizade and ayati 2020 and plasticizers hou et al 2016 in the ep process h2o2 can be generated in situ from o2 by electrochemistry at the cathode eq 1 from a sparged ozone generator effluent o2 and o3 gas mixture and then h2o2 reacts with the sparged o3 to produce oh eq 2 which can in turn effectively oxidize organic pollutants li et al 2014 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 2 o 3 2 oh 3 o 2 however a general disadvantage of electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops is the addition of salt compounds such as na2so4 bensalah et al 2020 liang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 k2so4 zhang et al 2022 nacl rajasekhar et al 2021 and na2sio3 guo et al 2021a as a supporting electrolyte to decrease water resistivity and cell voltage from an application point of view the addition of chemicals to the solution leads to a strong increase of operating costs and a more difficult procedure since it can cause the formation of secondary pollutants ma et al 2018 a possible alternative is the reduction of the distance between electrodes into a microscale as occurred in the microreactors clematis and panizza 2021 which can be achieved by sandwiching a separator between the anode and cathode in this study a solid polymer electrolyte spe is selected and used as the separator to maintain the gap electrode in a micron scale and avoid short circuit issues promising results in electrochemical organic oxidation have been reported in the past few years clematis et al 2017 tasca et al 2020 2019 xia et al 2019a 2019b nevertheless the spe substitution of supporting electrolytes in ep has not been reported in this paper a novel system ep spe system by coupling ep process with spe membrane was used to eliminate model plasticizers in water the degradation mineralization and energy efficiencies of various plasticizers in different systems were compared and the effects of applied current o3 concentration solution ph on the ep spe performance were also evaluated systematically the study focused on the types and concentrations of reactive oxygen species ros in the ep spe system and their contributions to the degradation of different pollutants were analyzed thoroughly moreover the performances of ep spe system for plasticizer degradation and mineralization were compared in different real water matrix finally the stability of ep spe system was tested 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples graphite plate and graphite felt were purchased

solutions were prepared with ultrapure water resistivity 18 mω from a mill q system upw 30s epoch co beijing four types of natural water samples were used for ep spe experiments in this study including one from yangtze river one from east lake a secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and groundwater in wuhan the main water quality parameters of the water matrices are summarized in table 1 to facilitate the evaluation of micropollutant abatement during ep spe system we spiked plasticizers including dmp dep 2 cp and pe in the real water samples to achieve an initial concentration of 20 mg l for each micropollutant 2 2 ozonation electrolysis and ep spe treatments ozonation electrolysis and ep spe treatments of 150 ml plasticizers dmp dep pe and 2 cp were conducted in a high purity quartz reactor in these experiments a high initial concentration of plasticizers 20 mg l 1 was used to facilitate the evaluation of the effects of main operating factors on the process efficiency during the treatments for ozonation and ep spe treatments an ozone generator 3s t10 d tonglin techonlogy co china was used to produce o3 from pure o2 gas 99 9 o3 concentration in the ozone generator effluent o2 and o3 gas mixture can be adjusted by changing the ozone generator power an ozone effluent was then sparged into the graphite felt using a teflon tube at a constant flow rate of 0 4 l mi n 1 both the electrolysis and ep spe treatments were conducted under galvanostatic conditions using a dc power supply it6863a itech electronic co ltd china the heart of the installation was constructed by sandwiching a solid polymer electrolyte spe nafion n324 sci materials hub between a 15 cm2 3 cm 5 cm graphite plate anode and a graphite felt cathode ep spe system in some experiments the spe was substituted by a teflon board cep nas in simulation of real water σ 0 33 ms c m 1 1 mmol l 1 na2so4 was added to the system while the electrolyte in conventional e peroxone systems cep as as salt is added to the system as a supporting electrolyte is usually 0 1 mol l 1 na2so4 the electrolysis treatment was initiated by switching on the dc power supply while the ozone generator was off for ep spe treatments the dc power supply and the ozone generator were turned on simultaneously the o2 and o3 mixture from the ozone generator was bubbled into the reactor at 0 4 l mi n 1 which is the same as that in ozonation treatments all experiments were performed in triplicates and the error bars in all data plots represent one standard deviation of the replicated test results 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of gas phase o3 at the gas inlet of the reactor was monitored using an ozone analyzer 3s j5000 tonglin technology co china during the ep spe process the ozone concentration in the aqueous phase was measured by the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 the concentration of h2o2 in solution was detected by the potassium titanium iv oxalate method liang et al 2021 dmp 2 cp pe and dep were measured using a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc ultimate 3000 equipped with a uv diode array detector dad tables s2 and s3 for detailed description the second order rate constants for the reaction of o3 with dmp and dep were measured text s1 with a competition kinetic method using p cba as a reference compound von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the second order rate constants for the reaction of o 2 k o 2 with the test compounds including dmp dep 2 cp and pe were measured using the same method by the photochemical generation of

paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr emxnano was employed during the ep spe and ozonation treatments to detect the formation of radicals 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline dmpo and 4 amino 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp were used as the spinning trap reagents for oh o 2 and 1o2 respectively about 20 μ l dmpo 0 2 mol l 1 or 50 μ l temp 0 3 mol l 1 was immediately injected into the samples taken from the ep spe system respectively 2 4 model development during ep spe o3 oh and o 2 exposures were measured to represent their oxidation capacity in the system guo et al 2021b the o3 exposure o 3 dt was obtained from the time integrated o3 concentration over a given period of reaction time using eq 4 while the oh oh dt and o 2 o 2 dt exposures were calculated using the binary equations eqs

and discussion 3 1 comparison of electrolysis ozonation and ep spe treatments of dmp degradation of dmp in electrolysis ozonation and ep spe processes are compared in fig 1 a negligible degradation of dmp was observed after 30 min in the electrolysis process indicating that dmp elimination by graphite felt adsorption and direct oxidation by electrolysis was insufficient approximately 98 of dmp was degraded in ozonation process after 30 min in contrast rapid dmp degradation occurred in ep spe process and 100 of dmp removal was achieved within 15 min the linear relationship between ln c c0 and reaction time suggested that dmp degradation in these processes followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s6 the apparent rate constant of dmp degradation was significantly enhanced in the ep spe process k obs 0 486 min 1 compared with that in the electrolysis k obs 0 007 min 1 and ozonation k obs 0 137 min 1 previous studies have reported that some oxidation intermediates of dmp have higher toxicity zhang et al 2021 high degrees of mineralization of dmp and its degradation intermediates are therefore desirable to minimize the potential environmental threat of the effluents fig 1 b shows that complete toc mineralization was achieved after 120 min for ep spe treatment in comparison only 12 33 and 8 82 tocs were removed from the solution after 120 min by ozonation and electrolysis treatments respectively among them the energy consumption of each part of the three processes was discussed in detail in text s3 the rapid degradation and complete mineralization of dmp in the ep spe process may stem from the efficient generation of reactive oxygen species a radical trapping and visualization technique by epr was used to investigate the evolution of ros involved in the ep spe and ozonation systems fig 1 c e depicts that no obvious characteristic peaks of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals were observed in ozonation processes however the three characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 with intensity ratios of 1 1 1 were captured indicating the existence of singlet oxygen the signals of dmpo oh dmpo o 2 and temp 1o2 were observed in the ep spe system indicating that hydroxyl and superoxide radicals were generated which contributed to the rapid degradation of dmp however the peak strength of singlet oxygen decreased significantly which may be caused by the reaction eq 8 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 since 1o2 exhibits similar selectivity toward organics as o3 frank et al 1987 1o2 will contribute negligibly to the abatement of ozone resistant micropollutants furthermore the oxidation capacity and concentration of o3 are higher than 1o2 therefore 1o2 also plays a minor role in the abatement of ozone reactive micropollutants compared to o3 frank et al 1987 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 overall the contribution of 1o2 for dmp mineralization in the ep spe system was negligible 8 1 o 2 e aq o 2 therefore the high mineralization efficiency of dmp in ep spe process can be attributed to the significant production of oh and o 2 in contrast mineralization of dmp and its degradation intermediates by electrolysis was limited due to water oxygen eq 9 and gas film formation on the anode surface hou et al 2016 as for ozonation although o3 could destruct 98 of dmp in 30 min the amounts of oh and o 2 generated by o3 were not enough to make dmp mineralization 9 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 3 2 effects of operating parameters on dmp degradation and toc mineralization to get more insights into ep spe treatment of dmp we evaluated systematically the effects of important operating parameters such as o3 concentration solution ph and current on the process performance fig 2 a shows that increasing o3 concentration in the sparged gas enhanced dmp degradation in the ep spe process from 96 21 to 100 two possible mechanisms may explain the o3 dosage dependent effect the first one is that increasing the o3 concentration in the sparged gas can facilitate o3 transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase and enhance o3 exposure hou et al 2016 since ozonation can effectively remove dmp fig 1 a therefore increasing o3 exposure promoted the ozonation process of dmp for the same reason dmp degraded by ozone oxidation alone also increased with o3 concentration in the sparged gas from 72 7 to 99 2 fig s7 the other reasonable mechanism could be that increasing the gas phase o3 concentration would enhance production of radicals including oh and o 2 eq 10 yao et al 2021 generated from the reactions of o3 with h 2 o 2 produced by o2 at the cathode eq 1 jiang et al 2018 the difference of dmp mineralization in these two systems confirmed the mechanism as shown in fig 2 b increasing the o3 concentration in the sparged gas also enhanced toc mineralization in the ep spe process and complete mineralization could be achieved at 40 mg l 1 o3 while the dmp mineralization by ozone oxidation alone with 40 mg l 1 o3 was only 12 3 fig 1 b the results indicated that the rate of radicals produced by ep spe process was significantly higher than that of ozonation 10 o 3 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h o 2 to investigate the effect of ph on dmp degradation and toc mineralization we adjusted the solution ph to different initial values between 3 and 9 using h2so4 or naoh before commencing the ep spe treatment and maintained at their initial ph values throughout the whole process the result showed that dmp degradation and toc mineralization were ph dependent the degradation rate constant of dmp reached a minimum of 0 255 min 1 at ph 3 and a further increase in ph almost doubled the degradation rate constant yet the values remained very close to each other fig 3 a the toc mineralization of dmp also varied with ph and the mineralization was the highest at neutral ph and reduced considerably at ph 3 fig 3 b the solution ph has very complex effects on ep spe processes as ph influences the solubility of o3 in water and the type and concentration of radicals wu et al 2019 acidic solution will inhibit the conversion of the gaseous o3 into the aqueous o3 yao et al 2021 thus the rates of dmp degradation and toc mineralization decreased considerably at ph 3 it is well known that decomposition of aqueous o3 to ho 2 conjugated base of h2o2 eq 11 is considerably enhanced at alkaline ph gunten 2003 thereby increasing the amount of oh eq 12 kishimoto et al 2005 however it may also become a quenching reagent to consumes oh eq 13 li et al 2014 in the ep spe process as a result these side reactions would lead to a decrease in pollutant degradation efficiency this may account for the lower toc mineralization at ph 9 than at ph 7 11 o 3 o h ho 2 o 2 12 o 3 ho 2 oh o 2 o 2 13 ho 2 oh o 2 h o h current density is also a common factor influencing dmp removal with an increase of the current density both dmp degradation and mineralization are strengthened fig 4 a and c this can be explained as the greater the current density the greater the amount of instantaneous h 2 o 2 which can react with o3 to produce more oh and o 2 eq 10 however when the current density increases from 10 to 15 ma cm 2 the degradation rate constant decreases slightly from 0 486 to 0 463 min 1 fig 4 a the high current density would give rise to some side reactions at cathode such as four electron reduction of o2 into h2o eq 14 and h2 evolution eq 15 li et al 2018 meanwhile the increase of voltage could also promote o3 depletion eq 16 haynes 2014 in addition a higher current density will lead to higher energy consumption compared with j 10 ma cm 2 the energy consumption of degradation and mineralization at j 15 ma cm 2 increases by 4 6 times 3 7 vs 0 8 kwh m 3 with 100 of degradation in 30 min and 2 times 23 5 vs 10 9 kwh m 3 with 100 of mineralization in 120 min respectively fig 4 b and d the ep spe processes were therefore carried out at 10 ma cm 2 in a cost effective way for most of the experiments 14 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 15 2 h 2 e h 2 16 o 3 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h o 2 3 3 comparison of energy efficiency in three ep systems to further evaluate dmp mineralization and energy efficiency in the ep spe system we conducted degradation and mineralization of dmp in control systems cep nas and conventional e peroxone system cep as for comparison as shown in fig 5 a like the ep spe system dmp can be degraded completely in the control systems cep nas and cep as in 15 min and the degradation rates of dmp in cep nas and cep as systems were 0 444 and 0 595 min 1 respectively however the mineralization of dmp was much lower compared to the ep spe system and can only reach 70 in 120 min in the control systems fig 5 c the varied dmp degradation and mineralization performance may be due to the different amounts of reactive species generated in the three different systems and will be further discussed in section 3 4 furthermore we found that the energy consumption of dmp degradation and mineralization were exceedingly different in three systems as illustrated in fig 5 b and d the ep spe system achieved the lowest degradation energy consumption of 0 8 kwh m 3 with 100 of dmp degradation in 15 min 7 8 kwh m 3 in the cep nas system and 2 4 kwh m 3 in the cep as system and 50 of toc removal efficiency with mineralization energy consumption of 1 0 kwh m 3 in only 10 min while it took 60 min with 26 6 kwh m 3 in the cep nas system and 30 min with 3 8 kwh m 3 in the cep as system to reach 50 of toc removal efficiency this result can be attributed to the lowest cell voltage of 4 8 v 8 2 v in the cep as system and 30 2 v in the cep nas system caused by the highest conductivity σ of 167 6 ms c m 1 simple conversion from ρ ep spe in the ep spe system σ cep as 15 82 ms c m 1 and σ cep nas 0 33 ms c m 1 detailed information in table s4 therefore the energy consumption of degradation and mineralization of dmp in the ep spe system was 3 0 times and 3 8 times lower than those in the cep as system respectively the ep spe system not only improved efficiency but also reduced energy consumption as against the conventional e peroxone system during dmp degradation and mineralization even more in the same level of electrical conductivity as to that of natural water the ep spe system could reduce the energy consumption of dmp degradation and mineralization by 9 8 times and 26 6 times respectively compared with the cep nas system 3 4 evaluation of ros in the ep spe cep nas and cep as system in avoiding a change of the reaction mechanisms of ep spe low concentration p cba 0 25 mmol l 1 and dep 0 1 mmol l 1 were spiked as probes to measure oh and o 2 exposure during ep spe based on the concentration curve of o3 and the depletion curves of p cba and dep observed during ep spe processes o3 oh and o 2 exposures during the two processes were obtained using eqs 4 6 and shown in fig 6 the exposures of o3 and oh increase with the duration of whole process of ep spe but o 2 exposure reaches a relatively stable level after 12 min manifesting that o 2 is consumed in the system eqs 17 19 guo et al 2021c 17 o 3 o 2 o 3 o 2 k 1 1 6 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 18 o

oh to o 3 exposure ratio of o 2 to o 3 exposure and ratio of o 2 to oh exposure have been defined as r ct r so and r sh respectively eqs 20 22 similar observations have been reported in previous studies elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021c because the r ct r so and r sh are constant and independent of the reaction time they also represent the ratios of transient o 3 oh and o 2 concentrations at any time during ep spe process elovitz and von gunten 1999 guo et al 2021b as shown in fig 6 c the r ct r so and r sh values were 2 48 1 0 9 2 59 1 0 7 and 104 4 during ep spe process respectively based on the constant r ct and r so values and o 3 concentrations observed the evolutions of oh and o 2 concentrations during the ep spe are modelled using eqs 21 and 22 and shown in fig 6 d 20 r ct oh dt o 3 dt oh o 3 21 r so o 2 dt o 3 dt o 2 o 3 22 r sh o 2 dt oh dt o 2 oh fig 6 d shows oh and o 2 concentrations remain constantly during the ep spe process over the entire reaction period the transient concentrations of o 3 oh and o 2 were 0 33 8 11 1 0 10 and 8 47 1 0 8 mmol l 1 table s5 respectively meanwhile the transient concentration of o 2 was 104 4 times higher than that of oh the higher amounts of o 2 compared to oh can be explained by the larger generation rates than consumption rates eqs 23 25 kishimoto et al 2005 the model simulated attenuation process correlates well with the experimentally measured values for both processes fig s8 this confirmed that the calculated values of oh and o 2 concentrations were accurate and the kinetics calculation was feasible consequently the main radical produced in the ep spe system is o 2 these simulation results agree with the epr analysis fig 1 c e 23 o 3 oh o 2 ho 2 k 1 3 0 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 24 oh o 3 o 2 ho 2 k 2 5 0 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 25 oh oh h 2 o 2 k 3 5 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 according to the analysis of the three systems ep spe cep nas and cep as in section 3 3 above the varied dmp degradation and mineralization in different systems may be resulted from the different amounts of oxidative species therefore the variations of major oxidative species o 3 oh and o 2 in control systems were also investigated as shown in fig 7 e and f r ct r so and r sh are 2 37 1 0 9 1 28 1 0 7 and 54 0 in cep nas respectively while they are 3 36 1 0 9 1 37 1 0 7 and 40 8 in cep as respectively thus the transient concentrations of o 3 oh and o 2 were calculated to be 0 34 8 05 1 0 10 and 4 36 1 0 8 mmol l 1 in cep nas respectively and 0 32 1 09 1 0 9 and 4 43 1 0 8 mmol l 1 in cep as respectively table s5 obviously the concentrations of the radicals in the two control systems have changed as different reactions caused by different electrode polarizations owing to different cell voltages 8 2 v in cep as system 30 2 v in cep nas system and 4 8 v in ep spe system for instance the main reaction was four electron reduction of o2 into h2o eq 14 in cep as system while the h2 evolution reaction eq 15 occurred in the cep nas system the reaction of generating h2o2 by the two electron reduction of o2 at cathode was inhibited fig s9 which results in a decrease in the content of o 2 eq 10 therefore the transient concentration of o 2 in cep as system 4 43 1 0 8 mmol l 1 and cep nas system 4 36 1 0 8 mmol l 1 were much lower than that in ep spe system 8 47 1 0 8 mmol l 1 however the transient concentration of oh only changed slightly 1 09 1 0 9 mmol l 1 in cep as system 8 05 1 0 10 mmol l 1 in cep nas system and 8 11 1 0 10 mmol l 1 in cep nas system table s5 because oh could also be produced by o 3 eqs 18 and 19 which would be produced directly at cathode in high cell voltage eq 26 xia et al 2017 this may be the possible reason for the different dmp degradation and mineralization in the two control groups 26 o 3 e o 3 3 5 effects of variety of spes and plasticizers on ep spe performance for further confirmation of the performances of ep spe system for wastewater treatment decomposition tests of different plasticizers were carried out in the ep spe system as shown in fig 8 a all the tested plasticizers can be degraded completely in 30 min and the degradation rates of 2 cp pe dep and dmp were 0 959 0 907 0 153 and 0 485 min 1 respectively due to the different second order rate constants of reactive species with the organic compounds table 2 in addition the mineralization rates of the organic pollutants reached above 80 except dep at 20 24 fig 8 b overall the ep spe system exhibited high degradation and mineralization efficiencies of plasticizers according to the previous research we also evaluated the contribution of ros to plasticizers we estimated the relative contributions of oh reaction f oh o3 oxidation f o 3 and o 2 oxidation f o 2 to plasticizers abatement using eqs 27 29 fig s10 the results revealed that o3 made the greatest contribution to 2 cp and pe degradation while oh is the predominant contributor to dep and dmp degradation

optimal spe the influence of different spes on the performance of ep system was also tested four spes nafion n324 nafion n438 nafion n117 and nafion n115 were selected for comparative tests and their properties are listed in table s6 as shown in fig 9 a nafion n324 achieved the best performance in dmp decomposition with the fastest k obs 0 486 mi n 1 degradation rate and highest mineralization of dmp in 60 min 90 fig 9 b due to its lowest resistivity table s6 although nafion n117 and nafion n438 had similar resistivity the rigidity of nafion n117 was worse than that of nafion n438 which made it difficult for anode and cathode to fit tightly with spe fig s11 thus increasing the voltage and energy consumption 3 5 vs 2 7 kwh m 3 fig 9 b despite that all four spes exhibited excellent performances 3 6 effects of water matrices on dmp degradation and mineralization by ep spe process in evaluation of the application potential of ep spe processes decomposition of dmp in ep spe system was carried out in real water samples of yangtze river east lake secondary effluent and groundwater as shown in fig 10 a the degradation of dmp could reach above 98 in the different natural waters within 30 min and the rate constants of dmp in the yangtze river east lake secondary effluent and groundwater were 0 420 0 335 0 454 and 0 466 min 1 respectively meanwhile the mineralization rates of dmp in the four real water matrices were 31 31 26 58 26 53 and 82 18 respectively fig 10 b among them the effect of chloride was negligible due to its low concentration yao et al 2019 while hco 3 k oh hco 3 8 5 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 might quench the hydroxyl radical to result in less amount of reactive species leading to a poor oxidation efficiency of plasticizer moreover the total organic carbon values toc were 58 55 86 9 53 75 and 19 5 mg l 1 in yangtze river east lake secondary effluent and groundwater respectively the dissolved organic pollutants dom and dmp compete with the produced radicals in the system thus weakening the dmp mineralization therefore the treatment efficiency of dmp in real water was highly dependent on the background matters the lower the concentration of bicarbonate and dom the higher removal rate of plasticizers the results suggest that the promising ep spe system is highly efficient to eliminate the plasticizers in water especially in groundwater 3 7 stability tests in practical applications the stability of the system is of great significance the stability of ep spe was therefore evaluated through cycles of dmp degradation as described in figs 11 and s12 dmp removal efficiency remained 100 and the degradation rate decreased by 8 7 from 0 537 min 1 to 0 490 min 1 after 15 runs indicating that the ep spe system exhibited obvious advantages in dmp degradation including high removal efficiency constant degradation rates and high stability 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that e peroxone combined with spe ep spe system is promising for efficient removals of plasticizers dmp can be effectively degraded and mineralized by the ep spe processes under a variety of tested conditions the kinetic calculations based on probes p cba and dep revealed that the ratios among o3 oh and o 2 concentrations remain almost constant over the entire reaction time in the ep spe system thus the transient concentrations of oh and o 2 can be calculated based on the detected o 3 concentrations and relative contributions of the various reactive species to plasticizers decomposition can be quantified even though the concentrations of o 2 in ep spe system was two orders of magnitude higher than oh the reaction rate of the plasticizer with o 2 is quite low compared to that with oh so oh still plays a dominant role in plasticizer degradation what is more the novel ep spe system shows a lower energy consumption and better mineralization than cep as system thus the ep spe system provides a promising technique for the control and rapid purification of plasticizers in the real wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
