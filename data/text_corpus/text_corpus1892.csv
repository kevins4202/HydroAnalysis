9460,volumetric soil water content vswc monitoring is an important aspect of environmental monitoring of farmland accurate and real time determination of the vswc is important for crop drought stress diagnosis and smart irrigation image technology is commonly used in agricultural information technology based on image technology we simulated the optimal frequency of the sensors to automatically collect vswc data thereby solving the problems of data redundancy and data analysis difficulties in real time monitoring in this study a cotton field under mulched drip irrigation in 2018 was utilised as the research subject 5te sensors were arranged on the soil profile of the cotton field using the grid method and voxler and surfer software was used to model the vswc data and draw contour maps image processing technology image greyscale and image similarity comparison was employed to determine the image algorithm suitable for contour map pre processing and the best time period for vswc monitoring these results indicated that the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation clahe greyscale algorithm is a suitable pre processing algorithm for processing contour maps using image processing technology and the best 5te sensor data monitoring time period is every 10 h this conclusion provides a theoretical reference for vswc monitoring and water management in production keywords image processing technology volumetric soil water content contour map monitor time period optimisation 1 introduction volumetric soil water content vswc is a basic consideration for crop growth and development and plays an important role in plant photosynthesis respiration transpiration and mineral transport real time monitoring of the vswc plays an important role in crop drought warning precision irrigation and yield estimation abioye et al 2020 sadri et al 2020 the rapid acquisition of crop water demand information is the basis of intelligent diagnosis and precision irrigation and real time vswc and plant water status monitoring can effectively obtain crop water demand information in real time han et al 2014 vera et al 2019 real time vswc monitoring can help managers develop irrigation plans and achieve intelligent irrigation management vera et al 2019 okasha et al 2021 currently real time monitoring of vswc is mainly carried out using sensors radiation methods e g neutron moisture meters nmm and remote sensing thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 yuen et al 2000 evett 2003 kibria et al 2021 the nmm is accurate however it is expensive contains radioactive material and is seldom used because of safety concerns robock 2003 the limitations of remote sensing include coarse spatial resolution 9 60 km grid cells shallow depth of vswc measurement approximately the top 5 cm of the soil column and low accuracy for rougher surfaces peng et al 2017 sahaar et al 2022 thus it is not practical for on going farm management therefore sensors have been widely used to monitor vswc in agriculture there are four main types of medium sensors to measure vswc time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr or capacitance time domain transmissiometry tdt and amplitude domain reflectometry adr incrocci et al 2020 furthermore fdr has the advantages of no maintenance requirements simple installation accurate measurements and low cost fares and polyakov 2006 its probe can also be connected to traditional data collectors which perform well in the automatic and continuous monitoring of vswc therefore fdr is the most common class of dielectric sensors used for smart farmland vswc monitoring thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 the 5te sensor 70 mhz decagon devices pullman wa usa fdr type is important for vswc monitoring pardossi et al 2009 these sensors make use of microwave measurement technology to measure the vswc by measuring the relative dielectric constant of the soil which can provide accurate field vswc measurements dobriyal et al 2012 zemni et al 2019 they have the advantages of automatic monitoring and simple operation and can be measured by directly connecting to the data collector vaz et al 2013 however studies have found that the dielectric constant measured by 5te sensors changes with temperature and dielectric loss occurs when measuring the dielectric constant of electrically charged soil clay or soil with high salinity bittelli et al 2008 therefore different soil types need to be calibrated before using 5te sensors because of the different physical chemical and biological characteristics of the soil kodešová et al 2011 specifically 5te sensors are more sensitive to salt and the conductivity of soil under high salt conditions affects the 5te sensors measurement accuracy visconti et al 2014 zemni et al 2019 in previous studies 5te sensors have mainly been used as a platform for vswc monitoring baram et al 2016 gamage et al 2019 but there have been few reports regarding their data collection and processing processes the conventional vswc monitoring interval is generally set to be measured every minute or hour but data acquisition is uninterrupted and real time liu et al 2020 so the amount of data is substantial this requires a more stringent vswc data processing and analysis conventional processing and analysis methods cannot fully and deeply analyse the data previous studies have indicated that sensors are placed in specific spatial areas to collect vswc data at key time nodes or growth periods vswc data were analysed based on geostatistics and the spatial variability of vswc was explored liu et al 2005 li and huang 2016 liu et al 2020 therefore reasonable processing and analysis of the real time data collected by the 5te sensor has become the key to using data to serve production and solve practical problems thus it is necessary to study the 5te sensor vswc monitoring time interval optimisation program image technology has become increasingly widely used in agriculture due to its advantages such as high speed high efficiency and precision saxena et al 2014 however the application of image processing to the analysis and processing of vswc data is new vswc analysis using image technology focused on the inversion of soil surface moisture by using remote sensing or satellite image modelling loew et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 or using a camera or unmanned aerial vehicles uav equipped with thermal infrared to obtain the digital processing of soil surface photos by extracting the average grey value and other characteristic image parameters and vswc measurement value modelling to predict surface vswc wang et al 2018 chang and hsu 2018 previous research mainly focused on monitoring surface vswc and monitoring of deep vswc using vswc imaging technology has not been systematically reported previous studies have shown that vswc has spatial variability after the vswc data collected by the grid method are interpolated based on the principles of geostatistics a contour map of the spatial distribution of vswc can be obtained liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 thus it is feasible to identify and analyse the characteristic information of the vswc contour map through image technology image processing is a technology that uses a computer to process image information in image analysis the quality of the image directly affects the design of the recognition algorithm and the accuracy of the effect hence before image analysis feature extraction segmentation matching and recognition etc pre processing is necessary förstner 2000 akram et al 2010 and its methods include greyscale geometric transformation and image enhancement thence choosing an appropriate pre processing algorithm in the experiment is the key point for image technology to identify and analyse the characteristic information of the vswc contour map based on the purposes described above this study explores the optimal time node for 5te vswc sensing observations as an example vswc data during the entire cotton growth period were collected by burying 5te sensors in the soil of a cotton field the data were analysed to achieve the following goals 1 to propose a suitable vswc contour map image processing algorithm and construct a suitable and efficient data analysis process and 2 to determine a reasonable time interval for data collection reduce the frequency of observations under the premise of ensuring the accuracy of vswc measurements and achieve energy savings and efficient data analysis 2 materials and

cm depths the soil cores were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h the mass of the soil dried in the oven was then divided by the core volume to calculate soil bulk density saturated moisture refers to the maximum capacity of soil to hold water including capillary and non capillary pores when all soil pores are filled with water under natural conditions according to the wilcox method wilcox 1951 stainless steel coring rings were used to collect standard soils from the study site after soaking the standard soil in water for 24 h it was directly dried at 105 c until the weight of the soil

american saline soil laboratory the soil moisture when the soil water suction was 33 kpa was regarded as the field capacity and the soil moisture corresponding to a water suction of 1500 kpa was regarded as the permanent wilting point 2 3 experimental design cotton 619 was selected as the experimental variety and the experimental treatment was set to drip irrigation with plastic mulches and the cotton planting and drip irrigation method of one film three pipes and three rows fig 1 a disposable single wing labyrinth drip irrigation belt was selected with specifications of φ 16 dripper spacing of 30 cm maximum flow of dripper of 3 0 l h 1 and working pressure of 0 1 mpa a 5te sensor was used as a vswc monitoring instrument and the sensors were arranged underground in a grid method fig 2 before the experiment winter and spring irrigations were carried out and the irrigation quota was 1500 m3 hm 2 the irrigation quota of drip irrigation cotton was set at 25 35 mm in the

dm s 1 the water requirement of cotton in the experimental region was 726 22 810 22 mm wang et al 2016 the remaining field management measures were consistent with the local conventional fields 2 4 5te sensor calibration 5te sensors can output soil permittivity k a apparent soil electrical conductivity ec a and temperature under high salinity conditions high ec a level the permittivity measurement deviates with the increase in ec a especially in sensors with frequencies below 200 mhz kargas et al 2017 additionally according to robinson et al 1999 it can be accurately measured by introducing the ec a effect and the calibration model formula 1 can adapt to a high ec a level 2 5 ds m 1 1 k ac k a 0 628 ec a where k ac denotes the corrected permittivity using this formula we can eliminate the influence of ec a 2 5 data collection and processing 2 5 1 data collection the data acquisition motherboard for automatic vswc monitoring in this experiment was developed by the smart cotton agriculture innovation team at the cotton research institute of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences the data were stored in the cloud the monitoring time was from 0 00 h on 18 may to 23 00 h on 22 september the total amount of original vswc data collected was 3024 30 excluding the time stamps 2 5 2 data processing fig 3 shows a flow chart of data processing the original data were

image the processing with the highest accuracy and smallest observation frequency was obtained 2 6 calculation method 2 6 1 conversion k ac to vswc 5te sensors are calibrated to accurately determine the permittivity in the range of 1 air to 80 water by the manufacturer before delivery according to the topp equation topp et al 1980 the soil dielectric constant collected by 5te sensors are converted to vswc at the measured site thus 2 vswc 4 3 10 6 k ac 3 5 5 10 6 k ac 2 2 92 10 2 k ac 5 3 10 2 where k ac is the corrected permittivity 2 6 2 image greyscale algorithm greyscale images can represent most of the information in an image with less data information which can save memory and increase the computational speed of the computer these images are often used for pre processing in most image processing algorithms many scholars have performed considerable research on greyscale colour images ĉadík 2008 benedetti et al 2012 depending on whether the mapping function in an algorithm is applied to all pixels in the image algorithms can be divided into global mapping local mapping and hybrid methods based on research and data searches in this research study four greyscale algorithms namely luminance color2gray limited contrast adaptive histogram equalisation clahe and contrast preserving decolourisation cp were selected to compare and evaluate greyscale images and comprehensively screen out the best greyscale effect 2 6 2 1 luminance luminance is a linear projection greyscale algorithm based on a red green blue rgb colour space it is a greyscale algorithm based on global mapping it has the advantages of simplicity and speed and can retain the overall information of the image to a certain extent the core principle of the algorithm is to find an optimal linear projection direction in the rgb colour space and convert the colour 3d pixel matrix into a 2d greyscale matrix according to the optimal linear projection direction so that the colour image is converted into a greyscale image hedjam et al 2015 the weights of the r g and b components are based on the formula 3 gray x y r x y 0 299 g x y 0 587 b x y 0 114 2 6 2 2 color2gray when a colour image is converted to a greyscale image important picture features are visually lost the color2gray algorithm reduces loss by preserving the important features of the colour image gooch et al 2005 the principle of the algorithm is to perform a signed chromaticity distance calculation on the ciel a b chromaticity plane and map the chromaticity and brightness changes in the original image onto the greyscale image to create a target image that retains the salient features of the colour image the core of the algorithm is to render the target difference grey value difference of the greyscale image close to the colour difference σ i e the difference in brightness and chroma of the original image using the least squares method this formula is expressed as follows 4 crunch x α tanh x α 5 v θ cos θ sin θ 6 c ij a ij b ij 7 δ α θ ij l ij l ij crunch c ij crunch c ij c ij v θ 0 crunch c ij others where l ij is the difference between the brightness value l of picture pixel i and the surrounding pixel j in the ciel a b space and a ij and b ij are the differences between pixel i and the surrounding pixel j in the a and b channels respectively the difference α is the chromaticity change amount that controls the brightness value of the original image θ determines whether the chromaticity difference will change the brightness difference of the original image on the δa δb chromaticity plane v θ is the normalised vector of θ relative to the axis of δa and δ α θ ij is the target difference between pixel i and the surrounding pixel j 2 6 2 3 limited contrast adaptive histogram equalisation clahe the image histogram is an image grey distribution density function which is an important statistical feature of an image and is used to characterise the brightness distribution in a digital image adaptive histogram equalisation ahe is a transformation algorithm that approximates the output image to a uniform distribution muniyappan et al 2013 compared with the original image the brightness of the image after ahe transformation is significantly improved but the salient area in the image becomes more blurred and the background noise increases clahe is a calculation method used to eliminate noise and improve image contrast compared with the image after the ahe transformation the details of the image after the clahe transformation are more obvious pizer et al 1987 stimper et al 2019 the core of the algorithm is to first divide the image into multiple small areas before processing calculate the histogram of each small area separately and limit the contrast to redistribute each histogram the part that exceeds the histogram clipping limit is evenly distributed to the other parts of the histogram the upper shear limit was obtained as follows 8 β n 1 0 01 α s max 1 l 9 s max u q where n is the sum of pixels in all small areas l is the number of grey levels in each small area α is the cut off coefficient u is the average gray value of each small block q is the mean square error of the cell s max is the maximum allowable slope and β is the upper clipping limit of the histogram for each small area 2 6 2 4 contrast preserving decolourisation cp the cp is a colour image greyscale optimisation algorithm proposed by lu in 2012 lu et al 2012 which aims to limit the spatial pixel interpolation to the maximum extent and allow the appropriate greyscale to be automatically selected to maintain the contrast of the original image it uses a finite multivariate polynomial for mapping and mathematically defines the polynomial space of colour c r g b n times as follows 10 n span r d 1 g d 2 b d 3 d i 0 1 2 d 1 d 2 d 3 n where n is the polynomial space generated by the series of monomials therefore the mapping function is expressed as 11 f r g b i w i m i where m i is the base of the ith term of polynomial n and w i is the weight of the corresponding monomial the mapping function is uniquely determined by weight w i for example when n 2 the total number of w i s is nine and the mapping function is a linear combination of elements in r g b rg rb gb r2 g2 b2 therefore the interpolation difference between the two grey pixels x and y is determined by parameter w i in addition w i is expressed as 12 e w x y n α x y exp i w i l i x y δ x y 2 2 σ 2 1 α x y exp i w i l i x y δ x y 2 2 σ 2 where l i x y can be expressed as m ix m iy and δ x y can be expressed as l x l y 2 a x a y 2 b x b y 2 which represents the colour contrast of the two pixels x and y in the ciel a b colour space when r x r y and g x g y and b x b y α x y 1 otherwise α x y 1 therefore the e w function was minimised and the w i parameter set was determined 2 6 3 evaluation of converting a colour image to a greyscale image evaluation of the effect of converting colour images into greyscale images can be divided into subjective and objective evaluations subjective evaluation implements a 5 point quality evaluation system this method is simple and intuitive however because the observer s personal factors may cause great uncertainty in the observed result the evaluation result is highly subjective therefore this experiment objectively evaluated the image quality of the colour image converted to a greyscale image by calculating the average value standard deviation entropy average gradient and edge intensity of the image specifically the average value of the image reflects its brightness and the larger the average value the greater the brightness of the image the standard deviation of the image reflects the degree of dispersion between the image pixel and mean values and the larger the standard deviation the better the image quality the entropy of the image is expressed as the average number of bits of the image grey level set which describes the average information amount of the image source and is the aggregation feature of the image grey level distribution the larger the entropy is the greater the value levels that the image contains the average gradient reflects the sharpness and textural changes in an image the larger the average gradient the clearer the image the edge of an image refers to a collection of pixels with changes in the grey level of the surrounding pixels the outline of the target can be drawn through an edge this is the most basic feature of an image and contains rich internal information for identification edge density refers to 2d randomness the edge density function is a variable x y pixel with respect to x or y the larger the value the more obvious are the edge details of the image 2 6 4 principles of image similarity calculation 2 6 4 1 cosine similarity cosine similarity refers to the use of the cosine of the angle between vectors as a measure of the difference between two individuals ye et al 2010 an image is a function of space which can be expressed as a vector and the cosine distance between the vectors is calculated to characterise the similarity between the two pictures assuming that pictures a and b can be represented as two n dimensional vectors a is a 1 a 2 a n and b is b 1 b 2 b n then the cosine of the angle θ between a and b is 13 cosine similarity cos θ a b a b i 1 n a i b i i 1 n a i 2 i 1 n b i 2 when the similarity between pictures a and b is high the angle is close to 0 and the cosine value is close to 1 2 6 4 2 structural similarity index ssim ssim is an evaluation index that comprehensively measures image similarity from three aspects brightness contrast and structural similarity wang et al 2004 according to this definition the value range of the ssim is 1 1 as the value approaches 1 the degree of similarity between the images increases assuming that there are images x and y the structural similarity between the two pictures is 14 s sim x y l x y α c x y β s x y γ where α β and γ represent the importance of the corresponding functions in the ssim and they are all greater than 0 constants l x y c x y and s x y are images x and y respectively the brightness contrast and structure comparison functions of the three functions are defined as follows 15 l x y 2 x y c 1 x 2 y 2 c 1 16 c x y 2 σ x σ y c 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 c 2 17 s x y σ xy c 3 σ x σ y c 3 where x and y are the average grey values of images x and y respectively σ x and σ y are the variances of images x and y respectively σ xy is the covariance of images x and y and c 1 c 2 and c 3 are constants the function is to prevent the denominator from becoming zero so it can be defined as 18 c i k i l 2 where k i i 1 2 3 represents a constant and l represents the greyscale range of the image to simplify the calculation process in actual engineering calculations it is often assumed that α β γ 1 and c 3 c 2 2 therefore the ssim formula can be expressed as 19 ssim x y 2 x y c 1 x 2 y 2 c 1 2 σ xy c 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 c 2 3 results 3 1 greyscale of the spatial distribution map of vswc compared to the original image the image processed by different greyscale algorithms can retain its information but there were obvious differences in image brightness contrast and sharpness fig 4 the greyscale image processed by the cp algorithm was the best in terms of brightness and the contrast between the light and dark parts was the most obvious the brightness level of the clahe algorithm was lower than that of the cp algorithm the clarity was the best and the detailed texture was the most obvious the color2gray algorithm was processed and the brightness of the greyscale image was the darkest which can effectively retain the global contrast of the original image however the contrast in local details was not obvious and the sharpness was also poor the luminance algorithm had a higher sharpness than the color2gray algorithm but the contrast between the light and dark parts was not obvious the overall grey value of the image had a low span 3 2 objective evaluation of the impact of different greyscale algorithms on image quality the basic feature statistics based on different greyscale algorithms were calculated table 2 the brightness of the image pre processed by the clahe and luminance algorithms is similar and the image pre processed by the cp algorithm had the highest brightness the pre processed image quality of the clahe algorithm was the best followed by the luminance cp and color2gray algorithms the two clahe and color2gray algorithms had the largest set of image grey values and the image contains the smallest set of grey values after the cp and luminance algorithms were processed the image pre processed using the clahe algorithm exhibited the highest sharpness and obvious texture changes the edge intensity of the image pre processed by the clahe algorithm was 4 09 which was higher than that of the luminance and cp algorithms indicating that the edge details of the image processed by this algorithm were more obvious 3 3 comparison of vswc monitoring accuracy in different time nodes fig 5 a shows the changes in image similarity between the different processing methods and ck after pre processing using the luminance greyscale algorithm the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between different treatments exhibited the same changing trend as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and the control showed three peaks which appeared during the t4 t8 and t13 treatments the similarity values were 99 2 99 4 and 98 8 and 99 1 99 6 and 99 3 respectively further significant multiple comparisons were made on t8 which has the highest similarity to ck processing and it was found that t8 processing under the two image similarity comparison algorithms was not significantly different from t9 processing but it was significantly different from the other processing methods fig 5b shows the change in image similarity between different processing methods and ck after pre processing by the color2gray greyscale algorithm which is consistent with the comparison result of image similarity after pre processing by the luminance greyscale algorithm the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between different treatments exhibited the same trend as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and the control showed a three peak change with peaks appearing in the t4 t8 and t13 treatments the values were 99 0 99 5 and 98 7 and 99 1 99 6 and 98 8 respectively further significant multiple comparisons were made on t8 with the highest similarity to ck processing and it was found that the similarity of the t8 processing method under the two image similarity comparison algorithms was significantly higher than that of the other processing methods fig 5c shows the change in image similarity between the different processing methods and ck after pre processing using the clahe greyscale algorithm the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between different treatments showed the same change trend between treatments as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and control presented a double peak first increasing then decreasing then increasing and finally decreasing with peaks in the t4 and t9 treatments at 88 4 88 3 99 4 and 99 5 respectively furthermore the two treatments with the highest similarity to the ck treatment t4 and t9 were compared the differences between the t4 treatment and t5 t6 and t9 were not significant and the differences between the t9 treatment and t8 were not significant fig 5d shows the change in image similarity between different processing methods after cp greying algorithm pre processing and ck comparison which is consistent with the image similarity comparison result after clahe greying algorithm pre processing the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between the different treatments demonstrated the same trend as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and control showed a double peak and the peaks appeared in the t4 and t9 treatments 87 3 88 0 99 9 and 99 9 respectively furthermore a significant multiple comparison of the two treatments t4 and t9 with the highest similarity to the ck treatment was carried out and it was found that there were significant differences between the t4 treatment and the other treatments except for the t9 treatment there was no significant difference from the t8 treatment and the other treatments showed significant differences 3 4 the influence of the clahe algorithm on the similarity data of the vswc contour map after pre processing the vswc contour map using clahe greyscale this study used the ssim and cosine similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity of each time contour map between the experimental and control group each batch treatment contained 3024 data points as shown in fig 6 the similarity value of the image processed by the clahe algorithm in the ssim and cosine similarity algorithm calculations is mostly within the normal range there are fewer outliers and they are concentrated on the side of the smaller value i e left skewed at the same time compared with the ssim algorithm the processing similarity calculated by the cosine similarity algorithm is higher it is more concentrated in different processing methods and its outlier data points are also higher than those of the ssim algorithm this indicates that the ssim algorithm as an image similarity comparison algorithm is more sensitive than the cosine similarity algorithm when comparing contour maps 4 discussion 4 1 image description of the spatial temporal variability in the vswc the vswc is an important factor that affects crop growth maintaining a proper vswc is conducive to achieving high yield quality and efficiency for crops soil moisture has variability in the time and space domains zhang et al 2019 isham et al 2005 mälicke et al 2019 which helps to understand the variability of soil characteristics and irrigation requirements of farmland and time variability helps to predict the next irrigation pandey and pandey 2010 with the help of spatial statistics new ideas can be provided to study the temporal and spatial heterogeneity and patterns of vswc das and mohanty 2006 korres et al 2015 liu et al 2006 and zhang et al 2017 used kriging interpolation on vswc data to draw contour maps which intuitively described spatiotemporal changes in the vswc pandey and pandey 2010 drew the depth of irrigated fields up to 60 cm for soil moisture stratification a contour map was used to show the characteristics of water changes in the farmland before and after irrigation the vswc contour map represents information on vswc variability at a specific time and has been widely used in previous studies based on the contour map representing the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of vswc during the entire growth period of the soil cotton field this study proposes the use of image processing technology to extract and identify the characteristic information of the vswc contour map in this study the author found through a comparison of image similarity algorithms that the similarity algorithm between the images that are closer in time is higher and there is no significant difference the similarity of images that are far apart in time is low and there are significant differences the results show that the image algorithm is credible for identifying the accuracy of the vswc contour map and is a reliable method 4 2 the influence of greyscale algorithm pre processing on the image quality of the vswc contour map image processing technology has made great progress in the application of crop identification and classification pest identification and classification agricultural product classification crop yield estimation and plant phenotype identification barbedo et al 2013 beron et al 2020 singh et al 2018 the algorithm is the core of image processing technology and its research depth directly affects the development of image processing technology as the pre processing of most image processing the greyscale algorithm is particularly important for different types of images in previous studies according to whether the mapping function in an algorithm can be applied to all pixels of the whole image all current greyscale algorithms are divided into the global mapping method local mapping method and hybrid method the global mapping greyscale method can better preserve the global structure information e g luminance color2gray but because all pixels use the same mapping method the resulting image will be smoothed and a lot of detail information will be lost hedjam et al 2015 gooch et al 2005 the local mapping greyscale algorithm pays too much attention to local information e g clahe which leads to the inconspicuous global structure and the serious loss of information in the image as well as halo and noise enhancement pizer et al 1987 stimper et al 2019 and the hybrid mapping greyscale algorithm maintains both the global structural information e g cp and the local contrast information lu et al 2012 the general analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of vswc requires professional geostatistical software which increases the difficulty of nonprofessional operations liu et al 2020 oldak et al 2002 the image processing technology proposed by the author to analyse the contour map of the spatial distribution of vswc is a new idea that has been verified and has exhibited good results in this paper in smart agriculture the greyscale algorithm is the basis of image processing technology kanan and cottrell 2012 and the main image processing algorithms in this study must convert the greyscale contour image into a single channel image before running for this reason luminance color2gray clahe and cp algorithms were chosen as greyscale algorithms the research results show that the brightness quality sharpness contrast and local contour details of the vswc contour map drawn by surfer software after the greyscale conversion of the clahe algorithm are better than those of the luminance color2gray and cp algorithms and can maximise the retention of the original image information however the accuracy of these results must be tested and verified during production 4 3 reasonable setting of the monitoring time node of the vswc sensor since williams and baker proved that the vswc was closely related to the dielectric properties of the soil in 1982 williams and baker 1982 the technology of indirectly measuring the vswc by monitoring the soil dielectric constant has achieved rapid development the vswc measurement method based on this principle has gradually become the main method of vswc measurement owing to its advantages of speed accuracy and easy integration slama et al 2019 monitored the vswc content at temporal and spatial levels based on the principle of the dielectric constant to simulate the influence of different brackish water irrigation regimes on root absorption and solute reflux deploying 5te sensors on the soil profile using a spatial grid method can effectively reflect spatial and temporal variations in the vswc related research has been promoted and applied to production previous studies on the use of permittivity for vswc monitoring are still based on spatial distribution and time consumption variation but there are no systematic reports on the application of vswc monitoring in production especially with respect to the optimisation of the time node of vswc observations based on production the time nodes of vswc monitoring based on apparent permittivity were optimised and it was found that the optimal time node of vswc monitoring was once every 10 h in sandy loams of typical inland extremely arid climate regions under slight salt conditions however this conclusion needs to be verified by setting up parallel control treatments in future studies the results of the experiment were based on a sandy loam soil under saline conditions however the accuracy of vswc measurements by 5te sensors is affected by many factors especially soil salinity zemni et al 2019 the soil salt content of the experimental site was 2 1 g kg 1 which represents saline alkali land in saline alkali soils the permittivity measurement of 5te sensors affects the performance of vswc measurements owing to the deviation of high soil conductivity satoh and kakiuchi 2021 therefore the 5te sensor must be calibrated before it is used in saline soils studies have shown that the hilhorst linear model hilhorst et al 2000 mhk model kargas et al 2017 and mhb model bouksila et al 2008 can be used to calibrate the apparent permittivity k a bulk electrical conductivity ec a and temperature measured by the 5te sensor in the laboratory and field thus improving the performance of the 5te sensor in saline alkali soil and reducing the measurement error 5 conclusion in this study by constructing datasets with different time intervals and relying on image processing technology to analyse and evaluate the accuracy of the data reflected by the data at different time intervals it can be concluded that 1 image processing technology can be used as a spatiotemporal contour map of vswc and a feasible means for extracting variability information 2 the greyscale image algorithm pre processed by the clahe algorithm can retain the information of the original image to the greatest extent and the image quality is high thus it can be used as a greyscale pre processing algorithm for the vswc contour map image and 3 the three greyscale algorithms and the two image similarity comparison algorithms in this experiment were calculated the 10 h dataset had the highest similarity with the control group 1 h dataset and the observation rate was the lowest therefore the optimal time monitoring node could be set to collect vswc data every 10 h under the conditions of this experiment cotton field in sandy loam under slight salt conditions in typical inland extremely arid climate regions this conclusion provides a theoretical basis for the use of 5te sensors to monitor changes in vswc and the use of image processing to analyse spatiotemporal changes in vswc optimise the vswc monitoring process and reduce the workload of data processing to provide basic information in agriculture for irrigation

9460,volumetric soil water content vswc monitoring is an important aspect of environmental monitoring of farmland accurate and real time determination of the vswc is important for crop drought stress diagnosis and smart irrigation image technology is commonly used in agricultural information technology based on image technology we simulated the optimal frequency of the sensors to automatically collect vswc data thereby solving the problems of data redundancy and data analysis difficulties in real time monitoring in this study a cotton field under mulched drip irrigation in 2018 was utilised as the research subject 5te sensors were arranged on the soil profile of the cotton field using the grid method and voxler and surfer software was used to model the vswc data and draw contour maps image processing technology image greyscale and image similarity comparison was employed to determine the image algorithm suitable for contour map pre processing and the best time period for vswc monitoring these results indicated that the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation clahe greyscale algorithm is a suitable pre processing algorithm for processing contour maps using image processing technology and the best 5te sensor data monitoring time period is every 10 h this conclusion provides a theoretical reference for vswc monitoring and water management in production keywords image processing technology volumetric soil water content contour map monitor time period optimisation 1 introduction volumetric soil water content vswc is a basic consideration for crop growth and development and plays an important role in plant photosynthesis respiration transpiration and mineral transport real time monitoring of the vswc plays an important role in crop drought warning precision irrigation and yield estimation abioye et al 2020 sadri et al 2020 the rapid acquisition of crop water demand information is the basis of intelligent diagnosis and precision irrigation and real time vswc and plant water status monitoring can effectively obtain crop water demand information in real time han et al 2014 vera et al 2019 real time vswc monitoring can help managers develop irrigation plans and achieve intelligent irrigation management vera et al 2019 okasha et al 2021 currently real time monitoring of vswc is mainly carried out using sensors radiation methods e g neutron moisture meters nmm and remote sensing thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 yuen et al 2000 evett 2003 kibria et al 2021 the nmm is accurate however it is expensive contains radioactive material and is seldom used because of safety concerns robock 2003 the limitations of remote sensing include coarse spatial resolution 9 60 km grid cells shallow depth of vswc measurement approximately the top 5 cm of the soil column and low accuracy for rougher surfaces peng et al 2017 sahaar et al 2022 thus it is not practical for on going farm management therefore sensors have been widely used to monitor vswc in agriculture there are four main types of medium sensors to measure vswc time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr or capacitance time domain transmissiometry tdt and amplitude domain reflectometry adr incrocci et al 2020 furthermore fdr has the advantages of no maintenance requirements simple installation accurate measurements and low cost fares and polyakov 2006 its probe can also be connected to traditional data collectors which perform well in the automatic and continuous monitoring of vswc therefore fdr is the most common class of dielectric sensors used for smart farmland vswc monitoring thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 the 5te sensor 70 mhz decagon devices pullman wa usa fdr type is important for vswc monitoring pardossi et al 2009 these sensors make use of microwave measurement technology to measure the vswc by measuring the relative dielectric constant of the soil which can provide accurate field vswc measurements dobriyal et al 2012 zemni et al 2019 they have the advantages of automatic monitoring and simple operation and can be measured by directly connecting to the data collector vaz et al 2013 however studies have found that the dielectric constant measured by 5te sensors changes with temperature and dielectric loss occurs when measuring the dielectric constant of electrically charged soil clay or soil with high salinity bittelli et al 2008 therefore different soil types need to be calibrated before using 5te sensors because of the different physical chemical and biological characteristics of the soil kodešová et al 2011 specifically 5te sensors are more sensitive to salt and the conductivity of soil under high salt conditions affects the 5te sensors measurement accuracy visconti et al 2014 zemni et al 2019 in previous studies 5te sensors have mainly been used as a platform for vswc monitoring baram et al 2016 gamage et al 2019 but there have been few reports regarding their data collection and processing processes the conventional vswc monitoring interval is generally set to be measured every minute or hour but data acquisition is uninterrupted and real time liu et al 2020 so the amount of data is substantial this requires a more stringent vswc data processing and analysis conventional processing and analysis methods cannot fully and deeply analyse the data previous studies have indicated that sensors are placed in specific spatial areas to collect vswc data at key time nodes or growth periods vswc data were analysed based on geostatistics and the spatial variability of vswc was explored liu et al 2005 li and huang 2016 liu et al 2020 therefore reasonable processing and analysis of the real time data collected by the 5te sensor has become the key to using data to serve production and solve practical problems thus it is necessary to study the 5te sensor vswc monitoring time interval optimisation program image technology has become increasingly widely used in agriculture due to its advantages such as high speed high efficiency and precision saxena et al 2014 however the application of image processing to the analysis and processing of vswc data is new vswc analysis using image technology focused on the inversion of soil surface moisture by using remote sensing or satellite image modelling loew et al 2006 zhou et al 2015 or using a camera or unmanned aerial vehicles uav equipped with thermal infrared to obtain the digital processing of soil surface photos by extracting the average grey value and other characteristic image parameters and vswc measurement value modelling to predict surface vswc wang et al 2018 chang and hsu 2018 previous research mainly focused on monitoring surface vswc and monitoring of deep vswc using vswc imaging technology has not been systematically reported previous studies have shown that vswc has spatial variability after the vswc data collected by the grid method are interpolated based on the principles of geostatistics a contour map of the spatial distribution of vswc can be obtained liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 thus it is feasible to identify and analyse the characteristic information of the vswc contour map through image technology image processing is a technology that uses a computer to process image information in image analysis the quality of the image directly affects the design of the recognition algorithm and the accuracy of the effect hence before image analysis feature extraction segmentation matching and recognition etc pre processing is necessary förstner 2000 akram et al 2010 and its methods include greyscale geometric transformation and image enhancement thence choosing an appropriate pre processing algorithm in the experiment is the key point for image technology to identify and analyse the characteristic information of the vswc contour map based on the purposes described above this study explores the optimal time node for 5te vswc sensing observations as an example vswc data during the entire cotton growth period were collected by burying 5te sensors in the soil of a cotton field the data were analysed to achieve the following goals 1 to propose a suitable vswc contour map image processing algorithm and construct a suitable and efficient data analysis process and 2 to determine a reasonable time interval for data collection reduce the frequency of observations under the premise of ensuring the accuracy of vswc measurements and achieve energy savings and efficient data analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted at the experimental site of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences 40 51 n 81 30e in alar city xinjiang province china in 2018 the study

slightly saline alkali land 2 2 basic physical properties of the soil the basic physical properties of the soil are listed in table 1 soil bulk density was defined as the ratio of oven dried soil mass to unit volume undisturbed soil core samples were collected using a stainless steel coring ring 50 mm internal diameter and 50 mm length from the experimental site at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm depths the soil cores were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h the mass of the soil dried in the oven was then divided by the core volume to calculate soil bulk density saturated moisture refers to the maximum capacity of soil to hold water including capillary and non capillary pores when all soil pores are filled with water under natural conditions according to the wilcox method wilcox 1951 stainless steel coring rings were used to collect standard soils from the study site after soaking the standard soil in water for 24 h it was directly dried at 105 c until the weight of the soil remained unchanged which is known as the oven dry weight the formula used was as follows saturated moisture mass of moist soil mass of oven dried soil mass of oven dried soil soil bulk density 100 field capacity is the point at which the soil water holding capacity reaches its maximum for the entire field permanent wilting point is the moisture content of a soil at which plants wilt and fail to recover when supplied with sufficient moisture and is usually the amount in soil held by a force stronger than 15 bar 4 2 pf or 225 psi field capacity and permanent wilting point were determined by plotting the soil moisture characteristic curve dehydration curve the soil moisture of the undisturbed samples was determined by the centrifuge method cr 21 g hitachi inc under 12 water suction

american saline soil laboratory the soil moisture when the soil water suction was 33 kpa was regarded as the field capacity and the soil moisture corresponding to a water suction of 1500 kpa was regarded as the permanent wilting point 2 3 experimental design cotton 619 was selected as the experimental variety and the experimental treatment was set to drip irrigation with plastic mulches and the cotton planting and drip irrigation method of one film three pipes and three rows fig 1 a disposable single wing labyrinth drip irrigation belt was selected with specifications of φ 16 dripper spacing of 30 cm maximum flow of dripper of 3 0 l h 1 and working pressure of 0 1 mpa a 5te sensor was used as a vswc monitoring instrument and the sensors were arranged underground in a grid method fig 2 before the experiment winter and spring irrigations were carried out and the irrigation quota was 1500 m3 hm 2 the irrigation quota of drip irrigation cotton was set at 25 35 mm in the experiment and the cotton was irrigated 12 times during the growing period in this experiment the salinity of irrigation water was less than 0 5 g l 1 and the electrical conductivity was less than 0 9 dm s 1 the water requirement of cotton in the experimental region was 726 22 810 22 mm wang et al 2016 the remaining field management measures were consistent with the local conventional fields 2 4 5te sensor calibration 5te sensors can output soil permittivity k a apparent soil electrical conductivity ec a and temperature under high salinity conditions high ec a level the permittivity measurement deviates with the increase in ec a especially in sensors with frequencies below 200 mhz kargas et al 2017 additionally according to robinson et al 1999 it can be accurately measured by introducing the ec a effect and the calibration model formula 1 can adapt to a high ec a level 2 5 ds m 1 1 k ac k a 0 628 ec a where k ac denotes the corrected permittivity using this formula we can eliminate the influence of ec a 2 5 data collection and processing 2 5 1 data collection the data acquisition motherboard for automatic vswc monitoring in this experiment was developed by the smart cotton agriculture innovation team at the cotton research institute of the chinese academy of agricultural sciences the data were stored in the cloud the monitoring time was from 0 00 h on 18 may to 23 00 h on 22 september the total amount of original vswc data collected was 3024 30 excluding the time stamps 2 5 2 data processing fig 3 shows a flow chart of data processing the original data were selected every 2 3 23 and 24 h and 23 datasets were reconstructed which were set as t1 t2 t23 and the collected raw data every 1 h were used as a control check ck 3d visualisation modelling of 24 data

the permittivity in the range of 1 air to 80 water by the manufacturer before delivery according to the topp equation topp et al 1980 the soil dielectric constant collected by 5te sensors are converted to vswc at the measured site thus 2 vswc 4 3 10 6 k ac 3 5 5 10 6 k ac 2 2 92 10 2 k ac 5 3 10 2 where k ac is the corrected permittivity 2 6 2 image greyscale algorithm greyscale images can represent most of the information in an image with less data information which can save memory and increase the computational speed of the computer these images are often used for pre processing in most image processing algorithms many scholars have performed considerable research on greyscale colour images ĉadík 2008 benedetti et al 2012 depending on whether the mapping function in an algorithm is applied to all pixels in the image algorithms can be divided into global mapping local mapping and hybrid methods based on research and data searches in this research study four greyscale algorithms namely luminance color2gray limited contrast adaptive histogram equalisation clahe and contrast preserving decolourisation cp were selected to compare and evaluate greyscale images and comprehensively screen out the best greyscale effect 2 6 2 1 luminance luminance is a linear projection greyscale algorithm based on a red green blue rgb colour space it is a greyscale algorithm based on global mapping it has the advantages of simplicity and speed and can retain the overall information of the image to a certain extent the core principle of the algorithm is to find an optimal linear projection direction in the rgb colour space and convert the colour 3d pixel matrix into a 2d greyscale matrix according to the optimal linear projection direction so that the colour image is converted into a greyscale image hedjam et al 2015 the weights of the r g and b components are based on the formula 3 gray x y r x y 0 299 g x y 0 587 b x y 0 114 2 6 2 2 color2gray when a colour image is converted to a greyscale image important picture features are visually lost the color2gray algorithm reduces loss by preserving the important features of the colour image gooch et al 2005 the principle of the algorithm is to perform a signed chromaticity distance calculation on the ciel a b chromaticity plane and map the chromaticity and brightness changes in the original image onto the greyscale image to create a target image that retains the salient features of the colour image the core of the algorithm is to render the target difference grey value difference of the greyscale image close to the colour difference σ i e the difference in brightness and chroma of the original image using the least squares method this formula is expressed as follows 4 crunch x α tanh x α 5 v θ cos θ sin θ 6 c ij a ij b ij 7 δ α θ ij l ij l ij crunch c ij crunch c ij c ij v θ 0 crunch c ij others where l ij is the difference between the brightness value l of picture pixel i and the surrounding pixel j in the ciel a b space and a ij and b ij are the differences between pixel i and the surrounding pixel j in the a and b channels respectively the difference α is the chromaticity change amount that controls the brightness value of the original image θ determines whether the chromaticity difference will change the brightness difference of the original image on the δa δb chromaticity plane v θ is the normalised vector of θ relative to the axis of δa and δ α θ ij is the target difference between pixel i and the surrounding pixel j 2 6 2 3 limited contrast adaptive histogram equalisation clahe the image histogram is an image grey distribution density function which is an important statistical feature of an image and is used to characterise the brightness distribution in a digital image adaptive histogram equalisation ahe is a transformation algorithm that approximates the output image to a uniform distribution muniyappan et al 2013 compared with the original image the brightness of the image after ahe transformation is significantly improved but the salient area in the image becomes more blurred and the background noise increases clahe is a calculation method used to eliminate noise and improve image contrast compared with the image after the ahe transformation the details of the image after the clahe transformation are more obvious pizer et al 1987 stimper et al 2019 the core of the algorithm is to first divide the image into multiple small areas before processing calculate the histogram of each small area separately and limit the contrast to redistribute each histogram the part that exceeds the histogram clipping limit is evenly distributed to the other parts of the histogram the upper shear limit was obtained as follows 8 β n 1 0 01 α s max 1 l 9 s max u q where n is the sum of pixels in all small areas l is the number of grey levels in each small area α is the cut off coefficient u is the average gray value of each small block q is the mean square error of the cell s max is the maximum allowable slope and β is the upper clipping limit of the histogram for each small area 2 6 2 4 contrast preserving decolourisation cp the cp is a colour image greyscale optimisation algorithm proposed by lu in 2012 lu et al 2012 which aims to limit the spatial pixel interpolation to the maximum extent and allow the appropriate greyscale to be automatically selected to maintain the contrast of the original image it uses a finite multivariate polynomial for mapping and mathematically defines the polynomial space of colour c r g b n times as follows 10 n span r d 1 g d 2 b d 3 d i 0 1 2 d 1 d 2 d 3 n where n is the polynomial space generated by the series of monomials therefore the mapping function is expressed as 11 f r g b i w i m i where m i is the base of the ith term of polynomial n and w i is the weight of the corresponding monomial the mapping function is uniquely determined by weight w i for example when n 2 the total number of w i s is nine and the mapping function is a linear combination of elements in r g b rg rb gb r2 g2 b2 therefore the interpolation difference between the two grey pixels x and y is determined by parameter w i in addition w i is expressed as 12 e w x y n α x y exp i w i l i x y δ x y 2 2 σ 2 1 α x y exp i w i l i x y δ x y 2 2 σ 2 where l i x y can be expressed as m ix m iy and δ x y can be expressed as l x l y 2 a x a y 2 b x b y 2 which represents the colour contrast of the two pixels x and y in the ciel a b colour space when r x r y and g x g y and b x b y α x y 1 otherwise α x y 1 therefore the e w function was minimised and the w i parameter set was determined 2 6 3 evaluation of converting a colour image to a greyscale image evaluation of the effect of converting colour images into greyscale images can be divided into subjective and objective evaluations subjective evaluation implements a 5 point quality evaluation system this method is simple and intuitive however because the observer s personal factors may cause great uncertainty in the observed result the evaluation result is highly subjective therefore this experiment objectively evaluated the image quality of the colour image converted to a greyscale image by calculating the average value standard deviation entropy average gradient and edge intensity of the image specifically the average value of the image reflects its brightness and the larger the average value the greater the brightness of the image the standard deviation of the image reflects the degree of dispersion between the image pixel and mean values and the larger the standard deviation the better the image quality the entropy of the image is expressed as the average number of bits of the image grey level set which describes the average information amount of the image source and is the aggregation feature of the image grey level distribution the larger the entropy is the greater the value levels that the image contains the average gradient reflects the sharpness and textural changes in an image the larger the average gradient the clearer the image the edge of an image refers to a collection of pixels with changes in the grey level of the surrounding pixels the outline of the target can be drawn through an edge this is the most basic feature of an image and contains rich internal information for identification edge density refers to 2d randomness the edge density function is a variable x y pixel with respect to x or y the larger the value the more obvious are the edge details of the image 2 6 4 principles of image similarity calculation 2 6 4 1 cosine similarity cosine similarity refers to the use of the cosine of the angle between vectors as a measure of the difference between two individuals ye et al 2010 an image is a function of space which can be expressed as a vector and the cosine distance between the vectors is calculated to characterise the similarity between the two pictures assuming that pictures a and b can be represented as two n dimensional vectors a is a 1 a 2 a n and b is b 1 b 2 b n then the cosine of the angle θ between a and b is 13 cosine similarity cos θ a b a b i 1 n a i b i i 1 n a i 2 i 1 n b i 2 when the similarity between pictures a and b is high the angle is close to 0 and the cosine value is close to 1 2 6 4 2 structural similarity index ssim ssim is an evaluation index that comprehensively measures image similarity from three aspects brightness contrast and structural similarity wang et al 2004 according to this definition the value range of the ssim is 1 1 as the value approaches 1 the degree of similarity between the images increases assuming that there are images x and y the structural similarity between the two pictures is 14 s sim x y l x y α c x y β s x y γ where α β and γ represent the importance of the corresponding functions in the ssim and they are all greater than 0 constants l x y c x y and s x y are images x and y respectively the brightness contrast and structure comparison functions of the three functions are defined as follows 15 l x y 2 x y c 1 x 2 y 2 c 1 16 c x y 2 σ x σ y c 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 c 2 17 s x y σ xy c 3 σ x σ y c 3 where x and y are the average grey values of images x and y respectively σ x and σ y are the variances of images x and y respectively σ xy is the covariance of images x and y and c 1 c 2 and c 3 are constants the function is to prevent the denominator from becoming zero so it can be defined as 18 c i k i l 2 where k i i 1 2 3 represents a constant and l represents the greyscale range of the image to simplify the calculation process in actual engineering calculations it is often assumed that α β γ 1 and c 3 c 2 2 therefore the ssim formula can be expressed as 19 ssim x y 2 x y c 1 x 2 y 2 c 1 2 σ xy c 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 c 2 3 results 3 1 greyscale of the spatial distribution map of vswc compared to the original image the image processed by different greyscale algorithms can retain its information but there were obvious differences in image brightness contrast and sharpness fig 4 the greyscale image processed by the cp algorithm was the best in terms of brightness and the contrast between the light and dark parts was the most obvious the brightness level of the clahe algorithm was lower than that of the cp algorithm the clarity was the best and the detailed texture was the most obvious the color2gray algorithm was processed and the brightness of the greyscale image was the darkest which can effectively retain the global contrast of the original image however the contrast in local details was not obvious and the sharpness was also poor the luminance algorithm had a higher sharpness than the color2gray algorithm but the contrast between the light and dark parts was not obvious the overall grey value of the image had a low span 3 2 objective evaluation of the impact of different greyscale algorithms on image quality the basic feature statistics based on different greyscale algorithms were calculated table 2 the brightness of the image pre processed by the clahe and luminance algorithms is similar and the image pre processed by the cp algorithm had the highest brightness the pre processed image quality of the clahe algorithm was the best followed by the luminance cp and color2gray algorithms the two clahe and color2gray algorithms had the largest set of image grey values and the image contains the smallest set of grey values after the cp and luminance algorithms were processed the image pre processed using the clahe algorithm exhibited the highest sharpness and obvious texture changes the edge intensity of the image pre processed by the clahe algorithm was 4 09 which was higher than that of the luminance and cp algorithms indicating that the edge details of the image processed by this algorithm were more obvious 3 3 comparison of vswc monitoring accuracy in different time nodes fig 5 a shows the changes in image similarity between the different processing methods and ck after pre processing using the luminance greyscale algorithm the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between different treatments exhibited the same changing trend as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and the control showed three peaks which appeared during the t4 t8 and t13 treatments the similarity values were 99 2 99 4 and 98 8 and 99 1 99 6 and 99 3 respectively further significant multiple comparisons were made on t8 which has the highest similarity to ck processing and it was found that t8 processing under the two image similarity comparison algorithms was not significantly different from t9 processing but it was significantly different from the other processing methods fig 5b shows the change in image similarity between different processing methods and ck after pre processing by the color2gray greyscale algorithm which is consistent with the comparison result of image similarity after pre processing by the luminance greyscale algorithm the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between different treatments exhibited the same trend as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and the control showed a three peak change with peaks appearing in the t4 t8 and t13 treatments the values were 99 0 99 5 and 98 7 and 99 1 99 6 and 98 8 respectively further significant multiple comparisons were made on t8 with the highest similarity to ck processing and it was found that the similarity of the t8 processing method under the two image similarity comparison algorithms was significantly higher than that of the other processing methods fig 5c shows the change in image similarity between the different processing methods and ck after pre processing using the clahe greyscale algorithm the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between different treatments showed the same change trend between treatments as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and control presented a double peak first increasing then decreasing then increasing and finally decreasing with peaks in the t4 and t9 treatments at 88 4 88 3 99 4 and 99 5 respectively furthermore the two treatments with the highest similarity to the ck treatment t4 and t9 were compared the differences between the t4 treatment and t5 t6 and t9 were not significant and the differences between the t9 treatment and t8 were not significant fig 5d shows the change in image similarity between different processing methods after cp greying algorithm pre processing and ck comparison which is consistent with the image similarity comparison result after clahe greying algorithm pre processing the image similarity comparison algorithm of ssim and cosine similarity between the different treatments demonstrated the same trend as the time node increased the similarity between the treatment and control showed a double peak and the peaks appeared in the t4 and t9 treatments 87 3 88 0 99 9 and 99 9 respectively furthermore a significant multiple comparison of the two treatments t4 and t9 with the highest similarity to the ck treatment was carried out and it was found that there were significant differences between the t4 treatment and the other treatments except for the t9 treatment there was no significant difference from the t8 treatment and the other treatments showed significant differences 3 4 the influence of the clahe algorithm on the similarity data of the vswc contour map after pre processing the vswc contour map using clahe greyscale this study used the ssim and cosine similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity of each time contour map between the experimental and control group each batch treatment contained 3024 data points as shown in fig 6 the similarity value of the image processed by the clahe algorithm in the ssim and cosine similarity algorithm calculations is mostly within the normal range there are fewer outliers and they are concentrated on the side of the smaller value i e left skewed at the same time compared with the ssim algorithm the processing similarity calculated by the cosine similarity algorithm is higher it is more concentrated in different processing methods and its outlier data points are also higher than those of the ssim algorithm this indicates that the ssim algorithm as an image similarity comparison algorithm is more sensitive than the cosine similarity algorithm when comparing contour maps 4 discussion 4 1 image description of the spatial temporal variability in the vswc the vswc is an important factor that affects crop growth maintaining a proper vswc is conducive to achieving high yield quality and efficiency for crops soil moisture has variability in the time and space domains zhang et al 2019 isham et al 2005 mälicke et al 2019 which helps to understand the variability of soil characteristics and irrigation requirements of farmland and time variability helps to predict the next irrigation pandey and pandey 2010 with the help of spatial statistics new ideas can be provided to study the temporal and spatial heterogeneity and patterns of vswc das and mohanty 2006 korres et al 2015 liu et al 2006 and zhang et al 2017 used kriging interpolation on vswc data to draw contour maps which intuitively described spatiotemporal changes in the vswc pandey and pandey 2010 drew the depth of irrigated fields up to 60 cm for soil moisture stratification a contour map was used to show the characteristics of water changes in the farmland before and after irrigation the vswc contour map represents information on vswc variability at a specific time and has been widely used in previous studies based on the contour map representing the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of vswc during the entire growth period of the soil cotton field this study proposes the use of image processing technology to extract and identify the characteristic information of the vswc contour map in this study the author found through a comparison of image similarity algorithms that the similarity algorithm between the images that are closer in time is higher and there is no significant difference the similarity of images that are far apart in time is low and there are significant differences the results show that the image algorithm is credible for identifying the accuracy of the vswc contour map and is a reliable method 4 2 the influence of greyscale algorithm pre processing on the image quality of the vswc contour map image processing technology has made great progress in the application of crop identification and classification pest identification and classification agricultural product classification crop yield estimation and plant phenotype identification barbedo et al 2013 beron et al 2020 singh et al 2018 the algorithm is the core of image processing technology and its research depth directly affects the development of image processing technology as the pre processing of most image processing the greyscale algorithm is particularly important for different types of images in previous studies according to whether the mapping function in an algorithm can be applied to all pixels of the whole image all current greyscale algorithms are divided into the global mapping method local mapping method and hybrid method the global mapping greyscale method can better preserve the global structure information e g luminance color2gray but because all pixels use the same mapping method the resulting image will be smoothed and a lot of detail information will be lost hedjam et al 2015 gooch et al 2005 the local mapping greyscale algorithm pays too much attention to local information e g clahe which leads to the inconspicuous global structure and the serious loss of information in the image as well as halo and noise enhancement pizer et al 1987 stimper et al 2019 and the hybrid mapping greyscale algorithm maintains both the global structural information e g cp and the local contrast information lu et al 2012 the general analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of vswc requires professional geostatistical software which increases the difficulty of nonprofessional operations liu et al 2020 oldak et al 2002 the image processing technology proposed by the author to analyse the contour map of the spatial distribution of vswc is a new idea that has been verified and has exhibited good results in this paper in smart agriculture the greyscale algorithm is the basis of image processing technology kanan and cottrell 2012 and the main image processing algorithms in this study must convert the greyscale contour image into a single channel image before running for this reason luminance color2gray clahe and cp algorithms were chosen as greyscale algorithms the research results show that the brightness quality sharpness contrast and local contour details of the vswc contour map drawn by surfer software after the greyscale conversion of the clahe algorithm are better than those of the luminance color2gray and cp algorithms and can maximise the retention of the original image information however the accuracy of these results must be tested and verified during production 4 3 reasonable setting of the monitoring time node of the vswc sensor since williams and baker proved that the vswc was closely related to the dielectric properties of the soil in 1982 williams and baker 1982 the technology of indirectly measuring the vswc by monitoring the soil dielectric constant has achieved rapid development the vswc measurement method based on this principle has gradually become the main method of vswc measurement owing to its advantages of speed accuracy and easy integration slama et al 2019 monitored the vswc content at temporal and spatial levels based on the principle of the dielectric constant to simulate the influence of different brackish water irrigation regimes on root absorption and solute reflux deploying 5te sensors on the soil profile using a spatial grid method can effectively reflect spatial and temporal variations in the vswc related research has been promoted and applied to production previous studies on the use of permittivity for vswc monitoring are still based on spatial distribution and time consumption variation but there are no systematic reports on the application of vswc monitoring in production especially with respect to the optimisation of the time node of vswc observations based on production the time nodes of vswc monitoring based on apparent permittivity were optimised and it was found that the optimal time node of vswc monitoring was once every 10 h in sandy loams of typical inland extremely arid climate regions under slight salt conditions however this conclusion needs to be verified by setting up parallel control treatments in future studies the results of the experiment were based on a sandy loam soil under saline conditions however the accuracy of vswc measurements by 5te sensors is affected by many factors especially soil salinity zemni et al 2019 the soil salt content of the experimental site was 2 1 g kg 1 which represents saline alkali land in saline alkali soils the permittivity measurement of 5te sensors affects the performance of vswc measurements owing to the deviation of high soil conductivity satoh and kakiuchi 2021 therefore the 5te sensor must be calibrated before it is used in saline soils studies have shown that the hilhorst linear model hilhorst et al 2000 mhk model kargas et al 2017 and mhb model bouksila et al 2008 can be used to calibrate the apparent permittivity k a bulk electrical conductivity ec a and temperature measured by the 5te sensor in the laboratory and field thus improving the performance of the 5te sensor in saline alkali soil and reducing the measurement error 5 conclusion in this study by constructing datasets with different time intervals and relying on image processing technology to analyse and evaluate the accuracy of the data reflected by the data at different time intervals it can be concluded that 1 image processing technology can be used as a spatiotemporal contour map of vswc and a feasible means for extracting variability information 2 the greyscale image algorithm pre processed by the clahe algorithm can retain the information of the original image to the greatest extent and the image quality is high thus it can be used as a greyscale pre processing algorithm for the vswc contour map image and 3 the three greyscale algorithms and the two image similarity comparison algorithms in this experiment were calculated the 10 h dataset had the highest similarity with the control group 1 h dataset and the observation rate was the lowest therefore the optimal time monitoring node could be set to collect vswc data every 10 h under the conditions of this experiment cotton field in sandy loam under slight salt conditions in typical inland extremely arid climate regions this conclusion provides a theoretical basis for the use of 5te sensors to monitor changes in vswc and the use of image processing to analyse spatiotemporal changes in vswc optimise the vswc monitoring process and reduce the workload of data processing to provide basic information in agriculture for irrigation

9461,brackish water drip irrigation bwdi is an effective application to overcome the water scarcity issues and achieve sustainable agriculture development however emitter clogging and soil salinization is inevitable issue in bwdi eventually threatening the environmental pollution and sustainable application of drip irrigation systems therefore this study experimentally assessed the anti clogging efficacy of compounding appropriate types of humic acid ha with conventional fertilizer in bwdi systems bwdis humic acid nitrogen han humic acid phosphate hap humic acid potassium hak were compounded with conventional fertilizers our results revealed compared with conventional fertilizer ck the ha treatments indirectly affected the precipitates and particulate fouling by absorbing the active functional groups and directly decreased the ph calcium and magnesium contents in brackish irrigation water accordingly ha compound fertilizer significantly reduced the fouling content of drip irrigation system and the anti clogging effect became better with the increase of ha application thus based on better anti clogging performance and minimum fertilizer costs our results suggested the han hak integrated fertigation could be an effective selection for bwdis which significantly enhanced the average discharge ratio and christiansen coefficient of nutrient uniformity in bwdis by 16 0 and 19 0 respectively these results might provide a new guideline for the successful application of ha compound fertilizer in bwdis to increase the drip irrigation anti clogging ability and overcome the agricultural non point source pollution issues keywords brackish water humic acid compound fertilizer precipitates fouling particulate fouling emitter clogging drip irrigation system 1 introduction water scarcity will be the world major crisis to meet standard water demands munia et al 2020 particularly in arid areas water scarcity becomes a major constraint restricting the sustainable agriculture development cao et al 2020 the abundant resources of brackish waters is an alternative resource that could be used to overcome the agriculture irrigation demands zhang et al 2013 aliaskari and schafer 2021 although previous studies have demonstrated brackish water can be successfully utilize for agriculture irrigation sharma and minhas 2005 zhu et al 2019 however due to high salinity concentrations brackish water would be detrimental to both the soil environment and crop health zhao et al 2020 and worsening of agricultural environmental safety pulido bosch et al 2018 moreover due to high concentration of chemical constituents brackish water is mostly not recommended for direct application to the irrigation fields wang and shan 2015 at the meantime the high evaporation in arid and semi arid areas increase the soil water upward movement which leads in excessive accumulation of soil soluble salt on the soil surface hassani et al 2021 desalinated saline water plays an important role in alleviating fresh water crises guo et al 2021 multiple desalination technologies could significantly reduce saline water salinity levels by 70 80 anand et al 2021 however the vast infrastructure operating cost and high energy consumption kim et al 2010 srimuk et al 2020 limited its wide range implication for agriculture irrigations and the farmers still prefer the direct application of brackish water without any treatment therefore investigating an alternative and effective irrigation strategy for brackish water application is in urgent need drip irrigation through its enclosed pipeline systems and high frequency supply features allows flexibility in reliable applications of brackish water zhangzhong et al 2019 and reduce the salt stresses in crop root zones liu et al 2019a at meantime the organic soluble fertilizer such as humic acid ha fertilizer has attracted widespread attention directly deliver through the drip irrigation system to the crops root zone the adsorption function of ha functional groups are used to change the ionic adsorption of soil colloid wei and shao 2007 liang et al 2018 and adjustment of soil ph hutchison et al 2001 chen et al 2019 therefore application of ha fertilizer in brackish water drip irrigation is expected to improve the soil environment and salinization issues so far brackish water drip irrigation system bwdis are not been widely promoted in actual agricultural fields high concentration of chemical ions in brackish resulting in chemical precipitation zhangzhong et al 2016 which increased the vulnerability of emitter clogging in bwdis emitter clogging deteriorates the fertigation and irrigation uniformity crop production and rising maintenance cost ribeiro et al 2004 however emitter clogging varies significantly with the variety of applied fertilizer previous studies ma et al 2020 and muhammad et al 2021 reported that the application of acid based phosphate fertilizer i e ammonium polyphosphate and urea phosphate fertilizer in saline waters significantly controlled the emitter clogging similarly the ha fertilizer contains a considerable amount of chelates i e sodium humate and potassium often used as scale inhibitor to prevent the chemical fouling chen et al 2011 feng et al 2019 the presence of ha would reduce the adsorption of phosphate on surface of caco3 fouling and directly prevents the precipitation of calcium and phosphorus compounds perassi and borgnino 2014 in addition benecke et al 2018 stated the application of ha in reverse osmosis desalination process changed the crystal structure of gypsum and significantly delay the precipitation thus weakening the effects of chemical fouling therefore ha fertilizer is expected to be an effective anti clogging fertilizer in bwdis as well as to regulate soil structure and improve the properties of saline soil accordingly compounding of ha fertilizer with conventional fertilizers may alleviate the emitter clogging and increase nutrients uniformity in bwdis in addition the current research advancement on scale inhibition of ha chelators has mainly limited to the industry levels nowack 2002 while the influence of ha fertilizer on emitter clogging in bwdis has not been investigated yet thus an in situ study was conducted to investigate the effects of compounding ha fertilizer with conventional fertilizers under eight different fertigation modes on emitter clogging in bwdis the emitter clogging mechanism fouling mineral composition and distribution characteristics were clarified the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of ha compound fertigation on emitter clogging in bwdis 2 elucidate the anti clogging mechanism of ha compound fertigation 3 determine the appropriate application mode of ha compound fertigationin bwdis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and treatments arrangement a total of eight home designed testing platforms with 15 m long drip laterals was constructed for eight different operating modes fig 1 the emitters were evenly installed along drip laterals having 30 cm spacing interval a homogeneous filtration system consisting the grit chamber sand filter media filtering size 0 9 1 3 mm disc filter 105 µm and screen filters 120 µm were used at the system head a total of 4 type of emitters were used during the experiment having discharge rate of 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 75 l h the geometric parameters of the emitter flow channels are shown in table s1 the testing platforms were arranged with circulating water design the system was operated from july 2019 to october 2019 8 h per day 10 00 am 6 00 pm total of 64 d flushing devices were installed at the end of testing platforms to flush the drip laterals after every eight days with a flushing velocity of 0 45 m s song et al 2017 the study was conducted utilizing brackish groundwater located in experimental station having total dissolved salts tds concentrations of 3000 mg l for each treatment the irrigation water temporarily stored in capped water tanks during the experiment the ph ca2 mg2 k co3 2 hco3 and so4 2 codcr total phosphorus and other parameters of brackish water were tested the ph value was measured by acid base field tests are carried out during the tester manufacture qingdao china type ph1b other indicators were tested by pony testing international group beijing china the irrigation water average parameters are shown in supplemental material table s2 in this experiment conventional fertilizer i e urea monoammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate and ha fertilizer i e humic acid nitrogen humic acid phosphorus and humic acid potassium were mixed with eight different fertilization modes having fertilizer concentration of 300 mg l the detailed arrangement of the experimental treatments are being explained in table 1 and basic information of fertilizers are shown in supplementary material table s3 besides the application of irrigation water and fertilization were done considering the growth period irrigation water and fertilization demands of jujube trees in arid arid semi arid areas li et al 2006 based on the planting period and irrigation and fertilization demands of jujube the testing system was operated every 8 days 64 h equivalent to an annual growth period including 20 3 h of fertilization and 43 7 h of irrigation without fertilization 2 2 emitter hydraulic performance evaluation the outflow of emitters along the drip laterals were tested after every 8 d weighing method was used to assess the emitter outflow the time span for emitter outflow measurements were set up as 3 min each time the head pressure of the testing systems was adjusted to 0 1 mpa before the emitter outflow was tested finally a high precision electronic balance accuracy of 10 4 g was used to weigh the collected outflow of each emitter as this was an outdoor experiment the irrigation water or surrounding temperature could be a key factor to effect emitter outflow thus the irrigation water temperature was monitored every day to eliminate the effects of varied temperature on emitter outflow proposed by pei et al 2013 liu et al 2019b the average discharge variation ratio dra and christiansen of uniformity were calculated to determine the hydraulic performance and emitter li et al 2019 the detailed calculation process is being explained in supplement materials section 1 4 2 3 emitter fouling substances extraction and analysis in order to analyze the composition of fouling substances a total of four sampling events were conducted at 16 d 48 d and 64 d of system operation emitter samples were carefully peel off placed in a zip lock bags and 45 ml of deionized water was added to detach the fouling substance from emitter flow channels using an ultrasonic cleaner for 20 min manufacturer hangzhou farent ultrasonic cleaning co ltd model no gvs 10 l hereafter 15 ml of treated suspension was centrifuged to balance solid residues in bottom of centrifuge tubes after centrifugation the fouling substances were dried at a constant temperature of 60 manufacturer jiangsu aobo technology co ltd model der 232 the dried samples were weighed with a high precision balance manufacturer guangdong juheng precision measurement control co ltd accuracy 10 4 g model ert to obtain the final dry weight dw of fouling substances the obtained solid particles were ground evenly and then scanned with a d8 advance x ray diffractometer manufacturer brook beijing technology co ltd model d8 advance the basic test conditions of the scanning process were utilized previously used by ma et al 2020 and the obtained atlas was analyzed by topas software supporting the x ray diffractometer

variation of drip irrigation testing system hydraulic performance and the accumulated total content of fouling substances are shown in fig 3 see supplementary materials fig s1 and fig s2 for the dynamic changes in dra and cu the results shows that the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the total content of fouling compared with ck treatment the fouling substances in ha compound fertilizer treatments were decreased by 3 64 18 61 mg cm2 which significantly p 0 05 alleviated emitter clogging fig 3a b leads to increase the dra and cu by 4 0 26 0 and 9 0 27 0 respectively different fertilization modes presented significant p 0 05 effects on fouling substance inside the emitters fig 3a b d compared with ck the single type ha compound fertilizer reduced the content of fouling substance by 3 64 10 82 mg cm2 and increased the dra and cu by 4 0 10 0 and 9 0 13 0 respectively the application of integrating two types and three types ha compound fertilizers reduced the fouling substance inside the emitters by 2 67 13 41 mg cm2 and 1 56 5 12 mg cm2 respectively which leads to increase the dra and cu of drip irrigation system by 3 0 12 0 and 2 0 10 0 two types and 10 0 15 0 and 8 0 13 0 three types respectively the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly changed the water quality parameters of bwdi waters see fig 2 compared with ck treatment the application of ha compound fertilizer led to a significant reduction in ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 in brackish water while increased the contents of hco3 the average variation of brackish water quality after the application of ha compound fertilizer which reduced the contents of ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 by 0 4 1 82 22 4 42 8 mg l 14 3 26 1 mg l and 9 3 13 5 mg l 41 8 63 5 mg

categories precipitate fouling and particulate fouling the proportions were ranged between 22 91 39 86 and 60 14 77 09 respectively fig 3d 3 2 variation of precipitates in fouling substances fig 4 shows that the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the precipitate fouling in drip emitters compared with ck the ha compound fertilizer reduced the content calcite dolomite and gypsum by 15 0 40 0 12 0 45 0 and 22 0 84 0 respectively fig 4a f which leads to reduce the total content of precipitates by 20 0 60 0 as well as significant p 0 05 differences in the content of precipitates fouling were found under different fertigation modes on other hand compared with ck the application of single type reduced the precipitate fouling by 20 0 36 0 while integrating two and three types of ha compound fertilizer decreased the fouling substances by 42 0 51 0 60 0 respectively 3 3 variation of particulates in fouling substance the general variation of particulate fouling in total fouling substances are illustrated in fig 5 compared with ck the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the content of clinochlore and muscovite by 5 0 50 0 and 12 0 45 0 respectively while the contents of quartz and anorthite were increased by 8 0 43 0 and 2 0 53 0 respectively thereby the accumulative content of particulate fouling was reduced by 2 0 8 0 in addition compared with the ck the application of single type fertilizer reduced the content of particulate fouling by 2 0 5 0 while integrating two and three type of ha compound fertilizer reduced by 5 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively 3 4 analysis of fouling formation path water quality parameters ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 so4 2 were significantly affected by application of ha compound fertilizer p 0 05 but had no significant effects on codcr total phosphorus and k table s4 the water quality parameters mineral components and drip irrigation hydraulic performance dw dra and cu fig 6a the sem analysis fig 6b shows a significant negative relationship of ha compound fertilizer with water quality β 0 84 p 0 01 the water quality presented significant p 0 05 positive correlation with ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 β 0 79 p 0 01 but a significant negative correlation with hco3 β 0 62 p 0 01 ha compound fertilizer significantly affects the total amount of fouling in bwdis by directly changing water quality indirectly affected precipitate and particulate fouling content in addition a negative significant correlation was observed in between precipitates and particulates fouling 4 discussions 4 1 effect of humic acid compound fertilizer on water quality the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 so4 2 while increased the content of hco3 in brackish water on the one hand ha is rich in a large number of active groups such as acidic and basic groups klucakova 2016 these oxygen containing functional groups determines the ability of ha molecules to have ion exchange groups complexing and dispersing molecular structures khil ko et al 2001 ha reduced the ph value of brackish water and increased the content of h thus reducing the ability of ca2 to combine with hco3 to form caco3 and promoted the ability of co3 2 to convert to hco3 ma et al 2020 as well as ha reduced the ability of ca2 to combine with so4 2 to form caso4 thus the conversion of so4 2 into hso4 was improved in addition ha can form stable soluble complex with ca2 and mg2 which change the dissolution reaction rate of ca2 and mg2 consequently reducing the content of ca2 and mg2 ions in brackish water to avoid the risk of ca2 and mg2 reactions with co3 2 and so4 2 in bw to form carbonate and sulfate promoting the conversion to bicarbonate and bisulfite mak et al 2009 on the other hand ha has a strong adsorption capacity plaschke et al 1999 ca2 and mg2 in brackish water could adsorbed on the surface of ha molecules thus reducing the contents of ca2 mg2 and other constituents in brackish water at the same time the application of ha compound fertilizer introduced a large number of negative charges shao et al 2011 and electrostatic adsorption occurred between the ions with positive charges in brackish water which changed the content of ions in brackish water 4 2 influence of humic acid compound fertilizer on fouling previous studies have reported that the ha will aggravate fouling substances hao et al 2011 lin et al 2015 olafsdottir and wu 2021 mainly due to the anion in ha combine with ca2 mg2 and slight quantity of fe3 and al3 in brackish water to form insoluble compounds in addition the zeta potential of ha colloidal particles is comparatively low resulting in ha flocculate and precipitate quickly and aggravates the fouling zhao et al 2019 in addition ha could form a ha ca complex on material surface and produce a huge amount of caco3 precipitation that leads to clogging cho et al 2019 however the aforementioned conclusions are in contradiction with our results while consistent with chen et al 2011 feng et al 2019 who proposed that ha fertilizers contain high amounts of chelates i e sodium and potassium humates which are often used as scale inhibitors and can effectively prevent precipitation scaling and with perassi and borgnino 2014 who concluded that ha can reduce the adsorption of phosphate on caco3 fouling surfaces and directly prevent the precipitation of calcium and phosphorus compounds moreover it corresponds to the results of benecke et al 2018 who indicated that the application of ha in the reverse osmosis desalination process can change the crystal structure of gypsum and significantly slow down the precipitation thus reducing the fouling content our results demonstrated that the application of ha compound fertilizer effectively reduced the precipitate and particulate fouling in brackish water figs 4 5 this was mainly due to ha compound fertilizer is rich in a large number of active groups klucakova 2016 which changes the crystallization kinetics by affecting brackish water quality choi et al 2018 and avoided the risk of ca2 mg2 reacting with co3 2 so4 2 and hco3 to form caco3 caso4 and camg co3 2 fouling in addition acid groups such as carboxylic acid in ha also have strong adsorption capacity plaschke et al 1999 which adsorbed on the binding site on the surface of fouling particles wada et al 2001 yin et al 2018 however due to the weak adhesion between ions the active cations between electrostatic layers may have a hydrophobic interaction with the ha molecules adsorbed on the dirt surface and thus move yuping et al 2007 lu et al 2020 the coordination exchange between the acid groups of ha and the ca2 and mg2 bonds on the fouling surface can occur thus the crystal structure and morphology of fouling particle change chong and jiang tao 2010 zhang et al 2015 in addition our results show fig 5 that the application of ha compound fertilizer reduces the total quantity of particulate fouling however in the particulates increased the content of silica and anorthite this was might be due to the adsorption of ha where the ha molecules are adsorbed on the surface of silica and anorthite particulates jarvis and majewski 2012 electrostatic attraction could increase the flocculation and settling strength of quartz and anorthite particulates zhou et al 2018 leading to increase the surface area of silica and anorthite that further promoted the deposition of particulate fouling in fact the application of ha compound fertilizer directly affected the brackish water quality and indirectly influenced the precipitate and particulate fouling by changing the brackish water ph and content of ca2 and mg2 an obvious interactions were found among precipitate and particulate fouling fig 6 this probably due to precipitates provides a large number of binding sites for the particulate deposition meyer 1984 which indirectly increased the content of particulate fouling in addition in addition brackish water contains high concentration of silica subramani et al 2012 thus due to chemical reaction it becomes easy to form silica fouling on pipeline german et al 2019 4 3 engineering applications the complex water quality of brackish irrigation water usually accompanied by salinization which deteriorates soil environment and crop health zhao et al 2020 desalinated brackish water for irrigation is an important means to alleviate the fresh water crisis tian et al 2021 however the higher operating cost of desalination technologies graham et al 2014 aparicio et al 2018 significantly restricted its practical implications in agricultural fields in addition desalinated brackish irrigation water are mostly need for the crops sensitive to salt tolerance generally the brackish water with salinity of 2000 4000 mg l could be directly utilized for agriculture irrigation through drip irrigation systems wei et al 2019 however the emitter clogging reduced irrigation uniformity and associated environmental issues are the other detrimental consequences bwdis thus this study intended to resolve the emitter clogging issue by compounding ha fertilizer with other conventional fertilizers and selecting most suitable fertilizer combination in bwdis our results shows that the compound ha fertilizer significantly improve the bwdis emitter anti clogging ability and nutrient uniformity along the drip laterals besides price is also an important factor in fertilizer selection hindering the promotion of bwdis generally due to excellent properties the price of ha is far higher than conventional fertilizer however compounding ha with conventional fertilizer the ha compound fertilizer will contain both the excellent properties of ha and the conventional fertilizer required for crop growth hence this strongly recommend the development of ha compound fertilizer the price of applying three type and two types ha fertilizers were higher by 31 33 44 19 and 21 65 37 08 than the three and two types of conventional fertilizers respectively on other hand the cost of applying two ha fertilizers was 7 68 18 44 lower than three type ha fertilizers see supplementary materials for detailed prices table s5 china fertilizer website 2019 accessed http www fert cn overall the resistance to soil salinity increasing crop yield and controlling emitter clogging in ha fertilizer are far superior than conventional fertilizer because the increased the variety of ha compound fertilizer improves its anti clogging effects improved by 4 0 27 0 but considering factors such as the price of ha fertilizer and conventional fertilizer as well as the farmers operating costs etc it is strongly recommended that the integrated application mode of han hak and bwdis in saline alkali land should be adopted although this study extensively understands the potential effects of different types of ha compound fertilizer on emitter clogging in bwdis however there are some issue might require further investigation 1 saline irrigation water with different salinity threshold should be considered to further verify the universality of the results 2 this study mainly considered the different modes of compounding ha with conventional fertilizer the emitter anti clogging mechanism under single types of ha fertilizer should investigated in future 5 conclusions 1 compared with conventional water soluble fertilizer the application of ha compound fertilizer reduced the total content of fouling substances in emitter flow channels by 2 92 16 11 mg cm2 which increased the dra and cu by 4 0 26 0 and 9 0 27 0 respectively 2 ha compound fertilizer significantly affected the precipitates and particulates fouling by changing the brackish water ph and the content of ca2 and mg2 at the end of system operation compared with ck the precipitates and particulates fouling were decreased by 20 0 60 0 and 2 0 8 0 respectively 3 based on this study results we strongly recommend the application of two or three types of ha compound fertilizer to improve fertilizer efficiency this recommendation also considered the price of ha fertilizer versus the conventional fertilizer under the balance of various factors we specifically recommend the ha compound fertilizer application pattern of han hak declaration of

han hak integrated fertigation could be an effective selection for bwdis which significantly enhanced the average discharge ratio and christiansen coefficient of nutrient uniformity in bwdis by 16 0 and 19 0 respectively these results might provide a new guideline for the successful application of ha compound fertilizer in bwdis to increase the drip irrigation anti clogging ability and overcome the agricultural non point source pollution issues keywords brackish water humic acid compound fertilizer precipitates fouling particulate fouling emitter clogging drip irrigation system 1 introduction water scarcity will be the world major crisis to meet standard water demands munia et al 2020 particularly in arid areas water scarcity becomes a major constraint restricting the sustainable agriculture development cao et al 2020 the abundant resources of brackish waters is an alternative resource that could be used to overcome the agriculture irrigation demands zhang et al 2013 aliaskari and schafer 2021 although previous studies have demonstrated brackish water can be successfully utilize for agriculture irrigation sharma and minhas 2005 zhu et al 2019 however due to high salinity concentrations brackish water would be detrimental to both the soil environment and crop health zhao et al 2020 and worsening of agricultural environmental safety pulido bosch et al 2018 moreover due to high concentration of chemical constituents brackish water is mostly not recommended for direct application to the irrigation fields wang and shan 2015 at the meantime the high evaporation in arid and semi arid areas increase the soil water upward movement which leads in excessive accumulation of soil soluble salt on the soil surface hassani et al 2021 desalinated saline water plays an important role in alleviating fresh water crises guo et al 2021 multiple desalination technologies could significantly reduce saline water salinity levels by 70 80 anand et al 2021 however the vast infrastructure operating cost and high energy consumption kim et al 2010 srimuk et al 2020 limited its wide range implication for agriculture irrigations and the farmers still prefer the direct application of brackish water without any treatment therefore investigating an alternative and effective irrigation strategy for brackish water application is in urgent need drip irrigation through its enclosed pipeline systems and high frequency supply features allows flexibility in reliable applications of brackish water zhangzhong et al 2019 and reduce the salt stresses in crop root zones liu et al 2019a at meantime the organic soluble fertilizer such as humic acid ha fertilizer has attracted widespread attention directly deliver through the drip irrigation system to the crops root zone the adsorption function of ha functional groups are used to change the ionic adsorption of soil colloid wei and shao 2007 liang et al 2018 and adjustment of soil ph hutchison et al 2001 chen et al 2019 therefore application of ha fertilizer in brackish water drip irrigation is expected to improve the soil environment and salinization issues so far brackish water drip irrigation system bwdis are not been widely promoted in actual agricultural fields high concentration of chemical ions in brackish resulting in chemical precipitation zhangzhong et al 2016 which increased the vulnerability of emitter clogging in bwdis emitter clogging deteriorates the fertigation and irrigation uniformity crop production and rising maintenance cost ribeiro et al 2004 however emitter clogging varies significantly with the variety of applied fertilizer previous studies ma et al 2020 and muhammad et al 2021 reported that the application of acid based phosphate fertilizer i e ammonium polyphosphate and urea phosphate fertilizer in saline waters significantly controlled the emitter clogging similarly the ha fertilizer contains a considerable amount of chelates i e sodium humate and potassium often used as scale inhibitor to prevent the chemical fouling chen et al 2011 feng et al 2019 the presence of ha would reduce the adsorption of phosphate on surface of caco3 fouling and directly prevents the precipitation of calcium and phosphorus compounds perassi and borgnino 2014 in addition benecke et al 2018 stated the application of ha in reverse osmosis desalination process changed the crystal structure of gypsum and significantly delay the precipitation thus weakening the effects of chemical fouling therefore ha fertilizer is expected to be an effective anti clogging fertilizer in bwdis as well as to regulate soil structure and improve the properties of saline soil accordingly compounding of ha fertilizer with conventional fertilizers may alleviate the emitter clogging and increase nutrients uniformity in bwdis in addition the current research advancement on scale inhibition of ha chelators has mainly limited to the industry levels nowack 2002 while the influence of ha fertilizer on emitter clogging in bwdis has not been investigated yet thus an in situ study was conducted to investigate the effects of compounding ha fertilizer with conventional fertilizers under eight different fertigation modes on emitter clogging in bwdis the emitter clogging mechanism fouling mineral composition and distribution characteristics were clarified the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of ha compound fertigation on emitter clogging in bwdis 2 elucidate the anti clogging mechanism of ha compound fertigation 3 determine the appropriate application mode of ha compound fertigationin bwdis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and treatments arrangement a total of eight home designed testing platforms with 15 m long drip laterals was constructed for eight different operating modes fig 1 the emitters were evenly installed along drip laterals having 30 cm spacing interval a homogeneous filtration system consisting the grit chamber sand filter media filtering size 0 9 1 3 mm disc filter 105 µm and screen filters 120 µm were used at the system head a total of 4 type of emitters were used during the experiment having discharge rate of 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 75 l h the geometric parameters of the emitter flow channels are shown in table s1 the testing platforms were arranged with circulating water design the system was operated from july 2019 to october 2019 8 h per day 10 00 am 6 00 pm total of 64 d flushing devices were installed at the end of testing platforms to flush the drip laterals after every eight days with a flushing velocity of 0 45 m s song et al 2017 the study was conducted utilizing brackish groundwater located in experimental station having total dissolved salts tds concentrations of 3000 mg l for each treatment the irrigation water temporarily stored in capped water tanks during the experiment the ph ca2 mg2 k co3 2 hco3 and so4 2 codcr total phosphorus and other parameters of brackish water were tested the ph value was measured by acid base field tests are carried out during the tester manufacture qingdao china type ph1b other indicators were tested by pony testing international group beijing china the irrigation water average parameters are shown in supplemental material table s2 in this experiment conventional fertilizer i e urea monoammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate and ha fertilizer i e humic acid nitrogen humic acid phosphorus and humic acid potassium were mixed with eight different fertilization modes having fertilizer concentration of 300 mg l the detailed arrangement of the experimental treatments are being explained in table 1 and basic information of fertilizers are shown in supplementary material table s3 besides the application of irrigation water and fertilization were done considering the growth period irrigation water and fertilization demands of jujube trees in arid arid semi arid areas li et al 2006 based on the planting period and irrigation and fertilization demands of jujube the testing system was operated every 8 days 64 h equivalent to an annual growth period including 20 3 h of fertilization and 43 7 h of irrigation without fertilization 2 2 emitter hydraulic performance evaluation the outflow of emitters along the drip laterals were tested after every 8 d weighing method was used to assess the emitter outflow the time span for emitter outflow measurements were set up as 3 min each time the head pressure of the testing systems was adjusted to 0 1 mpa before the emitter outflow was tested finally a high precision electronic balance accuracy of 10 4 g was used to weigh the collected outflow of each emitter as this was an outdoor experiment the irrigation water or surrounding temperature could be a key factor to effect emitter outflow thus the irrigation water temperature was monitored every day to eliminate the effects of varied temperature on emitter outflow proposed by pei et al 2013 liu et al 2019b the average discharge variation ratio dra and christiansen of uniformity were calculated to determine the hydraulic performance and emitter li et al 2019 the detailed calculation process is being explained in supplement materials section 1 4 2 3 emitter fouling substances extraction and analysis in order to analyze the composition of fouling substances a total of four sampling events were conducted at 16 d 48 d and 64 d of system operation emitter samples were carefully peel off placed in a zip lock bags and 45 ml of deionized water was added to detach the fouling substance from emitter flow channels using an ultrasonic cleaner for 20 min manufacturer hangzhou farent ultrasonic cleaning co ltd model no gvs 10 l hereafter 15 ml of treated suspension was centrifuged to balance solid residues in bottom of centrifuge tubes after centrifugation the fouling substances were dried at a constant temperature of 60 manufacturer jiangsu aobo technology co ltd model der 232 the dried samples were weighed with a high precision balance manufacturer guangdong juheng precision measurement control co ltd accuracy 10 4 g model ert to obtain the final dry weight dw of fouling substances the obtained solid particles were ground evenly and then scanned with a d8 advance x ray diffractometer manufacturer brook beijing technology co ltd model d8 advance the basic test conditions of the scanning process were utilized previously used by ma et al 2020 and the obtained atlas was analyzed by topas software supporting the x ray diffractometer

determine the significant differences of dra cu dw and other fouling substances among different treatments spearman s correlation was used to study the correlation between mineral components and clogging parameters dw dra and cu structural equation modelling sem was applied using amosv 22 0 ibm usa to determine the significant correlations between water quality parameters fouling substances

variation of drip irrigation testing system hydraulic performance and the accumulated total content of fouling substances are shown in fig 3 see supplementary materials fig s1 and fig s2 for the dynamic changes in dra and cu the results shows that the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the total content of fouling compared with ck treatment the fouling substances in ha compound fertilizer treatments were decreased by 3 64 18 61 mg cm2 which significantly p 0 05 alleviated emitter clogging fig 3a b leads to increase the dra and cu by 4 0 26 0 and 9 0 27 0 respectively different fertilization modes presented significant p 0 05 effects on fouling substance inside the emitters fig 3a b d compared with ck the single type ha compound fertilizer reduced the content of fouling substance by 3 64 10 82 mg cm2 and increased the dra and cu by 4 0 10 0 and 9 0 13 0 respectively the application of integrating two types and three types ha compound fertilizers reduced the fouling substance inside the emitters by 2 67 13 41 mg cm2 and 1 56 5 12 mg cm2 respectively which leads to increase the dra and cu of drip irrigation system by 3 0 12 0 and 2 0 10 0 two types and 10 0 15 0 and 8 0 13 0 three types respectively the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly changed the water quality parameters of bwdi waters see fig 2 compared with ck treatment the application of ha compound fertilizer led to a significant reduction in ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 in brackish water while increased the contents of hco3 the average variation of brackish water quality after the application of ha compound fertilizer which reduced the contents of ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 by 0 4 1 82 22 4 42 8 mg l 14 3 26 1 mg l and 9 3 13 5 mg l 41 8 63 5 mg

categories precipitate fouling and particulate fouling the proportions were ranged between 22 91 39 86 and 60 14 77 09 respectively fig 3d 3 2 variation of precipitates in fouling substances fig 4 shows that the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the precipitate fouling in drip emitters compared with ck the ha compound fertilizer reduced the content calcite dolomite and gypsum by 15 0 40 0 12 0 45 0 and 22 0 84 0 respectively fig 4a f which leads to reduce the total content of precipitates by 20 0 60 0 as well as significant p 0 05 differences in the content of precipitates fouling were found under different fertigation modes on other hand compared with ck the application of single type reduced the precipitate fouling by 20 0 36 0 while integrating two and three types of ha compound fertilizer decreased the fouling substances by 42 0 51 0 60 0 respectively 3 3 variation of particulates in fouling substance the general variation of particulate fouling in total fouling substances are illustrated in fig 5 compared with ck the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the content of clinochlore and muscovite by 5 0 50 0 and 12 0 45 0 respectively while the contents of quartz and anorthite were increased by 8 0 43 0 and 2 0 53 0 respectively thereby the accumulative content of particulate fouling was reduced by 2 0 8 0 in addition compared with the ck the application of single type fertilizer reduced the content of particulate fouling by 2 0 5 0 while integrating two and three type of ha compound fertilizer reduced by 5 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively 3 4 analysis of fouling formation path water quality parameters ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 hco3 so4 2 were significantly affected by application of ha compound fertilizer p 0 05 but had no significant effects on codcr total phosphorus and k table s4 the water quality parameters mineral components and drip irrigation hydraulic performance dw dra and

correlation with ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 β 0 79 p 0 01 but a significant negative correlation with hco3 β 0 62 p 0 01 ha compound fertilizer significantly affects the total amount of fouling in bwdis by directly changing water quality indirectly affected precipitate and particulate fouling content in addition a negative significant correlation was observed in between precipitates and particulates fouling 4 discussions 4 1 effect of humic acid compound fertilizer on water quality the application of ha compound fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 so4 2 while increased the content of hco3 in brackish water on the one hand ha is rich in a large number of active groups such as acidic and basic groups klucakova 2016 these oxygen containing functional groups determines the ability of ha molecules to have ion exchange groups complexing and dispersing molecular structures khil ko et al 2001 ha reduced the ph value of brackish water and increased the content of h thus reducing the ability of ca2 to combine with hco3 to form caco3 and promoted the ability of co3 2 to convert to hco3 ma et al 2020 as well as ha reduced the ability of ca2 to combine with so4 2 to form caso4 thus the conversion of so4 2 into hso4 was improved in addition ha can form stable soluble complex with ca2 and mg2 which change the dissolution reaction rate of ca2 and mg2 consequently reducing the content of ca2 and mg2 ions in brackish water to avoid the risk of ca2 and mg2 reactions with co3 2 and so4 2 in bw to form carbonate and sulfate promoting the conversion to bicarbonate and bisulfite mak et al 2009 on the other hand ha has a strong adsorption capacity plaschke et al 1999 ca2 and mg2 in brackish water could adsorbed on the surface of ha molecules thus reducing the contents of ca2 mg2 and other constituents in brackish water at the same time the application of ha compound fertilizer introduced a large number of negative charges shao et al 2011 and electrostatic adsorption occurred between the ions with positive charges in brackish water which changed the content of ions in brackish water 4 2 influence of humic acid compound fertilizer on fouling previous studies have reported that the ha will aggravate fouling substances hao et al 2011 lin et al 2015 olafsdottir and wu 2021 mainly due to the anion in ha combine with ca2 mg2 and slight quantity of fe3 and al3 in brackish water to form insoluble compounds in addition the zeta potential of ha colloidal particles is comparatively low resulting in ha flocculate and precipitate quickly and aggravates the fouling zhao et al 2019 in addition ha could form a ha ca complex on material surface and produce a huge amount of caco3 precipitation that leads to clogging cho et al 2019 however the aforementioned conclusions are in contradiction with our results while consistent with chen et al 2011 feng et al 2019 who proposed that ha fertilizers contain high amounts of chelates i e sodium and potassium humates which are often used as scale inhibitors and can effectively prevent precipitation scaling and with perassi and borgnino 2014 who concluded that ha can reduce the adsorption of phosphate on caco3 fouling surfaces and directly prevent the precipitation of calcium and phosphorus compounds moreover it corresponds to the results of benecke et al 2018 who indicated that the application of ha in the reverse osmosis desalination process can change the crystal structure of gypsum and significantly slow down the precipitation thus reducing the fouling content our results demonstrated that the application of ha compound fertilizer effectively reduced the precipitate and particulate fouling in brackish water figs 4 5 this was mainly due to ha compound fertilizer is rich in a large number of active groups klucakova 2016 which changes the crystallization kinetics by affecting brackish water quality choi et al 2018 and avoided the risk of ca2 mg2 reacting with co3 2 so4 2 and hco3 to form caco3 caso4 and camg co3 2 fouling in addition acid groups such as carboxylic acid in ha also have strong adsorption capacity plaschke et al 1999 which adsorbed on the binding site on the surface of fouling particles wada et al 2001 yin et al 2018 however due to the weak adhesion between ions the active cations between electrostatic layers may have a hydrophobic interaction with the ha molecules adsorbed on the dirt surface and thus move yuping et al 2007 lu et al 2020 the coordination exchange between the acid groups of ha and the ca2 and mg2 bonds on the fouling surface can occur thus the crystal structure and morphology of fouling particle change chong and jiang tao 2010 zhang et al 2015 in addition our results show fig 5 that the application of ha compound fertilizer reduces the total quantity of particulate fouling however in the particulates increased the content of silica and anorthite this was might be due to the adsorption of ha where the ha molecules are adsorbed on the surface of silica and anorthite particulates jarvis and majewski 2012 electrostatic attraction could increase the flocculation and settling strength of quartz and anorthite particulates zhou et al 2018 leading to increase the surface area of silica and anorthite that further promoted the deposition of particulate fouling in fact the application of ha compound fertilizer directly affected the brackish water quality and indirectly influenced the precipitate and particulate fouling by changing the brackish water ph and content of ca2 and mg2 an obvious interactions were found among precipitate and particulate fouling fig 6 this probably due to precipitates provides a large number of binding sites for the particulate deposition meyer 1984 which indirectly increased the content of particulate fouling in addition in addition brackish water contains high concentration of silica subramani et al 2012 thus due to chemical reaction it becomes easy to form silica fouling on pipeline german et al 2019 4 3 engineering applications the complex water quality of brackish irrigation water usually accompanied by salinization which deteriorates soil environment and crop health zhao et al 2020 desalinated brackish water for irrigation is an important means to alleviate the fresh water crisis tian et al 2021 however the higher operating cost of desalination technologies graham et al 2014 aparicio et al 2018 significantly restricted its practical implications in agricultural fields in addition desalinated brackish irrigation water are mostly need for the crops sensitive to salt tolerance generally the brackish water with salinity of 2000 4000 mg l could be directly utilized for agriculture irrigation through drip irrigation systems wei et al 2019 however the emitter clogging reduced irrigation uniformity and associated environmental issues are the other detrimental consequences bwdis thus this study intended to resolve the emitter clogging issue by compounding ha fertilizer with other conventional fertilizers and selecting most suitable fertilizer combination in bwdis our results shows that the compound ha fertilizer significantly improve the bwdis emitter anti clogging ability and nutrient uniformity along the drip laterals besides price is also an important factor in fertilizer selection hindering the promotion of bwdis generally due to excellent properties the price of ha is far higher than conventional fertilizer however compounding ha with conventional fertilizer the ha compound fertilizer will contain both the excellent properties of ha and the conventional fertilizer required for crop growth hence this strongly recommend the development of ha compound fertilizer the price of applying three type and two types ha fertilizers were higher by 31 33 44 19 and 21 65 37 08 than the three and two types of conventional fertilizers respectively on other hand the cost of applying two ha fertilizers was 7 68 18 44 lower than three type ha fertilizers see supplementary materials for detailed prices table s5 china fertilizer website 2019 accessed http www fert cn overall the resistance to soil salinity increasing crop yield and controlling emitter clogging in ha fertilizer are far superior than conventional fertilizer because the increased the variety of ha compound fertilizer improves its anti clogging effects improved by 4 0 27 0 but considering factors such as the price of ha fertilizer and conventional fertilizer as well as the farmers operating costs etc it is strongly recommended that the integrated application mode of han hak and bwdis in saline alkali land should be adopted although this study extensively understands the potential effects of different types of ha compound fertilizer on emitter clogging in bwdis however there are some issue might require further investigation 1 saline irrigation water with different salinity threshold should be considered to further verify the universality of the results 2 this study mainly considered the different modes of compounding ha with conventional fertilizer the emitter anti clogging mechanism under single types of ha fertilizer should investigated in future 5 conclusions 1 compared with conventional water soluble fertilizer the application of ha compound fertilizer reduced the total content of fouling substances in emitter flow channels by 2 92 16 11 mg cm2 which increased the dra and cu by 4 0 26 0 and 9 0 27 0 respectively 2 ha compound fertilizer significantly affected the precipitates and particulates fouling by changing the brackish water ph and the content of ca2 and mg2 at the end of system operation compared with ck the precipitates and particulates fouling were decreased by 20 0 60 0 and 2 0 8 0 respectively 3 based on this study results we strongly recommend the application of two or three types of ha compound fertilizer to improve fertilizer efficiency this recommendation also considered the price of ha fertilizer versus the conventional fertilizer under the balance of various factors we specifically recommend the ha compound fertilizer application pattern of han hak declaration of

9462,waterlogging is a major threat to wheat following rice production in the yangtze river plain china where the raised bed planting rbp pattern is recommended to reduce yield losses from waterlogging furrows used in rbp allow drainage runoff and beds serve as planting zones however the optimal bed widths for wheat following rice cultivation are unknown to adopt the most effective rbp patterns we evaluated the effects of bed width on the volumetric soil water content vswc radiation use efficiency yield and profitability among different rbp patterns during the 2019 20 and 2020 21 growing seasons the experiment comprised six planting patterns conventional flat planting fp and five rbp patterns with different bed widths rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 the results demonstrated that vswc increased with increasing bed width and rbp decreased vswc in the 0 10 cm soil layer but vswc did not significantly decrease when the beds were excessively wide the improved soil conditions promoted wheat canopy development and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar which resulted in a significantly higher value of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar that eventually increased both grain yields and net revenue the increase compared to fp was greatest for rbp180 and rbp240 there were tradeoffs between the positive growth promoting effects and the negative effect of decreased planting area with rbp excessively wide beds reduced the advantages of water drainage and excessively narrow bed widths reduced radiation resource capture the optimal bed widths for wheat production on the yangtze river plain were 213 4 215 3 cm 204 2 211 4 cm 197 3 206 5 cm and 204 9 214 6 cm for ipar biomass yield and economic benefits respectively overall rbp patterns with a 200 0 cm bed and 25 0 cm wide furrows are optimal for wheat after rice production under the current amount of rainfall in the yangtze river plain keywords raised bed planting bed size soil water content radiation capture economic benefit 1 introduction the rice wheat double cropping system of the yangtze river plain is highly important for food security in china and wheat is grown after rice on approximately 4 6 million hectares in china du et al 2021a excessive precipitation soil compaction after rice harvesting poor farmland drainage systems and conventional flat planting fp result in frequent long term waterlogging during wheat cultivation after the rice growing season in this region ding et al 2020 du et al 2021b waterlogging significantly restricts wheat growth and productivity causes 40 50 yield reductions in wet years and substantially increases interannual yield variability zhou 2010 stable and adequate food supplies are increasingly threatened by higher rainfall under ongoing and expected climate change worldwide donat et al 2016 valipour et al 2020 almazroui et al 2021 therefore it is urgent to implement effective crop management practices to mitigate waterlogging damage and increase agricultural productivity in frequently waterlogged arable land worldwide especially in the yangtze river plain wheat belt of china researchers have recently developed a series of new technologies to sustain the productivity of wheat cultivation after rice including furrow irrigated permanent raised bed planting systems singh et al 2006 2009 ditch buried straw return tillage practices yang et al 2019 the use of resistant strains wang et al 2016 zero tillage with medium sized strip seeding li et al 2020 2021 tillage fertilizer and seeding strategies ding et al 2021 and the use of turbo happy seeders sidhu et al 2015 one strategy is to grow wheat in raised bed planting rbp patterns under waterlogged conditions kaur et al 2020 du et al 2021b 2021c 2022 this strategy is different from the permanent raised bed system that is popularly used in south asia to address water scarcity singh et al 2009 gathala et al 2015 the rbp pattern generally consists of alternate beds and furrows the beds are used for planting crops and allow water to drain away from the plant root zone and reduce the likelihood of waterlogging and the furrows allow for drainage runoff the beds are generally destroyed after wheat harvest prior to puddling for planting rice this production practice has evolved and it is partially used in australia and china bakker et al 2007 manik et al 2019 du et al 2021b this technology changes the field microtopography improves the water drainage efficiency and decreases the gravimetric soil water content gswc du et al 2021b showed that in the yangtze river plain wheat grain yields increased by 11 3 14 1 with rbp and the gswc in the 0 10 cm soil depth was reduced by 13 2 19 4 compared to that under conventional fp patterns for the rbp pattern reducing the bed width and increasing the area of furrows increases the water drainage efficiency and decreases waterlogging however increasing the furrow area also reduces the crop planting area which decreases the potential yield in this pattern the bed width affects the water drainage efficiency soil water conditions grain yield and radiation capture efficiency therefore selecting a reasonable bed width is crucial to balance the positive effects of reduced waterlogging and the negative effects of a decreased planting area and reduced radiation capture under rbp previous studies showed that bed size was the major factor affecting soil water conditions soil temperature crop growth and yield formation in furrow irrigated raised bed planting systems wang et al 2015a qin et al 2016 ren et al 2016 fischer et al 2019 pan et al 2019 these studies indicated that increasing the mulched bed ridge width positively increased the soil temperature and the soil water content resulting in increased grain yield and water use efficiency but these factors did not increase without limit when the bed was excessively wide determining an appropriate bed width is essential for developing a more efficient rbp pattern to improve soil water conditions and increase resource use efficiency economic benefits and wheat yield wang et al 2015a 2015b duan et al 2021 however few studies have focused on the relationships between bed width and crop productivity in rbp patterns therefore a two year field study was performed on the yangtze river plain which is characterized by a subtropical humid climate to examine the effects of different bed widths on the volumetric soil water content vswc wheat growth grain yield radiation use efficiency and economic benefits compared with conventional fp the study provides experimental evidence for the optimum bed width in rbp patterns to ensure and stabilize wheat production after rice in the increasingly waterlogged region of the yangtze river plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site the field experiments were performed at the guohe experimental station of the anhui academy of agricultural sciences in lujiang county anhui province china 31 46 n 117 26 e during two consecutive wheat growing seasons in 2019 20 and 2020 21 a rice wheat double cropping system was implemented in the experimental field the area has a subtropical humid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1277 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 16 2 c the precipitation during the 2019 20 and 2020 21 wheat growing seasons were 545 4 and 598 6 mm respectively the field soil type is clay and the basic nutrient contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer before sowing wheat were 17 9 g kg 1 of soil organic matter 1 59 g kg 1 of total nitrogen 56 9 mg kg 1 of available phosphorus olsen phosphorus and 78 7 mg kg 1 of exchangeable potassium the soil bulk density at a soil depth of 0 20 cm before sowing was 1 23 g cm 3 the groundwater depth was approximately 80 cm 2 2 experimental design the study was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications of six planting patterns each season the following six different planting patterns were used 1 rbp60 alternating 60 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 2 rbp120 alternating 120 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 3 rbp180 alternating 180 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 4 rbp240 alternating 240 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 5 rbp300 alternating 300 cm wide beds and 25

rbp180 rbp240 rbp300 and fp respectively and each plot comprised five adjacent beds a local wheat cultivar triticum aestivum l yangfumai 6 early maturity with a sprout to harvest period of 199 days was planted in the beds at 20 cm intervals in 3 6 9 12 and 15 rows in the rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 treatments respectively on november 9 2019 and november 10 2020 the same row spacing was used for fp all plants were harvested manually at maturity on may 28 2020 and may 27 2021 crop management practices for high yield cultivation such as fertilization weeding and pest control were employed regularly in all plots during the growing periods 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 volumetric soil water content vswc the gswc was determined using the gravimetric method and by the oven drying method at 15 day intervals during the wheat growing period they were translated into vswc by multiplying the bulk density of the corresponding soil layer dixit and chen 2010 soil bulk density was determined in each plot using the ring method soil samples were collected at 10 cm increments along the 0 20 cm soil layer and at 30 cm intervals in the horizontal direction of the rbp patterns the vswc of the rbp patterns for the beds was the average of the values measured on all dates 2 3 2 biomass and leaf area index lai plant biomass and leaf area were measured every 15 days from the rising stage until harvest plants in a 0 5 0 6 m quadrat in each plot were sampled and separated into leaves stems and ears the green leaf area was measured using an li3000c instrument and the leaf area index lai was estimated manually all samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 30 min and then at 80 c to a constant weight 2 3 3 radiation capture and use efficiency the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation fpar of the wheat canopy was measured using a sunscan canopy analysis system to measure the radiation transmitted line sensors were placed parallel to the wheat rows in 30 cm intervals in the horizontal direction of the rbp and fp patterns fpar was calculated as the ratio of the difference between incident and transmitted radiation to the incident radiation charles edwards and lawn 1984 the average of the measurements was considered the fpar of the canopy measurements were obtained from 11 00 a m to 1 00 p m on clear days during the wheat season the daily intercepted par ipar was calculated as the daily fpar values between measurements were estimated by fitting polynomial functions and daily solar radiation by 0 5 monteith and unsworth 1990 caviglia et al 2004 the radiation use efficiency rue was calculated by dividing the accumulated biomass by the total ipar during the wheat season sinclair and muchow 1999 2 3 4 grain yield at maturity plants were harvested by hand from a 2 0 m long bed in each plot in the rbp patterns and a 2 0 1 0 m quadrat in the fp pattern to measure grain yield and yield components the grain yields were determined based on 12 water content 2 3 5 economic benefits economic benefits were estimated based on the costs of inputs operations seed fertilizer labor pesticides mechanical farming and mechanical harvesting and the value of the wheat grain the market prices of the inputs and wheat grain were determined by the real time local market prices for each of the two experimental growing seasons the net revenues were calculated by deducting the total inputs from the outputs 2 4 statistical analysis figures were created using origin 2018 software analyzes of variance were performed using spss 22 0 software the least significant difference lsd0 05 method was used to detect the mean differences between planting patterns in the calculation for the group index lai biomass and yield per unit area for the rbp patterns the total land area was used i e including the combined area of the beds and furrows 3 results 3 1 volumetric soil water content vswc compared to fp the rbp patterns decreased the bed vswc due to the high runoff efficiency especially in the 0 10 cm soil layer in both seasons fig 2 the mean vswcs of the beds in the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers were significantly p 0 05 affected by planting pattern and growing season table 1 bed width significantly influenced the soil water conditions and the vswc increased with increasing bed width rbp300 rbp240 rbp180 rbp120 rbp60 across the two seasons the mean vswcs of the rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 beds were 27 0 23 2 18 6 11 6 and 5 1 lower respectively in the 0 10 cm soil layer and 12 5 9 8 7 2 4 7 and 0 2 lower respectively in the 10 20 cm soil layer compared with fp fig 3 therefore the water runoff efficiency decreased with increasing bed width 3 2 crop development and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar the wheat lai was significantly affected p 0 01 by planting pattern and growing season table 1 and a higher lai was observed for the rbp patterns except rbp60 than for fp over the two seasons fig 4 the maximum wheat lais were observed under rbp180 and rbp240 in the two seasons and the values were significantly higher than those under rbp60 and fp the two season mean laimax values were 1 1 9 9 22 9 22 2 and 5 8 higher under rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 respectively than under fp the wheat canopy fpar was distinctly p 0 01 affected by planting pattern and growing season table 1 the fpar of wheat was significantly higher in rbp180 and rbp240 than in rbp60 over the two years p 0 05 compared to fp the two season mean wheat fpar in rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 increased by 4 1 7 9 11 7 10 8 and 6 5 respectively 3 3 radiation capture and use efficiency the biomass and ipar of wheat were significantly p 0 01 affected by planting pattern and growing season table 1 significantly greater biomass was measured at maturity for the rbp patterns except rbp60 with relative differences of 2 6 7 5 14 2 12 5 and 7 1 for rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 respectively compared to fp averaged over the two growing seasons table 2 the ipar of wheat was significantly higher in rbp180 and rbp240 than in rbp60 and fp over the two seasons p 0 05 the average ipar of rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 across the two seasons increased by 6 5 3 8 11 7 10 9 and 6 0 respectively compared to fp a bed width that was excessively large or small was not conducive to ipar bed width slightly affected rue in both seasons except for rbp60 which had significantly higher rue than other treatments table 2 compared to fp the average rue across the two seasons in rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 increased by 4 1 3 5 2 3 1 4 and 1 1 respectively 3 4 grain yield the planting pattern and growing season significantly p 0 05 affected the spike density grain number per spike thousand grain weight and grain yield of wheat table 1 compared to fp the grain number per spike was significantly higher in rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 and rbp240 p 0 05 in 2019 20 and 2020 21 whereas no significant difference was observed for rbp300 table 3 the spike density was significantly higher in rbp180 and rbp240 p 0 05 than in rbp60 in both seasons however bed width only slightly affected the thousand grain weight the wheat grain yield under the rbp patterns except for rbp60 was greatly improved compared to that under fp among the six patterns the yield of rbp240 was the highest in 2019 20 and the yield of rbp180 was the highest in 2020 21 the two season average grain yields under rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 were 3 1 9 4 16 4 14 1 and 7 0 higher respectively than that under fp a high grain yield was associated with a high grain number per spike in the rbp patterns and the low yield in rbp60 was associated with a low spike density 3 5 economic benefits rbp patterns with different bed widths had significant effects on the inputs outputs ratio of outputs to inputs and net income in both years table 4 the seed and pesticide cost inputs decreased with decreasing bed width but the rental of machinery cost input exhibited the opposite relationship which caused the total input to decrease with increasing bed width in both years the output values were largely dependent on the grain yield therefore the rbp patterns increased net income in both years rbp240 had the greatest net income and ratio of outputs to inputs in 2019 20 and rbp180 had the greatest values in 2020 21 the average net incomes across the two seasons for rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 increased by 11 6 60 us ha 1 68 3 352 us ha 1 98 9 509 us ha 1 97 1 500 us ha 1 and 68 3 351 us ha 1 respectively compared to fp 3 6 optimum bed width determination when all data from the six different planting patterns were pooled the net income and yield were markedly positively correlated with lai fpar and ipar but were not significantly correlated with vswc or rue fig 5 these results demonstrated that canopy capacity and radiation capture determined wheat yield the best fitting regression curves of vswc plotted against bed width showed that vswc increased linearly with increasing bed width in both soil layers p 0 01 fig 6 and the lowest value was obtained at a bed width of 60 cm i e rbp60 the ipar biomass yield and economic benefit had significant polynomial correlations with bed width p 0 01 or p 0 05 fig 6 which increased initially and then began to decrease with increasing bed width in both years the bed widths associated with the peak ipar biomass yield and economic benefit in 2019 20 and 2020 21 were 213 4 and 215 3 cm 211 4 and 204 2 cm 206 5 and 197 3 cm and 214 6 and 204 9 cm respectively overall the optimum bed width for wheat production was between 180 and 240 cm 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content under different bed widths consistent with our previous study du et al 2021b the rbp patterns in the present study significantly decreased vswc in the 0 10 cm soil layer compared to fp but differences existed between different bed widths the rbp patterns with narrow beds had better drainage and water reduction efficiency which resulted in significantly reduced vswcs in the beds fig 2 the positive effects intensified with increasing furrow area a narrow bed with a larger furrow area resulted in greater efficiency in draining excessive water enhanced water infiltration and a decreased bed vswc however narrow beds with more furrows have a smaller planting area which accelerates soil surface evaporation by direct solar radiation du et al 2021b this reduced effective planting area may also result in a loss of yield this result is opposite to those obtained for rainwater harvesting furrow ridge rhfr systems in dryland areas where wider ridges resulted in greater rainwater collection efficiency wang et al 2015a qin et al 2016 fischer et al 2019 pan et al 2019 the main reason is that the functions of the two planting systems are opposite one system aims to collect rainwater in the furrows and the other system aims to reduce soil water in the beds however better soil conditions may be obtained by increasing the functional area i e nonplanted areas 4 2 wheat canopy development and radiation capture under different bed widths crop yield depends on the efficient use of radiation resources and the ability to capture radiation resources is the most important strategy for improving crop yield li et al 2008 du et al 2015 liu et al 2016 consistent with our previous study du et al 2021c the improved soil conditions under the rbp patterns in the present study significantly reduced waterlogging damage and promoted crop growth an et al 2019 du et al 2021b 2021c which resulted in considerably enhanced wheat canopy lai and fpar values compared to those under fp fig 4 the data in our study indicated that the highest values for wheat lai and fpar were reached under rbp180 and rbp240 and then decreased however an increase or decrease in bed width above 240 or below 180 cm may not improve lai and fpar excessively wide beds decrease the drainage ability and reduce individual plant growth advantages excessively narrow beds reduce the effective planting area of furrows and decrease the plant population number well developed individual plants cannot compensate for yield losses from a reduced planting area therefore the selection of the appropriate bed width is vital to wheat growth and radiation resource capture our results showed that improved radiation capture drove the increased yields under the rbp patterns table 2 the mean ipar increased by 6 5 to 11 7 under rbp compared to that under fp rbp180 and rbp240 exhibited the highest ipar values the ipar declined when the bed width was above 240 or below 180 cm this result was related to the lower radiation capture efficiency caused by the insufficient plant population and therefore canopy or by the greater number of furrows which wasted considerable radiation resources fischer et al 2019 and singh et al 2009 reported similar results in raised bed experiments in mexico and india respectively in which greater radiation capture in beds facilitated wheat yield advantages 4 3 wheat grain yields under different bed sizes the rbp patterns significantly increased the wheat grain yields by 4 6 to 19 5 compared to fp which is consistent with our previous studies du et al 2021b 2022 in contrast the rhfr system had greater yields with wider ridges wang et al 2015a fischer et al 2019 pan et al 2019 and the rbp pattern did not increase yields the increase in wheat yield with bed width reached a maximum under rbp240 in 2019 20 and under rbp180 in 2020 21 and then decreased table 3 this phenomenon primarily resulted from the combined effect of promoted growth and the effective planting area the effective planting area was decreased in the rbp patterns compared to fp because part of the land was used as the furrows which had a negative effect on yield formation a wider bed was generally associated with poor drainage ability which reduced the growth advantages of the rbp patterns for the wider beds under the rbp pattern the spike numbers were the same as those under fp but the advantages of an increased grain number per spike were weakened the decrease in grain yield in the narrow beds may be explained by the negative effect of increased furrows resulting in a reduced planting area despite a decrease in vswc during the growing season the increase in yield per plant cannot offset the yield loss caused by the decrease in the planting area wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 this result was demonstrated by the higher grain number per spike with significantly lower spike numbers table 3 which is consistent with the lower wheat yield resulting from lower spike numbers in the permanently raised beds in india singh et al 2009 to achieve higher wheat yield the components of yield must be coordinated therefore the positive and negative effects must be coordinated to achieve a higher wheat yield rbp240 in 2019 20 and rbp180 in 2020 21 showed modest success in our study with a significantly increased grain number per spike and the same number of spikes which resulted in a significantly higher yield 4 4 economic benefits economic costs and benefits are important factors in the adoption of practices by smallholder farmers and across large areas luo et al 2021 as indicated in our previous studies the rbp patterns required significantly lower inputs and generated higher outputs than fp and provided significantly higher net revenue du et al 2021b 2022 the economic evaluation of the present study showed that the net revenue of wheat planting under rbp patterns was approximately 30 570 us ha 1 higher than that under fp across both years bed width significantly affected the inputs outputs and net revenue the inputs of seeds and pesticides increased with increasing bed width table 4 due to an increased planting area however the machinery rental input gradually declined decreasing the bed width required increased machinery rental inputs and was accompanied by decreased yield which reduced the net economic benefit the net revenue and the ratio of outputs to inputs first increased and then decreased with increasing bed width rbp240 in 2019 20 and rbp180 in 2020 21 achieved the highest net revenue which was primarily due to these conditions producing the highest grain yields in the two seasons 4 5 optimal bed width this study suggests that the rbp pattern may be used to increase productivity and profitability for wheat after rice production in the yangtze river region and that different bed width alter the soil water conditions radiation capture and crop productivity there is a tradeoff between the positive effect of promoting growth and the negative effect of reducing the planting area when the bed width is less than the optimum range wheat growth and yield formation are largely limited by the planting area ren et al 2016 however growth and yield are hampered by inefficient drainage when the beds exceed the optimum range regression analysis revealed that the optimum bed widths were 213 4 215 3 cm 197 3 206 5 cm and 204 9 214 6 cm for ipar wheat grain yield and net revenue respectively fig 6 a comprehensive consideration of factors such as machinery and planting row spacing suggests that to maximize the yield of wheat after rice cultivation and increase profitability rbps with a 200 0 cm bed width and a 25 0 cm furrow width are recommended in the frequently waterlogged arable land on the yangtze river plain china this result is similar to farmers experiences in victoria and western australia with bed widths of 2 m being the most suitable rbp pattern to improve crop productivity under waterlogged conditions wightman et al 2005 unlike the rbp pattern in the rhfr system in arid regions the optimum ridge bed widths that achieved the highest yield were 60 cm for winter wheat liu et al 2020 45 cm for potato tian et al 2003 35 36 cm for alfalfa wang et al 2015b and 32 38 cm for oats wang et al 2015a these differences likely reflect the fact that crops in the rhfr system are planted in the furrows rather than in the beds as in the rbp pattern wider ridges reduced the crop planting area which led to a negative effect on crop yield which is consistent with our attempts to reduce the wasted area in all cropping systems wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 the total growing season rainfall was slightly higher in 2020 21 than in 2019 20 in this experiment which resulted in a yield reduction caused by more serious waterlogging table 3 therefore the optimum bed width in 2020 21 that achieved the highest yield was narrower than that in 2019 20 fig 6 this result indicates that the appropriate bed width for wheat in the rbp pattern in the study region should be determined by considering the amount of rainfall a narrower bed width would have a greater grain yield in rainy years but a larger bed width is recommended in dry years there are some limitations to the present study that need to be addressed first although differences existed in the total rainfall among the two growing seasons tested this is not representative of all rainfall conditions second this study was performed on the same soil type and there is a lack of other studies on different soil types the optimum bed width in the rbp pattern may depend heavily on the soil characteristics and rainfall ren et al 2008 singh et al 2009 such information will help to improve the reliability and application range of the rbp pattern therefore further research is needed to investigate the quantitative relationship between bed width and rainfall for rbp patterns in areas with different soil types additional factors must be considered bed width often depends on machinery availability moreover more weeds sometimes accumulate in the furrows than in the fp plot and effective weed control in furrows needs to be addressed singh et al 2006 gathala et al 2015 5 conclusion in this study in the yangtze river region all of the rbp patterns significantly reduced the vswc by improving drainage efficiency the improved soil conditions promoted wheat canopy growth and radiation capture and eventually increased grain yields and net revenue which were sensitive to bed width there is a tradeoff between the positive effect of promoting growth and the negative effect of decreasing the planting area under the rbp pattern excessively wide beds reduce the advantages of water drainage and excessively narrow beds reduce radiation resource capture the optimum bed width was 200 0 cm in the rbp pattern with 25 0 cm wide furrows to reduce waterlogging under the current amount of rainfall these conditions ensured yield and profitability for wheat after rice production in the yangtze river region in addition a reasonable bed width should be designed in combination with soil type and rainfall and this needs further investigation the next step also needs to consider the integration of seeding machinery and agronomy according to a reasonable bed width declaration of competing interest the authors

9462,waterlogging is a major threat to wheat following rice production in the yangtze river plain china where the raised bed planting rbp pattern is recommended to reduce yield losses from waterlogging furrows used in rbp allow drainage runoff and beds serve as planting zones however the optimal bed widths for wheat following rice cultivation are unknown to adopt the most effective rbp patterns we evaluated the effects of bed width on the volumetric soil water content vswc radiation use efficiency yield and profitability among different rbp patterns during the 2019 20 and 2020 21 growing seasons the experiment comprised six planting patterns conventional flat planting fp and five rbp patterns with different bed widths rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 the results demonstrated that vswc increased with increasing bed width and rbp decreased vswc in the 0 10 cm soil layer but vswc did not significantly decrease when the beds were excessively wide the improved soil conditions promoted wheat canopy development and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar which resulted in a significantly higher value of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation ipar that eventually increased both grain yields and net revenue the increase compared to fp was greatest for rbp180 and rbp240 there were tradeoffs between the positive growth promoting effects and the negative effect of decreased planting area with rbp excessively wide beds reduced the advantages of water drainage and excessively narrow bed widths reduced radiation resource capture the optimal bed widths for wheat production on the yangtze river plain were 213 4 215 3 cm 204 2 211 4 cm 197 3 206 5 cm and 204 9 214 6 cm for ipar biomass yield and economic benefits respectively overall rbp patterns with a 200 0 cm bed and 25 0 cm wide furrows are optimal for wheat after rice production under the current amount of rainfall in the yangtze river plain keywords raised bed planting bed size soil water content radiation capture economic benefit 1 introduction the rice wheat double cropping system of the yangtze river plain is highly important for food security in china and wheat is grown after rice on approximately 4 6 million hectares in china du et al 2021a excessive precipitation soil compaction after rice harvesting poor farmland drainage systems and conventional flat planting fp result in frequent long term waterlogging during wheat cultivation after the rice growing season in this region ding et al 2020 du et al 2021b waterlogging significantly restricts wheat growth and productivity causes 40 50 yield reductions in wet years and substantially increases interannual yield variability zhou 2010 stable and adequate food supplies are increasingly threatened by higher rainfall under ongoing and expected climate change worldwide donat et al 2016 valipour et al 2020 almazroui et al 2021 therefore it is urgent to implement effective crop management practices to mitigate waterlogging damage and increase agricultural productivity in frequently waterlogged arable land worldwide especially in the yangtze river plain wheat belt of china researchers have recently developed a series of new technologies to sustain the productivity of wheat cultivation after rice including furrow irrigated permanent raised bed planting systems singh et al 2006 2009 ditch buried straw return tillage practices yang et al 2019 the use of resistant strains wang et al 2016 zero tillage with medium sized strip seeding li et al 2020 2021 tillage fertilizer and seeding strategies ding et al 2021 and the use of turbo happy seeders sidhu et al 2015 one strategy is to grow wheat in raised bed planting rbp patterns under waterlogged conditions kaur et al 2020 du et al 2021b 2021c 2022 this strategy is different from the permanent raised bed system that is popularly used in south asia to address water scarcity singh et al 2009 gathala et al 2015 the rbp pattern generally consists of alternate beds and furrows the beds are used for planting crops and allow water to drain away from the plant root zone and reduce the likelihood of waterlogging and the furrows allow for drainage runoff the beds are generally destroyed after wheat harvest prior to puddling for planting rice this production practice has evolved and it is partially used in australia and china bakker et al 2007 manik et al 2019 du et al 2021b this technology changes the field microtopography improves the water drainage efficiency and decreases the gravimetric soil water content gswc du et al 2021b showed that in the yangtze river plain wheat grain yields increased by 11 3 14 1 with rbp and the gswc in the 0 10 cm soil depth was reduced by 13 2 19 4 compared to that under conventional fp patterns for the rbp pattern reducing the bed width and increasing the area of furrows increases the water drainage efficiency and decreases waterlogging however increasing the furrow area also reduces the crop planting area which decreases the potential yield in this pattern the bed width affects the water drainage efficiency soil water conditions grain yield and radiation capture efficiency therefore selecting a reasonable bed width is crucial to balance the positive effects of reduced waterlogging and the negative effects of a decreased planting area and reduced radiation capture under rbp previous studies showed that bed size was the major factor affecting soil water conditions soil temperature crop growth and yield formation in furrow irrigated raised bed planting systems wang et al 2015a qin et al 2016 ren et al 2016 fischer et al 2019 pan et al 2019 these studies indicated that increasing the mulched bed ridge width positively increased the soil temperature and the soil water content resulting in increased grain yield and water use efficiency but these factors did not increase without limit when the bed was excessively wide determining an appropriate bed width is essential for developing a more efficient rbp pattern to improve soil water conditions and increase resource use efficiency economic benefits and wheat yield wang et al 2015a 2015b duan et al 2021 however few studies have focused on the relationships between bed width and crop productivity in rbp patterns therefore a two year field study was performed on the yangtze river plain which is characterized by a subtropical humid climate to examine the effects of different bed widths on the volumetric soil water content vswc wheat growth grain yield radiation use efficiency and economic benefits compared with conventional fp the study provides experimental evidence for the optimum bed width in rbp patterns to ensure and stabilize wheat production after rice in the increasingly waterlogged region of the yangtze river plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site the field experiments were performed at the guohe experimental station of the anhui academy of agricultural sciences in lujiang county anhui province china 31 46 n 117 26 e during two consecutive wheat growing seasons in 2019 20 and 2020 21 a rice wheat double cropping system was implemented in the experimental field the area has a subtropical humid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1277 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 16 2 c the precipitation during the 2019 20 and 2020 21 wheat growing seasons were 545 4 and 598 6 mm respectively the field soil type is clay and the basic nutrient contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer before sowing wheat were 17 9 g kg 1 of soil organic matter 1 59 g kg 1 of total nitrogen 56 9 mg kg 1 of available phosphorus olsen phosphorus and 78 7 mg kg 1 of exchangeable potassium the soil bulk density at a soil depth of 0 20 cm before sowing was 1 23 g cm 3 the groundwater depth was approximately 80 cm 2 2 experimental design the study was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications of six planting patterns each season the following six different planting patterns were used 1 rbp60 alternating 60 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 2 rbp120 alternating 120 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 3 rbp180 alternating 180 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 4 rbp240 alternating 240 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows 5 rbp300 alternating 300 cm wide beds and 25 cm wide furrows fig 1 and 6 fp flat planting for all rbp treatments the bed height was 25 cm the plot dimensions were 4 25 7 25 10 25 13 25 16 25 and 15 0 m width and 20 0 m length for rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 rbp300 and fp respectively and each plot comprised five adjacent beds a local wheat cultivar triticum aestivum l yangfumai 6 early maturity with a sprout to harvest period of 199 days was planted in the beds at 20 cm intervals in 3 6 9 12 and 15 rows in the rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 treatments respectively on november 9 2019 and november 10 2020 the same row spacing was used for fp all plants were harvested manually at maturity on may 28 2020 and may 27 2021 crop management practices for high yield cultivation such as fertilization weeding and pest control were employed regularly in all plots during the growing periods 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 volumetric soil water content vswc the gswc was determined using the gravimetric method and by the oven drying method at 15 day intervals during the wheat growing period they were translated into vswc by multiplying the bulk density of the corresponding soil layer dixit and chen 2010 soil bulk density was determined in each plot using the ring method soil samples were collected at 10 cm increments along the 0 20 cm soil layer and at 30 cm intervals in the horizontal direction of the rbp patterns the vswc of the rbp patterns for the beds was the average of the values measured on all dates 2 3 2 biomass and leaf area index lai plant biomass and leaf area were measured every 15 days from the rising stage until harvest plants in a 0 5 0 6 m quadrat in each plot were sampled and separated into leaves stems and ears the green leaf area was measured using an li3000c instrument and the leaf area index lai was estimated manually all samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 30 min and then at 80 c to a constant weight 2 3 3 radiation capture and use efficiency the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation fpar of the wheat canopy was measured using a sunscan canopy analysis system to measure the radiation transmitted line sensors were placed parallel to the wheat rows in 30 cm intervals in the horizontal direction of the rbp and fp patterns fpar was calculated as the ratio of the difference between incident and transmitted radiation to the incident radiation charles edwards and lawn 1984 the average of the measurements was considered the fpar of the canopy measurements were obtained from 11 00 a m to 1 00 p m on clear days during the wheat season the daily intercepted par ipar was calculated as the daily fpar values between measurements were estimated by fitting polynomial functions and daily solar radiation by 0 5 monteith and unsworth 1990 caviglia et al 2004 the radiation use efficiency rue was calculated by dividing the accumulated biomass by the total ipar during the wheat season sinclair and muchow 1999 2 3 4 grain yield at maturity plants were harvested by hand from a 2 0 m long bed in each plot in the rbp patterns and a 2 0 1 0 m quadrat in the fp pattern to measure grain yield and yield components the grain yields were determined based on 12 water content 2 3 5 economic benefits economic benefits were estimated based on the costs of inputs operations seed fertilizer labor pesticides mechanical farming and mechanical harvesting and the value of the wheat grain the market prices of the inputs and wheat grain were determined by the real time local market prices for each of the two experimental growing seasons the net revenues were calculated by deducting the total inputs from the outputs 2 4 statistical analysis figures were created using origin 2018 software analyzes of variance were performed using spss 22 0 software the least significant difference lsd0 05 method was used to detect the mean differences between planting patterns in the calculation for the group index lai biomass and yield per unit area for the rbp patterns the total land area was used i e including the combined area of the beds and furrows 3 results 3 1 volumetric soil water content vswc compared to fp the rbp patterns decreased the bed vswc due to the high runoff efficiency especially in the 0 10 cm soil layer in both seasons fig 2 the mean vswcs of the beds in the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm soil layers were significantly p 0 05 affected by planting pattern and growing season table 1 bed width significantly influenced the soil water conditions and the vswc increased with increasing bed width rbp300 rbp240 rbp180 rbp120 rbp60 across the two seasons the mean vswcs of the rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 beds were 27 0 23 2 18 6 11 6 and 5 1 lower respectively in the 0 10 cm soil layer and 12 5 9 8 7 2 4 7 and 0 2 lower respectively in the 10 20 cm soil layer compared with fp fig 3 therefore the water runoff efficiency decreased with increasing bed width 3 2 crop development and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar the wheat lai was significantly affected p 0 01 by planting pattern and growing season table 1 and a higher lai was observed for the rbp patterns except rbp60 than for fp over the two seasons fig 4 the maximum wheat lais were observed under rbp180 and rbp240 in the two seasons and the values were significantly higher than those under rbp60 and fp the two season mean laimax values were 1 1 9 9 22 9 22 2 and 5 8 higher under rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 respectively than under fp the wheat canopy fpar was distinctly p 0 01 affected by planting pattern and growing season table 1 the fpar of wheat was significantly higher in rbp180 and rbp240 than in rbp60 over the two years p 0 05 compared to fp the two season mean wheat fpar in rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 increased by 4 1 7 9 11 7 10 8 and 6 5 respectively 3 3 radiation capture and use efficiency the biomass and ipar of wheat were significantly p 0 01 affected by planting pattern and growing season table 1 significantly greater biomass was measured at maturity for the rbp patterns except rbp60 with relative differences of 2 6 7 5 14 2 12 5 and 7 1 for rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 respectively compared to fp averaged over the two growing seasons table 2 the ipar of wheat was significantly higher in rbp180 and rbp240 than in rbp60 and fp over the two seasons p 0 05 the average ipar of rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 across the two seasons increased by 6 5 3 8 11 7 10 9 and 6 0 respectively compared to fp a bed width that was excessively large or small was not conducive to ipar bed width slightly affected rue in both seasons except for rbp60 which had significantly higher rue than other treatments table 2 compared to fp the average rue across the two seasons in rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 increased by 4 1 3 5 2 3 1 4 and 1 1 respectively 3 4 grain yield the planting pattern and growing season significantly p 0 05 affected the spike density grain number per spike thousand grain weight and grain yield of wheat table 1 compared to fp the grain number per spike was significantly higher in rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 and rbp240 p 0 05 in 2019 20 and 2020 21 whereas no significant difference was observed for rbp300 table 3 the spike density was significantly higher in rbp180 and rbp240 p 0 05 than in rbp60 in both seasons however bed width only slightly affected the thousand grain weight the wheat grain yield under the rbp patterns except for rbp60 was greatly improved compared to that under fp among the six patterns the yield of rbp240 was the highest in 2019 20 and the yield of rbp180 was the highest in 2020 21 the two season average grain yields under rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 were 3 1 9 4 16 4 14 1 and 7 0 higher respectively than that under fp a high grain yield was associated with a high grain number per spike in the rbp patterns and the low yield in rbp60 was associated with a low spike density 3 5 economic benefits rbp patterns with different bed widths had significant effects on the inputs outputs ratio of outputs to inputs and net income in both years table 4 the seed and pesticide cost inputs decreased with decreasing bed width but the rental of machinery cost input exhibited the opposite relationship which caused the total input to decrease with increasing bed width in both years the output values were largely dependent on the grain yield therefore the rbp patterns increased net income in both years rbp240 had the greatest net income and ratio of outputs to inputs in 2019 20 and rbp180 had the greatest values in 2020 21 the average net incomes across the two seasons for rbp60 rbp120 rbp180 rbp240 and rbp300 increased by 11 6 60 us ha 1 68 3 352 us ha 1 98 9 509 us ha 1 97 1 500 us ha 1 and 68 3 351 us ha 1 respectively compared to fp 3 6 optimum bed width determination when all data from the six different planting patterns were pooled the net income and yield were markedly positively correlated with lai fpar and ipar but were not significantly correlated with vswc or rue fig 5 these results demonstrated that canopy capacity and radiation capture determined wheat yield the best fitting regression curves of vswc plotted against bed width showed that vswc increased linearly with increasing bed width in both soil layers p 0 01 fig 6 and the lowest value was obtained at a bed width of 60 cm i e rbp60 the ipar biomass yield and economic benefit had significant polynomial correlations with bed width p 0 01 or p 0 05 fig 6 which increased initially and then began to decrease with increasing bed width in both years the bed widths associated with the peak ipar biomass yield and economic benefit in 2019 20 and 2020 21 were 213 4 and 215 3 cm 211 4 and 204 2 cm 206 5 and 197 3 cm and 214 6 and 204 9 cm respectively overall the optimum bed width for wheat production was between 180 and 240 cm 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content under different bed widths consistent with our previous study du et al 2021b the rbp patterns in the present study significantly decreased vswc in the 0 10 cm soil layer compared to fp but differences existed between different bed widths the rbp patterns with narrow beds had better drainage and water reduction efficiency which resulted in significantly reduced vswcs in the beds fig 2 the positive effects intensified with increasing furrow area a narrow bed with a larger furrow area resulted in greater efficiency in draining excessive water enhanced water infiltration and a decreased bed vswc however narrow beds with more furrows have a smaller planting area which accelerates soil surface evaporation by direct solar radiation du et al 2021b this reduced effective planting area may also result in a loss of yield this result is opposite to those obtained for rainwater harvesting furrow ridge rhfr systems in dryland areas where wider ridges resulted in greater rainwater collection efficiency wang et al 2015a qin et al 2016 fischer et al 2019 pan et al 2019 the main reason is that the functions of the two planting systems are opposite one system aims to collect rainwater in the furrows and the other system aims to reduce soil water in the beds however better soil conditions may be obtained by increasing the functional area i e nonplanted areas 4 2 wheat canopy development and radiation capture under different bed widths crop yield depends on the efficient use of radiation resources and the ability to capture radiation resources is the most important strategy for improving crop yield li et al 2008 du et al 2015 liu et al 2016 consistent with our previous study du et al 2021c the improved soil conditions under the rbp patterns in the present study significantly reduced waterlogging damage and promoted crop growth an et al 2019 du et al 2021b 2021c which resulted in considerably enhanced wheat canopy lai and fpar values compared to those under fp fig 4 the data in our study indicated that the highest values for wheat lai and fpar were reached under rbp180 and rbp240 and then decreased however an increase or decrease in bed width above 240 or below 180 cm may not improve lai and fpar excessively wide beds decrease the drainage ability and reduce individual plant growth advantages excessively narrow beds reduce the effective planting area of furrows and decrease the plant population number well developed individual plants cannot compensate for yield losses from a reduced planting area therefore the selection of the appropriate bed width is vital to wheat growth and radiation resource capture our results showed that improved radiation capture drove the increased yields under the rbp patterns table 2 the mean ipar increased by 6 5 to 11 7 under rbp compared to that under fp rbp180 and rbp240 exhibited the highest ipar values the ipar declined when the bed width was above 240 or below 180 cm this result was related to the lower radiation capture efficiency caused by the insufficient plant population and therefore canopy or by the greater number of furrows which wasted considerable radiation resources fischer et al 2019 and singh et al 2009 reported similar results in raised bed experiments in mexico and india respectively in which greater radiation capture in beds facilitated wheat yield advantages 4 3 wheat grain yields under different bed sizes the rbp patterns significantly increased the wheat grain yields by 4 6 to 19 5 compared to fp which is consistent with our previous studies du et al 2021b 2022 in contrast the rhfr system had greater yields with wider ridges wang et al 2015a fischer et al 2019 pan et al 2019 and the rbp pattern did not increase yields the increase in wheat yield with bed width reached a maximum under rbp240 in 2019 20 and under rbp180 in 2020 21 and then decreased table 3 this phenomenon primarily resulted from the combined effect of promoted growth and the effective planting area the effective planting area was decreased in the rbp patterns compared to fp because part of the land was used as the furrows which had a negative effect on yield formation a wider bed was generally associated with poor drainage ability which reduced the growth advantages of the rbp patterns for the wider beds under the rbp pattern the spike numbers were the same as those under fp but the advantages of an increased grain number per spike were weakened the decrease in grain yield in the narrow beds may be explained by the negative effect of increased furrows resulting in a reduced planting area despite a decrease in vswc during the growing season the increase in yield per plant cannot offset the yield loss caused by the decrease in the planting area wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 this result was demonstrated by the higher grain number per spike with significantly lower spike numbers table 3 which is consistent with the lower wheat yield resulting from lower spike numbers in the permanently raised beds in india singh et al 2009 to achieve higher wheat yield the components of yield must be coordinated therefore the positive and negative effects must be coordinated to achieve a higher wheat yield rbp240 in 2019 20 and rbp180 in 2020 21 showed modest success in our study with a significantly increased grain number per spike and the same number of spikes which resulted in a significantly higher yield 4 4 economic benefits economic costs and benefits are important factors in the adoption of practices by smallholder farmers and across large areas luo et al 2021 as indicated in our previous studies the rbp patterns required significantly lower inputs and generated higher outputs than fp and provided significantly higher net revenue du et al 2021b 2022 the economic evaluation of the present study showed that the net revenue of wheat planting under rbp patterns was approximately 30 570 us ha 1 higher than that under fp across both years bed width significantly affected the inputs outputs and net revenue the inputs of seeds and pesticides increased with increasing bed width table 4 due to an increased planting area however the machinery rental input gradually declined decreasing the bed width required increased machinery rental inputs and was accompanied by decreased yield which reduced the net economic benefit the net revenue and the ratio of outputs to inputs first increased and then decreased with increasing bed width rbp240 in 2019 20 and rbp180 in 2020 21 achieved the highest net revenue which was primarily due to these conditions producing the highest grain yields in the two seasons 4 5 optimal bed width this study suggests that the rbp pattern may be used to increase productivity and profitability for wheat after rice production in the yangtze river region and that different bed width alter the soil water conditions radiation capture and crop productivity there is a tradeoff between the positive effect of promoting growth and the negative effect of reducing the planting area when the bed width is less than the optimum range wheat growth and yield formation are largely limited by the planting area ren et al 2016 however growth and yield are hampered by inefficient drainage when the beds exceed the optimum range regression analysis revealed that the optimum bed widths were 213 4 215 3 cm 197 3 206 5 cm and 204 9 214 6 cm for ipar wheat grain yield and net revenue respectively fig 6 a comprehensive consideration of factors such as machinery and planting row spacing suggests that to maximize the yield of wheat after rice cultivation and increase profitability rbps with a 200 0 cm bed width and a 25 0 cm furrow width are recommended in the frequently waterlogged arable land on the yangtze river plain china this result is similar to farmers experiences in victoria and western australia with bed widths of 2 m being the most suitable rbp pattern to improve crop productivity under waterlogged conditions wightman et al 2005 unlike the rbp pattern in the rhfr system in arid regions the optimum ridge bed widths that achieved the highest yield were 60 cm for winter wheat liu et al 2020 45 cm for potato tian et al 2003 35 36 cm for alfalfa wang et al 2015b and 32 38 cm for oats wang et al 2015a these differences likely reflect the fact that crops in the rhfr system are planted in the furrows rather than in the beds as in the rbp pattern wider ridges reduced the crop planting area which led to a negative effect on crop yield which is consistent with our attempts to reduce the wasted area in all cropping systems wang et al 2015b liu et al 2020 the total growing season rainfall was slightly higher in 2020 21 than in 2019 20 in this experiment which resulted in a yield reduction caused by more serious waterlogging table 3 therefore the optimum bed width in 2020 21 that achieved the highest yield was narrower than that in 2019 20 fig 6 this result indicates that the appropriate bed width for wheat in the rbp pattern in the study region should be determined by considering the amount of rainfall a narrower bed width would have a greater grain yield in rainy years but a larger bed width is recommended in dry years there are some limitations to the present study that need to be addressed first although differences existed in the total rainfall among the two growing seasons tested this is not representative of all rainfall conditions second this study was performed on the same soil type and there is a lack of other studies on different soil types the optimum bed width in the rbp pattern may depend heavily on the soil characteristics and rainfall ren et al 2008 singh et al 2009 such information will help to improve the reliability and application range of the rbp pattern therefore further research is needed to investigate the quantitative relationship between bed width and rainfall for rbp patterns in areas with different soil types additional factors must be considered bed width often depends on machinery availability moreover more weeds sometimes accumulate in the furrows than in the fp plot and effective weed control in furrows needs to be addressed singh et al 2006 gathala et al 2015 5 conclusion in this study in the yangtze river region all of the rbp patterns significantly reduced the vswc by improving drainage efficiency the improved soil conditions promoted wheat canopy growth and radiation capture and eventually increased grain yields and net revenue which were sensitive to bed width there is a tradeoff between the positive effect of promoting growth and the negative effect of decreasing the planting area under the rbp pattern excessively wide beds reduce the advantages of water drainage and excessively narrow beds reduce radiation resource capture the optimum bed width was 200 0 cm in the rbp pattern with 25 0 cm wide furrows to reduce waterlogging under the current amount of rainfall these conditions ensured yield and profitability for wheat after rice production in the yangtze river region in addition a reasonable bed width should be designed in combination with soil type and rainfall and this needs further investigation the next step also needs to consider the integration of seeding machinery and agronomy according to a reasonable bed width declaration of competing interest the authors

9463,solving the disparity between rainwater supply and crop water demand is a fundamental issue in semiarid rainfed agriculture over the last decades the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm farming system has been widely used as an on site in situ rain harvesting farming strategy providing a partial solution to the supply demand mismatch of rainwater the off site rain harvesting system ex situ water cistern for supplemental irrigation has been little used we established an integrated ex situ rain harvesting system incorporated into maize rfm in a semiarid site of northwest china from 2018 to 2019 five treatments were designed as 1 ck 1 flat planting without mulching and irrigation 2 ck 2 rfm without irrigation 3 rfm60 rfm with 60 mm irrigation 4 rfm105 rfm with 105 mm irrigation and 5 rfm150 rfm with 150 mm irrigation we found that supplemental irrigation treatments significantly increased grain yield total biomass and crop water productivity compared to ck 1 and ck 2 p 0 05 across two growing seasons suggesting that ex situ rain harvesting irrigation can significantly promote field productivity based on widely used rfm system the differences mentioned above were the greatest in rfm105 and rfm150 significantly greater than those of rfm60 no significant difference was observed between rfm150 and rfm105 greater output in rfm150 and rfm105 was closely associated with improved soil water storage and thermal state in two growing seasons particularly rfm150 and rfm105 harvested the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen after the second fallow period the highest economic benefit was found in rfm105 followed by rfm150 and rfm60 the least in the two control groups our findings provided a critical case to solve the rainfall supply demand mismatch the ex situ rainwater harvesting supplemental irrigation can act as a promising solution to upgrade the current widely used rfm farming system for better adaptation to climate change in the semiarid region keywords ex situ rain harvesting ridge furrow plastic mulching supplemental irrigation maize productivity soil organic carbon 1 introduction agricultural production in the arid and semiarid regions is mainly constrained by severe water resource scarcity li et al 2019 li and gong 2002 in these regions crops growth and yield are hampered by limited precipitation fan et al 2014 severe water shortage occurs in the regions with mean annual precipitation of around 300 800 mm ali et al 2017 gu et al 2017 due to climate change the semiarid loess plateau in northwest china experiences low rainfall events 6 mm which cannot sustain crop production li et al 2001 liu and zhang 2007 in the loess plateau the growing season of maize zea mays l ranges from late april to september but over 50 of annual precipitation falls in the period from july to september meng et al 2017 xiaoli et al 2012 yan et al 2017 this discrepancy between rain season and maize growth cycle means that the lack of precipitation frequently inhibits crop production during the early stages reducing grain yield at later stages zhang et al 2014 water deficiencies at the different growth stages have diverse effects on maize growth due to sensitivity differences to drought çakir 2004 deng et al 2006 the greatest yield reductions resulting from water stress frequently take place from tassel emergence to silking stages debaeke and aboudrare 2004 grant et al 1989 li and sun 2016 over the last two decades the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm farming system has been widely used as an in situ rainwater collection and utilization strategy in the loess plateau of china east african plateau and other asian countries feng et al 2017 mo et al 2018b rfm system is an efficient strategy to counter the drought risk throughout the crop growth cycle boers et al 1986 jiang et al 2013 it proves to be easily operated and efficient for soil and water management wu et al 2015 a lot of studies show that rfm significantly promotes crop growth and development including plant height dry matter and grain yield compared with conventional flat planting feng et al 2017 mo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however water shortage would remain unavoidable during some crop growth stages in semiarid areas gu et al 2017 xiao et al 2007 zhou et al 2009 to avoid water stress during critical growth stages supplemental irrigation which combines dryland farming with limited irrigation on crop productivity under the rfm system could be an appropriate choice to avoid a high yield penalty and increase water use efficiency deng et al 2006 on the other hand due to climate change surface runoff has increased significantly over the last half century in northwest china s hilly and gully areas tao et al 2003 to some extent this may cause short term flood events but it can be used for agricultural purposes when well harvested theoretically farmer investments in ex situ water harvesting can significantly improve irrigation water availability bringing about a revival of the agricultural economy and substantially increasing farmers incomes and livelihoods a water cistern is a bottle shaped underground tank lined with either clay or cement tiles which store runoff from mainly natural soil surfaces or concrete lined catchment surfaces gould et al 2014 building a water cistern is a one time event that takes about seven days using locally available materials it does not require ongoing training for a project recipient to understand its use however ex situ rainwater collection through building a water cistern beside the farmland and reuse strategy is a potential solution to the contradiction between water supply and demand therefore there is an urgent need to promote new ways of addressing this mismatch consequently a field experiment was designed and conducted with the following objectives 1 to identify the effects of supplemental irrigation under rfm on maize growth crop water productivity and grain yield 2 to evaluate the influences of different treatments on soil quality soil organic carbon soc soil total nitrogen stn and soil organic carbon to soil total nitrogen ration c n ratio 3 to clarify the hydrothermal mechanism of this novel solution on field productivity and profitability and 4 to set up a successful case on the feasibility and application potential in the loess plateau and other similar areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was performed at a semiarid site i e the dryland rainfed agricultural station of lanzhou university at zhonglianchuan village in the northern hilly and gully region of yuzhong county gansu china 36 02 n 104 25 e and 2400 m above sea level during 2018 and 2019 the climate is temperate semiarid with an average annual precipitation of 350 mm about 65 occurring between june and september the local mean annual air temperature is 6 5 c july and august recorded the highest values of mean monthly temperature of 16 5 c and precipitation of 70 7 mm respectively according to the local average level over the last 15 years the experimental site soil is classified as heima soil with a loamy texture it has a field water holding capacity fwhc of 22 9 and a permanent wilting coefficient pwc of 6 2 zhou et al 2009 the average bulk density in the 0 200 cm soil layer is 1 2 g cm 3 the soil consists of 37 clay 0 002 mm 59 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 4 sand 0 05 2 0 mm zhang et al 2019 the top layer of soil 20 cm has a ph of 8 3 organic carbon of 6 4 g kg 1 total nitrogen of 0 7 g kg 1 available p of 3 2 mg kg 1 and available k of 159 5 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and treatments in this experiment a water cistern was established adjacent to the experimental field fig 1a and e and conducted supplemental irrigation from water cistern in the maize field on the basis of rfm application five treatments were designed 1 rfm with 60 mm irrigation rfm60 fig 1b 2 rfm with 105 mm irrigation rfm105 fig 1b 3 rfm with 150 mm irrigation rfm150 fig 1b 4 rfm without irrigation ck 2 fig 1c and 5 flat planting without mulching and irrigation ck 1 fig 1d respectively water supply for both the ck 1 and ck 2 was solely dependent on rainfall while in rfm60 rfm105 and rfm150 soil moisture was achieved through both rainfall and supplemental irrigation supplemental irrigation was applied at selected stages jointing tasseling and pre silking using a flooding surface irrigation method the supplemental irrigation water was channeled directly to the furrows the irrigation stages and amount for each treatment are presented in table 1 a water pump was used to pump irrigation water from the cistern to the field the irrigation water was channeled directly to the furrows using a plastic hose pipe fitted with a water meter ensuring each furrow had uniform water distribution before irrigation weather forecasting was monitored to ensure no or little rainfall was expected for seven days the rfm had a ridge height of 15 cm and a width of 30 cm while furrows were 20 cm wide a transparent plastic film of 0 008 mm thickness and 140 cm length was used for covering both the ridge and furrows completely except for ck 1 which was left bare at the jointing point of two pieces of plastic films in the middle of a furrow the plastic was fixed by placing soil on the film surface the furrows were closed at the end of each plot to hold back the irrigation water to facilitate the infiltration of rainwater and irrigation water into the soil profile holes measuring 2 cm in diameter were made on the plastic mulch in the furrow at a spacing of 0 6 m using an iron rod on all treatments except ck 1 fig 1b the treatments were applied to 20 m2 5 m by 4 m plots with a gap of 0 8 m between the plots to minimize the leakage of irrigation water from one plot to the other each treatment was replicated three times in a randomized arrangement chemical fertilizers consisting of 150 kg ha 1 in the form of urea 46 n and 165 kg ha 1 in the form of superphosphate 12 p were broadcasted and incorporated into the top 30 cm the ridges furrows and film mulching in all treatments except ck 1 were done on 28 april 2018 and 22 april 2019 respectively using a hand hole drilling machine maize seeds zea mays kenyu no 10 were sown 4 5 cm deep through the plastic film by making holes in the furrows for rfm treatments on 29 april 2018 and 23 april 2019 respectively each plot had a planting density of 100 plants 50 000 plants per hectare the harvesting took place on 15 october 2018 and 9 october 2019 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements during the growing season the soil temperature dynamics 0 15 cm were monitored using data loggers elitech usb temperature rc 5 placed in the soil in the middle of the furrow and plants in a row in each treatment plot the data loggers were configured to record the soil temperature at an interval of 5 h for three consecutive days at seedling jointing silking and maturity growth stages the mean growth stage temperature ⁰c was calculated using the four daily readings soil water storage was determined gravimetrically swc to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm intervals at jointing 53 60 days after sowing das silking 94 103 das and to a depth of 200 cm before sowing and harvesting 130 141 das in each plot soil samples were taken in the middle part between two plants in the furrows using an 8 cm diameter hand auger the soil samples were quickly weighed and then reweighed after oven drying for 48 h at 105 c the soil water storage sws mm was calculated according to the following formula sws mm swc bd sd where swc is the gravimetric soil water content bd is soil bulk density g cm 3 and sd is the soil depth mm three soil samples at 0 20 cm depth were taken randomly in each plot s furrow before sowing jointing silking and maturity during the two growing seasons and fallow period in 2020 the subsamples from each plot were pooled together to make a composite fresh soil samples were air dried at room temperature and pressed to pass a 0 15 mm sieve soil organic carbon soc was determined using potassium dichromate oxidation which was based on the walkley black chromic acid wet oxidation method while soil total nitrogen stn was measured using a kj kjeldahl auto analyzer sdk 800 shanghai peiou analytical instrument china c n ratio was then calculated for each sample shoot biomass total of grain cob cores leaves and stem was determined at the maturity growth stage five plants were randomly selected and cut off at the first nodule on the stem the harvested shoots were chopped into small pieces oven dried at 105 c for 1 h then at 75 c for a minimum period of 24 h till constant weight was achieved at maturity maize ears were manually harvested and grain yield was measured by harvesting 10 m2 from the center of each plot for all treatments the crop water productivity cwp kg ha 1mm 1 was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield per unit area to the total water consumption for the whole season while irrigation water productivity iwp kg ha 1mm 1 was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield per unit area to the total irrigation amount applied for the whole season according to the following equations cwp y et where y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 and et mm is the corresponding actual crop evapotranspiration in each growing season iwp yi yd ir where yi is the grain yield with irrigation kg ha 1 and yd is the grain yield for ck 2 or an equivalent rainfed field kg ha 1 and ir is the amount of irrigation water applied mm chai et al 2015 fernández et al 2020 the experimental field was flat thus no runoff was observed during the experiment the drainage was considered insignificant over a depth of 200 cm because the rainfall was so low to cause drainage below 200 cm therefore evapotranspiration et mm was estimated using the following formula et p i δsws where p is the total precipitation within a growing season mm i is the total supplemental irrigation mm and δsws is the change in soil water storage at sowing and harvest mm to evaluate the practicability of the technology in improving small households livelihood we calculated the economic benefit based on the inputs used and the total output in the present economic evaluation system the economic return was assessed using equations presented by zhang et al 2017 economic return us ha 1 grain yield benefit us ha 1 maize stover benefit us ha 1 total cost us ha 1 where total cost us ha 1 machinery operation

edition vsn international ltd vsni uk was used with irrigation amount as a factor the least significant differences lsd0 05 were used to detect mean differences between the treatments and further separated by fisher least significant difference origin 9 1 software was used to make all the figures 3 results 3 1 precipitation and air temperature during the experimental period in 2018 and 2019 total precipitation during the maize growing season 20 april 30 september was 401 and 362 mm respectively fig 2 2018 was a wet year compared with the 15 year average of 300 mm and 2019 was a normal year although 2018 received more precipitation over 50 occurred in august and september while in 2019 the precipitation was well distributed with about 70 occurring from april july the monthly mean air temperatures fig 2 in may the first month after sowing were 11 9 c and 9 7 c for 2018 and 2019 on average the mean air temperature during both growing seasons was insignificantly different with 11 1 c and 10 7 c for 2018 and 2019 respectively 3 2 soil hydrothermal state 3 2 1 soil water storage 0 100 cm the soil water storage dynamic changes at 100 cm soil depths with a 20 cm increment in all treatments at jointing silking and maturity stages in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons are displayed in fig 3 the trend of sws was rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 2 ck 1 in 2018 whereas in 2019 rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 2 ck 1 at the jointing stage in both years ck 1 had the lowest sws as compared to other treatments in the 2018 season soil water content was consistently lower in rfm60 than in rfm105 and rfm150 but insignificantly different to ck 2 in the 2019 season the same trend as 2018 was observed at the silking stage but at the maturity stage all treatments were significantly different from each other except rfm105 and rfm150 the variation trend was also observed through the soil profile fig 3 the soil water content was mostly significantly higher on rfm150 and rfm105 on the top 60 cm soil depth for both years from 60 100 cm the differences in sws decreased with increasing depth the soil water conditions were well regulated at critical growth stages by the different irrigation amounts and rfm and maize crop well reacted to soil water conditions 3 2 2 soil temperature variation mean daily soil temperature variations at the top 15 cm soil depth for seedling jointing silking and maturity are shown in fig 4 the soil temperatures at 15 cm soil depth followed the same trend as the air temperature in the two years across all the planting patterns values gradually increased after sowing reaching their maximum value at around 60 das and then decreased until maturity no significant difference in mean daily soil temperature was observed between the treatments during the seedling stage ck 1 significantly recorded the highest soil temperature at the jointing stage which was followed by ck 2 and rfm60 insignificantly different then by rfm105 and rfm150 for both growing seasons at silking as compared to ck 1 rfm150 and rfm105 reduced soil temperature by 2 6 c in 2018 and 2 5 c in 2019 during this stage rfm60 and ck 2 were not significantly different although they reduced soil temperature by 1 7 c and 1 5 c in 2018 and 1 9 c and 2 c in 2019 as compared to ck 1 respectively at maturity the soil temperatures differences magnitude decreased as compared to ck 2 and ck 1 3 3 soil nutrients in our study the stn content differed between the different treatments and the growing seasons fig 5a in general stn contents decreased in all treatments from sowing to silking then increased through maturity to the fallow period in both growing seasons in 2018 the differences in stn contents in all treatments were not significant except at maturity at maturity rfm150 and rfm105 had higher stn content in the soil of 0 46 and 0 43 g kg 1 respectively there was only a slight increase in stn for rfm60 compared to both ck treatments fig 5a in 2019 rfm150 and rfm105 maintained a significant difference in stn content in the soil throughout the growing period on average the differences in stn during the 2019 2020 furrow period and before sowing in 2018 was 0 17 0 23 0 13 0 13 and 0 05 g kg 1 for rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 2 and ck 1 respectively the soc content values at early growth stages sowing and jointing were not significantly different among the treatments fig 5b however the amount of soil carbon consumption varied with the treatments and growing seasons in both growing seasons soc content was inclined to decrease in each treatment from sowing to maturity this suggested an increase in biomass accumulation resulted in higher soc consumption there was no significant difference in soc consumption between the treatments from jointing to maturity in 2018 while during the 2019 growing season rfm150 and rfm105 averagely had significantly more soc in the soil of 6 4 g kg 1 rfm60 was insignificantly different from ck 2 with 6 1 g kg 1 and ck 1 had the lowest soc of 5 8 g kg 1 respectively there was a significant increase in soc content in the soil during the fallow period in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 this was mainly because of the biological breakdown of crop residue and mineralization of organic matter in the soil system on average during fallow periods soc content in the soil significantly increased by 0 6 and 0 7 g kg 1 in 2018 2019 and 0 4 and 0 3 g kg 1 in 2019 2020 for rfm150 and rfm105 respectively fig 5b in 2018 2019 the increment was higher because data was collected after fertilization although rfm60 was significantly higher than ck 1 it was insignificantly different from ck 2 both with 0 4 and 0 2 g kg 1 for 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 fallow periods average at the end of two growing seasons fallow period 2019 2020 minus before sowing 2018 soc was increased by 0 39 and 0 36 g kg 1 for rfm150 and rfm105 while rfm60 ck 2 and ck 1 decreased soc by 0 03 0 15 and 0 2 g kg 1 respectively lastly the c n ratio first increased from sowing to silking and decreased up to the fallow period in 2018 2019 fig 5c in the 2019 growing season it slightly increased from sowing to maturity and then it turned to decrease during the fallow period in 2019 2020 across the growing periods rfm150 and rfm105 significantly reduced the c n ratio by 4 41 and 4 63 while rfm60 was insignificantly different from ck 2 with 3 36 and ck 1 the least with 1 97 respectively fig 5c 3 4 cpw and iwp on a biomass basis the shoot biomass total of grain cob cores leaves and stem accumulation during the maturity stage is shown in table 2 the shoot biomass accumulated in 2018 was greater than that of 2019 as a result of irrigation water since most of the precipitation occurred later in the growing season the shoot biomass crop water productivity cwps was significantly higher for ck 2 followed by rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 with 28 95 26 45 26 04 and 26 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 27 11 25 77 27 00 and 26 31 kg ha 1 mm 1 for 2018 and 2019 respectively ck 1 recorded the least cwps in both years table 2 the shoot biomass irrigation water productivity iwps was significantly higher for rfm150 with 17 30 kg ha 1 mm 1 followed by rfm105 with 13 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 then rfm60 with 12 17 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 while in 2019 rfm150 had 42 55 kg ha 1 mm 1 followed by rfm60 with 37 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 then rfm105 with 32 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 3 5 cwp and iwp on a yield basis the et and amount of precipitation received during the growing season are shown in table 2 in the 2018 growing season the precipitation was 401 mm and et values were 527 490 454 392 and 389 mm for rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 1 and ck 2 respectively in the 2019 growing season the precipitation was lower 362 mm than in 2018 but was well distributed the et values for rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 1 and ck 2 were 434 395 371 325 and 334 mm respectively these results indicated that the et was significantly different among different treatments and between the growing seasons grain yield was 4884 and 4756 kg ha 1 in the 2018 season and 4427 and 4385 kg ha 1 in the 2019 growing season for rfm150 and rfm105 table 2 the differences were insignificant between the two treatments this showed that the additional water supply above 105 mm did not increase the grain yield rfm60 had a grain yield of 3133 kg ha 1 in 2018 which was not significantly different from ck 2 but significantly different from ck 1 table 2 in the 2019 growing season rfm60 recorded 3657 kg ha 1 which was significantly different from ck 2 3170 kg ha 1 and ck 1 1279 kg ha 1 the grain yield crop water productivity cwpy was insignificantly different during the 2018 growing season for rfm150 and rfm105 with 9 23 and 9 69 kg ha 1 mm 1 while rfm60 had the lowest cwpy of 6 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 for irrigation treatments which were not significantly different from ck 2 respectively in the 2019 season rfm105 recorded the highest cwpy of 10 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 while rfm150 rfm60 were not significantly different from ck 2 ck 1 had the lowest cwpy table 2 grain yield irrigation water productivity iwpy was significantly higher for rfm105 in both growing seasons with 16 70 and 17 36 kg ha 1 mm 1 for 2018 and 2019 respectively rfm150 recorded an iwpy of 12 55 and 12 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 while rfm60 recorded 2 18 and 12 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 2 when the et was increased from 455 to 490 mm the iwpy increased by 2 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 but when et was increased from 490 to 527 the cwpy was not significantly increased in 2018 while in 2019 when the et was increased from 395 to 434 mm the cwpy significantly decreased by 1 04 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 2 3 6 economic benefit in assessing the reception extent by local farmers under climate change conditions we analyzed the economic benefit we estimated the net incomes under different treatments across the two growing seasons table 3 in comparison with ck 2 three irrigated treatments required additional inputs such as the purchase of irrigation equipment and water cistern construction of 1540 us ha 1 the net income was calculated according to the return on investment period due to extra irrigation labor the total labor for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 was increased by 1622 3 us ha 1 in the first growing seasons than ck 2 on average according to the real time local market price the total input values were 2959 2 us ha 1 for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 while ck 2 and ck 1 were 1333 9 and 1011 8 us ha 1 in 2018 respectively the total input for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 in 2019 was not the same as for 2018 because irrigation was applied twice and the water cistern construction cost was not included in the second year and subsequent years for a period of 20 years which is water cistern s service life table 1 the corresponding total output value including grain and straw harvest in both years was increased by 33 6 36 7 and 11 1 for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 as compared with ck 2 respectively the net income for both growing seasons was increased by 213 1 in rfm150 238 9 in rfm105 and 28 9 in rfm60 compared with ck 2 respectively ck 1 incurred losses in both growing seasons table 3 finally the average output to input ratio was 0 9 1 for rfm150 and rfm105 while rfm60 was 0 8 1 and ck 2 1 1 1 respectively therefore rfm150 and rfm105 have a return on investment period of 2 years while rfm60 has 3 5 years 4 discussion rainwater harvesting supplemental irrigation under rfm at different growth stages impacted soil water storage soil temperature and soil nutrients which led to a change in total shoot biomass and grain yield for maize crop in loess plateau the maize crop in the semiarid loess plateau is constrained by water stress during early growth stages as a result of precipitation mismatch meng et al 2017 yan et al 2017 supplemental irrigation under rfm at jointing tasseling and pre silking could reduce yield losses by reducing moisture stress and optimization of soil temperature 4 1 soil hydrothermal dynamics previous studies have reported that rfm can improve soil hydrothermal conditions for dryland agriculture in arid and semiarid regions dong et al 2018 feng et al 2017 gu et al 2017 mo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 also irrigation under the surface of plastic mulch is an effective way to reduce soil evaporation deng et al 2006 in our study irrigation under rfm improved soil moisture in the furrows due to the redirection of rainwater falling on the ridges into the furrows ren et al 2008 besides this the supplemental water directed on the furrows the plastic film helped reduce soil evaporation and increase crop canopy hence increasing moisture availability oweis and hachum 2006 the treatment with less irrigation i e rfm60 had low soil water storage because irrigation water tends to accumulate at the shallow layers fig 3 our results were in line with what hao et al 2015 found at the maturity stage during the first growing season when the crop had reached full physiological maturity there was high soil moisture under rfm150 and rfm105 treatments because of rainwater from late 2018 incorporated with irrigation during silking this unused water is deposited in moderately deep soil layers which led to higher soil moisture earlier in the following season this was in agreement with research done by oweis et al 2005 the rainwater from late 2018 plus irrigation water during silking was stored in slightly deeper layers effects of plastic mulching on soil temperature in agricultural fields have been widely reported in research literatures rfm improves soil temperature for seedling establishment in spring sown crops mo et al 2018a at early growth stages a small plant canopy allows most of the soil surface mulched with plastic film to receive solar energy causing the topsoil to warm quickly mo et al 2017 as we found out in this study plastic mulched treatments had higher soil temperature during the seedling stage as compared with flat bare treatment the soil temperature at the topsoil under rfm and supplemental irrigation decrease during the vegetative growth of a crop as a result of overshadowing li et al 2016 in this study the same results were observed at 15 cm soil depth where rfm150 and rfm105 had significantly lower soil temperature during the vegetative growth stage as compared with other treatments fig 4 the other treatments were observed to have high soil temperatures because a small plant canopy during early growth stages allows penetration of solar radiations which heats the topsoil li et al 2016 in the loess plateau low soil temperatures at early crop stages can significantly influence crop development from these results it can be concluded that rfm plus supplemental irrigation plays a critical role in regulating soil temperature during the crop growth period 4 2 relations between supplemental irrigation and soil nutrients soc is associated with biological and chemical measures of soil quality and it plays a great role in maintaining a soil nutrient pool and improving the availability of soil nutrients li et al 2004 liu et al 2014 in our study soc across all the treatments decreased from sowing up to maturity only to restock during the fallow period fig 5 rfm plus supplemental irrigation during critical growth stages of maize crop played a crucial role in improving the soil hydrothermal state this improved soil hydrothermal conditions aids in accelerating organic matter decomposition which plays a significant effect on replacing depleted soc as reported in mo et al 2017 although li et al 2004 reported that burying crop residues in the soil could reduce the depletion rate of soc there were no residues intentionally added to the soil in this study still improved biomass production under rfm plus supplemental irrigation treatments showed a positive soc balance during the fallow period this showed that the soc which was lost within the growing period was restored during the fallow period therefore the rfm plus supplemental irrigation of 150 and 105 mm which increased the soc content in the soil within two years played a role in returning more organic matter to the soil system and hence improving soil quality even though the study area had a very low soc content which is quite often more obstinate as li et al 2004 found our results were in agreement with qiu et al 2018 that soc content increases under supplemental irrigation in arid and semiarid regions high c n ratio of above 1 24 may slow down the organic matter decomposition rate hence limiting the soil microbial activities while a low c n ratio may accelerate the mineralization rate hence increasing nutrients availability chen et al 2014 in this study the c n ratio was low hence increased nutrients availability for crop development during the fallow period the c n ratio declined rapidly under rfm150 and rfm105 indicating a high rate of mineralization of soil organic nitrogen resulting from improved soil hydrothermal conditions fig 5c therefore c n ratio which is a sign of soil quality was well recovered the stn declined from sowing to silking in 2018 in all treatments this decline may have been due to high allocation of nitrogen for biomass formation at the vegetative stages or increased nitrogen lock up in the bodies of microorganisms due to the high soc stn ratio a positive trend of total nitrogen from maturity through the fallow period might have resulted from the release of microbial bound nitrogen thus becoming available in the soil 4 3 maize productivity cwp and profitability our results were consistent during the two growing seasons showing clearly that rfm plus supplemental irrigation significantly affected cwp shoot biomass and total grain yield rfm150 and rfm105 registered higher both shoot biomass and total grain yield table 2 previous researches have proven that rfm is an effective technique to improve yield and cwp in wheat significantly ali et al 2019 maize mo et al 2018 and oilseed rape gu et al 2019 2017 in arid and semiarid regions due to improved hydrothermal conditions soil nutrients and water absorption were positively impacted promoting crop growth under rfm plus supplemental irrigation practices as li et al 2019 and li and sun 2016 found the shoot biomass was greater in 2018 as compared to 2019 table 2 this is because of higher precipitation that occurred immediately after sowing in april and good soil water storage as a result of supplemental irrigation the results indicate that supplemental irrigation could increase shoot biomass with an irrigation amount of 105 mm iwps was higher in rfm150 showing that most of the supplemental irrigation water was used for biomass formation as earlier reported rfm plus supplemental irrigation improved soil moisture in the furrows and may be reduced drought stress hence rfm105 presented the highest grain yield among all the treatments in both years although it was not significantly higher than rfm150 table 2 remarkably the first year had a higher grain yield than the second year for rfm105 and rfm150 whereas rfm60 ck 2 and ck 1 had a higher yield in the second year this phenomenon was owed to the good distribution of the precipitation within the crop growing season in the second year although the first year received higher rainfall 401 mm within the growing season it was not well distributed fig 2 most of the rainfall occurred in august 141 mm hence positively influencing rfm105 and rfm150 treatments on crop growth this is because from jointing to silking precipitation was insufficient hence the crops were exposed to water stress which was minimized by supplemental irrigation supplemental irrigation around the pre silking prolonged duration of grain filling whereby it extends the functional period of leaves which can in turn increase grain weight verma et al 2004 this was shown in this study by rfm150 and rfm105 increasing cwp has been a key objective in most of the researches whereby it can enhance grain yields li et al 2019 the rainfall patterns mainly influenced cwp for maize yield treated with supplemental irrigation combined with rfm during the growing season on the other hand rfm is known to reduce soil evaporation hence improving crop yield without taking advantage of the et as it was shown in our study by ck 2 which had a lower et than ck oweis et al 2005 discovered that the higher the rainfall the higher the et our study showed the same results whereby 2018 had a higher et than in 2019 this is attributed to increased plant transpiration rfm150 and rfm105 had higher et which was induced by a greater amount of irrigation water gao et al 2017 results were consistent with ours whereby the et increased with greater water input rfm105 increased cwpy and total grain yield by 5 26 and 38 3 58 4 respectively while rfm150 increased cwpy by 21 in the first year but was significantly lower in the second year than ck 2 this improvement by rfm105 and rfm150 was may be due to the effective use of supplemental irrigation which was applied by retaining more soil water combined with decreased soil evaporation because of plastic mulch this increased the crop transpiration rate leading to biomass accumulation thus improving grain yield ali et al 2016 iwpy like cwpy increased with increasing supplemental irrigation amount table 2 in our study the results were opposite of what gao et al 2017 and dogan et al 2011 found that iwp decreases with increasing irrigation amount although it increased up to 105 mm and decreased with more water application this is because maybe in our experiment supplemental irrigation was done when the rainfall was not enough unlike deficit irrigation our results were consistent with li and sun 2016 zhang et al 2006 under deep groundwater table regions the irrigation water use efficiency of maize increase up to a certain optimum the net economic benefit is an important factor when considering whether a new technique can be widely applied by local farmers as mo et al 2017 reported the adoption of water saving technologies can increase crop productivity and thereby increase the profit of producers rfm150 and rfm105 have a short return on investment period of 2 years rfm105 could be recommended as an economically optimal practice for maize production and for improving the livelihood of farmers in the loess plateau ex situ surface runoff harvesting and storing in a water cistern is a feasible option we expect to implement further scientific advances that can reduce the extensive input costs associated with rfm with supplemental irrigation practices for example doing tillage once in every two growing seasons using plastic film mulch for two consecutive years this will help in the adoption of rfm with supplemental irrigation practices within china and other countries as per our results and results from li and sun 2016 supplemental irrigation during the critical growth stages of maize is of great importance and increases shoot biomass and total grain yield the experiment also showed that maize production in semiarid regions might need large amounts of irrigation during some years but not in others for example in 2018 supplemental irrigation was applied thrice while in 2019 it was applied twice therefore our main objective was achieved the maize crop yield and cwp were improved by rfm with supplemental irrigation via harvesting overland runoff and saving in a water cistern beside the farmland 5 conclusion in this study ex situ rainwater harvesting for supplemental irrigation was investigated when combined with an in situ ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm farming system ex situ surface runoff harvesting and storing in a water cistern is a feasible option this makes rfm plus supplemental irrigation a capable planting technique in semiarid regions it provides soil moisture to meet crop water requirements during critical growth stages and regulates soil temperature hence improving shoot biomass and total grain yield of maize crop this system naturally maximizes the cwp and iwp about 105 mm irrigation amount in growing season harvested the highest productivity and profitability compared to 0 and 60 irrigation amounts and it had no significant difference with 150 mm irrigation amount across two growing seasons also this technique helps improve soil organic carbon and total nitrogen after the second fallow period therefore our findings provided an experimental evaluation on balancing the supply and demand mismatch of seasonal rainfall the ex situ rainwater harvesting supplemental irrigation might act as a promising solution to further improve field productivity and cope with climate change in a semiarid environment in conclusion the ex situ rainwater harvesting system showed great potential to upgrade the current widely used rfm farming system in a semiarid rainfed agricultural region the plastic film mulch should be used for two consecutive seasons and thereafter harvested and recycled to minimize plastic film residues in agricultural fields and maximize net profit under rfm combined with supplemental irrigation practices

9463,solving the disparity between rainwater supply and crop water demand is a fundamental issue in semiarid rainfed agriculture over the last decades the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm farming system has been widely used as an on site in situ rain harvesting farming strategy providing a partial solution to the supply demand mismatch of rainwater the off site rain harvesting system ex situ water cistern for supplemental irrigation has been little used we established an integrated ex situ rain harvesting system incorporated into maize rfm in a semiarid site of northwest china from 2018 to 2019 five treatments were designed as 1 ck 1 flat planting without mulching and irrigation 2 ck 2 rfm without irrigation 3 rfm60 rfm with 60 mm irrigation 4 rfm105 rfm with 105 mm irrigation and 5 rfm150 rfm with 150 mm irrigation we found that supplemental irrigation treatments significantly increased grain yield total biomass and crop water productivity compared to ck 1 and ck 2 p 0 05 across two growing seasons suggesting that ex situ rain harvesting irrigation can significantly promote field productivity based on widely used rfm system the differences mentioned above were the greatest in rfm105 and rfm150 significantly greater than those of rfm60 no significant difference was observed between rfm150 and rfm105 greater output in rfm150 and rfm105 was closely associated with improved soil water storage and thermal state in two growing seasons particularly rfm150 and rfm105 harvested the highest soil organic carbon and total nitrogen after the second fallow period the highest economic benefit was found in rfm105 followed by rfm150 and rfm60 the least in the two control groups our findings provided a critical case to solve the rainfall supply demand mismatch the ex situ rainwater harvesting supplemental irrigation can act as a promising solution to upgrade the current widely used rfm farming system for better adaptation to climate change in the semiarid region keywords ex situ rain harvesting ridge furrow plastic mulching supplemental irrigation maize productivity soil organic carbon 1 introduction agricultural production in the arid and semiarid regions is mainly constrained by severe water resource scarcity li et al 2019 li and gong 2002 in these regions crops growth and yield are hampered by limited precipitation fan et al 2014 severe water shortage occurs in the regions with mean annual precipitation of around 300 800 mm ali et al 2017 gu et al 2017 due to climate change the semiarid loess plateau in northwest china experiences low rainfall events 6 mm which cannot sustain crop production li et al 2001 liu and zhang 2007 in the loess plateau the growing season of maize zea mays l ranges from late april to september but over 50 of annual precipitation falls in the period from july to september meng et al 2017 xiaoli et al 2012 yan et al 2017 this discrepancy between rain season and maize growth cycle means that the lack of precipitation frequently inhibits crop production during the early stages reducing grain yield at later stages zhang et al 2014 water deficiencies at the different growth stages have diverse effects on maize growth due to sensitivity differences to drought çakir 2004 deng et al 2006 the greatest yield reductions resulting from water stress frequently take place from tassel emergence to silking stages debaeke and aboudrare 2004 grant et al 1989 li and sun 2016 over the last two decades the ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm farming system has been widely used as an in situ rainwater collection and utilization strategy in the loess plateau of china east african plateau and other asian countries feng et al 2017 mo et al 2018b rfm system is an efficient strategy to counter the drought risk throughout the crop growth cycle boers et al 1986 jiang et al 2013 it proves to be easily operated and efficient for soil and water management wu et al 2015 a lot of studies show that rfm significantly promotes crop growth and development including plant height dry matter and grain yield compared with conventional flat planting feng et al 2017 mo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 however water shortage would remain unavoidable during some crop growth stages in semiarid areas gu et al 2017 xiao et al 2007 zhou et al 2009 to avoid water stress during critical growth stages supplemental irrigation which combines dryland farming with limited irrigation on crop productivity under the rfm system could be an appropriate choice to avoid a high yield penalty and increase water use efficiency deng et al 2006 on the other hand due to climate change surface runoff has increased significantly over the last half century in northwest china s hilly and gully areas tao et al 2003 to some extent this may cause short term flood events but it can be used for agricultural purposes when well harvested theoretically farmer investments in ex situ water harvesting can significantly improve irrigation water availability bringing about a revival of the agricultural economy and substantially increasing farmers incomes and livelihoods a water cistern is a bottle shaped underground tank lined with either clay or cement tiles which store runoff from mainly natural soil surfaces or concrete lined catchment surfaces gould et al 2014 building a water cistern is a one time event that takes about seven days using locally available materials it does not require ongoing training for a project recipient to understand its use however ex situ rainwater collection through building a water cistern beside the farmland and reuse strategy is a potential solution to the contradiction between water supply and demand therefore there is an urgent need to promote new ways of addressing this mismatch consequently a field experiment was designed and conducted with the following objectives 1 to identify the effects of supplemental irrigation under rfm on maize growth crop water productivity and grain yield 2 to evaluate the influences of different treatments on soil quality soil organic carbon soc soil total nitrogen stn and soil organic carbon to soil total nitrogen ration c n ratio 3 to clarify the hydrothermal mechanism of this novel solution on field productivity and profitability and 4 to set up a successful case on the feasibility and application potential in the loess plateau and other similar areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiment was performed at a semiarid site i e the dryland rainfed agricultural station of lanzhou university at zhonglianchuan village in the northern hilly and gully region of yuzhong county gansu china 36 02 n 104 25 e and 2400 m above sea level during 2018 and 2019 the climate is temperate semiarid with an average annual precipitation of 350 mm about 65 occurring between june and september the local mean annual air temperature is 6 5 c july and august recorded the highest values of mean monthly temperature of 16 5 c and precipitation of 70 7 mm respectively according to the local average level over the last 15 years the experimental site soil is classified as heima soil with a loamy texture it has a field water holding capacity fwhc of 22 9 and a permanent wilting coefficient pwc of 6 2 zhou et al 2009 the average bulk density in the 0 200 cm soil layer is 1 2 g cm 3 the soil consists of 37 clay 0 002 mm 59 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 4 sand 0 05 2 0 mm zhang et al 2019 the top layer of soil 20 cm has a ph of 8 3 organic carbon of 6 4 g kg 1 total nitrogen of 0 7 g kg 1 available p of 3 2 mg kg 1 and available k of 159 5 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and treatments in this experiment a water cistern was established adjacent to the experimental field fig 1a and e and conducted supplemental irrigation from water cistern in the maize field on the basis of rfm application five treatments were designed 1 rfm with 60 mm irrigation rfm60 fig 1b 2 rfm with 105 mm irrigation rfm105 fig 1b 3 rfm with 150 mm irrigation rfm150 fig 1b 4 rfm without irrigation ck 2 fig 1c and 5 flat planting without mulching and irrigation ck 1 fig 1d respectively water supply for both the ck 1 and ck 2 was solely dependent on rainfall while in rfm60 rfm105 and rfm150 soil moisture was achieved through both rainfall and supplemental irrigation supplemental irrigation was applied at selected stages jointing tasseling and pre silking using a flooding surface irrigation method the supplemental irrigation water was channeled directly to the furrows the irrigation stages and amount for each treatment are presented in table 1 a water pump was used to pump irrigation water from the cistern to the field the irrigation water was channeled directly to the furrows using a plastic hose pipe fitted with a water meter ensuring each furrow had uniform water distribution before irrigation weather forecasting was monitored to ensure no or little rainfall was expected for seven days the rfm had a ridge height of 15 cm and a width of 30 cm while furrows were 20 cm wide a transparent plastic film of 0 008 mm thickness and 140 cm length was used for covering both the ridge and furrows completely except for ck 1 which was left bare at the jointing point of two pieces of plastic films in the middle of a furrow the plastic was fixed by placing soil on the film surface the furrows were closed at the end of each plot to hold back the irrigation water to facilitate the infiltration of rainwater and irrigation water into the soil profile holes measuring 2 cm in diameter were made on the plastic mulch in the furrow at a spacing of 0 6 m using an iron rod on all treatments except ck 1 fig 1b the treatments were applied to 20 m2 5 m by 4 m plots with a gap of 0 8 m between the plots to minimize the leakage of irrigation water from one plot to the other each treatment was replicated three times in a randomized arrangement chemical fertilizers consisting of 150 kg ha 1 in the form of urea 46 n and 165 kg ha 1 in the form of superphosphate 12 p were broadcasted and incorporated into the top 30 cm the ridges furrows and film mulching in all treatments except ck 1 were done on 28 april 2018 and 22 april 2019 respectively using a hand hole drilling machine maize seeds zea mays kenyu no 10 were sown 4 5 cm deep through the plastic film by making holes in the furrows for rfm treatments on 29 april 2018 and 23 april 2019 respectively each plot had a planting density of 100 plants 50 000 plants per hectare the harvesting took place on 15 october 2018 and 9 october 2019 respectively 2 3 sampling and measurements during the growing season the soil temperature dynamics 0 15 cm were monitored using data loggers elitech usb temperature rc 5 placed in the soil in the middle of the furrow and plants in a row in each treatment plot the data loggers were configured to record the soil temperature at an interval of 5 h for three consecutive days at seedling jointing silking and maturity growth stages the mean growth stage temperature ⁰c was calculated using the four daily readings soil water storage was determined gravimetrically swc to a depth of 100 cm at 20 cm intervals at jointing 53 60 days after sowing das silking 94 103 das and to a depth of 200 cm before sowing and harvesting 130 141 das in each plot soil samples were taken in the middle part between two plants in the furrows using an 8 cm diameter hand auger the soil samples were quickly weighed and then reweighed after oven drying for 48 h at 105 c the soil water storage sws mm was calculated according to the following formula sws mm swc bd sd where swc is the gravimetric soil water content bd is soil bulk density g cm 3 and sd is the soil depth mm three soil samples at 0 20 cm depth were taken randomly in each plot s furrow before sowing jointing silking and maturity during the two growing seasons and fallow period in 2020 the subsamples from each plot were pooled together to make a composite fresh soil samples were air dried at room temperature and pressed to pass a 0 15 mm sieve soil organic carbon soc was determined using potassium dichromate oxidation which was based on the walkley black chromic acid wet oxidation method while soil total nitrogen stn was measured using a kj kjeldahl auto analyzer sdk 800 shanghai peiou analytical instrument china c n ratio was then calculated for each sample shoot biomass total of grain cob cores leaves and stem was determined at the maturity growth stage five plants were randomly selected and cut off at the first nodule on the stem the harvested shoots were chopped into small pieces oven dried at 105 c for 1 h then at 75 c for a minimum period of 24 h till constant weight was achieved at maturity maize ears were manually harvested and grain yield was measured by harvesting 10 m2 from the center of each plot for all treatments the crop water productivity cwp kg ha 1mm 1 was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield per unit area to the total water consumption for the whole season while irrigation water productivity iwp kg ha 1mm 1 was calculated as the ratio of the grain yield per unit area to the total irrigation amount applied for the whole season according to the following equations cwp y et where y is the maize grain yield kg ha 1 and et mm is the corresponding actual crop evapotranspiration in each growing season iwp yi yd ir where yi is the grain yield with irrigation kg ha 1 and yd is the grain yield for ck 2 or an equivalent rainfed field kg ha 1 and ir is the amount of irrigation water applied mm chai et al 2015 fernández et al 2020 the experimental field was flat thus no runoff was observed during the experiment the drainage was considered insignificant over a depth of 200 cm because the rainfall was so low to cause drainage below 200 cm therefore evapotranspiration et mm was estimated using the following formula et p i δsws where p is the total precipitation within a growing season mm i is the total supplemental irrigation mm and δsws is the change in soil water storage at sowing and harvest mm to evaluate the practicability of the technology in improving small households livelihood we calculated the economic benefit based on the inputs used and the total output in the present economic evaluation system the economic return was

edition vsn international ltd vsni uk was used with irrigation amount as a factor the least significant differences lsd0 05 were used to detect mean differences between the treatments and further separated by fisher least significant difference origin 9 1 software was used to make all the figures 3 results 3 1 precipitation and air temperature during the experimental period in 2018 and 2019 total precipitation during the maize growing season 20 april 30 september was 401 and 362 mm respectively fig 2 2018 was a wet year compared with the 15 year average of 300 mm and 2019 was a normal year although 2018 received more precipitation over 50 occurred in august and september while in 2019 the precipitation was well distributed with about 70 occurring from april july the monthly mean air temperatures fig 2 in may the first month after sowing were 11 9 c and 9 7 c for 2018 and 2019 on average the mean air temperature during both growing seasons was insignificantly different with 11 1 c and 10 7 c for 2018 and 2019 respectively 3 2 soil hydrothermal state 3 2 1 soil water storage 0 100 cm the soil water storage dynamic changes at 100 cm soil depths with a 20 cm increment in all treatments at jointing silking and maturity stages in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons are displayed in fig 3 the trend of sws was rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 2 ck 1 in 2018 whereas in 2019 rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 2 ck 1 at the jointing stage in both years ck 1 had the lowest sws as compared to other treatments in the 2018 season soil water content was consistently lower in rfm60 than in rfm105 and rfm150 but insignificantly different to ck 2 in the 2019 season the same trend as 2018 was observed at the silking stage but at the maturity stage all treatments were significantly different from each other except rfm105 and rfm150 the variation trend was also observed through the soil profile fig 3 the soil water content was mostly significantly higher on rfm150 and rfm105 on the top 60 cm soil depth for both years from 60 100 cm the differences in sws decreased with increasing depth the soil water conditions were well regulated at critical growth stages by the different irrigation amounts and rfm and maize crop well reacted to soil water conditions 3 2 2 soil temperature variation mean daily soil temperature variations at the top 15 cm soil depth for seedling jointing silking and maturity are shown in fig 4 the soil temperatures at 15 cm soil depth followed the same trend as the air temperature in the two years across all the planting patterns values gradually increased after sowing reaching their maximum value at around 60 das and then decreased until maturity no significant difference in mean daily soil temperature was observed between the treatments during the seedling stage ck 1 significantly recorded the highest soil temperature at the jointing stage which was followed by ck 2 and rfm60 insignificantly different then by rfm105 and rfm150 for both growing seasons at silking as compared to ck 1 rfm150 and rfm105 reduced soil temperature by 2 6 c in 2018 and 2 5 c in 2019 during this stage rfm60 and ck 2 were not significantly different although they reduced soil temperature by 1 7 c and 1 5 c in 2018 and 1 9 c and 2 c in 2019 as compared to ck 1 respectively at maturity the soil temperatures differences magnitude decreased as compared to ck 2 and ck 1 3 3 soil nutrients in our study the stn content differed between the different treatments and the growing seasons fig 5a in general stn contents decreased in all treatments from sowing to silking then increased through maturity to the fallow period in both growing seasons in 2018 the differences in stn contents in all treatments were not significant except at maturity at maturity rfm150 and rfm105 had higher stn content in the soil of 0 46 and 0 43 g kg 1 respectively there was only a slight increase in stn for rfm60 compared to both ck treatments fig 5a in 2019 rfm150 and rfm105 maintained a significant difference in stn content in the soil throughout the growing period on average the differences in stn during the 2019 2020 furrow period and before sowing in 2018 was 0 17 0 23 0 13 0 13 and 0 05 g kg 1 for rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 2 and ck 1 respectively the soc content values at early growth stages sowing and jointing were not significantly different among the treatments fig 5b however the amount of soil carbon consumption varied with the treatments and growing seasons in both growing seasons soc content was inclined to decrease in each treatment from sowing to maturity this suggested an increase in biomass accumulation resulted in higher soc consumption there was no significant difference in soc consumption between the treatments from jointing to maturity in 2018 while during the 2019 growing season rfm150 and rfm105 averagely had significantly more soc in the soil of 6 4 g kg 1 rfm60 was insignificantly different from ck 2 with 6 1 g kg 1 and ck 1 had the lowest soc of 5 8 g kg 1 respectively there was a significant increase in soc content in the soil during the fallow period in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 this was mainly because of the biological breakdown of crop residue and mineralization of organic matter in the soil system on average during fallow periods soc content in the soil significantly increased by 0 6 and 0 7 g kg 1 in 2018 2019 and 0 4 and 0 3 g kg 1 in 2019 2020 for rfm150 and rfm105 respectively fig 5b in 2018 2019 the increment was higher because data was collected after fertilization although rfm60 was significantly higher than ck 1 it was insignificantly different from ck 2 both with 0 4 and 0 2 g kg 1 for 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 fallow periods average at the end of two growing seasons fallow period 2019 2020 minus before sowing 2018 soc was increased by 0 39 and 0 36 g kg 1 for rfm150 and rfm105 while rfm60 ck 2 and ck 1 decreased soc by 0 03 0 15 and 0 2 g kg 1 respectively lastly the c n ratio first increased from sowing to silking and decreased up to the fallow period in 2018 2019 fig 5c in the 2019 growing season it slightly increased from sowing to maturity and then it turned to decrease during the fallow period in 2019 2020 across the growing periods rfm150 and rfm105 significantly reduced the c n ratio by 4 41 and 4 63 while rfm60 was insignificantly different from ck 2 with 3 36 and ck 1 the least with 1 97 respectively fig 5c 3 4 cpw and iwp on a biomass basis the shoot biomass total of grain cob cores leaves and stem accumulation during the maturity stage is shown in table 2 the shoot biomass accumulated in 2018 was greater than that of 2019 as a result of irrigation water since most of the precipitation occurred later in the growing season the shoot biomass crop water productivity cwps was significantly higher for ck 2 followed by rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 with 28 95 26 45 26 04 and 26 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 27 11 25 77 27 00 and 26 31 kg ha 1 mm 1 for 2018 and 2019 respectively ck 1 recorded the least cwps in both years table 2 the shoot biomass irrigation water productivity iwps was significantly higher for rfm150 with 17 30 kg ha 1 mm 1 followed by rfm105 with 13 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 then rfm60 with 12 17 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 while in 2019 rfm150 had 42 55 kg ha 1 mm 1 followed by rfm60 with 37 25 kg ha 1 mm 1 then rfm105 with 32 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 3 5 cwp and iwp on a yield basis the et and amount of precipitation received during the growing season are shown in table 2 in the 2018 growing season the precipitation was 401 mm and et values were 527 490 454 392 and 389 mm for rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 1 and ck 2 respectively in the 2019 growing season the precipitation was lower 362 mm than in 2018 but was well distributed the et values for rfm150 rfm105 rfm60 ck 1 and ck 2 were 434 395 371 325 and 334 mm respectively these results indicated that the et was significantly different among different treatments and between the growing seasons grain yield was 4884 and 4756 kg ha 1 in the 2018 season and 4427 and 4385 kg ha 1 in the 2019 growing season for rfm150 and rfm105 table 2 the differences were insignificant between the two treatments this showed that the additional water supply above 105 mm did not increase the grain yield rfm60 had a grain yield of 3133 kg ha 1 in 2018 which was not significantly different from ck 2 but significantly different from ck 1 table 2 in the 2019 growing season rfm60 recorded 3657 kg ha 1 which was significantly different from ck 2 3170 kg ha 1 and ck 1 1279 kg ha 1 the grain yield crop water productivity cwpy was insignificantly different during the 2018 growing season for rfm150 and rfm105 with 9 23 and 9 69 kg ha 1 mm 1 while rfm60 had the lowest cwpy of 6 89 kg ha 1 mm 1 for irrigation treatments which were not significantly different from ck 2 respectively in the 2019 season rfm105 recorded the highest cwpy of 10 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 while rfm150 rfm60 were not significantly different from ck 2 ck 1 had the lowest cwpy table 2 grain yield irrigation water productivity iwpy was significantly higher for rfm105 in both growing seasons with 16 70 and 17 36 kg ha 1 mm 1 for 2018 and 2019 respectively rfm150 recorded an iwpy of 12 55 and 12 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 while rfm60 recorded 2 18 and 12 18 kg ha 1 mm 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively table 2 when the et was increased from 455 to 490 mm the iwpy increased by 2 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 but when et was increased from 490 to 527 the cwpy was not significantly increased in 2018 while in 2019 when the et was increased from 395 to 434 mm the cwpy significantly decreased by 1 04 kg ha 1 mm 1 table 2 3 6 economic benefit in assessing the reception extent by local farmers under climate change conditions we analyzed the economic benefit we estimated the net incomes under different treatments across the two growing seasons table 3 in comparison with ck 2 three irrigated treatments required additional inputs such as the purchase of irrigation equipment and water cistern construction of 1540 us ha 1 the net income was calculated according to the return on investment period due to extra irrigation labor the total labor for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 was increased by 1622 3 us ha 1 in the first growing seasons than ck 2 on average according to the real time local market price the total input values were 2959 2 us ha 1 for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 while ck 2 and ck 1 were 1333 9 and 1011 8 us ha 1 in 2018 respectively the total input for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 in 2019 was not the same as for 2018 because irrigation was applied twice and the water cistern construction cost was not included in the second year and subsequent years for a period of 20 years which is water cistern s service life table 1 the corresponding total output value including grain and straw harvest in both years was increased by 33 6 36 7 and 11 1 for rfm150 rfm105 and rfm60 as compared with ck 2 respectively the net income for both growing seasons was increased by 213 1 in rfm150 238 9 in rfm105 and 28 9 in rfm60 compared with ck 2 respectively ck 1 incurred losses in both growing seasons table 3 finally the average output to input ratio was 0 9 1 for rfm150 and rfm105 while rfm60 was 0 8 1 and ck 2 1 1 1 respectively therefore rfm150 and rfm105 have a return on investment period of 2 years while rfm60 has 3 5 years 4 discussion rainwater harvesting supplemental irrigation under rfm at different growth stages impacted soil water storage soil temperature and soil nutrients which led to a change in total shoot biomass and grain yield for maize crop in loess plateau the maize crop in the semiarid loess plateau is constrained by water stress during early growth stages as a result of precipitation mismatch meng et al 2017 yan et al 2017 supplemental irrigation under rfm at jointing tasseling and pre silking could reduce yield losses by reducing moisture stress and optimization of soil temperature 4 1 soil hydrothermal dynamics previous studies have reported that rfm can improve soil hydrothermal conditions for dryland agriculture in arid and semiarid regions dong et al 2018 feng et al 2017 gu et al 2017 mo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 also irrigation under the surface of plastic mulch is an effective way to reduce soil evaporation deng et al 2006 in our study irrigation under rfm improved soil moisture in the furrows due to the redirection of rainwater falling on the ridges into the furrows ren et al 2008 besides this the supplemental water directed on the furrows the plastic film helped reduce soil evaporation and increase crop canopy hence increasing moisture availability oweis and hachum 2006 the treatment with less irrigation i e rfm60 had low soil water storage because irrigation water tends to accumulate at the shallow layers fig 3 our results were in line with what hao et al 2015 found at the maturity stage during the first growing season when the crop had reached full physiological maturity there was high soil moisture under rfm150 and rfm105 treatments because of rainwater from late 2018 incorporated with irrigation during silking this unused water is deposited in moderately deep soil layers which led to higher soil moisture earlier in the following season this was in agreement with research done by oweis et al 2005 the rainwater from late 2018 plus irrigation water during silking was stored in slightly deeper layers effects of plastic mulching on soil temperature in agricultural fields have been widely reported in research literatures rfm improves soil temperature for seedling establishment in spring sown crops mo et al 2018a at early growth stages a small plant canopy allows most of the soil surface mulched with plastic film to receive solar energy causing the topsoil to warm quickly mo et al 2017 as we found out in this study plastic mulched treatments had higher soil temperature during the seedling stage as compared with flat bare treatment the soil temperature at the topsoil under rfm and supplemental irrigation decrease during the vegetative growth of a crop as a result of overshadowing li et al 2016 in this study the same results were observed at 15 cm soil depth where rfm150 and rfm105 had significantly lower soil temperature during the vegetative growth stage as compared with other treatments fig 4 the other treatments were observed to have high soil temperatures because a small plant canopy during early growth stages allows penetration of solar radiations which heats the topsoil li et al 2016 in the loess plateau low soil temperatures at early crop stages can significantly influence crop development from these results it can be concluded that rfm plus supplemental irrigation plays a critical role in regulating soil temperature during the crop growth period 4 2 relations between supplemental irrigation and soil nutrients soc is associated with biological and chemical measures of soil quality and it plays a great role in maintaining a soil nutrient pool and improving the availability of soil nutrients li et al 2004 liu et al 2014 in our study soc across all the treatments decreased from sowing up to maturity only to restock during the fallow period fig 5 rfm plus supplemental irrigation during critical growth stages of maize crop played a crucial role in improving the soil hydrothermal state this improved soil hydrothermal conditions aids in accelerating organic matter decomposition which plays a significant effect on replacing depleted soc as reported in mo et al 2017 although li et al 2004 reported that burying crop residues in the soil could reduce the depletion rate of soc there were no residues intentionally added to the soil in this study still improved biomass production under rfm plus supplemental irrigation treatments showed a positive soc balance during the fallow period this showed that the soc which was lost within the growing period was restored during the fallow period therefore the rfm plus supplemental irrigation of 150 and 105 mm which increased the soc content in the soil within two years played a role in returning more organic matter to the soil system and hence improving soil quality even though the study area had a very low soc content which is quite often more obstinate as li et al 2004 found our results were in agreement with qiu et al 2018 that soc content increases under supplemental irrigation in arid and semiarid regions high c n ratio of above 1 24 may slow down the organic matter decomposition rate hence limiting the soil microbial activities while a low c n ratio may accelerate the mineralization rate hence increasing nutrients availability chen et al 2014 in this study the c n ratio was low hence increased nutrients availability for crop development during the fallow period the c n ratio declined rapidly under rfm150 and rfm105 indicating a high rate of mineralization of soil organic nitrogen resulting from improved soil hydrothermal conditions fig 5c therefore c n ratio which is a sign of soil quality was well recovered the stn declined from sowing to silking in 2018 in all treatments this decline may have been due to high allocation of nitrogen for biomass formation at the vegetative stages or increased nitrogen lock up in the bodies of microorganisms due to the high soc stn ratio a positive trend of total nitrogen from maturity through the fallow period might have resulted from the release of microbial bound nitrogen thus becoming available in the soil 4 3 maize productivity cwp and profitability our results were consistent during the two growing seasons showing clearly that rfm plus supplemental irrigation significantly affected cwp shoot biomass and total grain yield rfm150 and rfm105 registered higher both shoot biomass and total grain yield table 2 previous researches have proven that rfm is an effective technique to improve yield and cwp in wheat significantly ali et al 2019 maize mo et al 2018 and oilseed rape gu et al 2019 2017 in arid and semiarid regions due to improved hydrothermal conditions soil nutrients and water absorption were positively impacted promoting crop growth under rfm plus supplemental irrigation practices as li et al 2019 and li and sun 2016 found the shoot biomass was greater in 2018 as compared to 2019 table 2 this is because of higher precipitation that occurred immediately after sowing in april and good soil water storage as a result of supplemental irrigation the results indicate that supplemental irrigation could increase shoot biomass with an irrigation amount of 105 mm iwps was higher in rfm150 showing that most of the supplemental irrigation water was used for biomass formation as earlier reported rfm plus supplemental irrigation improved soil moisture in the furrows and may be reduced drought stress hence rfm105 presented the highest grain yield among all the treatments in both years although it was not significantly higher than rfm150 table 2 remarkably the first year had a higher grain yield than the second year for rfm105 and rfm150 whereas rfm60 ck 2 and ck 1 had a higher yield in the second year this phenomenon was owed to the good distribution of the precipitation within the crop growing season in the second year although the first year received higher rainfall 401 mm within the growing season it was not well distributed fig 2 most of the rainfall occurred in august 141 mm hence positively influencing rfm105 and rfm150 treatments on crop growth this is because from jointing to silking precipitation was insufficient hence the crops were exposed to water stress which was minimized by supplemental irrigation supplemental irrigation around the pre silking prolonged duration of grain filling whereby it extends the functional period of leaves which can in turn increase grain weight verma et al 2004 this was shown in this study by rfm150 and rfm105 increasing cwp has been a key objective in most of the researches whereby it can enhance grain yields li et al 2019 the rainfall patterns mainly influenced cwp for maize yield treated with supplemental irrigation combined with rfm during the growing season on the other hand rfm is known to reduce soil evaporation hence improving crop yield without taking advantage of the et as it was shown in our study by ck 2 which had a lower et than ck oweis et al 2005 discovered that the higher the rainfall the higher the et our study showed the same results whereby 2018 had a higher et than in 2019 this is attributed to increased plant transpiration rfm150 and rfm105 had higher et which was induced by a greater amount of irrigation water gao et al 2017 results were consistent with ours whereby the et increased with greater water input rfm105 increased cwpy and total grain yield by 5 26 and 38 3 58 4 respectively while rfm150 increased cwpy by 21 in the first year but was significantly lower in the second year than ck 2 this improvement by rfm105 and rfm150 was may be due to the effective use of supplemental irrigation which was applied by retaining more soil water combined with decreased soil evaporation because of plastic mulch this increased the crop transpiration rate leading to biomass accumulation thus improving grain yield ali et al 2016 iwpy like cwpy increased with increasing supplemental irrigation amount table 2 in our study the results were opposite of what gao et al 2017 and dogan et al 2011 found that iwp decreases with increasing irrigation amount although it increased up to 105 mm and decreased with more water application this is because maybe in our experiment supplemental irrigation was done when the rainfall was not enough unlike deficit irrigation our results were consistent with li and sun 2016 zhang et al 2006 under deep groundwater table regions the irrigation water use efficiency of maize increase up to a certain optimum the net economic benefit is an important factor when considering whether a new technique can be widely applied by local farmers as mo et al 2017 reported the adoption of water saving technologies can increase crop productivity and thereby increase the profit of producers rfm150 and rfm105 have a short return on investment period of 2 years rfm105 could be recommended as an economically optimal practice for maize production and for improving the livelihood of farmers in the loess plateau ex situ surface runoff harvesting and storing in a water cistern is a feasible option we expect to implement further scientific advances that can reduce the extensive input costs associated with rfm with supplemental irrigation practices for example doing tillage once in every two growing seasons using plastic film mulch for two consecutive years this will help in the adoption of rfm with supplemental irrigation practices within china and other countries as per our results and results from li and sun 2016 supplemental irrigation during the critical growth stages of maize is of great importance and increases shoot biomass and total grain yield the experiment also showed that maize production in semiarid regions might need large amounts of irrigation during some years but not in others for example in 2018 supplemental irrigation was applied thrice while in 2019 it was applied twice therefore our main objective was achieved the maize crop yield and cwp were improved by rfm with supplemental irrigation via harvesting overland runoff and saving in a water cistern beside the farmland 5 conclusion in this study ex situ rainwater harvesting for supplemental irrigation was investigated when combined with an in situ ridge furrow plastic mulching rfm farming system ex situ surface runoff harvesting and storing in a water cistern is a feasible option this makes rfm plus supplemental irrigation a capable planting technique in semiarid regions it provides soil moisture to meet crop water requirements during critical growth stages and regulates soil temperature hence improving shoot biomass and total grain yield of maize crop this system naturally maximizes the cwp and iwp about 105 mm irrigation amount in growing season harvested the highest productivity and profitability compared to 0 and 60 irrigation amounts and it had no significant difference with 150 mm irrigation amount across two growing seasons also this technique helps improve soil organic carbon and total nitrogen after the second fallow period therefore our findings provided an experimental evaluation on balancing the supply and demand mismatch of seasonal rainfall the ex situ rainwater harvesting supplemental irrigation might act as a promising solution to further improve field productivity and cope with climate change in a semiarid environment in conclusion the ex situ rainwater harvesting system showed great potential to upgrade the current widely used rfm farming system in a semiarid rainfed agricultural region the plastic film mulch should be used for two consecutive seasons and thereafter harvested and recycled to minimize plastic film residues in agricultural fields and maximize net profit under rfm combined with supplemental irrigation practices

9464,capturing and reusing fertigation drainage is a key strategy for maximizing greenhouse production efficiency while minimizing the impact of wastewater discharge on receiving ecosystems fertigation drainage in this regard refers to irrigation water mixed with fertilizer that has once passed through soilless culture although an economically and environmentally prudent practice recirculating fertigation solutions does pose an increased risk of pathogen proliferation there are many water disinfection technologies currently available to growers including ozone o3 aq and advanced oxidation processes aop beyond currently available treatment options there are emerging technologies that have yet to be optimized for recirculating hydroponics electrochemical systems based on dimensionally stable anodes dsa offer a novel method for disinfecting fertigation using cyclamen persicum as a representative greenhouse floriculture crop fertigation solutions were inoculated with fusarium oxysporum isolated from a diseased c persicum sample following inoculation solutions were treated with one of either a dsa electrochemical system a uv ozone aop system or ozonation solutions were then applied to the crop and disease progression was monitored the positive control group f oxysporum added exhibited pathogenicity following the recirculation of the fertigation solution while the negative control f oxysporum absent did not show pathogenicity in c persicum all water treatment systems achieved a log 4 reduction in f oxysporum which prevented pathogenicity in plants furthermore there were no significant differences in plant physiology between the water treatment methods in comparison to the negative control group however all treatments performed significantly better than the positive control group which experienced pathogenicity solution nutrient analysis indicated stability across all treatments energy consumption was also monitored and demonstrated a two fold reduction in electricity use with the electrochemical flow cell efc compared to the aop system keywords electrochemical fertigation disinfection pathogen greenhouse recirculation 1 introduction agriculture is increasingly dependent on the reuse of irrigation water as concerns over the environmental impact of water taking and agricultural wastewater discharge grow peters and meybeck 2000 verhoeven et al 2006 further ever increasing water scarcity is threatening supplies not only in terms of absolute quantities distributed amongst a growing number of stakeholders but also in terms of the quality of available water resources pereira et al 2002 water scarcity is an existential threat that if not addressed in the face of an ever growing human population will lead to political and

of the total 80 litres of fertigation solution was completed every 1 5 weeks for a total of 4 recirculation s over the 6 week experimental period 2 4 water treatment technologies controls did not have any water treatment technologies in place for inactivating pathogens the remaining water treatments used for treating inoculated fertigation solutions were ozonation o3 aq aop o3 aq uv and an efc outfitted with dsa electrodes ozonation was performed using a stabilized aqueous ozone dispenser lqfc225k tersano inc canada and oxygen concentrator as013 5 airsep corporation usa modifications to the ozone system were made to accommodate the larger back pressures imposed by the drip irrigation system modifications included the swapping out of a venturi injector 287 mazzei injector company usa and the addition of a ½ inch hdpe hose with static diffusers downstream from the venturi injector the aop used matching components for ozonation ozone dispenser and oxygen concentrator but included a uv lamp gauv 6sm greenway water technologies canada downstream from the ozone system supplementary figure 2 ultraviolet dosage was monitored during treatment with 80 transmittance at an intensity of 75 mj cm2 to the fertigation solution ozonation and aop treatments were measured for concentrations of aqueous ozone using ozone accuvac ampules 2518025 hach company usa and a colourimeter dr 850 hach

the residual ozone was below 0 01 mmol l before applying to crops the aop treatment measured a residual ozone concentration 0 0002 mmol l following treatment with the uv lamp and was applied directly to plants following treatment the efc treatment with dsa followed the previous methods described by lévesque et al 2019 an applied current density of 4 55 ma cm2 with a 1 minute contact time 0 38 l min was used in the study these parameters were chosen for the study as previous work demonstrated the complete inactivation of pathogens while limiting the effluent concentrations of free chlorine

growth and water quality analysis after 6 weeks of growth noticeable differences became apparent between treatments and were evaluated for plant growth disease severity and water quality characteristics disease severity index was assessed by four levels from healthy plants a leaf necrosis b wilting c and crown rot d fig 2 plant growth was evaluated at the end of the growth period by measuring total number of leaves total leaf area average petiole length and dry weights of plants total leaf area of plants was measured by removing leaves and passing through a leaf area meter li 3100 c li cor inc usa final dry weight measurements were performed by adding fresh plants in paper bags dried over 4 days at 55 c in a drying oven ov 510a 2 blue m electric company usa and weighed ms32001l mettler toledo switzerland water quality was analyzed for each recirculation reservoir 1 and after each treatment reservoir 2 by taking 3 subsamples of fertigation water from both reservoirs individual macro and micronutrient ions were measured by a shimadzu hplc system consisting of a dgu 20a3 degasser a sil 10ap autosampler two lc 20at pumps two cdd 10a vp conductivity detectors cto 20ac column oven and cbm 20a system controller initial treatment samples were analyzed for pathogen inactivation by performing serial dilutions and counted in petri dishes for colony forming units analysis after incubating for 2 days as described by lévesque et al 2019 all petri dishes contained pda agar and antibiotics as previously described in the pathogen culturing methods 2 6 statistical analysis all graphical figures and statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program jmp version 14 0 sas institute inc usa residuals were tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test all data was determined to have a normal distribution statistical analysis on plant growth parameters number of leaves leaf area petiole length and dry weights was conducted by performing a one way anova significance established at α 0 05 significant differences in individual macronutrients and micronutrients were determined through regression slope analysis 3 results pathogen inactivation was monitored for all treatments within the first pass from reservoir one towards reservoir two fig 3 there were no significant differences in colony forming units of f oxysporum in water passing between reservoirs for the positive control p 0 3508 this confirmed that viable pathogens were capable of passing through the irrigation system to reach the crop sampling of the negative control treatment failed to detect additional pathogens such that any disease symptoms that developed could be ascribed to the inoculation with f oxysporum all of the water treatment technologies tested were capable of achieving complete inactivation of pathogens fig 3 after six weeks of growth all treatments exhibited significant differences p 0 05 in comparison to the positive control for leaf area number of leaves petiole length and dry weights of c persicum fig 4 in comparison to the negative control all water treatment technologies used during the study were not found to have significant differences in plant growth furthermore no visual differences were observed between water treatment methods though clear differences in the health of plants were discerned with the positive control due to pathogenicity fig 5 all plants within the positive control were classified between categories 1 3 using the disease severity index while plants in the negative control and water treatment strategies were classified as category 4 or healthy fertigation solutions for all treatments were analyzed for individual macro and micronutrients in solution after each treatment recirculation phase nitrates were shown to remain relatively constant until reaching the third recirculation of the fertigation solution fig 6 the fertigation solution collected from the negative control was determined to have a slope of zero and no significant difference was observed however during the last recirculation there was a large decrease in nitrate by approximately 2 42 mmol l some water treatment technologies were shown to have significantly increasing slopes for dsa p 0 0016 and ozone p 0 0494 while aop did not have any significant increases p 0 5300 the positive control had the largest significant increase in nitrate p 0 0001 comparison to all treatments significant changes in total concentration of orthophosphate were only found for the positive control treatment p 0 0004 while all treatments had slopes that were significantly decreasing for ammonium p 0 0001 fig 7 potassium showed no significant differences in the slopes for aop dsa and ozonation although sharp declines were experienced with the first recirculation of the solution potassium did have a significant decrease with the negative control p 0 0001 and a significant increase with the positive control p 0 0079 sulphate concentration was shown to increase in all treatments p 0 0001 except for dsas and the negative control which did not exhibit any difference fig 8 all treatments resulted in a large increase in sulphate and gradual decrease with increasing number of passes through the system however dsas and negative control both experienced a large increase during the first recirculation and a larger decline in sulphate with consecutive recirculations the larger declines can be caused by differences in plant uptake or possibly anion exchange rates between the soil and fertigation solution furthermore the decline in sulphate from dsas could be caused by chemical reduction at the cathode leading to sulphur being incorporated in limescale in contrast the other treatments experienced a gradual decline with consecutive recirculations all treatments exhibited increases for magnesium and calcium in the fertigation solution p 0 0001 both magnesium and calcium were shown to increase the most with the positive control with increasing recirculations significant increases in the concentration of iron were only observed for the positive control treatment with increasing number of recirculations p 0 0001 fig 9 all other treatments were not found to exhibit any significant differences however aop and ozone treatments exhibited decreases in iron followed by treatments during the recirculation phases 2 5 and 3 5 the dsa treatment also showed signs of a decreasing trend after the first recirculation though the decrease appears to be more gradual similar to the aop treatment all treatments were not found to have significant increases in chloride with only marginal increases of 0 04 mmol l over the growth period of 3 weeks fig 10 increases can be attributed to low uptake and evapotranspiration from plants over time chloride levels for the dsa treatment were higher due to the addition of kcl for introducing 0 57 mmol l of cl in solution 3 1 water treatment cost analysis the energy consumption from all water treatment technologies without the added energy requirement costs of irrigation pumps and carbon filters removal of atmospheric ozone is summarized in table 2 the cost of ozonation was directly provided by the power consumption for the tersano ozone dispenser and by the oxygen concentrator the cost for aop was the same as the ozonation treatment though with the added power consumption of the uv light the cost for the electrochemical flow cell was directly related to the power consumption provided to the electrodes for maintaining a current density of 4 55 ma cm2 energy consumption from the efc was determined to be 2 times lower than aop and ozonation treatments when corrected for differences in treatment times required to achieve the target result 4 discussion fusarium oxysporum was shown to remain unchanged in the positive control while the negative control did not have the presence of the pathogen in the fertigation solution the difference between these treatments demonstrated that pathogenicity observed in the positive control was solely caused by the presence of the inoculated pathogen in the fertigation solution the water treatment technologies tested including ozonation aop and dsa were all shown to be effective in achieving the complete inactivation of f oxysporum in solution furthermore the in situ chlorination method was found to achieve higher inactivation rates through a log 4 reduction of f oxysporum in comparison to chlorine dosing rodriguez et al 2018 these inactivation rates can be attributed to the regenerative hypochlorination process previously described kapalka et al 2010 lévesque et al 2019 liang et al 2005 enhanced inactivation through the in situ process can also be attributed to additional factors such as an acidic environment at the anode causing non enzymatic proteolysis kraft 2008 permentier and bruins 2004 furthermore electroporation could also play a role in increasing the permeability of cell membranes that can lead to the loss of function in cells drees et al 2003 physico chemical factors in combination can likely explain the higher inactivation rates that are achieved in comparison to conventional chlorine injection methods aronsson and rönner 2001 vega mercado et al 1996 the inoculation of f oxysporum was shown to be highly infectious through the rapid damage of c persicum in the positive control treatment plants in the negative control did not exhibit any symptoms of pathogenicity from other potential pathogens that might have been present in the greenhouse furthermore none of the plants subjected to the various water treatment technologies exhibited any of the adverse effects exhibited by the positive control treatment upon analyzing the plant growth parameters for number of leaves leaf areas petiole length and dry weights there were no significant differences between water treatment methods and the negative control however all treatments did have significant differences in plant growth in comparison to the positive control previous research has shown concern over the effects of chloramines date et al 2005 lévesque et al 2019 premuzic et al 2007 and other organo halogenated compounds lonigro et al 2017 that can reside in the soil substrate which can have an impact on plant growth while previous research has found phytotoxic 0 004 mmol l nh2cl in hydroponically grown lettuce there were no measurable decreases in the physiological health of c persicum this could be largely due to a hardier and less chlorine sensitive root system as well as soil organic matter acting as a buffer which resulted in no negative effects in plant growth furthermore previous results have determined that the concentrations of free and combined chlorine delivered to plants were approximately 0 004 mmol l and 0 03 mmol l lévesque et al 2019 although negative impacts were not found in this type of ornamental crop electrochemical chlorination must be used cautiously for free and combined chlorine with more chlorine sensitive crops such as lettuce nonetheless when using the efc system with the tested current density 4 55 ma cm2 this supplied a free chlorine concentration of 0 004 mmol l which still conforms with safe irrigation practices and human consumption lonigro et al 2017 in this study all the water treatment strategies exhibited acceptable crop protection when presented with pathogen concentrations that could potentially decimate greenhouse production systems therefore other factors that may differentiate the relative merits of the techniques will be considered such as nutrient dynamics energy consumption and ease of use using soil in a recirculating irrigation system can be challenging to monitor and maintain nutrients which may become depleted or accumulate in the substrate in this study all nutrient concentrations remained relatively stable for the first 3 recirculations mainly due to the resupply of fertigation water after the second recirculation however by the 4th recirculation there were some fluctuations in nutrients due to the increase in plant growth interactions with the substrate development of algae and some minor effects of water treatment strategies nitrate was shown to decrease in the negative control while slight increases were exhibited in the ozonation aop and dsa treatments the delayed decrease in nitrate could be attributed to the water treatment technologies nitrifying nh4 and other organic sources den blanken 1985 geenens et al 2001 as well as potential promotion of biological nitrification schroeder et al 2015 this may have caused the concentration of no3 to remain stable for longer periods with water treatment technologies in comparison to the negative control furthermore no3 could be depleted by the presence of algae in the irrigation line or at the soil surface for potted plants which was most apparent in the control treatments ozone exhibited the highest concentration of nitrate on the 4th recirculation while aop and dsa had marginal increases as all technologies are known to nitrify nh4 berger et al 1999 luo et al 2015 ammonium was shown to decrease for all treatments which could be a combination of nitrification reactions caused by the water treatment methods soil dwelling bacteria fan et al 2011 and plant uptake other nutrients that were shown to increase with the number of recirculations such as po4 3 and so4 2 were likely caused by the resupply of fertigation water during the second treatment however the gradual loss of so4 2 from the negative control and dsas can be caused by a variety of factors such as plant uptake anion exchange rates between the soil and fertigation solution hodges and johnson 1987 or possibly electrochemical reduction of sulphate that becomes incorporated in limescale antony et al 2008 cui et al 2016 furthermore the increase of mg2 and ca2 exhibited by all treatments can be explained by the dissolution of amended dolomitic limestone in the growth medium the biggest difference between water treatment technologies was the presence of chelated iron although complicated with the recirculation of the solution through soil there were clear indications of aop and ozone treatments decreasing the concentration of fe2 in solution following treatment both technologies have been known to destroy the iron chelator edta which will precipitate fe2 out of solution fe3 sillanpää et al 2011 furthermore dsas have been known to destroy edta with preferential conditions ph 7 high cl khelifa et al 2013 however a long contact time of 50 min is needed to fully destroy edta using a low current density under certain conditions there was no edta that was removed in solution when the ph of the solution is less than 7 and using low current densities khelifa et al 2013 as shown for iron dynamics in figure 9 iron was depleted over time though it may remain stable in solution for longer periods in comparison to ozonation and aop treatments chloride levels were shown to remain relatively stable over a growth period of 21 days and subsequent nutrient solution replenishment this aspect is a significant advantage over injection systems which have been shown to have a 4 fold increase over a period of 80 days when injecting free chlorine at 0 04 mmol l dannehl et al 2016 furthermore the concentration of cl has an influence on no3 uptake within plants neocleus et al 2021 and the in situ treatment could stabilize the desired cl levels for longer periods of time future research should encompass longer growth periods to differentiate all treatments for the stability of nutrients in solution with recirculating solutions this aspect should be conducted in a hydroponic system to remove external factors imposed by the soil growth medium energy consumption was also an additional factor to consider between water treatment technologies for determining the most cost effective method for disinfecting recirculating fertigation solutions in greenhouse production the efc system was determined to have the lowest energy requirements for treating irrigation water although the time needed to treat the full volume of fertigation water was 9 times higher than aop and ozonation treatments further considerations for cost is the presence of nh4 in solution that influences the current efficiency of the system ammonium consumes free chlorine which can increase the cost of electrolysis by forming a chemical species with a lower oxidation potential the consumption of free chlorine can add costs in comparison to ozonation and aop which do not react with nh4 future research should explore the use of a purely nitrate based fertilizer that prevent the formation of chloramines meador and fisher 2013 which can increase the current efficiency of the system furthermore the current efficiency of the system can be improved by increasing the level of cl in solution and future research should explore this factor hernlem 2005 although the research should also take into consideration processes that lead to higher concentrations of chloramines that can pose phytotoxicity to crops premuzic et al 2007 as well as the loss of nitrogen through breakpoint chlorination reactions kapalka et al 2010 the efc unit could be scaled 10 times through a series of modules to handle larger volumes of fertigation solution and treat the full volume with the same efficacy but at a faster flow rate with maintaining the same current density across 10 modules and assuming the voltage and resistance remain the same the energy consumption would still equate to 0 088 kwh due to faster flow rates reducing treatment time however considerations must be made for equipment that can handle higher currents e g wiring which can marginally increase the cost of the technology other considerations for increasing the flow rate for treating irrigation water is having multiple smaller units while keeping the same parameters nonetheless the efc system still proved to be the most energy efficient by a factor of two further testing is needed to understand scaling capabilities and whether the technology can be scaled in a linear trend while producing the same results as previously described the last factor under consideration in comparing these water treatment technologies is their ease of use ozonation and aop can be challenging to operate due to multiple components that require monitoring the components include monitoring the flow rate of fertigation water flow of concentrated oxygen influent and effluent pressure differences and venturi injection flow aop also adds more complexity with monitoring the turbidity of the solution due to the effects in transmittance of uv light through the solution the efc system was determined to be the simplest to operate and monitor with only having to monitor the fertigation flow rate current and voltage of the system which remained constant throughout treatment it includes no moving parts with the exception of pumps directing the solution to the efc system other aspects such as clogging imposed by algal development in irrigation lines were unnoticed with the use of ozonation and dsa treatments this requires less maintenance and replacement of irrigation lines throughout the use of the hydroponic system aop did not have algal development near the water treatment system although some algal development was noticed further downstream of the irrigation system the efc system has been determined to have the lowest maintenance among all treatments which can save significant operational and maintenance costs 5 conclusion recirculating fertigation solutions for the production of ornamental crops has been shown to be an effective means of conserving resources such as water and fertilizer as well as maintaining the health of crops it was demonstrated that without a water treatment system in place plants can be easily decimated from pathogens present in the fertigation solution all water treatment strategies ozone aop and dsa were shown to protect crops from pathogens in a recirculating fertigation system without impeding the growth of crops plant nutrients were also shown to remain relatively constant following treatment with respect to plant nutrient uptake and resupply of the fertigation solution however close monitoring procedures should be in place for chelated iron for all treatments the degradation of edta was of most concern with aop and ozonation treatments while the dsa treatment was shown to remain stable for longer periods energy consumption was determined to be 2 times higher for aop and ozonation in comparison to fertigation treatment with dsa further research is needed to scale the

9464,capturing and reusing fertigation drainage is a key strategy for maximizing greenhouse production efficiency while minimizing the impact of wastewater discharge on receiving ecosystems fertigation drainage in this regard refers to irrigation water mixed with fertilizer that has once passed through soilless culture although an economically and environmentally prudent practice recirculating fertigation solutions does pose an increased risk of pathogen proliferation there are many water disinfection technologies currently available to growers including ozone o3 aq and advanced oxidation processes aop beyond currently available treatment options there are emerging technologies that have yet to be optimized for recirculating hydroponics electrochemical systems based on dimensionally stable anodes dsa offer a novel method for disinfecting fertigation using cyclamen persicum as a representative greenhouse floriculture crop fertigation solutions were inoculated with fusarium oxysporum isolated from a diseased c persicum sample following inoculation solutions were treated with one of either a dsa electrochemical system a uv ozone aop system or ozonation solutions were then applied to the crop and disease progression was monitored the positive control group f oxysporum added exhibited pathogenicity following the recirculation of the fertigation solution while the negative control f oxysporum absent did not show pathogenicity in c persicum all water treatment systems achieved a log 4 reduction in f oxysporum which prevented pathogenicity in plants furthermore there were no significant differences in plant physiology between the water treatment methods in comparison to the negative control group however all treatments performed significantly better than the positive control group which experienced pathogenicity solution nutrient analysis indicated stability across all treatments energy consumption was also monitored and demonstrated a two

each plant after every irrigation event drip irrigation was employed with one emitter per pot that delivered fertigation solution at a rate of 4 l h the irrigation system was arranged by drip irrigation with spikes inserted in the soil lc1 grower mix sun gro horticulture usa with a flow rate of 4 l h plants were placed along troughs and evenly spaced by 60 cm on a total of 4 different grow benches the greenhouse conditions were monitored and maintained by an automated control system 2tx and ex 16 argus control systems canada day night temperature set points were 19 c 16 c 0 17 c over the course of the study while relative humidity rh was maintained at 75 daily light levels 43 31 37 0 n 80 13 43 1 w averaged around total daily light integral of approximately 20 89 mol m2 d per day from february 28th to april 15th 2019 ambient atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were used 2 3 experiment design the experiment was arranged as a randomized complete block design with four replicate blocks containing five treatments randomly assigned to individual troughs on each grow bench which comprised a single block fig 1a treatments consisted of a positive and negative control ozone aop and dsa the negative control solution was not inoculated with f oxysporum while the solutions used in the positive control ozone aop and dsa treatments were inoculated all treatments contained 2 reservoirs one reservoir captures the fertigation solution after passing through treatments reservoir 2 and the other collects the fertigation water following the application to crops reservoir 1 fig 1b diaphragm pumps 8025 733 256 shurflo usa draw the fertigation water from reservoir 1 towards the treatment systems and a second set further distributes towards the drippers one full recirculation of the total 80 litres of fertigation solution was completed every 1 5 weeks for a total of 4 recirculation s over the 6 week experimental period 2 4 water treatment technologies controls did not have any water treatment technologies in place for inactivating pathogens the remaining water treatments used for treating inoculated fertigation solutions were ozonation o3 aq aop o3 aq uv and an efc outfitted with dsa electrodes ozonation was performed using a stabilized aqueous ozone dispenser lqfc225k tersano inc canada and oxygen concentrator as013 5 airsep corporation usa modifications to the ozone system were made to accommodate the larger back pressures imposed by the drip irrigation system modifications included the swapping out of a venturi injector 287 mazzei injector company usa and the addition of a ½ inch hdpe hose with static diffusers downstream from the venturi injector the aop used matching components for ozonation ozone dispenser and oxygen concentrator but included a uv lamp gauv 6sm greenway water technologies canada downstream from the ozone system supplementary figure 2 ultraviolet dosage was monitored during treatment with 80 transmittance at an intensity of 75 mj cm2 to the fertigation solution ozonation and aop treatments were measured for concentrations of aqueous ozone using ozone accuvac ampules 2518025 hach company usa and a colourimeter dr 850 hach company usa in the ozonation treatment an average concentration of 0 08 0 001 mmol l was measured following treatment the solution was allowed to stand for approximately 30 min and remeasured until the residual ozone was below 0 01 mmol l before applying to crops the aop treatment measured a residual ozone concentration 0 0002 mmol l following treatment with the uv lamp and was applied directly to plants following treatment the efc treatment with dsa followed the previous methods described by lévesque et al 2019 an applied current density of 4 55 ma cm2 with a 1 minute contact time 0 38 l min was used in the study these parameters were chosen for the study as previous work demonstrated the complete inactivation of pathogens while limiting the effluent concentrations of free chlorine and chloramines lévesque et al 2019 a power supply df1730sc 20 a dc power supply gold source china was directly connected to the efc and monitored for the current and voltage using multimeters fluke 189 fluke corporation canada free chlorine concentrations were measured using dpd test n tube cuvette and colourimeter hach company usa the treatment with the use of dsa was determined to have a residual free chlorine concentration of 0 005 0 0002 mmol l following treatment of the fertigation solution energy consumption was determined for the ozone and aop systems by measuring power w draw with an electricity usage monitor lgp4400 p3 international corporation usa energy consumption for the dsa treatment was calculated by measuring the current and voltage using multimeters 2 5 plant growth and water quality analysis after 6 weeks of growth noticeable differences became apparent between treatments and were evaluated for plant growth disease severity and water quality characteristics disease severity index was assessed by four levels from healthy plants a leaf necrosis b wilting c and crown rot d fig 2 plant growth was evaluated at the end of the growth period by measuring total number of leaves total leaf area average petiole length and dry weights of plants total leaf area of plants was measured by removing leaves and passing through a leaf area meter li 3100 c li cor inc usa final dry weight measurements were performed by adding fresh plants in paper bags dried over 4 days at 55 c in a drying oven ov 510a 2 blue m electric company usa and weighed ms32001l mettler toledo switzerland water quality was analyzed for each recirculation reservoir 1 and after each treatment reservoir 2 by taking 3 subsamples of fertigation water from both reservoirs individual macro and micronutrient ions were measured by a shimadzu hplc system consisting of a dgu 20a3 degasser a sil 10ap autosampler two lc 20at pumps two cdd 10a vp conductivity detectors cto 20ac column oven and cbm 20a system controller initial treatment samples were analyzed for pathogen inactivation by performing serial dilutions and counted in petri dishes for colony forming units analysis after incubating for 2 days as described by lévesque et al 2019 all petri dishes contained pda agar and antibiotics as previously described in the pathogen culturing methods 2 6 statistical analysis all graphical figures and statistical analyses were performed using the statistical program jmp version 14 0 sas institute inc usa residuals were tested for normality using the shapiro wilk test all data was determined to have a normal distribution statistical analysis on plant growth parameters number of leaves leaf area petiole length and dry weights was conducted by performing a one way anova significance established at α 0 05 significant differences in individual macronutrients and micronutrients were determined through regression slope analysis 3 results pathogen inactivation was monitored for all treatments within the first pass from reservoir one towards reservoir two fig 3 there were no significant differences in colony forming units of f oxysporum in water passing between reservoirs for the positive control p 0 3508 this confirmed that viable pathogens were capable of passing through the irrigation system to reach the crop sampling of the negative control treatment failed to detect additional pathogens such that any disease symptoms that developed could be ascribed to the inoculation with f oxysporum all of the water treatment technologies tested were capable of achieving complete inactivation of pathogens fig 3 after six weeks of growth all treatments exhibited significant differences p 0 05 in comparison to the positive control for leaf area number of leaves petiole length and dry weights of c persicum fig 4 in comparison to the negative control all water treatment technologies used during the study were not found to have significant differences in plant growth furthermore no visual differences were observed between water treatment methods though clear differences in the health of plants were discerned with the positive control due to pathogenicity fig 5 all plants within the positive control were classified between categories 1 3 using the disease severity index while plants in the negative control and water treatment strategies were classified as category 4 or healthy fertigation solutions for all treatments were analyzed for individual macro and micronutrients in solution after each treatment recirculation phase nitrates were shown to remain relatively constant until reaching the third recirculation of the fertigation solution fig 6 the fertigation solution collected from the negative control was determined to have a slope of zero and no significant difference was observed however during the last recirculation there was a large decrease in nitrate by approximately 2 42 mmol l some water treatment technologies were shown to have significantly increasing slopes for dsa p 0 0016 and ozone p 0 0494 while aop did not have any significant increases p 0 5300 the positive control had the largest significant increase in nitrate p 0 0001 comparison to all treatments significant changes in total concentration of orthophosphate were only found for the positive control treatment p 0 0004 while all treatments had slopes that were significantly decreasing for ammonium p 0 0001 fig 7 potassium showed no significant differences in the slopes for aop dsa and ozonation although sharp declines were experienced with the first recirculation of the solution potassium did have a significant decrease with the negative control p 0 0001 and a significant increase with the positive control p 0 0079 sulphate concentration was shown to increase in all treatments p 0 0001 except for dsas and the negative control which did not exhibit any difference fig 8 all treatments resulted in a large increase in sulphate and gradual decrease with increasing number of passes through the system however dsas and negative control both experienced a large increase during the first recirculation and a larger decline in sulphate with consecutive recirculations the larger declines can be caused by differences in plant uptake or possibly anion exchange rates between the soil and fertigation solution furthermore the decline in sulphate from dsas could be caused by chemical reduction at the cathode leading to sulphur being incorporated in limescale in contrast the other treatments experienced a gradual decline with consecutive recirculations all treatments exhibited increases for magnesium and calcium in the fertigation solution p 0 0001 both magnesium and calcium were shown to increase the most with the positive control with increasing recirculations significant increases in the concentration of iron were only observed for the positive control treatment with increasing number of recirculations p 0 0001 fig 9 all other treatments were not found to exhibit any significant differences however aop and ozone treatments exhibited decreases in iron followed by treatments during the recirculation phases 2 5 and 3 5 the dsa treatment also showed signs of a decreasing trend after the first recirculation though the decrease appears to be more gradual similar to the aop treatment all treatments were not found to have significant increases in chloride with only marginal increases of 0 04 mmol l over the growth period of 3 weeks fig 10 increases can be attributed to low uptake and evapotranspiration from plants over time chloride levels for the dsa treatment were higher due to the addition of kcl for introducing 0 57 mmol l of cl in solution 3 1 water treatment cost analysis the energy consumption from all water treatment technologies without the added energy requirement costs of irrigation pumps and carbon filters removal of atmospheric ozone is summarized in table 2 the cost of ozonation was directly provided by the power consumption for the tersano ozone dispenser and by the oxygen concentrator the cost for aop was the same as the ozonation treatment though with the added power consumption of the uv light the cost for the electrochemical flow cell was directly related to the power consumption provided to the electrodes for maintaining a current density of 4 55 ma cm2 energy consumption from the efc was determined to be 2 times lower than aop and ozonation treatments when corrected for differences in treatment times required to achieve the target result 4 discussion fusarium oxysporum was shown to remain unchanged in the positive control while the negative control did not have the presence of the pathogen in the fertigation solution the difference between these treatments demonstrated that pathogenicity observed in the positive control was solely caused by the presence of the inoculated pathogen in the fertigation solution the water treatment technologies tested including ozonation aop and dsa were all shown to be effective in achieving the complete inactivation of f oxysporum in solution furthermore the in situ chlorination method was found to achieve higher inactivation rates through a log 4 reduction of f oxysporum in comparison to chlorine dosing rodriguez et al 2018 these inactivation rates can be attributed to the regenerative hypochlorination process previously described kapalka et al 2010 lévesque et al 2019 liang et al 2005 enhanced inactivation through the in situ process can also be attributed to additional factors such as an acidic environment at the anode causing non enzymatic proteolysis kraft 2008 permentier and bruins 2004 furthermore electroporation could also play a role in increasing the permeability of cell membranes that can lead to the loss of function in cells drees et al 2003 physico chemical factors in combination can likely explain the higher inactivation rates that are achieved in comparison to conventional chlorine injection methods aronsson and rönner 2001 vega mercado et al 1996 the inoculation of f oxysporum was shown to be highly infectious through the rapid damage of c persicum in the positive control treatment plants in the negative control did not exhibit any symptoms of pathogenicity from other potential pathogens that might have been present in the greenhouse furthermore none of the plants subjected to the various water treatment technologies exhibited any of the adverse effects exhibited by the positive control treatment upon analyzing the plant growth parameters for number of leaves leaf areas petiole length and dry weights there were no significant differences between water treatment methods and the negative control however all treatments did have significant differences in plant growth in comparison to the positive control previous research has shown concern over the effects of chloramines date et al 2005 lévesque et al 2019 premuzic et al 2007 and other organo halogenated compounds lonigro et al 2017 that can reside in the soil substrate which can have an impact on plant growth while previous research has found phytotoxic 0 004 mmol l nh2cl in hydroponically grown lettuce there were no measurable decreases in the physiological health of c persicum this could be largely due to a hardier and less chlorine sensitive root system as well as soil organic matter acting as a buffer which resulted in no negative effects in plant growth furthermore previous results have determined that the concentrations of free and combined chlorine delivered to plants were approximately 0 004 mmol l and 0 03 mmol l lévesque et al 2019 although negative impacts were not found in this type of ornamental crop electrochemical chlorination must be used cautiously for free and combined chlorine with more chlorine sensitive crops such as lettuce nonetheless when using the efc system with the tested current density 4 55 ma cm2 this supplied a free chlorine concentration of 0 004 mmol l which still conforms with safe irrigation practices and human consumption lonigro et al 2017 in this study all the water treatment strategies exhibited acceptable crop protection when presented with pathogen concentrations that could potentially decimate greenhouse production systems therefore other factors that may differentiate the relative merits of the techniques will be considered such as nutrient dynamics energy consumption and ease of use using soil in a recirculating irrigation system can be challenging to monitor and maintain nutrients which may become depleted or accumulate in the substrate in this study all nutrient concentrations remained relatively stable for the first 3 recirculations mainly due to the resupply of fertigation water after the second recirculation however by the 4th recirculation there were some fluctuations in nutrients due to the increase in plant growth interactions with the substrate development of algae and some minor effects of water treatment strategies nitrate was shown to decrease in the negative control while slight increases were exhibited in the ozonation aop and dsa treatments the delayed decrease in nitrate could be attributed to the water treatment technologies nitrifying nh4 and other organic sources den blanken 1985 geenens et al 2001 as well as potential promotion of biological nitrification schroeder et al 2015 this may have caused the concentration of no3 to remain stable for longer periods with water treatment technologies in comparison to the negative control furthermore no3 could be depleted by the presence of algae in the irrigation line or at the soil surface for potted plants which was most apparent in the control treatments ozone exhibited the highest concentration of nitrate on the 4th recirculation while aop and dsa had marginal increases as all technologies are known to nitrify nh4 berger et al 1999 luo et al 2015 ammonium was shown to decrease for all treatments which could be a combination of nitrification reactions caused by the water treatment methods soil dwelling bacteria fan et al 2011 and plant uptake other nutrients that were shown to increase with the number of recirculations such as po4 3 and so4 2 were likely caused by the resupply of fertigation water during the second treatment however the gradual loss of so4 2 from the negative control and dsas can be caused by a variety of factors such as plant uptake anion exchange rates between the soil and fertigation solution hodges and johnson 1987 or possibly electrochemical reduction of sulphate that becomes incorporated in limescale antony et al 2008 cui et al 2016 furthermore the increase of mg2 and ca2 exhibited by all treatments can be explained by the dissolution of amended dolomitic limestone in the growth medium the biggest difference between water treatment technologies was the presence of chelated iron although complicated with the recirculation of the solution through soil there were clear indications of aop and ozone treatments decreasing the concentration of fe2 in solution following treatment both technologies have been known to destroy the iron chelator edta which will precipitate fe2 out of solution fe3 sillanpää et al 2011 furthermore dsas have been known to destroy edta with preferential conditions ph 7 high cl khelifa et al 2013 however a long contact time of 50 min is needed to fully destroy edta using a low current density under certain conditions there was no edta that was removed in solution when the ph of the solution is less than 7 and using low current densities khelifa et al 2013 as shown for iron dynamics in figure 9 iron was depleted over time though it may remain stable in solution for longer periods in comparison to ozonation and aop treatments chloride levels were shown to remain relatively stable over a growth period of 21 days and subsequent nutrient solution replenishment this aspect is a significant advantage over injection systems which have been shown to have a 4 fold increase over a period of 80 days when injecting free chlorine at 0 04 mmol l dannehl et al 2016 furthermore the concentration of cl has an influence on no3 uptake within plants neocleus et al 2021 and the in situ treatment could stabilize the desired cl levels for longer periods of time future research should encompass longer growth periods to differentiate all treatments for the stability of nutrients in solution with recirculating solutions this aspect should be conducted in a hydroponic system to remove external factors imposed by the soil growth medium energy consumption was also an additional factor to consider between water treatment technologies for determining the most cost effective method for disinfecting recirculating fertigation solutions in greenhouse production the efc system was determined to have the lowest energy requirements for treating irrigation water although the time needed to treat the full volume of fertigation water was 9 times higher than aop and ozonation treatments further considerations for cost is the presence of nh4 in solution that influences the current efficiency of the system ammonium consumes free chlorine which can increase the cost of electrolysis by forming a chemical species with a lower oxidation potential the consumption of free chlorine can add costs in comparison to ozonation and aop which do not react with nh4 future research should explore the use of a purely nitrate based fertilizer that prevent the formation of chloramines meador and fisher 2013 which can increase the current efficiency of the system furthermore the current efficiency of the system can be improved by increasing the level of cl in solution and future research should explore this factor hernlem 2005 although the research should also take into consideration processes that lead to higher concentrations of chloramines that can pose phytotoxicity to crops premuzic et al 2007 as well as the loss of nitrogen through breakpoint chlorination reactions kapalka et al 2010 the efc unit could be scaled 10 times through a series of modules to handle larger volumes of fertigation solution and treat the full volume with the same efficacy but at a faster flow rate with maintaining the same current density across 10 modules and assuming the voltage and resistance remain the same the energy consumption would still equate to 0 088 kwh due to faster flow rates reducing treatment time however considerations must be made for equipment that can handle higher currents e g wiring which can marginally increase the cost of the technology other considerations for increasing the flow rate for treating irrigation water is having multiple smaller units while keeping the same parameters nonetheless the efc system still proved to be the most energy efficient by a factor of two further testing is needed to understand scaling capabilities and whether the technology can be scaled in a linear trend while producing the same results as previously described the last factor under consideration in comparing these water treatment technologies is their ease of use ozonation and aop can be challenging to operate due to multiple components that require monitoring the components include monitoring the flow rate of fertigation water flow of concentrated oxygen influent and effluent pressure differences and venturi injection flow aop also adds more complexity with monitoring the turbidity of the solution due to the effects in transmittance of uv light through the solution the efc system was determined to be the simplest to operate and monitor with only having to monitor the fertigation flow rate current and voltage of the system which remained constant throughout treatment it includes no moving parts with the exception of pumps directing the solution to the efc system other aspects such as clogging imposed by algal development in irrigation lines were unnoticed with the use of ozonation and dsa treatments this requires less maintenance and replacement of irrigation lines throughout the use of the hydroponic system aop did not have algal development near the water treatment system although some algal development was noticed further downstream of the irrigation system the efc system has been determined to have the lowest maintenance among all treatments which can save significant operational and maintenance costs 5 conclusion recirculating fertigation solutions for the production of ornamental crops has been shown to be an effective means of conserving resources such as water and fertilizer as well as maintaining the health of crops it was demonstrated that without a water treatment system in place plants can be easily decimated from pathogens present in the fertigation solution all water treatment strategies ozone aop and dsa were shown to protect crops from pathogens in a recirculating fertigation system without impeding the growth of crops plant nutrients were also shown to remain relatively constant following treatment with respect to plant nutrient uptake and resupply of the fertigation solution however close monitoring procedures should be in place for chelated iron for all treatments the degradation of edta was of most concern with aop and ozonation treatments while the dsa treatment was shown to remain stable for longer periods energy consumption was determined to be 2 times higher for aop and ozonation in comparison to fertigation treatment with dsa further research is needed to scale the
