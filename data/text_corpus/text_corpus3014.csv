15070,the recent outbreaks of harmful algal blooms in the western lake erie basin wleb have drawn tremendous attention to bloom prediction for better control and management many weekly to annual bloom prediction models have been reported but they only employ small datasets have limited types of input features build linear regression or probabilistic models or require complex process based computations to address these limitations we conducted a comprehensive literature review complied a large dataset containing chlorophyll a index from 2002 to 2019 as the output and a novel combination of riverine the maumee detroit rivers and meteorological wleb features as the input and built machine learning based classification and regression models for 10 d scale bloom predictions by analyzing the feature importance we identified 8 most important features for the hab control including nitrogen loads time water levels soluble reactive phosphorus load and solar irradiance here both long and short term nitrogen loads were for the first time considered in hab models for lake erie based on these features the 2 3 and 4 level random forest classification models achieved an accuracy of 89 6 77 0 and 66 7 respectively and the regression model achieved an r2 value of 0 69 in addition long short term memory lstm was implemented to predict temporal trends of four short term features n solar irradiance and two water levels and achieved the nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 12 0 97 feeding the lstm model predictions for these features into the 2 level classification model reached an accuracy of 86 0 for predicting the habs in 2017 2018 suggesting that we can provide short term hab forecasts even when the feature values are not available graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bloom forecast feature selection long short term memory machine learning random forest time series modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the 1960s harmful algal blooms habs frequently occurred in the western lake erie basin wleb but disappeared in the late 1970s due to effective phosphorus control measures commission 1972 depinto et al 1986 however following occasional occurrences in the 1990s habs have started to occur annually since 2002 and reached record levels in recent years stumpf et al 2016 habs can not only release excess toxins which can poison aquatic lives and endanger human health but also cause oxygen depletion and turn the water body into a dead zone usepa 2021 because the wellness or deterioration of lake erie affects millions of residents in the whole lake erie watershed timely and accurate hab forecasts will prepare the stakeholders for upcoming habs and prevent the public from close contact with the poisoned water so far there are a number of reported predictive models that can provide hab forecasts for the wleb most of these models are statistical models that link the extent of monitored bloom biomass to various physicochemical meteorological and hydrodynamic variables briefly the employed statistical functions range from single stumpf et al 2016 2012 or multiple linear regression ho and michalak 2017 and probabilistic models bertani et al 2016 obenour et al 2014 to a spatio temporal geostatistical model fang et al 2019 the involved variables include day of year long term cumulative soluble reactive phosphorus srp maumee river discharge spatial coordinates total spring phosphorus load tp total spring bioavailable phosphorus tbp load water column depth and or wind speed bertani et al 2016 fang et al 2019 ho and michalak 2017 obenour et al 2014 stumpf et al 2016 in addition to those data driven statistical models there are several process based hydrodynamic models verhamme et al 2016 wynne et al 2013 2011 with the latest one being three dimensional at a fine scale and incorporating hydrodynamics nutrient sediment dynamics and vertical mixing to track the hab occurrence verhamme et al 2016 in all the above studies the bloom biomass is quantified by either remote sensing sayers et al 2019 stumpf et al 2012 or in situ sampling bridgeman et al 2013 fang et al 2019 millie et al 2014 please see table s1 in the supplementary material sm for a list of predictive models reported for the wleb since 2010 despite the significant progress in the hab modeling for lake erie there are seven major limitations in the reported models first although nutrient particularly spring p load are known to be key parameters influencing habs in lake erie stumpf et al 2016 2012 other temporal meteorological data such as solar irradiance wind speed water temperature and high flows which carry low levels of nutrient from the detroit river into the wleb are also reportedly affecting the bloom growth in summer bertani et al 2017 michalak et al 2013 however only partial variables are considered in the available models for the wleb for example some of these models only rely on the p load from the maumee river to predict the annual hab levels ho and michalak 2017 obenour et al 2014 stumpf et al 2016 the hydrodynamic model used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa 2021 is mainly based on physical transport processes rather than biological mechanisms to forecast the location and intensity of the bloom twice a week rowe et al 2016 wynne et al 2011 moreover n is known to be limited in summer in the wleb chaffin et al 2013 2014 but the amount of regenerated n in the water column can be thousand times more than the corresponding external n load in late august hampel et al 2019 therefore legacy n or regenerated n may be an important nutrient source for habs yet no available models have considered any n related features in the models models that do not consider all potentially influential variables may not accurately predict the bloom extent or reflect the temporal trend in the habs even though many parameters have been considered second physical transport models are computationally expensive as they require satellite imaging in situ bloom biomass sampling well defined biochemical physiological parameters and extensive waterflow and wind information which are not easy to use for most users li et al 2021 wynne et al 2011 third models that not only have good prediction accuracy but also provide a deep understanding of the operating hab mechanisms are desirable for proper hab control and management forth the statistical functions in the data driven models may not capture the nonlinear interactive and dynamic even stochastic nature of the habs millie et al 2014 like linear regression models which can only predict the annual maximum hab extent in lake erie stumpf et al 2016 additional examples in table s1 fifth running process based models often requires expert knowledge across multiple disciplines because the models involve a large number of parameters that need to be calibrated verhamme et al 2016 sixth many of these models are based on very small sample sizes with the data volume between 10 and 67 bertani et al 2017 see table s1 finally most of the reported statistical models are annual models that provide seasonal forecasts such as the annual noaa forecast noaa 2021 but do not issue short term forecasts to the public ho and michalak 2017 obenour et al 2014 apart from the above models for the wleb machine learning ml models have been successfully employed in bloom predictions for many lakes and rivers rousso et al 2020 for example a gradient boosting binary classification model integrated hydrological parameters water temperature and water quality at the 10 d scale for hab prediction for the han river and achieved a high accuracy of 0 9 based on the kappa coefficient xia et al 2020 pyo et al combined riverine atmospheric and environmental variables with a convolutional neural network for bloom prediction for the nakdong river and achieved a nse of 0 87 pyo et al 2020 when random forest rf was employed together with 27 environmental variables at a time scale of 4 h the model achieved an r2 of 0 89 for the prediction of the phytoplankton community in lake greifensee thomas et al 2018 however these models also did not consider all potentially influential features and did not screen for the most essential features that is comprehensive feature engineering given the powerful predictive ability of ml models it is important to improve the feature engineering and develop ml models for bloom predictions for the wleb yet only a couple of ml models have been employed to model habs in the wleb and achieved some success that is a boosted regression tree model to compare the hab estimates based on 8 different monitoring programs but the r2 was only 33 1 49 8 bertani et al 2017 and artificial neural network ann models for total phytoplankton and microcystis biomass but the training data were only from 2009 to 2011 millie et al 2014 in this study we first conducted a comprehensive literature review and collected data for all influencing features that had been used discussed in previous studies on lake erie since 2010 michalak et al 2013 rousso et al 2020 sayers et al 2019 stumpf et al 2016 as summarized in table s1 based on the available data we then developed rf classification and regression models for short term 10 d scale forecast of habs in the welb during the model development careful feature selection was conducted to exclude redundant information and to identify the most important features which is necessary for efficient and accurate hab predictions and targeted controls we next evaluated the effects of the identified important features such as total nitrogen tn load and water levels which have not been investigated before on the bloom predictions in addition to the p loads that have been widely applied in previous modeling the tn load was recently discovered to be significantly related to habs in the wleb newell et al 2019 paerl et al 2020 therefore short and long term n based features were for the first time added into the model input finally ml models were developed for the prediction of the important riverine and meteorological features because the feature values are not available real time which prevents us from using the rf models for short term 10 d scale bloom forecasts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as the nutrient sources and the occurrence of habs in lake erie are mostly related to western lake erie the study area was concentrated on the wleb as delineated by the area of around 3000 km2 on the left side of the line from point pelee canada to marblehead ohio fig 1 bertani et al 2017 manning et al 2019 verhamme et al 2016 even though the monitored blooms sometimes crossed the boundary of the wleb the crossed parts were still considered when calculating the ci values correspondingly meteorological data were collected for the wleb 2 2 hab quantification habs were quantified by chlorophyll a index ci values using 10 d composite ci values the maximum ci value in a 10 d window extracted from satellite images see text s1 for more details of how to obtain the ci values the reason that 10 d composite ci values were used was that the national centers for coastal ocean science nccos only published processed 10 d composite satellite images for the whole lake from 2002 to 2019 e g fig 1 yielding a total of 240 records the 10 d window was determined based on the availability and representativeness of satellite images due to wind cloud cover and satellite revisiting time stumpf et al 2012 more discussion in text s1 nccos also publishes the annual hab severity levels light mild significant and extreme the ci values were classified into 2 3 or 4 levels based on the severity index table 1 and the levels were set as the corresponding classification model outputs there are several additional hab quantification programs for the wleb please see text s2 for a discussion of these programs and why we decided to use the ci values 2 3 selection of input features to consider all influential factors in the input we conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify all potentially relevant factors including hydrodynamic meteorological physicochemical and time of year that could affect the bloom behavior table 2 scheme s1 all features that have been used in the reported models for lake erie are summarized in table s1 first many studies have used spring p loads for hab predictions ho and michalak 2017 stumpf et al 2016 2012 because these loads are known to significantly affect hab formation either directly or after being deposited in lake sediments bertani et al 2017 michalak et al 2013 therefore we included different loads of spring nutrient between 2002 and 2019 in the input features table s1 and text s3 meteorological features including temperature wind light ice cover and precipitation can also influence the bloom growth and were thus selected too specifically algal blooms are prone to grow in warm and still water that has high light availability paerl and huisman 2008 sellner 1997 light availability represented as solar irradiance is indispensable for photosynthesis of autotrophs like the algae wind speed has reportedly influenced the vertical distribution of blooms in the water column chaffin et al 2020 hunter et al 2008 manning et al 2019 while wind direction also matters for the bloom distribution bertani et al 2017 rowe et al 2016 although not occurring in the summertime ice cover will block the sunlight and influence sediment resuspension in lakes which then subsequently changes the ecology and economy of the lake regions including the p cycle assel 2005 finally precipitation is known for its influence on the nutrient loads richards et al 2010 as precipitation caused runoffs will carry nutrient to the receiving water the hydrodynamic and physicochemical features were mostly obtained for the maumee river referred to as the riverine features sometimes the maumee river provides about 5 of the water influx but approximately 45 50 of the p loading to lake erie which dominates the nutrient loading to the lake bertani et al 2017 elliott 2010 michalak et al 2013 nutrients from the maumee river are known to have a major impact on the occurrence of habs in lake erie as low flushing rates and subsequently long residence times in the lake are favorable for the algal growth in addition the water levels in the wleb near the detroit river wld and the maumee river wlm were selected to monitor the lake inflow rowe et al 2016 and they reflect the water flow direction and water circulation conditions in the wleb please see text s3 for additional discussion on biological features as shown in table s2 the ci values are usually small in early summer and in october and reach peak in late summer to better capture the temporal trend in the bloom occurrence we integrated the time periods over the bloom season as part of the input like in other models bertani et al 2017 fang et al 2019 from june 1st to october 31st there were fifteen 10 d time periods and these time periods were numbered from 1 to 15 1 for the first period of june 1 10 2 for the second period of june 11 20 etc table s2 as the ci data were 10 d composite values most of the selected features were aggregated as 10 d averaged values so that the input and output matched in dimension before the onset and peak of habs there may be delays time lags in the habs responses to the environmental conditions franks 2018 moore et al 2009 valbi et al 2019 time lags were thus considered by calculating 20 d and 30 d average values of the features table 2 bertani et al 2017 to capture both the previous and current conditions moreover 1 y 5 y and 9 y cumulative srp and total nitrogen tn loads were considered to represent the long term p n loads ho and michalak 2017 details about the data sources are in text s4 as some of the features were highly correlated with each other data analysis was conducted to exclude some of the highly correlated features based on the pearson coefficient see text s5 and fig s2 after that we obtained an initial list of 50 input features table 2 compared to the small dataset 240 ci values 50 features were still too many because using irrelevant features might worsen the model performance so we conducted feature selection based on the feature importance to significantly decrease the number of input features while maintaining the model performance as details in section 2 4 2 4 developing bloom prediction models all the data were divided into training and test datasets in a ratio of 4 1 by stratified sampling as we had compared stratified sampling with random data split and obtained better model performance with the stratified sampling details in text s6 the training dataset was further divided into 5 parts for a 5 fold cross validation hastie et al 2009 the feature selection process involved sequentially identifying the least important features and excluding them until we obtained the smallest number of features while still maintaining a good model performance fig 2 c more details in text s6 the obtained regression models were evaluated by the r2 and root mean square error rmse values the obtained classification models were evaluated by the prediction accuracy along with the confusion matrix and the kappa coefficient text s7 table s4 to select the best ml algorithm s for the modeling purposes we compared the performance of 9 widely used ml algorithms ann bootstrap aggregating ba breiman 1996 gradient boosting gb friedman 2001 gaussian processes gp williams and rasmussen 1995 k nearest neighbors knn taunk et al 2019 lstm rf support vector machine svm li et al 2021 and xgboost xgb chen and guestrin 2016 based on all the 50 features and random data split sequentially for the lstm note that grid search was employed to optimize the hyperparameters for all the above algorithms during the model training process texts s6 s8 and s9 include more details of the rf ann and other model development respectively as the performance shown in table s5 rf outperformed all other models in both the classification and regression models therefore rf was employed to develop all the models below after the important features were identified following the feature selection process rf models were developed using these features as the input moreover the habs in 2017 2019 were predicted based on the records from 2002 to 2016 to further evaluate the practical applicability of the rf classification model 2 5 time series modeling with long short term memory lstm one major limitation in the application of the obtained models is that many of the input features are not available real time to timely obtain these features in situ sampling is a helpful solution but requires high cost in comparison predicting these features using data driven models would be an attractive choice existing tools such as the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed hydrological and water quality model arnold et al 1998 kalcic et al 2016 have been implemented to forecast the long term riverine nutrient data for the maumee river kalcic et al 2019 verma et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 however little is done regarding short term forecasts of the parameters swat models also require many predefined parameters such as moisture evaporation and canopy features which largely limits the applicability of the swat models in comparison lstm is an advanced ml algorithm for modeling time series data gers et al 2000 it can overcome the problem of stationary time series and is capable of learning long and short term patterns of changes hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 kratzert et al 2018 maier and dandy 1996 as lstm can quickly yield fair predictions using the target itself as the input especially when there are decades of records available for example based on 40 years of river flow data in hun river china researchers used lstm for river flow prediction at a 10 d scale and obtained a good performance nse 0 75 xu et al 2020 with decades of monitoring data we employed lstm to develop predictive models at the daily scale and 10 d scale for selected riverine and meteorological features which will aid nutrient management and hab forecast respectively details of lstm and how the lstm models were developed are listed in text s9 and fig s4 as ann is also a common ml algorithm for water quality prediction chen et al 2020 ann models were also developed and compared with the lstm models the results table s6 showed that lstm outperformed ann in predicting the five riverine features so lstm was used for all the time series modeling lstm models were optimized for four rf features sol30 n30 wld20 and wlm10 at the 10 d scale to predict the feature values for each 10 d period we averaged the historical data into 10 d averages to be consistent with the ci periods and predicted 10 d averages for each feature by using all the data from the prior periods as the training data for example when the n10 data for the period of july 1st to july 10th 2017 was to be predicted it was treated as the test set and the tn data records prior to june 30th 2017 were used as the training set the predicted n10 is the model predicted 10 d average n values the predicted n30 was the average of the predicted n10 and the observed tn in the previous 20 d for the 31 10 d periods between 2017 and 2019 table s2 we obtained 31 predicted n30 values similarly we obtained 31 predicted values each for sol30 wld20 and wlm10 the predicted values not the observed values for these features were then employed in the rf2 model for predicting the hab levels in 2017 2019 and the performance was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 classification and regression modeling based on rf according to the severity index shown in table 1 the ci values were initially divided into four levels as the output for 4 level rf classification rf4 models however as the data shown in table 1 there are 148 data points for level 1 rf4 l1 habs but only between 24 and 37 data points for levels 2 4 rf4 l2 to l4 blooms as the whole dataset was very unbalanced we further divided the data into 3 levels and 2 levels for 3 level classification rf3 model we set light blooms as rf3 l1 mild blooms as rf3 l2 and extreme and severe blooms as rf3 l3 for 2 level classification rf2 model we set light and mild blooms as rf2 l1 and extreme severe blooms as rf2 l2 for each classification model we employed the feature selection process to eliminate insignificant features while maintaining the model performance and ended up with only eight to nine most important features details in section 3 2 which were employed to build the final models fig 3 a and tables s7 9 summarize the performance of the rf2 rf3 and rf4 models on the test set using the respectively identified top 8 9 and 9 features the rf2 model has the best performance with the overall accuracy of 89 6 and the kappa coefficient of 0 73 note that a kappa value of 0 4 is deemed weak that of 0 6 is moderate and that of 0 8 is strong mchugh 2012 the prediction accuracy is higher for rf2 l1 blooms than for rf2 l2 blooms 94 3 vs 76 9 in comparison svm and a naïve bayes classifier were recently applied to predict karenia brevis bloom events in the west florida gulf for two level predictions li et al 2021 with 318 bloom events and 765 non bloom events in the dataset they obtained an accuracy of 79 by svm as the best performance using riverine tp tn q temperature wind speed direction and sea surface height as the features given that the above study had more data points 1083 vs 240 and a more balanced data distribution between the two levels l1 l2 2 4 1 vs 3 4 1 the performance of the rf2 model developed in this study is quite satisfactory we further tried to address the data imbalance issue by either synthesizing additional data or removing a portion of the rf2 l1 data but did not observe improved model performance details in text s11 the rf3 model had an overall accuracy of 77 1 and a moderate kappa coefficient of 0 59 but it had a low accuracy of 25 0 for rf3 l2 habs fig 3a and table s8 the rf4 model had an overall accuracy of 66 7 and a weak kappa coefficient of 0 43 it however had a low accuracy of 25 0 and 18 2 for rf4 l2 and rf4 l3 blooms respectively 100 for rf4 l4 blooms the imbalanced dataset and small sample size are most likely the reasons for the poor performance because accurate ml models require both high data quality and large sample sizes tao et al 2017 nevertheless both the rf3 and rf4 models still have a high accuracy of 96 3 for rf4 l1 blooms and good accuracy for the most severe blooms so both models can accurately issue a safety notice to the public the rf regression model achieved an r2 of 0 72 and 0 69 for the training set and test set respectively fig 3b the model performance on the training set is similar to that of the reported linear regression or probabilistic models r2 from 0 71 to 0 97 table s1 but those models are based on much smaller sampler sizes 10 28 the performance on the test set is better than that of reported ml models r2 of 0 181 to 0 497 for boosting regression tree models bertani et al 2017 or 0 76 and 0 50 for ann models based on only 3 years of biomass data millie et al 2014 the performance of the regression model is also better than that of the reported phytoplankton models whose typical r2 values range from 0 4 to 0 6 arhonditsis and brett 2004 to further examine the ability of the rf models to predict habs we trained another rf2 model based on the data from 2002 to 2016 to predict the habs between 2017 and 2019 as shown in table s11 the developed model showed an overall accuracy of 74 2 and a moderate kappa coefficient of 0 45 with the annual accuracy of 91 82 and 44 for the year of 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively four of the 9 predictions for the year of 2019 were overestimation probably due to the high stp and ssrp levels in 2019 fig 4 from 2002 to 2019 the year of 2019 had the 2nd highest stp 3rd highest ssrp and 7th highest stn the high nutrient levels might have contributed to the overestimation additional predictions for the year of 2020 were also made based on the whole dataset covering 2002 2019 to simulate real practices and the predictions matched the reported values text s12 table s12 overall the above results demonstrated that the obtained rf models can be employed to successfully predict habs in the wleb given that the rf2 model performed the best and might be a more practical way e g only those extreme and severe habs are of more concern and more informative to the public we focus on the rf2 model below to predict hab levels for the wleb 3 2 interpretation of the feature importance it is essential to interpret the obtained ml models and examine if they are trustworthy following the ground truth this was done by ranking the feature importance which can also help 1 achieve parsimonious models so that only the minimum number of features are needed to facilitate the application of the models because all these feature values should be obtained through intensive data collection monitoring or modeling efforts fewer features also introduce less uncertainties and 2 design effective hab management plans based on the most relevant features following the feature selection process in section 2 4 we identified eight most important features for the rf2 model in the order of 5tn n30 time period wlm10 wld20 ssrp sol30 stn as discussed below this feature importance rank also agreed well with the shapley values obtained from the shapley feature interpretation method see text s13 and fig s7 the relevance or non relevance of all other features is discussed in text s14 it was initially surprising that 5tn n30 and stn were among the identified 8 important features as they revealed the significant role of n in the hab modeling yet n has not been incorporated in any of the reported hab prediction models for lake erie according to the monthly nutrient loadings into the lake there is usually no n limitation except in late summer chaffin et al 2013 2014 in some extreme years such as 2011 there is no n limitation even in the late summer michalak et al 2013 as a result researchers have been focusing on p when developing models for the wleb stumpf et al 2012 however an abundant spring tn load is necessary for the late summer bloom growth moreover a recent study on the sandusky bay lake erie discovered that the amount of internal ammonia regenerated in the water column over the three summer months accounted for 77 of the annual external tn load and the amount of regenerated n in late august was even 1000 times of the corresponding river n input into the bay hampel et al 2019 similar findings have also been reported for lake taihu where 9 of the external n load was stored in the lake and the regenerated ammonia in the water column provided 38 58 of the nh4 needed for summer fall blooms xu et al 2021 furthermore recent studies have proposed both n and p reduction plans for habs management since n and p reportedly jointly spur the growth of habs paerl et al 2016 2020 in agreement with the above findings the worst habs in lake erie occurred in 2011 and 2015 which had the highest spring n p loads fig 4 these findings suggest a potentially important role of n in the hab formation in the wleb and the necessity to integrate n based features such as 5tn and n30 in the models to capture the influence of long term and short term n loadings respectively text s15 shows our additional effort to improve the performance of the rf2 model by considering different contributions of regenerated n but the model performance did not improve further time of the year time period ranked the third because as mentioned previously habs in the wleb follow the temporal trend of starting in early june peaking around august and disappearing in october therefore time is an essential feature to capture the dynamics in hab formation similarly day of year and month of year have been employed as input features in recent space time geostatistical and machine learning models table s1 bertani et al 2017 fang et al 2019 the water levels near the maumee river wlm10 and the detroit river wld20 were identified as two of the most important features in the rf2 models in the literature the hydraulic load from the detroit river was also treated as a significant parameter affecting the hab formation in the wleb kane et al 2014 scavia et al 2016 this is because high flowrates along with low nutrient concentrations from the detroit river can dilute the lake water and the river flow will affect the lake circulation wynne et al 2011 a recent study linked the hab occurrence to low water levels because a low water level leads to water stabilization and nutrient accumulation rousso et al 2020 however we observed significantly higher water levels for rf2 l2 habs than for rf2 l1 habs p 0 001 fig 5 a b for the wleb rowe et al 2016 based on the recorded 10 d average water levels from 2002 to 2020 fig s8 there are clear trends that the water levels near the maumee and detroit rivers increased from the beginning of the year to the midyear and then kept decreasing for the remaining of the year the increasing water levels in the first half of the year means that the inflows are greater than the outflows this can lead to the accumulation of nutrient rich water in the wleb over summer which may provide a better condition for hab formation generally p is the known limiting factor for the hab formation in the wleb chaffin et al 2014 joosse and baker 2011 matisoff and ciborowski 2005 therefore the model correctly identified ssrp as a major feature in addition cumulative p load has been demonstrated to be influential to lake erie habs del giudice et al 2018 ho and michalak 2017 the 1srp 1 year cumulative soluble reactive phosphorus was the 9th important feature identified by the model which presented a significant importance among other features but it was not included in the final 8 features because including it did not further improve the model performance better features to represent long term p effects might be needed solar irradiance sol30 was the seventh most important feature it is related to the clearness of the sky as a cloudless sky is associated with higher water temperature and calm water conditions this finding agrees with previously reported hab prediction models for the lake table s1 bertani et al 2017 millie et al 2014 rowe et al 2016 where solar irradiance is often found to be positively related to habs rousso et al 2020 similar types of 5 9 input features were also identified for the 3 and 4 level classification models and the regression model with slight differences in the time lags or the feature importance see the captions of tables s8 9 and fig 3 in comparison the reported ml models for the wleb used a total of 29 31 input features bertani et al 2017 millie et al 2014 table s1 the identified small number of features in this study significantly simplified the model input while still achieving very good model performance this comparison also demonstrates the need to incorporate the most influential input features in ml modeling 3 3 lstm time series modeling of input features among the top eight input features for the rf2 model four are short term variables sol30 n30 wld20 and wlm10 while the other four are not 5tn time period ssrp and stn since the short term features are not readily available real time we d like to build predictive models for them so the rf models can be applied for short term hab forecasts fig 5c shows the performance of the lstm models for the four short term features at the 10 d scale sol10 wld10 and wlm10 all had good nse values of 0 88 0 97 n10 showed a low nse of 0 12 which might be due to the large fluctuation in the n values the optimized lstm models were then employed to predict values for the four features 31 predictions per feature for 2017 2019 the predicted and observed data for these features agreed well with the r2 values of 0 75 0 92 and 0 89 for sol10 wld10 and wlm10 respectively and that for n10 being 0 22 the lower r2 value for the n10 still might be due to the higher data fluctuation later the predicted 10 d average values were combined with the historical data to calculate sol30 wld20 and n30 and the predicted and observed data had a much better agreement with the r2 of 0 94 0 9 and 0 9 respectively to examine how well the lstm predictions can be used for forecasting habs we employed the data from 2002 to 2016 to forecast the habs in 2017 2019 and achieved an overall accuracy of 77 4 86 for 2017 2018 with the annual accuracy of 91 82 and 56 for 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to the rf2 hindcast model in section 3 1 this model performs almost the same even slightly better for 2019 demonstrating the feasibility of combining the lstm and rf models for forecasting habs for the wleb in addition we built predictive models for the common riverine parameters fig 5d because an accurate prediction of q would help forecast potential flooding events and facilitate subsequent response plans and timely nutrient predictions can guide nutrient control measures for the maumee river watershed the performance of the optimized lstm models for the 10 parameters at the daily scale is summarized in fig 5d and table s14 all the models presented good nse values of higher than 0 8 except for tkn 0 60 and sol 0 62 although tkn has a lower nse of 0 60 the good nse of 0 87 for n on the daily scale is more important as n is used in the rf models 4 conclusion many features are known to considerably influence the extent of habs in the wleb in this work we identified a novel combination of only eight input features some were for the first time considered in one model from a long list of 50 initial features and employed them to build ml models for predicting hab levels in the wleb final model summarized in fig 6 overall we have three major findings 1 we developed effective classification and regression rf models to predict short term 10 d scale hab levels in the wleb and achieved an accuracy of up to 89 6 2 level classification rf2 on the test set these models filled the gap between twice a week and annual bloom predictions and will benefit the public by providing short term bloom alerts and aiding hab management 2 based on the comprehensive understanding of the operating mechanisms of habs in the wleb and careful feature selection we identified eight influencing features in the hab occurrence in the order of 5tn n30 time period wlm10 wld20 ssrp sol30 stn some of which 5tn stn and n30 were for the first considered in the hab modeling for the wleb these features contributed to more accurate models for better control of future habs including new plans to control n in addition to p the findings also emphasized the need to include the most relevant features not just a long list of partial features in ml modeling to achieve good model performance zhong et al 2022 3 this work is not just restricted to retrospective historical data modeling for the identified time sensitive features including total nitrogen loads solar irradiance and two water levels we developed robust lstm models to forecast them in a short term 10 d in advance which in turn can help forecast habs for the wleb nutrient management will also benefit from the lstm predictions at both daily and 10 d scales for the n p features to allow for more strategically adjusting fertilizer applications controlling runoffs and adapting to climate change despite the above results future work is warranted to further improve the model performance including 1 significantly increasing the data volume such as more satellite images at a finer time scale more discussion in text s2 2 making biological features available

15070,the recent outbreaks of harmful algal blooms in the western lake erie basin wleb have drawn tremendous attention to bloom prediction for better control and management many weekly to annual bloom prediction models have been reported but they only employ small datasets have limited types of input features build linear regression or probabilistic models or require complex process based computations to address these limitations we conducted a comprehensive literature review complied a large dataset containing chlorophyll a index from 2002 to 2019 as the output and a novel combination of riverine the maumee detroit rivers and meteorological wleb features as the input and built machine learning based classification and regression models for 10 d scale bloom predictions by analyzing the feature importance we identified 8 most important features for the hab control including nitrogen loads time water levels soluble reactive phosphorus load and solar irradiance here both long and short term nitrogen loads were for the first time considered in hab models for lake erie based on these features the 2 3 and 4 level random forest classification models achieved an accuracy of 89 6 77 0 and 66 7 respectively and the regression model achieved an r2 value of 0 69 in addition long short term memory lstm was implemented to predict temporal trends of four short term features n solar irradiance and two water levels and achieved the nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 12 0 97 feeding the lstm model predictions for these features into the 2 level classification model reached an accuracy of 86 0 for predicting the habs in 2017 2018 suggesting that we can provide short term hab forecasts even when the feature values are not available graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bloom forecast feature selection long short term memory machine learning random forest time series modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the 1960s harmful algal blooms habs frequently occurred in the western lake erie basin wleb but disappeared in the late 1970s due to effective phosphorus control measures commission 1972 depinto et al 1986 however following occasional occurrences in the 1990s habs have started to occur annually since 2002 and reached record levels in recent years stumpf et al 2016 habs can not only release excess toxins which can poison aquatic lives and endanger human health but also cause oxygen depletion and turn the water body into a dead zone usepa 2021 because the wellness or deterioration of lake erie affects millions of residents in the whole lake erie watershed timely and accurate hab forecasts will prepare the stakeholders for upcoming habs and prevent the public from close contact with the poisoned water so far there are a number of reported predictive models that can provide hab forecasts for the wleb most of these models are statistical models that link the extent of monitored bloom biomass to various physicochemical meteorological and hydrodynamic variables briefly the employed statistical functions range from single stumpf et al 2016 2012 or multiple linear regression ho and michalak 2017 and probabilistic models bertani et al 2016 obenour et al 2014 to a spatio temporal geostatistical model fang et al 2019 the involved variables include day of year long term cumulative soluble reactive phosphorus srp maumee river discharge spatial coordinates total spring phosphorus load tp total spring bioavailable phosphorus tbp load water column depth and or wind speed bertani et al 2016 fang et al 2019 ho and michalak 2017 obenour et al 2014 stumpf et al 2016 in addition to those data driven statistical models there are several process based hydrodynamic models verhamme et al 2016 wynne et al 2013 2011 with the latest one being three dimensional at a fine scale and incorporating hydrodynamics nutrient sediment dynamics and vertical mixing to track the hab occurrence verhamme et al 2016 in all the above studies the bloom biomass is quantified by either remote sensing sayers et al 2019 stumpf et al 2012 or in situ sampling bridgeman et al 2013 fang et al 2019 millie et al 2014 please see table s1 in the supplementary material sm for a list of predictive models reported for the wleb since 2010 despite the significant progress in the hab modeling for lake erie there are seven major limitations in the reported models first although nutrient particularly spring p load are known to be key parameters influencing habs in lake erie stumpf et al 2016 2012 other temporal meteorological data such as solar irradiance wind speed water temperature and high flows which carry low levels of nutrient from the detroit river into the wleb are also reportedly affecting the bloom growth in summer bertani et al 2017 michalak et al 2013 however only partial variables are considered in the available models for the wleb for example some of these models only rely on the p load from the maumee river to predict the annual hab levels ho and michalak 2017 obenour et al 2014 stumpf et al 2016 the hydrodynamic model used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa 2021 is mainly based on physical transport processes rather than biological mechanisms to forecast the location and intensity of the bloom twice a week rowe et al 2016 wynne et al 2011 moreover n is known to be limited in summer in the wleb chaffin et al 2013 2014 but the amount of regenerated n in the water column can be thousand times more than the corresponding external n load in late august hampel et al 2019 therefore legacy n or regenerated n may be an important nutrient source for habs yet no available models have considered any n related features in the models models that do not consider all potentially influential variables may not accurately predict the bloom extent or reflect the temporal trend in the habs even though many parameters have been considered second physical transport models are computationally expensive as they require satellite imaging in situ bloom biomass sampling well defined biochemical physiological parameters and extensive waterflow and wind information which are not easy to use for most users li et al 2021 wynne et al 2011 third models that not only have good prediction accuracy but also provide a deep understanding of the operating hab mechanisms are desirable for proper hab control and management forth the statistical functions in the data driven models may not capture the nonlinear interactive and dynamic even stochastic nature of the habs millie et al 2014 like linear regression models which can only predict the annual maximum hab extent in lake erie stumpf et al 2016 additional examples in table s1 fifth running process based models often requires expert knowledge across multiple disciplines because the models involve a large number of parameters that need to be calibrated verhamme et al 2016 sixth many of these models are based on very small sample sizes with the data volume between 10 and 67 bertani et al 2017 see table s1 finally most of the reported statistical models are annual models that provide seasonal forecasts such as the annual noaa forecast noaa 2021 but do not issue short term forecasts to the public ho and michalak 2017 obenour et al 2014 apart from the above models for the wleb machine learning ml models have been successfully employed in bloom predictions for many lakes and rivers rousso et al 2020 for example a gradient boosting binary classification model integrated hydrological parameters water temperature and water quality at the 10 d scale for hab prediction for the han river and achieved a high accuracy of 0 9 based on the kappa coefficient xia et al 2020 pyo et al combined riverine atmospheric and environmental variables with a convolutional neural network for bloom prediction for the nakdong river and achieved a nse of 0 87 pyo et al 2020 when random forest rf was employed together with 27 environmental variables at a time scale of 4 h the model achieved an r2 of 0 89 for the prediction of the phytoplankton community in lake greifensee thomas et al 2018 however these models also did not consider all potentially influential features and did not screen for the most essential features that is comprehensive feature engineering given the powerful predictive ability of ml models it is important to improve the feature engineering and develop ml models for bloom predictions for the wleb yet only a couple of ml models have been employed to model habs in the wleb and achieved some success that is a boosted regression tree model to compare the hab estimates based on 8 different monitoring programs but the r2 was only 33 1 49 8 bertani et al 2017 and artificial neural network ann models for total phytoplankton and microcystis biomass but the training data were only from 2009 to 2011 millie et al 2014 in this study we first conducted a comprehensive literature review and collected data for all influencing features that had been used discussed in previous studies on lake erie since 2010 michalak et al 2013 rousso et al 2020 sayers et al 2019 stumpf et al 2016 as summarized in table s1 based on the available data we then developed rf classification and regression models for short term 10 d scale forecast of habs in the welb during the model development careful feature selection was conducted to exclude redundant information and to identify the most important features which is necessary for efficient and accurate hab predictions and targeted controls we next evaluated the effects of the identified important features such as total nitrogen tn load and water levels which have not been investigated before on the bloom predictions in addition to the p loads that have been widely applied in previous modeling the tn load was recently discovered to be significantly related to habs in the wleb newell et al 2019 paerl et al 2020 therefore short and long term n based features were for the first time added into the model input finally ml models were developed for the prediction of the important riverine and meteorological features because the feature values are not available real time which prevents us from using the rf models for short term 10 d scale bloom forecasts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as the nutrient sources and the occurrence of habs in lake erie are mostly related to western lake erie the study area was concentrated on the wleb as delineated by the area of around 3000 km2 on the left side of the line from point pelee canada to marblehead ohio fig 1 bertani et al 2017 manning et al 2019 verhamme et al 2016 even though the monitored blooms sometimes crossed the boundary of the wleb the crossed parts were still considered when calculating the ci values correspondingly meteorological data were collected for the wleb 2 2 hab quantification habs were quantified by chlorophyll a index ci values using 10 d composite ci values the maximum ci value in a 10 d window extracted from satellite images see text s1 for more details of how to obtain the ci values the reason that 10 d composite ci values were used was that the national centers for coastal ocean science nccos only published processed 10 d composite satellite images for the whole lake from 2002 to 2019 e g fig 1 yielding a total of 240 records the 10 d window was determined based on the availability and representativeness of satellite images due to wind cloud cover and satellite revisiting time stumpf et al 2012 more discussion in text s1 nccos also publishes the annual hab severity levels light mild significant and extreme the ci values were classified into 2 3 or 4 levels based on the severity index table 1 and the levels were set as the corresponding classification model outputs there are several additional hab quantification programs for the wleb please see text s2 for a discussion of these programs and why we decided to use the ci values 2 3 selection of input features to consider all influential factors in the input we conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify all potentially relevant factors including hydrodynamic meteorological physicochemical and time of year that could affect the bloom behavior table 2 scheme s1 all features that have been used in the reported models for lake erie are summarized in table s1 first many studies have used spring p loads for hab predictions ho and michalak 2017 stumpf et al 2016 2012 because these loads are known to significantly affect hab formation either directly or after being deposited in lake sediments bertani et al 2017 michalak et al 2013 therefore we included different loads of spring nutrient between 2002 and 2019 in the input features table s1 and text s3 meteorological features including temperature wind light ice cover and precipitation can also influence the bloom growth and were thus selected too specifically algal blooms are prone to grow in warm and still water that has high light availability paerl and huisman 2008 sellner 1997 light availability represented as solar irradiance is indispensable for photosynthesis of autotrophs like the algae wind speed has reportedly influenced the vertical distribution of blooms in the water column chaffin et al 2020 hunter et al 2008 manning et al 2019 while wind direction also matters for the bloom distribution bertani et al 2017 rowe et al 2016 although not occurring in the summertime ice cover will block the sunlight and influence sediment resuspension in lakes which then subsequently changes the ecology and economy of the lake regions including the p cycle assel 2005 finally precipitation is known for its influence on the nutrient loads richards et al 2010 as precipitation caused runoffs will carry nutrient to the receiving water the hydrodynamic and physicochemical features were mostly obtained for the maumee river referred to as the riverine features sometimes the maumee river provides about 5 of the water influx but approximately 45 50 of the p loading to lake erie which dominates the nutrient loading to the lake bertani et al 2017 elliott 2010 michalak et al 2013 nutrients from the maumee river are known to have a major impact on the occurrence of habs in lake erie as low flushing rates and subsequently long residence times in the lake are favorable for the algal growth in addition the water levels in the wleb near the detroit river wld and the maumee river wlm were selected to monitor the lake inflow rowe et al 2016 and they reflect the water flow direction and water circulation conditions in the wleb please see text s3 for additional discussion on biological features as shown in table s2 the ci values are usually small in early summer and in october and reach peak in late summer to better capture the temporal trend in the bloom occurrence we integrated the time periods over the bloom season as part of the input like in other models bertani et al 2017 fang et al 2019 from june 1st to october 31st there were fifteen 10 d time periods and these time periods were numbered from 1 to 15 1 for the first period of june 1 10 2 for the second period of june 11 20 etc table s2 as the ci data were 10 d composite values most of the selected features were aggregated as 10 d averaged values so that the input and output matched in dimension before the onset and peak of habs there may be delays time lags in the habs responses to the environmental conditions franks 2018 moore et al 2009 valbi et al 2019 time lags were thus considered by calculating 20 d and 30 d average values of the features table 2 bertani et al 2017 to capture both the previous and current conditions moreover 1 y 5 y and 9 y cumulative srp and total nitrogen tn loads were considered to represent the long term p n loads ho and michalak 2017 details about the data sources are in text s4 as some of the features were highly correlated with each other data analysis was conducted to exclude some of the highly correlated features based on the pearson coefficient see text s5 and fig s2 after that we obtained an initial list of 50 input features table 2 compared to the small dataset 240 ci values 50 features were still too many because using irrelevant features might worsen the model performance so we conducted feature selection based on the feature importance to significantly decrease the number of input features while maintaining the model performance as details in section 2 4 2 4 developing bloom prediction models all the data were divided into training and test datasets in a ratio of 4 1 by stratified sampling as we had compared stratified sampling with random data split and obtained better model performance with the stratified sampling details in text s6 the training dataset was further divided into 5 parts for a 5 fold cross validation hastie et al 2009 the feature selection process involved sequentially identifying the least important features and excluding them until we obtained the smallest number of features while still maintaining a good model performance fig 2 c more details in text s6 the obtained regression models were evaluated by the r2 and root mean square error rmse values the obtained classification models were evaluated by the prediction accuracy along with the confusion matrix and the kappa coefficient text s7 table s4 to select the best ml algorithm s for the modeling purposes we compared the performance of 9 widely used ml algorithms ann bootstrap aggregating ba breiman 1996 gradient boosting gb friedman 2001 gaussian processes gp williams and rasmussen 1995 k nearest neighbors knn taunk et al 2019 lstm rf support vector machine svm li et al 2021 and xgboost xgb chen and guestrin 2016 based on all the 50 features and random data split sequentially for the lstm note that grid search was employed to optimize the hyperparameters for all the above algorithms during the model training process texts s6 s8 and s9 include more details of the rf ann and other model development respectively as the performance shown in table s5 rf outperformed all other models in both the classification and regression models therefore rf was employed to develop all the models below after the important features were identified following the feature selection process rf models were developed using these features as the input moreover the habs in 2017 2019 were predicted based on the records from 2002 to 2016 to further evaluate the practical applicability of the rf classification model 2 5 time series modeling with long short term memory lstm one major limitation in the application of the obtained models is that many of the input features are not available real time to timely obtain these features in situ sampling is a helpful solution but requires high cost in comparison predicting these features using data driven models would be an attractive choice existing tools such as the soil and water assessment tool swat a semi distributed hydrological and water quality model arnold et al 1998 kalcic et al 2016 have been implemented to forecast the long term riverine nutrient data for the maumee river kalcic et al 2019 verma et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 however little is done regarding short term forecasts of the parameters swat models also require many predefined parameters such as moisture evaporation and canopy features which largely limits the applicability of the swat models in comparison lstm is an advanced ml algorithm for modeling time series data gers et al 2000 it can overcome the problem of stationary time series and is capable of learning long and short term patterns of changes hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 kratzert et al 2018 maier and dandy 1996 as lstm can quickly yield fair predictions using the target itself as the input especially when there are decades of records available for example based on 40 years of river flow data in hun river china researchers used lstm for river flow prediction at a 10 d scale and obtained a good performance nse 0 75 xu et al 2020 with decades of monitoring data we employed lstm to develop predictive models at the daily scale and 10 d scale for selected riverine and meteorological features which will aid nutrient management and hab forecast respectively details of lstm and how the lstm models were developed are listed in text s9 and fig s4 as ann is also a common ml algorithm for water quality prediction chen et al 2020 ann models were also developed and compared with the lstm models the results table s6 showed that lstm outperformed ann in predicting the five riverine features so lstm was used for all the time series modeling lstm models were optimized for four rf features sol30 n30 wld20 and wlm10 at the 10 d scale to predict the feature values for each 10 d period we averaged the historical data into 10 d averages to be consistent with the ci periods and predicted 10 d averages for each feature by using all the data from the prior periods as the training data for example when the n10 data for the period of july 1st to july 10th 2017 was to be predicted it was treated as the test set and the tn data records prior to june 30th 2017 were used as the training set the predicted n10 is the model predicted 10 d average n values the predicted n30 was the average of the predicted n10 and the observed tn in the previous 20 d for the 31 10 d periods between 2017 and 2019 table s2 we obtained 31 predicted n30 values similarly we obtained 31 predicted values each for sol30 wld20 and wlm10 the predicted values not the observed values for these features were then employed in the rf2 model for predicting the hab levels in 2017 2019 and the performance was evaluated 3 results and discussion 3 1 classification and regression modeling based on rf according to the severity index shown in table 1 the ci values were initially divided into four levels as the output for 4 level rf classification rf4 models however as the data shown in table 1 there are 148 data points for level 1 rf4 l1 habs but only between 24 and 37 data points for levels 2 4 rf4 l2 to l4 blooms as the whole dataset was very unbalanced we further divided the data into 3 levels and 2 levels for 3 level classification rf3 model we set light blooms as rf3 l1 mild blooms as rf3 l2 and extreme and severe blooms as rf3 l3 for 2 level classification rf2 model we set light and mild blooms as rf2 l1 and extreme severe blooms as rf2 l2 for each classification model we employed the feature selection process to eliminate insignificant features while maintaining the model performance and ended up with only eight to nine most important features details in section 3 2 which were employed to build the final models fig 3 a and tables s7 9 summarize the performance of the rf2 rf3 and rf4 models on the test set using the respectively identified top 8 9 and 9 features the rf2 model has the best performance with the overall accuracy of 89 6 and the kappa coefficient of 0 73 note that a kappa value of 0 4 is deemed weak that of 0 6 is moderate and that of 0 8 is strong mchugh 2012 the prediction accuracy is higher for rf2 l1 blooms than for rf2 l2 blooms 94 3 vs 76 9 in comparison svm and a naïve bayes classifier were recently applied to predict karenia brevis bloom events in the west florida gulf for two level predictions li et al 2021 with 318 bloom events and 765 non bloom events in the dataset they obtained an accuracy of 79 by svm as the best performance using riverine tp tn q temperature wind speed direction and sea surface height as the features given that the above study had more data points 1083 vs 240 and a more balanced data distribution between the two levels l1 l2 2 4 1 vs 3 4 1 the performance of the rf2 model developed in this study is quite satisfactory we further tried to address the data imbalance issue by either synthesizing additional data or removing a portion of the rf2 l1 data but did not observe improved model performance details in text s11 the rf3 model had an overall accuracy of 77 1 and a moderate kappa coefficient of 0 59 but it had a low accuracy of 25 0 for rf3 l2 habs fig 3a and table s8 the rf4 model had an overall accuracy of 66 7 and a weak kappa coefficient of 0 43 it however had a low accuracy of 25 0 and 18 2 for rf4 l2 and rf4 l3 blooms respectively 100 for rf4 l4 blooms the imbalanced dataset and small sample size are most likely the reasons for the poor performance because accurate ml models require both high data quality and large sample sizes tao et al 2017 nevertheless both the rf3 and rf4 models still have a high accuracy of 96 3 for rf4 l1 blooms and good accuracy for the most severe blooms so both models can accurately issue a safety notice to the public the rf regression model achieved an r2 of 0 72 and 0 69 for the training set and test set respectively fig 3b the model performance on the training set is similar to that of the reported linear regression or probabilistic models r2 from 0 71 to 0 97 table s1 but those models are based on much smaller sampler sizes 10 28 the performance on the test set is better than that of reported ml models r2 of 0 181 to 0 497 for boosting regression tree models bertani et al 2017 or 0 76 and 0 50 for ann models based on only 3 years of biomass data millie et al 2014 the performance of the regression model is also better than that of the reported phytoplankton models whose typical r2 values range from 0 4 to 0 6 arhonditsis and brett 2004 to further examine the ability of the rf models to predict habs we trained another rf2 model based on the data from 2002 to 2016 to predict the habs between 2017 and 2019 as shown in table s11 the developed model showed an overall accuracy of 74 2 and a moderate kappa coefficient of 0 45 with the annual accuracy of 91 82 and 44 for the year of 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively four of the 9 predictions for the year of 2019 were overestimation probably due to the high stp and ssrp levels in 2019 fig 4 from 2002 to 2019 the year of 2019 had the 2nd highest stp 3rd highest ssrp and 7th highest stn the high nutrient levels might have contributed to the overestimation additional predictions for the year of 2020 were also made based on the whole dataset covering 2002 2019 to simulate real practices and the predictions matched the reported values text s12 table s12 overall the above results demonstrated that the obtained rf models can be employed to successfully predict habs in the wleb given that the rf2 model performed the best and might be a more practical way e g only those extreme and severe habs are of more concern and more informative to the public we focus on the rf2 model below to predict hab levels for the wleb 3 2 interpretation of the feature importance it is essential to interpret the obtained ml models and examine if they are trustworthy following the ground truth this was done by ranking the feature importance which can also help 1 achieve parsimonious models so that only the minimum number of features are needed to facilitate the application of the models because all these feature values should be obtained through intensive data collection monitoring or modeling efforts fewer features also introduce less uncertainties and 2 design effective hab management plans based on the most relevant features following the feature selection process in section 2 4 we identified eight most important features for the rf2 model in the order of 5tn n30 time period wlm10 wld20 ssrp sol30 stn as discussed below this feature importance rank also agreed well with the shapley values obtained from the shapley feature interpretation method see text s13 and fig s7 the relevance or non relevance of all other features is discussed in text s14 it was initially surprising that 5tn n30 and stn were among the identified 8 important features as they revealed the significant role of n in the hab modeling yet n has not been incorporated in any of the reported hab prediction models for lake erie according to the monthly nutrient loadings into the lake there is usually no n limitation except in late summer chaffin et al 2013 2014 in some extreme years such as 2011 there is no n limitation even in the late summer michalak et al 2013 as a result researchers have been focusing on p when developing models for the wleb stumpf et al 2012 however an abundant spring tn load is necessary for the late summer bloom growth moreover a recent study on the sandusky bay lake erie discovered that the amount of internal ammonia regenerated in the water column over the three summer months accounted for 77 of the annual external tn load and the amount of regenerated n in late august was even 1000 times of the corresponding river n input into the bay hampel et al 2019 similar findings have also been reported for lake taihu where 9 of the external n load was stored in the lake and the regenerated ammonia in the water column provided 38 58 of the nh4 needed for summer fall blooms xu et al 2021 furthermore recent studies have proposed both n and p reduction plans for habs management since n and p reportedly jointly spur the growth of habs paerl et al 2016 2020 in agreement with the above findings the worst habs in lake erie occurred in 2011 and 2015 which had the highest spring n p loads fig 4 these findings suggest a potentially important role of n in the hab formation in the wleb and the necessity to integrate n based features such as 5tn and n30 in the models to capture the influence of long term and short term n loadings respectively text s15 shows our additional effort to improve the performance of the rf2 model by considering different contributions of regenerated n but the model performance did not improve further time of the year time period ranked the third because as mentioned previously habs in the wleb follow the temporal trend of starting in early june peaking around august and disappearing in october therefore time is an essential feature to capture the dynamics in hab formation similarly day of year and month of year have been employed as input features in recent space time geostatistical and machine learning models table s1 bertani et al 2017 fang et al 2019 the water levels near the maumee river wlm10 and the detroit river wld20 were identified as two of the most important features in the rf2 models in the literature the hydraulic load from the detroit river was also treated as a significant parameter affecting the hab formation in the wleb kane et al 2014 scavia et al 2016 this is because high flowrates along with low nutrient concentrations from the detroit river can dilute the lake water and the river flow will affect the lake circulation wynne et al 2011 a recent study linked the hab occurrence to low water levels because a low water level leads to water stabilization and nutrient accumulation rousso et al 2020 however we observed significantly higher water levels for rf2 l2 habs than for rf2 l1 habs p 0 001 fig 5 a b for the wleb rowe et al 2016 based on the recorded 10 d average water levels from 2002 to 2020 fig s8 there are clear trends that the water levels near the maumee and detroit rivers increased from the beginning of the year to the midyear and then kept decreasing for the remaining of the year the increasing water levels in the first half of the year means that the inflows are greater than the outflows this can lead to the accumulation of nutrient rich water in the wleb over summer which may provide a better condition for hab formation generally p is the known limiting factor for the hab formation in the wleb chaffin et al 2014 joosse and baker 2011 matisoff and ciborowski 2005 therefore the model correctly identified ssrp as a major feature in addition cumulative p load has been demonstrated to be influential to lake erie habs del giudice et al 2018 ho and michalak 2017 the 1srp 1 year cumulative soluble reactive phosphorus was the 9th important feature identified by the model which presented a significant importance among other features but it was not included in the final 8 features because including it did not further improve the model performance better features to represent long term p effects might be needed solar irradiance sol30 was the seventh most important feature it is related to the clearness of the sky as a cloudless sky is associated with higher water temperature and calm water conditions this finding agrees with previously reported hab prediction models for the lake table s1 bertani et al 2017 millie et al 2014 rowe et al 2016 where solar irradiance is often found to be positively related to habs rousso et al 2020 similar types of 5 9 input features were also identified for the 3 and 4 level classification models and the regression model with slight differences in the time lags or the feature importance see the captions of tables s8 9 and fig 3 in comparison the reported ml models for the wleb used a total of 29 31 input features bertani et al 2017 millie et al 2014 table s1 the identified small number of features in this study significantly simplified the model input while still achieving very good model performance this comparison also demonstrates the need to incorporate the most influential input features in ml modeling 3 3 lstm time series modeling of input features among the top eight input features for the rf2 model four are short term variables sol30 n30 wld20 and wlm10 while the other four are not 5tn time period ssrp and stn since the short term features are not readily available real time we d like to build predictive models for them so the rf models can be applied for short term hab forecasts fig 5c shows the performance of the lstm models for the four short term features at the 10 d scale sol10 wld10 and wlm10 all had good nse values of 0 88 0 97 n10 showed a low nse of 0 12 which might be due to the large fluctuation in the n values the optimized lstm models were then employed to predict values for the four features 31 predictions per feature for 2017 2019 the predicted and observed data for these features agreed well with the r2 values of 0 75 0 92 and 0 89 for sol10 wld10 and wlm10 respectively and that for n10 being 0 22 the lower r2 value for the n10 still might be due to the higher data fluctuation later the predicted 10 d average values were combined with the historical data to calculate sol30 wld20 and n30 and the predicted and observed data had a much better agreement with the r2 of 0 94 0 9 and 0 9 respectively to examine how well the lstm predictions can be used for forecasting habs we employed the data from 2002 to 2016 to forecast the habs in 2017 2019 and achieved an overall accuracy of 77 4 86 for 2017 2018 with the annual accuracy of 91 82 and 56 for 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively compared to the rf2 hindcast model in section 3 1 this model performs almost the same even slightly better for 2019 demonstrating the feasibility of combining the lstm and rf models for forecasting habs for the wleb in addition we built predictive models for the common riverine parameters fig 5d because an accurate prediction of q would help forecast potential flooding events and facilitate subsequent response plans and timely nutrient predictions can guide nutrient control measures for the maumee river watershed the performance of the optimized lstm models for the 10 parameters at the daily scale is summarized in fig 5d and table s14 all the models presented good nse values of higher than 0 8 except for tkn 0 60 and sol 0 62 although tkn has a lower nse of 0 60 the good nse of 0 87 for n on the daily scale is more important as n is used in the rf models 4 conclusion many features are known to considerably influence the extent of habs in the wleb in this work we identified a novel combination of only eight input features some were for the first time considered in one model from a long list of 50 initial features and employed them to build ml models for predicting hab levels in the wleb final model summarized in fig 6 overall we have three major findings 1 we developed effective classification and regression rf models to predict short term 10 d scale hab levels in the wleb and achieved an accuracy of up to 89 6 2 level classification rf2 on the test set these models filled the gap between twice a week and annual bloom predictions and will benefit the public by providing short term bloom alerts and aiding hab management 2 based on the comprehensive understanding of the operating mechanisms of habs in the wleb and careful feature selection we identified eight influencing features in the hab occurrence in the order of 5tn n30 time period wlm10 wld20 ssrp sol30 stn some of which 5tn stn and n30 were for the first considered in the hab modeling for the wleb these features contributed to more accurate models for better control of future habs including new plans to control n in addition to p the findings also emphasized the need to include the most relevant features not just a long list of partial features in ml modeling to achieve good model performance zhong et al 2022 3 this work is not just restricted to retrospective historical data modeling for the identified time sensitive features including total nitrogen loads solar irradiance and two water levels we developed robust lstm models to forecast them in a short term 10 d in advance which in turn can help forecast habs for the wleb nutrient management will also benefit from the lstm predictions at both daily and 10 d scales for the n p features to allow for more strategically adjusting fertilizer applications controlling runoffs and adapting to climate change despite the above results future work is warranted to further improve the model performance including 1 significantly increasing the data volume such as more satellite images at a finer time scale more discussion in text s2 2 making biological features available

area slope for circumferential and longitudinal cracks in pipes if the results can be replicated these equations will allow crack behavior to be accurately modelled using a theoretically sound approach replacing the current equations developed by cassa and van zyl 2013 and fox et al 2017 while i commend the impressive scope and significant contribution of the study there are two aspects that require clarification namely the size and impact of longitudinal pipe wall stresses and inconsistencies in the experimental results 2 longitudinal pipe wall stresses the paper uses two equations eqs 6 and 7 to estimate longitudinal and circumferential pipe wall stresses induced by internal pipe pressure these equations can be derived from a free body analysis of a closed cylindrical container in which the internal pressure is counteracted through longitudinal and circumferential wall stresses for example see gere 2001 however water distribution pipes are generally supported in the longitudinal direction by external thrust blocks or restraints these supports counteract the internal pressure forces and thus reduce or eliminate pressure dependent longitudinal wall stresses van zyl and malde 2017 cassa et al 2010 investigated the impact of pressure dependent longitudinal stresses on the head area slope of circumferential cracks by considering two extreme cases a bi axial loading state with pressure dependent longitudinal wall stresses as described by eq 6 and a uni axial loading state with no longitudinal wall stresses while they observed small and negative head area slopes for the uni axial loading state they found positive head area slopes comparable to this study for the bi axial loading state the small and negative head area slopes of circumferential cracks for the uni axial loading state have been replicated in other modeling cassa and van zyl 2013 and experimental van zyl and malde 2017 studies while the authors only considered the bi axial loading state in their study it is important to note that this assumption may not reflect the behavior of water distribution pipes in the field and thus that circumferential cracks may display significantly smaller head area slopes than observed in their study 3 experimental results the study experimentally determined the head area slopes of leaks using photographic measurements and showed that these slopes correspond well with the theoretical tada paris and klecker models however the paper does not provide a detailed comparison between head area slopes and their corresponding leakage exponents which were independently obtained using hydraulic measurements the authors note inconsistencies between these two measurements citing cases where head area slopes are positive suggesting the leakage area increases with pressure but with corresponding leakage exponents below 0 5 suggesting the leakage area decreases with pressure for instance tests on 40 mm long and 1 5 mm wide longitudinal and circumferential slits in a steel pipe external diameter 90 mm and wall thickness 3 mm found head area slopes of 0 004 and 0 0004 mm2 m and leakage exponents of 0 45 and 0 42 respectively it is possible to show theoretically that these head area slopes are so small that their equivalent leakage exponents should be 0 50 and thus can be assumed fixed van zyl et al 2017 van zyl and cassa 2014 this is supported by a comparable experiment conducted by van zyl and malde 2017 using a 115 mm external diameter steel pipe with wall thickness 4 92 mm containing 1 mm wide longitudinal and circumferential slits with lengths 50 and 53 mm respectively using only hydraulic measurements they observed similar head area slopes to this study but leakage exponents of 0 50 in both cases the authors explanation for the inconsistencies is that the measured discharge coefficient cd decreases with reynolds number for most of the test samples note that laminar flow through orifices occur at reynolds numbers below 10 not 2000 idelchik 1987 however since it appears that the authors calculated the discharge coefficients by replacing the photographically measured leak areas and corresponding hydraulically measured pressures and flow rates into the orifice equation eq 1 their discharge coefficient values may include other influencing factors such as the following experimental measurement

flow past the test section van zyl and malde 2017 installed their test samples in a dead end pipe rather than the pipe loop used in this study the significant flow through the test section during tests may have affected the leakage behavior the effect of submerging the test section which differs from the unsubmerged tests by van zyl and malde 2017 coetzer et al 2006 observed that submerging

15072,photochemical reactions widely occur in the aquatic environment and play fundamental roles in aquatic ecosystems in particular solar induced photodegradation is efficient for many organic micropollutants omps especially those that cannot undergo hydrolysis or biodegradation and thus can mitigate chemical pollution recent reports indicate that photodegradation may play a more important role than biodegradation in many omp transformations in the aquatic environment photodegradation can be influenced by the water matrix such as ph inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter dom the effect of the water matrix such as dom on photodegradation is complex and new insights concerning the disparate effects of dom have recently been reported in addition the photodegradation process is also influenced by physical factors such as latitude water depth and temporal variations in sunlight as these factors determine the light conditions however it remains challenging to gain an overview of the importance of photodegradation in the aquatic environment because the reactions involved are diverse and complex therefore this review provides a concise summary of the importance of photodegradation and the major processes related to the photodegradation of omps with particular attention given to recent progress on the major reactions of dom in addition major knowledge gaps in this field of environmental photochemistry are highlighted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive intermediates water matrix dissolved organic matter photodegradation physical factors 1 introduction photochemistry is deeply integrated into the earth s biological and ecological systems in the atmosphere the presence of oxygen and its photochemical product ozone screen out most ultraviolet radiation uv from the sun making life on earth possible visible light which is transmitted through the atmosphere is intimately involved in various biological and chemical phenomena such as vision of humans and animals photosynthesis and photodegradation those phenomena are explained by the sequential reactions caused by excited states of atoms and molecules wayne 2005 as such solar light and the induced photochemical processes are fundamental aspects of ecosystems and the environment consequently photochemistry often appears as a dominant process in health and environmental problems as well nucleic acids and proteins are readily damaged by short wavelength radiation i e uv and ecosystems can be disrupted by excess or unwanted light i e light pollution li et al 2022 such alterations of the light environment have been shown to date mostly in relation to plant and animal physiology häder and barnes 2019 li et al 2022 as well as aquatic photochemistry and microbiology sulzberger et al 2019 organic micropollutants omps are a serious concern due to their occurrence persistence and toxicity in aquatic environments for instance pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been frequently detected worldwide in many water bodies including coastal seawaters rivers and lakes madikizela et al 2020 given their unexpected interaction with organisms a certain portion of omps is detrimental to aquatic organisms rozas et al 2017 including bacteria algae invertebrates brausch and rand 2011 hernando et al 2006 michael et al 2014 and fish crane et al 2006 schwaiger et al 2004 the direct consequence of antibiotic residues is the development of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains grenni et al 2018 which can potentially cause severe disease including urinary tract lower respiratory tract and bloodstream infections sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 in addition even at low concentrations long term exposure to omps increases the ecological risk to aquatic organisms in the water environment kumar et al 2019 yang et al 2020 generally in aquatic ecosystems each omp can exhibit a wide range of concentrations ng l to μg l level kameda et al 2011 patel et al 2019 petrović et al 2014 vimalkumar et al 2018 zareitalabad et al 2013 relatively high omp concentrations have commonly been observed in water bodies that receive treated wastewater because conventional wastewater treatment plants are not equipped to eliminate omps efficiently gruchlik et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 margot et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 sörengård et al 2019 photodegradation plays an essential role in the fate of omps particularly in the surface layer of water bodies where solar irradiation i e uv and visible light are abundant during the daytime thereby inducing direct and indirect photolysis of omps in direct photolysis omps undergo various photodegradation paths depending on their chemical structure and the direct absorption of solar radiation is enhanced by the presence of light absorbing functional groups such as aromatic rings boreen et al 2003 challis et al 2013 edhlund et al 2006 fatta kassinos et al 2011 indirect photodegradation in natural water involves photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical ho which can initiate photodegradation of omps vione et al 2014 overall the rate of photodegradation depends on the chemical structure of omps the irradiance determined by the photon flux in a particular wavelength band and the water constituents present e g dom boreen et al 2004 fent et al 2006 despite a growing number of studies on such underwater photolysis a majority of them describe processes and mechanisms only under well controlled conditions e g in a photochemical reactor equipped with an artificial lamp thus it is often difficult to place such knowledge in the context of photodegradation of omps in the natural aquatic environment compared with other pathways e g biodegradation the importance of photodegradation in the real environment is more largely unknown recently several articles have been conducted to describe the in situ photochemical processes bouhala et al 2020 dimou et al 2005 shih and wang 2009 nevertheless the focus on irradiation conditions processes and target omps remain scarce and fragmented these facts underscore the critical need to conduct comparative studies e g baena nogueras et al 2017 ossola et al 2021 to obtain a comprehensive overview of the photodegradation as well as to undertake a quantitative assessment of omps in the aquatic environment water matrix is widely regarded as an important factor in determining the photodegradation of omps due to its role in the production of ppris and the inhibition of photolysis challis et al 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 vione et al 2014 vione and scozzaro 2019 yan and song 2014 nevertheless limited knowledge of photodegradation processes in various water matrices including the complex photoreactions of dom preclude us to obtain a comprehensive overview of such processes in addition photodegradation is also affected by various other physical environmental factors such as water depth latitude season and time of day these physical factors have received less attention than the water matrix although many of the former are likely more important in defining the photodegradation kinetics of omps than the latter therefore the impact of physical factors on photodegradation need to be elucidated as the basis for enhancing knowledge of environmental photochemistry in the broader sense given these environmental processes that have yet to be revealed we believe that it would be useful to update the existing knowledge in the field to achieve more effective management of aquatic photodegradation of omps this review therefore aims to provide a concise overview of the importance of photochemical reactions in the fate of omps in the aquatic environment from a comprehensive viewpoint and addresses the basics of aquatic photochemistry and its relation to environmental factors including the water matrix and physical conditions 2 why photodegradation solar energy is abundant on the surface layer of water bodies although approximately 72 of the solar energy reaches the earth s surface valero et al 2000 the short wavelengths 280 nm are completely absorbed due to atmospheric absorption and scattering consequently direct solar irradiance is decreased from 1361 w m 2 at the top of the atmosphere to about 1000 w m 2 at the earth s surface coddington et al 2016 myers 2013 the total energy that reaches the earth s surface is about 3 1024 j per year which is equivalent to approximately 6500 times the annual energy consumption of humankind 4 6 1020 j per year klan and wirz 2009 within a water body omps are mainly degraded and transformed by biological e g biodegradation and chemical e g photolysis hydrolysis processes among them hydrolysis is usually slow and requires the existence of hydrolytic functional groups in the omp such as ester bonds xu et al 2019 2021 while photodegradation and biodegradation occur more extensively in the water environment owing to the abundant solar radiation and various photosensitizers i e dom in the water photodegradation may be a pivotal removal pathway for many omps with possible interactions with other processes baena nogueras et al 2017 reported that the photodegradation and biodegradation rate constants of 33 frequently detected ppcps carried out following oecd guidelines no 316 oecd 2008 and no 306 oecd 1992 were significantly larger than their hydrolysis rates furthermore most of the studied ppcps exhibited faster photodegradation half life t 1 2 range 0 02 29 h than biodegradation t 1 2 range 4 2310 h fig 1 while we should note that this comparison depends on local physicochemical condition as well in addition typical ppcps such as ibuprofen ibp diclofenac dcf and sulfamethoxazole smx exhibited photodegradation rates of 0 03 h 1 t 1 2 23 h 4 04 h 1 t 1 2 0 17 h and 0 19 h 1 t 1 2 3 73 h respectively in spiked pure water under simulated solar light in contrast ibp exhibited a biodegradation rate of 0 0005 h 1 t 1 2 1386 h in spiked freshwater while dcf and smx exhibited no biodegradation at all for 28 days baena nogueras et al 2017 these studies suggested that photodegradation may play a more important role in many omps transformation processes than biodegradation many omps are toxic to microorganisms ebert et al 2011 larsson et al 2007 le page et al 2017 patel et al 2019 rubasinghege et al 2018 partly because of the intended uses of the omps for example as antimicrobial agents this toxicity poses significant challenges in terms of biodegradability in the environment hence among the potential degradation and transformation processes photodegradation possibly plays a rather important role in deciding the fate of omps in aquatic environments it is also noteworthy that photochemical transformation of omps including photodegradation in some cases may result in photo induced toxicity and generate more persistent products which possibly increases the ecological risk buth et al 2007 latch et al 2003a plumlee et al 2009 robert et al 2017 for instance the photodegradation of fenoxaprop p ethyl forms higher toxic and more persistent products such as 4 6 chloro 2 benzoxazolyl oxy phenol 48 h ec50 of 1 49 1 64 mg l lin et al 2008 simulated solar irradiation can enhance the acute toxicity of fluoroquinolones and anthraquinones to daphnia magna luo et al 2018 wang et al 2009 3 overview of aquatic photodegradation the photodegradation process is active only during daytime when light is abundant and the corresponding rate of photodegradation is highly affected by the light intensity imposed on the omps or photosensitizers in addition the extent of light attenuation increases with the depth of the water column and varies seasonally mathon et al 2019 against this backdrop the influence of natural solar light on the degradation of omps remains largely unknown and has been scarcely studied despite that such information is essential for understanding the attenuation process of omps and elucidating their fate in the environment wang et al 2021b photodegradation processes can be either direct or indirect wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 de la cruz et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 2 direct photolysis occurs when omps directly receive photon energy from an irradiation source and the omp s electrons are excited to a higher energy level this allows the molecule to undergo chemical transformations i e fragmentation intramolecular rearrangement isomerization hydrogen atom abstraction dimerization and electron transfer from to the compound ultimately causing the omp to photodegrade schwarzenbach et al 2002 an omp s capability to undergo direct photolysis depends on two factors the ability of the omp to absorb photon energy as indicated by its molar absorption coefficient and the likelihood of the molecule to undergo a chemical transformation as indicated by its quantum yield ge et al 2009 yao et al 2013 additionally direct photolysis can be influenced by the water matrix via processes such as light screening caused by light absorbing constituents as well as back reduction by dom liu et al 2020 in indirect photodegradation photons are received by photosensitizers to produce ppris which ultimately degrade the target omps therefore the composition of the water matrix in which the target omps occur can have a positive or negative influence on the efficiency of photodegradation lado ribeiro et al 2019 the indirect photodegradation is largely dependent on water matrix components such as no3 no2 and dom because these components can photo generate ppris to degrade the omps ge et al 2009 however the impact of such components can also vary depending on the target omps wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 sun et al 2014 as well as the source of dom sun et al 2014 which will be elaborated in the following section of this review photodegradation studies are usually conducted under well controlled conditions in the laboratory the rates of photodegradation obtained from the laboratory experiments were then extrapolated to different environments providing a great practical significance for the management of chemicals precursors of omps however this strategy poses several challenges because laboratory conditions are often different from those in real water bodies mackay 2001 in recent years a kinetics based and user friendly model called apex aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics has been developed to predict the photo transformation kinetics of omps bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 zhou et al 2018 have also developed a kinetics based photodegradation rate prediction model taking into account the variations in the intensity of underwater and hourly sunlight these two models are useful in extrapolating photochemical persistence data determined in the laboratory to the real environment although further development is needed to comprehensively study photodegradation in actual water environments the input photochemical parameters of omps in the aforementioned models such as quantum yield of direct photolysis and the second order reaction rate constants are necessary for predicting the photochemical persistence however these parameters are not available for most of omps actually thousands of chemicals have already been synthesized and used and thus have entered the aquatic environment prediction of those photochemical parameters for omps is pertinent to persistence evaluation some pioneering studies employed quantitative structure activity property relationship qsar qspr to predict these parameters including the quantum yield for omps chen et al 2000 2001a 2001b niu et al 2005 shao et al 2010 yang et al 2003 and the photochemical kinetics parameters li et al 2014 luo et al 2017 2019 which provide an opportunity for prediction given the lack of relevant data nevertheless this article cannot cover all the basics of environmental photochemistry and interested readers may refer relevant literature for further details about the basic mechanisms boule 1999 calza and vione 2015 klan and wirz 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2002 4 effects of the water matrix on photodegradation photodegradation of omps can be influenced by the constituents in the water matrix such as ions no3 no2 fe2 fe3 co3 2 hco3 halide ions etc dom and suspended solids ge et al 2010a 2010b 2010c vione et al 2014 likewise coexisting omps can be considered as water matrix components that can also affect photodegradation the water matrix can either accelerate photodegradation or inhibit it in addition the water ph can influence the charge state of dom and the presence of ionized omps in water indicating a dependency of photodegradation upon the ph values of the water boreen et al 2004 ge et al 2010a wei et al 2013 werner et al 2006 for example ciprofloxacin cip has five dissociated species and each of them had dissimilar photolytic kinetics and products wei et al 2013 in the following sections the effects of the water matrix on the photodegradation of omps are further elaborated 4 1 inorganic ions inorganic ions are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and play various roles in the photodegradation of omps the ions can interact with omps thereby altering their photodegradation behaviors for example coordination with transition metals such as cu ii can alter the light absorption characteristic and photo reactivity of omps wei et al 2015 in addition some inorganic ions can produce ppris e g photolysis of no3 no2 can produce ho which can provide additional opportunities for degradation of refractory omps in this section the focus is given mainly to inorganic ions that can produce ppris on the photodegradation of omps no3 no2 are ubiquitous in natural waters and play important roles in the photodegradation of omps because no3 no2 are important sources of ho the no3 no2 are usually more abundant in freshwater than seawater boule 1999 takeda et al 2004 indicating production of ho by photolysis of no3 no2 in freshwater can be more efficient than that in seawater no3 no2 can produce ho through direct photolysis under the action of solar radiation λ 280 nm the main reactions are shown below mack and bolton 1999 wu et al 2020 1 no2 hv no o 2 no3 hv no2 o cage 3 o h ho as shown in eqs 1 3 both no3 and no2 can directly absorb solar radiation and produce o which is a precursor of ho the pka of ho is 11 9 eq 3 suggesting that reaction 3 favors the generation of ho at environmental ph mack and bolton 1999 no2 can be transformed to its conjugated acid hono which is more efficient in producing ho thereby increasing the production of ho with decreasing the ph however this ph effect is obvious only in water with a ph 5 which is not a common ph in surface waters arakaki et al 1999 no3 can photo isomerize into oono and form its conjugated acid hoono with pka 6 5 7 where hoono can produce ho while oono cannot gligorovski et al 2015 mack and bolton 1999 nevertheless this pathway may also be insignificant in the natural environment because the quantum yield for photoproduction of oono under solar radiation is low less than 0 26 at 313 nm irradiation benedict et al 2017 although the concentration of no2 is usually lower than that of no3 in natural waters no2 absorbs solar radiation more effectively and produces ho with a higher quantum yield ф no2 ho 0 025 0 065 depending on wavelength ф no3 ho 0 01 vione et al 2014 overall comparable roles of no3 and no2 in producing ho were commonly reported gligorovski et al 2015 minero et al 2007 takeda et al 2004 fe ion species particularly fe ii fe iii complexes mainly hydroxo and organic complexes can participate in fenton photo fenton reactions to generate ho that causes omps degradation in sunlit aquatic environments the photochemistry of fe has been reviewed previously and two representative equations eqs 4 and 5 concerning ho production are shown below lueder et al 2020 vione et al 2014 the importance of these reactions depends on specific water bodies where the ph is low enough and the concentrations of fe ii fe iii are sufficiently high gligorovski et al 2015 this is because fenton photo fenton reactions are favored under low ph conditions ph 2 3 feng and nansheng 2000 4 feoh2 hv fe2 ho 5 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho photodegradation of omps can be influenced by co3 2 hco3 mainly due to the generation of the carbonate radical ion co3 that reacts with omps in sunlit water bodies co3 is a selective oxidant with e nhe co3 co3 2 1 59 v huie et al 1991 which is lower than that of ho while its steady state concentration is estimated to be two orders of magnitude higher than that of ho sulzberger et al 1997 the reactions between co3 and omps mainly occur via electron transfer or a hydrogen abstraction mechanism liu et al 2018 thus co3 plays an important role in photodegradation of some omps containing electron rich structures such as nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds thiols and aromatic compounds anilines and phenols busset et al 2007 de laurentiis et al 2014 mazellier et al 2007 sun et al 2020 wu and linden 2010 co3 is a secondary radical because as shown in eqs 6 and 7 the co3 is generated through either reaction between co3 2 hco3 and ho or between co3 2 and excited species i e excited triplet state of dom and omps 3dom 3omps yan et al 2019 6 hco3 co3 2 ho co3 h2o ho 7 co3 2 3dom 3omp co3 reaction 6 is highly ph dependent because of the dissociation of carbonic acid to co3 2 and hco3 that occurs at different ph values pka1 6 3 and pka2 10 3 vione et al 2014 the generation of co3 is more strongly favored when ph increases from 6 to 9 circumneutral ph as co3 2 is more reactive than hco3 toward ho k hco3 ho 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 k co3 2 ho 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 and the proportion of co3 2 increases when the ph increases zhou et al 2020 eq 7 is important only under specific conditions waters with high doc canonica et al 2005 and in most cases eq 6 is the dominant reaction for generating co3 in natural water bodies halide ions can react mainly through an oxidation reaction with photochemically produced ho or 3dom to form various halogen radical species x x2 and xy where x and y stand for cl br or i parker and mitch 2016 zhang and parker 2018 zhang et al 2018a 8 ho x hox 9 hox ho x 10 hox h h2o x 11 hox x y ho x2 xy 12 3dom x dom x 13 3dom 2x or x y dom x2 xy compared with x x2 and xy are dominant in halide containing sunlit waters concentrations of all types of x2 are estimated to be three orders of magnitude higher than all x because x especially for cl are abundant which can rapidly react with x to form x2 xy ershov 2004 yang and pignatello 2017 in seawater the steady state concentrations of br and brcl are estimated to be 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of ho zhang and parker 2018 these halogen radicals can be quenched by hco3 co3 to form co3 and by dom to form dom radical halogen radicals can react with omps via halogenation cheng et al 2021 and many polyhalogenated omps can be produced these omps can exhibit serious ecological risks lallas 2001 on the other hand halogen radicals can also react with omps through oxidation reactions where halogen atoms are not introduced into the reaction products wang et al 2021a since the reaction between halogen radicals and the omps is a redox reaction the redox potential is pertinent to the reaction the reduction potential of cl e nhe 2 5 v is the highest among all the halogen radicals others range from 1 1 to 2 2 v and is slightly lower than that of ho e nhe 2 7 v indicating that cl has high reactivity toward many omps wardman 1989 halogen radicals can react with saturated aliphatic compounds via hydrogen abstraction olefinic compounds via addition reaction aromatic compounds via addition reaction electron abstraction and organosulfur species adduct formation or sulfur oxidation wang et al 2021a zhang and parker 2018 in addition to the generation of halogen radicals parker et al 2013 have reported that an increase in ionic strength can slow down intra organic matter electron transfer of 3dom resulting in higher steady state concentrations of 3dom 3dom ss elevation of 3dom ss by halide ions has also been observed in further studies as well as the quenching of excited singlet state dom 1dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 higher 3dom ss can promote photodegradation when 3dom is critical to photodegradation chen et al 2019 li et al 2016b suppression of photodegradation by halide ions was also observed for 17β estradiol a phenol and this was attributed to the inhibition of electron transfer pathways between 3dom and 17β estradiol grebel et al 2012 parker et al 2013 further research is needed to clarify the relative importance between the elevation of 3dom ss and inhibition of the electron transfer pathways by halide ions in the photodegradation of omps regarding halide specific effects previous studies have found that cl and br can enhance photobleaching of dom grebel et al 2009 grebel et al 2012 thereby decreasing the sensitizing ability of dom and inhibiting photodegradation halide ions like br may also exhibit a heavy atom effect on photodegradation which can promote intersystem crossing from the excited singlet state to the excited triplet state and influence the photodegradation as a consequence koziar and cowan 1977 li et al 2016a 4 2 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in environmental water bodies and it can widely absorb solar radiation up to 500 nm nebbioso and piccolo 2013 after absorbing light dom can produce various ppris such as 1dom aqueous electron e aq superoxide o2 h2o2 3dom 1o2 and ho which contribute to photodegradation fig 3 dom can also inhibit photodegradation for example by competing for light with omps and quenching ppris generated during photodegradation 4 2 1 promotion effects carbonyl structures and aromatic compounds are the main chromophores of dom these chromophores absorb solar radiation and first produce 1dom with a short lifetime and low steady state concentration in environmental waters boyle et al 2009 1dom has high reactivity and has been shown to play a pivotal role in the formation of some ppris such as e aq and charge transfer state dom dom the excited singlet state aromatic groups mainly phenol and its derivatives such as aromatic carboxylic acids köhler et al 1985 and aromatic amino acids mossoba et al 1982 in 1dom can eject e aq the e aq generated plays an insignificant role in omps attenuation in environmental waters because it is produced only inside the dom microenvironment and mostly recombines with cations before escaping into the bulk solution zepp et al 1987 only hydrophobic omps with a very high octanol water partition coefficient k ow such as mirex k ow 106 29 burns et al 1996 1997 can bind with dom so that e aq can react to them 1dom can also produce dom through direct intramolecular electron transfer mckay et al 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 these dom states are formed as a result of the transfer of an electron either partially or completely from an electron rich donor e g hydroxy or alkoxy benzenes to an electron poor acceptor e g carbonyl containing moieties like aromatic ketones and quinones mckay et al 2016 to date dom is widely regarded as the major ppri responsible for the production of o2 ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 electron rich phenolic moieties are precursors of dom which further verified that dom is the precursor of o2 o2 often acts as a weak oxidant with e nhe o2 h2o2 0 91 v playing an important role in the redox speciation of dissolved metals in natural water bodies ma et al 2020 catalyzed or uncatalyzed disproportionation of o2 can produce h2o2 cooper and lean 1989 petasne and zika 1987 scully et al 1996 which is an important ppri because it can further generate ho through fenton reactions southworth and voelker 2003 although only about 12 35 of o2 is transformed to h2o2 via dismutation le roux et al 2021 where another portion of o2 undergoes photoinduced loss possibly by reacting with dom ma et al 2020 o2 is still considered the most important ppri for producing h2o2 aromatic carbonyl and quinone groups in 1dom about 4 8 can be transformed to 3dom through intersystem crossing mckay 2020 although 3dom is less reactive than 1dom 3dom has a longer lifetime and higher steady state concentration 10 14 to 10 12 m thereby making it an important ppri in environmental waters mcneill and canonica 2016 3dom can directly react with omps via oxidation e g electron transfer proton coupled electron transfer or other related mechanisms or energy transfer mcneill and canonica 2016 and is also the precursor of 1o2 and ho mainly ho like species 3dom tends to react with aromatic anilines and electron rich phenols via an oxidation mechanism it mainly acts as an oxidant and thus should have a higher reduction potential than the target compound plenty of examples of oxidation with 3dom were summarized by mcneill and canonica 2016 for energy transfer reactions with 3dom a prerequisite is that the compound should have lower excited triplet energy e t than that of 3dom the reaction between o2 and 3dom that forms 1o2 is a typical energy transfer reaction it requires only 94 kj mol 1 zepp et al 1977 1o2 occurs in sunlit dom solutions with steady state concentrations ranging from 10 12 to 10 15 m which is in the same range as 3dom mcneill and canonica 2016 peterson et al 2012 1o2 is a selective oxidant and can react rapidly with only certain omps such as phenolates and furans ossola et al 2019 as well as indoles imidazoles and some easily oxidized amino acids boreen et al 2008 latch et al 2003b it is notable that the distributions of 1o2 exhibit a microheterogeneity because the species is produced in a microenvironment of dom and sometimes it reaches higher steady state concentration in the hydrophobic sites of dom compared with that in the bulk solution grandbois et al 2008 latch and mcneill 2006 therefore hydrophobic omps that can bind to dom are possibly susceptible to reaction with 1o2 in addition to 1o2 it is often reported that only compounds containing dienes can react with 3dom through energy transfer via compounds such as sorbic acid grebel et al 2011 isoprene and sorbic alcohol zhou et al 2019a and the corresponding products are their cis trans isomers since dienes structures rarely occur in omps oxidation of omps by 3dom is more common than energy transfer li et al 2015 2016a 3dom are mixtures of different excited triplet state species which means the e t is distribution rather than a definite value zepp et al 1985 employed diene probes and demonstrated that about 37 of 3dom had high e t 250 kj mol 1 labeled as high energy 3dom hi 3dom the remainder was labeled as low energy 3dom 94 kj mol 1 e t 250 kj mol 1 recently zhou et al 2019a used sorbic alcohol e t 250 kj mol 1 as a hi 3dom probe and found that the average proportion of hi 3dom in 15 different types of dom was 33 close to the 37 reported previously zepp et al 1985 further work by wang et al 2020a confirmed the high reactivity of hi 3dom in the photodegradation of omps using 11 different types of doms notably the proportion of hi 3dom depended on the source of dom with the proportion being higher in autochthonous freshwater dom than allochthonous freshwater dom zhou et al 2019a a more recent study indicated that about 58 of the hi 3dom generated from leaf litter soil stream water and lake water samples can react with 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp a widely used electron transfer probe verifying that hi 3dom is possibly important in oxidation of omps wasswa et al 2022 they also reported the precursors of hi 3dom were photo resistant and bio refractory meaning that hi 3dom may be more important in reaction with omps and generating 1o2 even after undergoing environmental processes like photobleaching and biodegradation furthermore guo et al 2021 found that maricultural seawater dom s dom can generate more hi 3dom than s dom with less influence of mariculture contributing to the high reactivity of 3dom this is the first time to quantify hi 3dom in s dom given that s dom is different from freshwater dom in many aspects detailed in section 4 2 3 however further study is needed to clarify whether hi 3dom plays an important role in the overall photodegradation of omps in the natural environment as has been assumed 3dom is a precursor of ho which is a highly reactive radical that reacts with omps at a near diffusion controlled rate ho production by dom also exhibits microheterogeneity similar to that of 1o2 where more ho is possibly produced inside the hydrophobic core of dom yan et al 2021 hence hydrophobic omps that can enter the dom microenvironment are possibly specifically susceptible to photodegradation however in sunlit surface waters the steady state concentration of ho 10 16 10 18 m is much lower than that of 3dom or 1o2 even though direct photolysis of nitrite nitrate or photo fenton reactions can elevate the steady state concentration of ho mack and bolton 1999 white et al 2003 zepp et al 1992 regarding the production of ho there is still a dispute as to whether ho is produced by 3dom or other precursors like dom in dom solutions exposed to sunlight mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 in addition to free ho the generation of ho like species has also been reported including lower energy hydroxylation intermediates that react with omps at a slightly lower rate than free ho reacts with them and quinones are regarded as the precursors of these species gan et al 2008 liu et al 2019 page et al 2011 although studies usually do not distinguish between them in measurement the presence of ho like species can be confirmed by using methane which selectively quenches ho rather than ho like species page et al 2011 two pathways were proposed for the production of ho namely h2o2 dependent and h2o2 independent pathways mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 the percentage for the h2o2 dependent pathway varied among the dom samples page et al 2011 in the h2o2 independent pathway it has been observed that the steady state concentrations of 3dom and 1o2 increased while the quantum yield of ho decreased after quenching of 1dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 implying that ho and 1o2 do not share the same precursor 3dom and that 1dom may contribute to ho production sun et al 2015 found that direct photolysis of substituted phenols specifically carboxylate substituted phenols may be an important source of ho in dom two feasible pathways were proposed 1 the carboxylate substituted phenol generates an e aq and a phenol cation radical then the phenol cation radical either undergoes deprotonation and forms ho or 2 is transformed to a dihydroxycyclohexadienyl radical intermediate that finally eliminates ho however the importance of this mechanism is not clear because good correlation has not been observed between the quantum yield for ho production and the dom electron donating capacity edc which is mainly due to polyphenol moieties in dom mckay et al 2017 this lack of good correlation could be due to the small experimental database the heterogeneity in producing ho from different substituted phenols sun et al 2015 and the fact that some polyphenolic ho precursors are formed only after dom is irradiated berto et al 2016 thus further studies are needed to clarify the production mechanism of ho in dom solutions and in particular the correlation between the quantum yield for ho production and edc should be investigated using irradiated dom 4 2 2 inhibition effects of dom light screening and quenching are the two main inhibition effects of dom on the photodegradation of omps canonica and laubscher 2008 chin et al 2004 the light screening effect is based on the fact that dom competes for light with the omps resulting in inhibition of the direct photolysis the light screening effect is unavoidable for most omps because direct photolysis is induced mainly by short wavelength light which overlaps the absorption spectra of dom under solar radiation in addition to omps dom also screens and weakens radiation for other photosensitizers such as no3 no2 inhibiting their photolysis that yields ho vione et al 2014 phenolic moieties are mainly responsible for the quenching effects in dom solutions these electron rich compounds can transfer an electron to 3dom thereby consuming 3dom but this inhibition effect is not predominant in sunlit natural water bodies canonica et al 2000 a recent study reported that quenching of hi 3dom is more apparent than that of low energy 3dom owing to the higher redox potential of hi 3dom zhou et al 2019a on the other hand the phenolic moieties can reduce the reactive intermediates generated from the oxidation reaction between 3dom and omps for example oxidation of aromatic anilines by 3dom forms a cation radical aromatic aniline after the loss of an electron electron rich phenolic moieties can transfer an electron to the cation radical reducing it back to its parent compound thus inhibiting the reaction wenk and canonica 2012 previous studies have reported that the content of phenolic moieties in autochthonous dom is lower than that in allochthonous dom guo et al 2021 zhou et al 2019a and thus the quenching effects is less obvious in autochthonous dom bahnmüller et al 2014 wang et al 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 additionally canonica and laubscher 2008 reported that the quenching effects were observed in the photodegradation of omps containing phenols anilines and the like and that the inhibition efficiencies were different for different compounds photobleaching of dom can be considered as an indirect inhibition effect of dom after photobleaching of dom its photo reactivity is decreased helms et al 2009 2014 moran et al 2000 niu et al 2014 in photobleaching the chromophores are photochemically destroyed either through direct destruction of the dom molecules by light or reactions between dom and ppris after photobleaching of dom the rate of photodegradation of omps in the same solutions could decrease the photodegradation rate of omps decreased as the length of irradiation time increased and the decrease was highly dependent on the characteristics of both the dom and omps niu et al 2014 using solid state 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy helms et al 2014 found that aromatic carbon was preferentially removed while carbohydrate like and amide peptide like carbons remained after photobleaching for up to 110 days 4 2 3 seawater dom vs freshwater dom although seawater covers 71 of the earth s surface and acts as an important sink of omps less attention has been paid to the effects of s dom on the photodegradation of omps compared with freshwater dom this is due to the difficulty of extracting s dom from seawater that typically has high salinity and relatively low dom content s dom is mainly autochthonous dom derived from cellular excretions of marine phytoplankton and bacteria s dom normally undergoes photobleaching for a long time and can be influenced by anthropogenic sources such as mariculture in coastal regions hence the effects of s dom on the photodegradation of omps can differ from those of freshwater dom reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis ro ed technology is normally used to extract s dom due to its high recovery efficiency zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 extracted s dom by ro ed and found that s dom influenced by mariculture activities exhibited higher photo reactivity higher ppris production quantum yield light absorption rate and 3dom reactivity than s dom extracted from more pristine seawater wang et al 2019 also found that compared with reference freshwater dom suwannee river fulvic acid and suwannee river natural organic matter srnom s dom undergoes more photobleaching in which a lower content of c c and c o functional groups is observed however compared with freshwater dom s dom enhanced the photodegradation of both 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone and nebivolol to a greater extent which was attributed to the higher reactivity of 3dom with the omps and fewer antioxidants in the s dom wang et al 2020b 2019 further work by guo et al 2021 indicated that hi 3dom is not responsible for the higher reactivity of 3dom from s dom than that from freshwater dom in contrast a lower content of phenolic moieties that lessened inhibition explained the higher reactivity of 3dom from s dom however the s dom was extracted only from coastal areas in the bohai sea and further studies concerning the photochemistry of s dom from other regions are needed 4 3 suspended solids and coexisting pollutants suspended solids such as sand clay particulate organic matter and phytoplankton are also ubiquitous in surface waters these components can influence the underwater light environment adsorb omps and affect photosensitizing processes kirk 1985 lund hansen 2004 rose et al 2014 shang et al 2015 possibly altering the photodegradation of omps for example suspended solids can inhibit the photodegradation of sulfamethoxazole and the inhibition effects become stronger with increasing concentration of the suspended sediments niu et al 2013 the inhibition effect was mainly due to the suppression of ho generation while adsorption of sulfamethoxazole on solids played an insignificant role thirumavalavan et al 2012 attributed the effect of suspended solids to turbidity and light attenuation and their study showed that the photodegradation of microcystin lr was impeded when the turbidity increased notably a variety of omps rather than a single one may coexist in the same water body and thus the photodegradation of an omp can be influenced by the coexisting omps generally the coexisting omps can have multifarious effects on the photodegradation processes jentzsch et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b depending on the intended functions of the coexisting omps for example uv absorbers used in polymers are designed to absorb photon energy and then to release the excitation energy in the form of heat so they can compete for photons with the target omp during photodegradation primary antioxidants are capable of reacting with ppris thus preventing further propagation of oxidation reactions the antioxidants can also consume the generated ppris and prevent further reactions with the target omp hunt 2000 in addition recent studies have reported that trace amounts of co existing omps can also increase the photodegradation of other omps in waters jentzsch et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2019b for example bezafibrate bzf displayed faster photodegradation in the presence of fenofibrate acid fnfa in ultrapure water wastewater treatment plant effluent water and the receiving river water despite the usual resistance of bzf to degradation the promotional effect of fnfa was due to its ability to generate 1o2 and e aq further tests conducted with srnom 5 0 and 10 0 mg l and bzf 5 0 mg l in the presence and absence of fnfa 1 0 mg l revealed that the presence of fnfa induced much faster photodegradation of bzf than the presence of srnom zhou et al 2019b hence the influence of co existing omps on each other s degradation can be important in surface waters despite their lower concentration compared with dom however the influences of co exposure of the omps on mutual photodegradation has hardly been studied in water environments given the increased detection of diverse omps in surface waters further investigations are necessary to elucidate the influence of co existing omps on their mutual persistence in environmental waters 5 major physical factors for photodegradation of omps photodegradation is also influenced by physical environmental factors such as the depth of water latitude temporal variation diurnal and seasonal and temperature koumaki et al 2015 mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 zepp and cline 1977 those physical effects have received less attention than the water matrix because the physical effects are caused by variation of the light intensity and the wavelength profile apart from the diversity of photochemical reactions however changes in physical factors cannot be ignored when aiming to understand the photochemical reactions and the overall fate of omps for example thermal lake stratification can determine the vertical distribution of omp concentrations as a result of the vertical mixing process and photolysis in the surface layer rehrl et al 2020 assuming the same wavelength profile the rate of photodegradation would be proportional to the photon influx in fact most studies involving in situ photodegradation experiments performed at different locations and different times i e different latitudes and seasons might be more readily comparable if the effects of physical factors on light conditions are better understood 5 1 latitude sunshine duration and cloud conditions vary depending on latitude this would obviously influence the availability of underwater light and thus light absorption by photosensitizers or omps annual irradiance measured over the period 1951 1960 shows a substantial change with latitude fig 4 landsberg 1961 lewis 1987 the total annual irradiance on the earth s surface is maximal at the equator theoretically the tropical latitudes 0 to 25 should have the highest annual irradiance fig 4 theoretical earth surface because the sun shines almost directly over these areas however the subtropical latitudes 25 to 40 were observed to have the highest annual irradiance fig 4 land masses this is because cloud conditions can influence the amount of solar radiation that reaches the earth s surface clouds can decrease the solar flux by up to 70 of the initial solar radiation that is transmitted through the atmosphere to the surface janjai et al 2011 the effect of cloud cover on decreasing light transmission has been estimated to be between 31 for uvb radiation and 72 for photosynthetically active radiation par musiolková et al 2021 in addition the uneven distribution of moisture causes the transmissivity of the atmosphere to be unusually high over the subtropical land masses thus more light can reach the earth s surface at subtropical latitudes than in tropical regions lewis 1987 given a constant attenuation coefficient daily irradiance at latitudes between 10 n and 5 s shows peaks twice a year in march and september lewis 1987 the annual minimum daily irradiance for a constant attenuation coefficient near the equator would be approximately 85 of the annual maximum daily irradiance the range of minima on the tropical latitudes is significantly higher and the minimum daily irradiance at 30 latitude is approximately 50 of the minimum at the equator fig 4 the relative importance of shorter wavelengths also varies depending on the latitude which possibly affects the absorption spectra and the rate of photodegradation of omps schmitt et al 2021 due to the tilt of the earth s axis of rotation solar energy is received at a low angle at high latitudes hence the distribution of net energy per unit area is much less than that in the tropics also higher latitudes above 50 often have the shortest sunshine duration annually and have more cloudy and rainy weather at latitudes higher than 66 7 the polar region no direct energy is received at all from the sun for at least part of the year roots 1989 therefore the degradation rate and the half life times that are determined experimentally need to be corrected to estimate the actual degradation rate in the different regions furthermore the attenuation of light by clouds has uncertainties with respect to the climatic reduction of light intensity at various geographical locations indirect relationships of latitude with the water matrix and photochemistry can be identified based on the environmental conditions of the surface water for instance lakes located in high latitude regions may be covered with ice for much of the year so sunlight can barely reach the underlying water unless the ice melts the photochemical process may likely cease to exist due to the efficient attenuation of light sommaruga 2001 moreover several water bodies in high latitude nordic countries experience noticeable browning a gradual increase in dom concentration weyhenmeyer et al 2016 such browning could affect photoreactions by enhancing processes that are triggered by 3dom and 1o2 over those induced by ho co3 and direct photolysis calderaro and vione 2020 in addition to shifting the photodegradation pathways toward 3dom the increase in dom could also lower the photodegradation rate constants and increase the photochemical persistence of omps vione and scozzaro 2019 recent studies have updated the solar irradiance spectra between 70 s and 70 n at different times of the year and these were validated against high resolution spectroradiometer measurements apell and mcneill 2019 simulations of ppri production using the updated solar irradiance spectra show that the spectrum of sunlight plays a role that is as important as the role of light intensity in determining ppri production furthermore the dependence of ppri production on the solar irradiance spectra has recently been evaluated by designing reactors equipped with monochromatic led lights for the experiments the result show that the quantum yields of ris decreased with an increasing wavelength from 375 to 490 nm and notably decreased to zero above 490 nm wu et al 2021 5 2 seasonal and diurnal cycles the solar irradiance varies daily and seasonally due to the rotation and revolution of the earth and the temporal variation of sunlight affects the photodegradation of omps in terms of daily variation the photochemical persistence of omps can be prolonged for omps with photodegradation t 1 2 being over days because no photodegradation occurs at nighttime for example recent studies indicated that the photodegradation t 1 2 of omps can be significantly underestimated if the variation of the intensity of sunlight with the time of day is not considered zhou et al 2018 chen et al 2019 guo et al 2021 on the other hand the variations i e seasonal and diurnal of the water matrix such as ph no2 no3 and dom together with the irradiance of sunlight affected the photochemical processes including the overall kinetics of the omp photo transformations vione et al 2018 compared with freshwater and estuarine systems the attenuation of sunlight in seawater is generally the weakest zhou et al 2018 and thus such differences will also highly likely affect the photochemical rates and processes as a whole the diurnal solar light variations in nigeria tropic soneye et al 2019 and northeast china mid latitude zhou et al 2018 are presented in fig 5 a and 5b respectively the solar intensity increases from 7 am reaching a maximum at around noon and decreases to 0 wm 2 at around 6 pm the variation in the intensity of solar light suggested that the photodegradation rate of omps should likewise show a variation although photodegradation studies usually simulate a solar intensity at noon which could largely overestimate the degradation rate of the omps in addition as shown in fig 5a variation of the diurnal pattern of light intensity over the seasons can also be observed such differences in light intensity are caused by the attenuation of light by aerosol particles in the dry season and increased cloudiness and humidity in the wet season stratification is also a seasonal phenomenon that commonly occurs in lakes and reservoirs which also influences the photochemical processes in waters for example lake water typically undergoes stratification in summer in temperate climates the epilimnion is the surface layer of water and thus receives more illumination meaning that photodegradation processes will be more active there in contrast the hypolimnion is poorly illuminated due to light screening by the overlying water column so photochemical processes are limited or negligible vione 2020 the epilimnion and hypolimnion evolve differently and thus a depth profile gradient is generated with respect to the concentration of photodegradable omps avetta et al 2016 if the omp is completely photodegraded in the epilimnion the stratification phase considerably slows down the overall degradation kinetics vione and scozzaro 2019 a recent study investigated the photodegradation of 23 omps in the free water surface constructed wetland during the summer and winter in southern france 43 85 n for the 23 omps studied direct photolysis was the predominant process in summer while indirect photodegradation was more significant in winter although the light intensity was higher in summer the no3 concentration was higher in winter enhancing the formation of ho that promoted the wintertime indirect photodegradation mathon et al 2019 in addition a 7 year survey in a stream in the usa observed seasonal variation of no3 in which no3 concentrations were high during summer while low from mid autumn to late spring the low no3 concentrations were attributable to the maximum availability of sunlight irradiance in late spring and the seasonal input of leaves to the stream in autumn mulholland and hill 1997 another study conducted in the guadiana river spain has also shown that photodegradation is more important in summer than in winter vione et al 2018 in the months with the highest clear sky sunlight irradiance i e june and july the river water showed low no3 concentrations and high dom levels this phenomenon may be quite typical of the surface water bodies as the minima for no3 and the maxima for doc concentrations occur frequently in summer in several surface water environments vione et al 2018 5 3 water depth underwater light intensity is generally attenuated with increasing water depth due to various components in the water column such as phytoplankton particles dom ions and water itself h2o absorbs mainly red light around 700 nm which is one of the reasons for the color of the sea hale and querry 1973 sunlight attenuation underwater alters the availability of light and affects the photochemical reactions of omps and photosensitizers zhou et al 2018 light absorption and scattering are the main causes of light attenuation in the water bodies kirk 1977 in general the intensity of light decreases exponentially with depth as described by eq 14 14 i z i 0e ez where i z and i 0 are the intensities of light wm 2 or quanta m 2s 1 at depth z m and just below the surface respectively and e is the vertical attenuation coefficient m 1 for downward irradiance scheffer 2004 which is affected by water matrix components such as dom and inorganic ions the depth of this photic environment varies depending on the water matrix and the wavelength of light avetta et al 2016 boreen et al 2003 vione and scozzaro 2019 the depth of light penetration generally refers to the depth at which the light has been attenuated by 99 zepp and cline 1977 turbid lakes and estuaries show a light penetration depth of 0 3 m while the clearest oceans have a penetration depth up to 150 m gons et al 1997 in terms of wavelength the depth of light penetration in freshwater is low for uv blue and red light whereas green and yellow transmit to deeper water levine and macnichol 1982 moreover the wavelength profile of the irradiation shifts vertically in water depending on the water matrix minero et al 2007 the absorption effects of dom change depending on the wavelength profile especially for light with wavelengths below 500 nm therefore the penetration depth for sunlight is greater in waters containing lower concentrations of dom and the corresponding rates of photo transformation may be larger bracchini et al 2007 in addition the enhancement of photoreactions in shallow water is more conspicuous for processes triggered by uv absorbing species such as no3 no2 vione and scozzaro 2019 previous studies concluded that uv light is attenuated by water within tens of centimeters of depth in lakes with a high dom concentration and turbidity in both cases the photochemical reactions are significantly affected by the light attenuation huovinen et al 2003 leavitt et al 1997 markager and vincent 2000 it has also been reported that the steady state concentration of 1o2 in lake waters decreased by a factor of 8 8 when the depth increased from 0 m to 20 m indicating that depth is an important factor in determining indirect photochemical processes partanen et al 2021 another study employing the apex model demonstrated that the photochemical half lives t 1 2 of three omps ibuprofen carbamazepine and diclofenac are almost linearly correlated with depth vione et al 2018 in addition to the variation of light attenuation with depth photochemical reactions in the surface layer z 0 m differ from those in bulk water because the surface layer air water creates a unique environment that can promote unique chemical reactions george et al 2015 kappes et al 2021 for example interfaces covered with fatty acids are ubiquitous in the environment and fatty acids are believed to be photochemically inert in the actinic region however direct photolysis of fatty acids has been shown to occur and complex volatile organic compounds are generated at an air water interface coated solely with a monolayer of carboxylic acid rossignol et al 2016 likewise photochemical reactions may also occur at the water sediment interface in water bodies where the light is not completely attenuated at the bottom of the water column these photochemical water sediment interface reactions might determine the fate of many hydrophobic omps because sorption by sediments is an important removal pathway for omps golovko et al 2020 koba et al 2018 nevertheless the photochemical reactions at interfaces have receive relatively little attention and further studies are needed 5 4 temperature in general the temperature is higher in summer than in winter and decreases with increasing water depth and latitude several photodegradation studies have highlighted the impact of temperature on the photodegradation process for instance mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 studied the effect of temperature on ho formation using five different types of dom isolates at four or five different temperatures within the range of 10 40 c the apparent activation energies ea for ho formation from the doms kj mol 1 were obtained using the arrhenius equation eq 15 15 ln ф a e a rt ln a where ф a is the apparent quantum yield of ho through dom photolysis r is the universal gas constant kj k 1 mol 1 t is the absolute temperature k and a is the pre exponential factor plots of ln ф a vs 1 t revealed significant slopes indicating the temperature dependency of ho formation through photolysis of the dom isolates in addition the photolysis of p benzoquinone was studied by applying the arrhenius equation to the production of phenol through p benzoquinone photolysis and the loss of p benzoquinone it was revealed that ф a of formation of phenol through p benzoquinone photolysis was temperature independent while ф a of p benzoquinone loss was temperature independent when the temperature was over 23 c and temperature dependent when the temperature was less than 23 c mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 zhu and kieber 2018 studied the photolysis of acetaldehyde glyoxal and methylglyoxal in north pacific seawater under simulated solar radiation and revealed the apparent quantum yield of acetaldehyde was temperature independent while those for glyoxal and methylglyoxal were temperature dependent kieber et al 2014 determined the impact of temperature on the apparent quantum yield for photochemically producing h2o2 in seawater samples collected from stations located in antarctica the pacific ocean the gulf of mexico and the several other sites located on the east coast of the united states their experimental results revealed that the apparent quantum yields for h2o2 production increased within the temperature range of 0 35 c with an average factor of 1 8 every 10 c the study indicated that the decrease of temperature and irradiation toward the polar region was mainly responsible for the decrease in h2o2 production in the seawater as indicated above the temperature effects on the photochemical transformations in the aquatic environment are significant although the level of influence varies depending on the omps or the process of concern therefore it is necessary to acknowledge temperature as an important physical factor influencing photochemical reactions in water 6 major knowledge gaps and challenges the dom photochemistry is complex and has not been comprehensively explored further investigations are needed with a specific focus on topics such as the production mechanisms of ho the role of hi 3dom in photodegradation and the photo reactivity of less studied dom e g s dom further research efforts are needed to develop prediction models for parameters necessary to describe the kinetics of omp photodegradation quantum yield second order rate constant etc thus the model applicability can be improved in terms of domain and prediction accuracy at present it is impossible to exhaustively determine the kinetics parameters of all omps experimentally given the recent development of computing performance and new calculating methods research is encouraged to apply computational calculations e g quantum chemical calculation molecular dynamics simulation and machine learning to aquatic photochemical study as they can provide insights at a molecular level lereche et al 2021 vialykh et al 2020 westermayr and marquetand 2021 xia et al 2022 modeling of photodegradation rates of omps in water bodies is required for their comprehensive understanding which possibly supports sustainable application and discharge of organic chemicals in environment although the current models such as apex is kinetics based and practical there is scope for further development such as inclusion of the reactivity of actual 3dom quantum yields for the formation of ppris in different water matrix and reactions involving halogen radicals photochemical and biological processes have close linkages in aquatic environment in terms of degradation and toxicity of omps and thus the comprehensive experimental studies elucidating actual environmental processes should also receive attention photodegradation has been shown to enhance the toxicity of omps in some cases so researchers must also pay attention to degradation pathways and the potential toxicity of byproducts vione and carena 2020 computational toxicology can be of great help in assessing the ecotoxicity of products as standard chemicals are not always available the available photochemistry studies are biased toward temperate and subarctic regions and thus more attention should be paid to tropical regions where the incident solar radiation is more intense and many developing countries may have to deal with serious pollution caused by omps a standard protocol for indirect photodegradation studies is needed to provide meaningful data to allow comparative research and ecological risk assessment recommendations for the determination of 1o2 quantum yield is one such example ossola et al 2021 in general the increasing diversity of omps in water bodies is responsible for multifarious photodegradation which poses challenges both in environmental science and environmental management for maintaining sustainable aquatic ecosystems 7 conclusions chemical pollution by omps has become a serious environmental issue and thus understanding the fate of omps is essential for ecological risk assessment this review highlighted photodegradation as a major removal process of many omps in the aquatic environment its significance and processes depend on both physical and chemical conditions which are pertinent to the persistence of omps physical condition basically determines overall energy input for photochemical reactions while water matrix i e inorganic ions dom suspended solids and coexisting pollutants determines reaction pathways and rates in both direct and indirect photolysis in particular s dom exhibits high photochemical reactivity on photodegradation of major types of omps such as sulfa drugs given that seawater is an important sink of omps photochemical studies regarding s dom extracted from seawater should be supplemented for comprehensively understanding of the fate of omps in seawater in addition to such experimental studies to elucidate each pathway this review also pointed out the importance of integrating different approaches such as modeling based on theoretical and empirical equations and comprehensive experiment combining photochemical and biological processes those challenges support the design and implementation of reasonable and practical methods for the management of omps in aquatic environment in this sense we hope this review will stimulate further investigation of photodegradation processes and the fate of omps declaration of

15072,photochemical reactions widely occur in the aquatic environment and play fundamental roles in aquatic ecosystems in particular solar induced photodegradation is efficient for many organic micropollutants omps especially those that cannot undergo hydrolysis or biodegradation and thus can mitigate chemical pollution recent reports indicate that photodegradation may play a more important role than biodegradation in many omp transformations in the aquatic environment photodegradation can be influenced by the water matrix such as ph inorganic ions and dissolved organic matter dom the effect of the water matrix such as dom on photodegradation is complex and new insights concerning the disparate effects of dom have recently been reported in addition the photodegradation process is also influenced by physical factors such as latitude water depth and temporal variations in sunlight as these factors determine the light conditions however it remains challenging to gain an overview of the importance of photodegradation in the aquatic environment because the reactions involved are diverse and complex therefore this review provides a concise summary of the importance of photodegradation and the major processes related to the photodegradation of omps with particular attention given to recent progress on the major reactions of dom in addition major knowledge gaps in this field of environmental photochemistry are highlighted graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive intermediates water matrix dissolved organic matter photodegradation physical factors 1 introduction photochemistry is deeply integrated into the earth s biological and ecological systems in the atmosphere the presence of oxygen and its photochemical product ozone screen out most ultraviolet radiation uv from the sun making life on earth possible visible light which is transmitted through the atmosphere is intimately involved in various biological and chemical phenomena such as vision of humans and animals photosynthesis and photodegradation those phenomena are explained by the sequential reactions caused by excited states of atoms and molecules wayne 2005 as such solar light and the induced photochemical processes are fundamental aspects of ecosystems and the environment consequently photochemistry often appears as a dominant process in health and environmental problems as well nucleic acids and proteins are readily damaged by short wavelength radiation i e uv and ecosystems can be disrupted by excess or unwanted light i e light pollution li et al 2022 such alterations of the light environment have been shown to date mostly in relation to plant and animal physiology häder and barnes 2019 li et al 2022 as well as aquatic photochemistry and microbiology sulzberger et al 2019 organic micropollutants omps are a serious concern due to their occurrence persistence and toxicity in aquatic environments for instance pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have been frequently detected worldwide in many water bodies including coastal seawaters rivers and lakes madikizela et al 2020 given their unexpected interaction with organisms a certain portion of omps is detrimental to aquatic organisms rozas et al 2017 including bacteria algae invertebrates brausch and rand 2011 hernando et al 2006 michael et al 2014 and fish crane et al 2006 schwaiger et al 2004 the direct consequence of antibiotic residues is the development of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains grenni et al 2018 which can potentially cause severe disease including urinary tract lower respiratory tract and bloodstream infections sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 in addition even at low concentrations long term exposure to omps increases the ecological risk to aquatic organisms in the water environment kumar et al 2019 yang et al 2020 generally in aquatic ecosystems each omp can exhibit a wide range of concentrations ng l to μg l level kameda et al 2011 patel et al 2019 petrović et al 2014 vimalkumar et al 2018 zareitalabad et al 2013 relatively high omp concentrations have commonly been observed in water bodies that receive treated wastewater because conventional wastewater treatment plants are not equipped to eliminate omps efficiently gruchlik et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 margot et al 2013 ribeiro et al 2015 sörengård et al 2019 photodegradation plays an essential role in the fate of omps particularly in the surface layer of water bodies where solar irradiation i e uv and visible light are abundant during the daytime thereby inducing direct and indirect photolysis of omps in direct photolysis omps undergo various photodegradation paths depending on their chemical structure and the direct absorption of solar radiation is enhanced by the presence of light absorbing functional groups such as aromatic rings boreen et al 2003 challis et al 2013 edhlund et al 2006 fatta kassinos et al 2011 indirect photodegradation in natural water involves photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radical ho which can initiate photodegradation of omps vione et al 2014 overall the rate of photodegradation depends on the chemical structure of omps the irradiance determined by the photon flux in a particular wavelength band and the water constituents present e g dom boreen et al 2004 fent et al 2006 despite a growing number of studies on such underwater photolysis a majority of them describe processes and mechanisms only under well controlled conditions e g in a photochemical reactor equipped with an artificial lamp thus it is often difficult to place such knowledge in the context of photodegradation of omps in the natural aquatic environment compared with other pathways e g biodegradation the importance of photodegradation in the real environment is more largely unknown recently several articles have been conducted to describe the in situ photochemical processes bouhala et al 2020 dimou et al 2005 shih and wang 2009 nevertheless the focus on irradiation conditions processes and target omps remain scarce and fragmented these facts underscore the critical need to conduct comparative studies e g baena nogueras et al 2017 ossola et al 2021 to obtain a comprehensive overview of the photodegradation as well as to undertake a quantitative assessment of omps in the aquatic environment water matrix is widely regarded as an important factor in determining the photodegradation of omps due to its role in the production of ppris and the inhibition of photolysis challis et al 2014 mcneill and canonica 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 vione et al 2014 vione and scozzaro 2019 yan and song 2014 nevertheless limited knowledge of photodegradation processes in various water matrices including the complex photoreactions of dom preclude us to obtain a comprehensive overview of such processes in addition photodegradation is also affected by various other physical environmental factors such as water depth latitude season and time of day these physical factors have received less attention than the water matrix although many of the former are likely more important in defining the photodegradation kinetics of omps than the latter therefore the impact of physical factors on photodegradation need to be elucidated as the basis for enhancing knowledge of environmental photochemistry in the broader sense given these environmental processes that have yet to be revealed we believe that it would be useful to update the existing knowledge in the field to achieve more effective management of aquatic photodegradation of omps this review therefore aims to provide a concise overview of the importance of photochemical reactions in the fate of omps in the aquatic environment from a comprehensive viewpoint and addresses the basics of aquatic photochemistry and its relation to environmental factors including the water matrix and physical conditions 2 why photodegradation solar energy is abundant on the surface layer of water bodies although approximately 72 of the solar energy reaches the earth s surface valero et al 2000 the short wavelengths 280 nm are completely absorbed due to atmospheric absorption and scattering consequently direct solar irradiance is decreased from 1361 w m 2 at the top of the atmosphere to about 1000 w m 2 at the earth s surface coddington et al 2016 myers 2013 the total energy that reaches the earth s surface is about 3 1024 j per year which is equivalent to approximately 6500 times the annual energy consumption of humankind 4 6 1020 j per year klan and wirz 2009 within a water body omps are mainly degraded and transformed by biological e g biodegradation and chemical e g photolysis hydrolysis processes among them hydrolysis is usually slow and requires the existence of hydrolytic functional groups in the omp such as ester bonds xu et al 2019 2021 while photodegradation and biodegradation occur more extensively in the water environment owing to the abundant solar radiation and various photosensitizers i e dom in the water photodegradation may be a pivotal removal pathway for many omps with possible interactions with other processes baena nogueras et al 2017 reported that the photodegradation and biodegradation rate constants of 33 frequently detected ppcps carried out following oecd guidelines no 316 oecd 2008 and no 306 oecd 1992 were significantly larger than their hydrolysis rates furthermore most of the studied ppcps exhibited faster photodegradation half life t 1 2 range 0 02 29 h than biodegradation t 1 2 range 4 2310 h fig 1 while we should note that this comparison depends on local physicochemical condition as well in addition typical ppcps such as ibuprofen ibp diclofenac dcf and sulfamethoxazole smx exhibited photodegradation rates of 0 03 h 1 t 1 2 23 h 4 04 h 1 t 1 2 0 17 h and 0 19 h 1 t 1 2 3 73 h respectively in spiked pure water under simulated solar light in contrast ibp exhibited a biodegradation rate of 0 0005 h 1 t 1 2 1386 h in spiked freshwater while dcf and smx exhibited no biodegradation at all for 28 days baena nogueras et al 2017 these studies suggested that photodegradation may play a more important role in many omps transformation processes than biodegradation many omps are toxic to microorganisms ebert et al 2011 larsson et al 2007 le page et al 2017 patel et al 2019 rubasinghege et al 2018 partly because of the intended uses of the omps for example as antimicrobial agents this toxicity poses significant challenges in terms of biodegradability in the environment hence among the potential degradation and transformation processes photodegradation possibly plays a rather important role in deciding the fate of omps in aquatic environments it is also noteworthy that photochemical transformation of omps including photodegradation in some cases may result in photo induced toxicity and generate more persistent products which possibly increases the ecological risk buth et al 2007 latch et al 2003a plumlee et al 2009 robert et al 2017 for instance the photodegradation of fenoxaprop p ethyl forms higher toxic and more persistent products such as 4 6 chloro 2 benzoxazolyl oxy phenol 48 h ec50 of 1 49 1 64 mg l lin et al 2008 simulated solar irradiation can enhance the acute toxicity of fluoroquinolones and anthraquinones to daphnia magna luo et al 2018 wang et al 2009 3 overview of aquatic photodegradation the photodegradation process is active only during daytime when light is abundant and the corresponding rate of photodegradation is highly affected by the light intensity imposed on the omps or photosensitizers in addition the extent of light attenuation increases with the depth of the water column and varies seasonally mathon et al 2019 against this backdrop the influence of natural solar light on the degradation of omps remains largely unknown and has been scarcely studied despite that such information is essential for understanding the attenuation process of omps and elucidating their fate in the environment wang et al 2021b photodegradation processes can be either direct or indirect wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 de la cruz et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 2 direct photolysis occurs when omps directly receive photon energy from an irradiation source and the omp s electrons are excited to a higher energy level this allows the molecule to undergo chemical transformations i e fragmentation intramolecular rearrangement isomerization hydrogen atom abstraction dimerization and electron transfer from to the compound ultimately causing the omp to photodegrade schwarzenbach et al 2002 an omp s capability to undergo direct photolysis depends on two factors the ability of the omp to absorb photon energy as indicated by its molar absorption coefficient and the likelihood of the molecule to undergo a chemical transformation as indicated by its quantum yield ge et al 2009 yao et al 2013 additionally direct photolysis can be influenced by the water matrix via processes such as light screening caused by light absorbing constituents as well as back reduction by dom liu et al 2020 in indirect photodegradation photons are received by photosensitizers to produce ppris which ultimately degrade the target omps therefore the composition of the water matrix in which the target omps occur can have a positive or negative influence on the efficiency of photodegradation lado ribeiro et al 2019 the indirect photodegradation is largely dependent on water matrix components such as no3 no2 and dom because these components can photo generate ppris to degrade the omps ge et al 2009 however the impact of such components can also vary depending on the target omps wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 sun et al 2014 as well as the source of dom sun et al 2014 which will be elaborated in the following section of this review photodegradation studies are usually conducted under well controlled conditions in the laboratory the rates of photodegradation obtained from the laboratory experiments were then extrapolated to different environments providing a great practical significance for the management of chemicals precursors of omps however this strategy poses several challenges because laboratory conditions are often different from those in real water bodies mackay 2001 in recent years a kinetics based and user friendly model called apex aqueous photochemistry of environmentally occurring xenobiotics has been developed to predict the photo transformation kinetics of omps bodrato and vione 2014 vione 2020 zhou et al 2018 have also developed a kinetics based photodegradation rate prediction model taking into account the variations in the intensity of underwater and hourly sunlight these two models are useful in extrapolating photochemical persistence data determined in the laboratory to the real environment although further development is needed to comprehensively study photodegradation in actual water environments the input photochemical parameters of omps in the aforementioned models such as quantum yield of direct photolysis and the second order reaction rate constants are necessary for predicting the photochemical persistence however these parameters are not available for most of omps actually thousands of chemicals have already been synthesized and used and thus have entered the aquatic environment prediction of those photochemical parameters for omps is pertinent to persistence evaluation some pioneering studies employed quantitative structure activity property relationship qsar qspr to predict these parameters including the quantum yield for omps chen et al 2000 2001a 2001b niu et al 2005 shao et al 2010 yang et al 2003 and the photochemical kinetics parameters li et al 2014 luo et al 2017 2019 which provide an opportunity for prediction given the lack of relevant data nevertheless this article cannot cover all the basics of environmental photochemistry and interested readers may refer relevant literature for further details about the basic mechanisms boule 1999 calza and vione 2015 klan and wirz 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2002 4 effects of the water matrix on photodegradation photodegradation of omps can be influenced by the constituents in the water matrix such as ions no3 no2 fe2 fe3 co3 2 hco3 halide ions etc dom and suspended solids ge et al 2010a 2010b 2010c vione et al 2014 likewise coexisting omps can be considered as water matrix components that can also affect photodegradation the water matrix can either accelerate photodegradation or inhibit it in addition the water ph can influence the charge state of dom and the presence of ionized omps in water indicating a dependency of photodegradation upon the ph values of the water boreen et al 2004 ge et al 2010a wei et al 2013 werner et al 2006 for example ciprofloxacin cip has five dissociated species and each of them had dissimilar photolytic kinetics and products wei et al 2013 in the following sections the effects of the water matrix on the photodegradation of omps are further elaborated 4 1 inorganic ions inorganic ions are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and play various roles in the photodegradation of omps the ions can interact with omps thereby altering their photodegradation behaviors for example coordination with transition metals such as cu ii can alter the light absorption characteristic and photo reactivity of omps wei et al 2015 in addition some inorganic ions can produce ppris e g photolysis of no3 no2 can produce ho which can provide additional opportunities for degradation of refractory omps in this section the focus is given mainly to inorganic ions that can produce ppris on the photodegradation of omps no3 no2 are ubiquitous in natural waters and play important roles in the photodegradation of omps because no3 no2 are important sources of ho the no3 no2 are usually more abundant in freshwater than seawater boule 1999 takeda et al 2004 indicating production of ho by photolysis of no3 no2 in freshwater can be more efficient than that in seawater no3 no2 can produce ho through direct photolysis under the action of solar radiation λ 280 nm the main reactions are shown below mack and bolton 1999 wu et al 2020 1 no2 hv no o 2 no3 hv no2 o cage 3 o h ho as shown in eqs 1 3 both no3 and no2 can directly absorb solar radiation and produce o which is a precursor of ho the pka of ho is 11 9 eq 3 suggesting that reaction 3 favors the generation of ho at environmental ph mack and bolton 1999 no2 can be transformed to its conjugated acid hono which is more efficient in producing ho thereby increasing the production of ho with decreasing the ph however this ph effect is obvious only in water with a ph 5 which is not a common ph in surface waters arakaki et al 1999 no3 can photo isomerize into oono and form its conjugated acid hoono with pka 6 5 7 where hoono can produce ho while oono cannot gligorovski et al 2015 mack and bolton 1999 nevertheless this pathway may also be insignificant in the natural environment because the quantum yield for photoproduction of oono under solar radiation is low less than 0 26 at 313 nm irradiation benedict et al 2017 although the concentration of no2 is usually lower than that of no3 in natural waters no2 absorbs solar radiation more effectively and produces ho with a higher quantum yield ф no2 ho 0 025 0 065 depending on wavelength ф no3 ho 0 01 vione et al 2014 overall comparable roles of no3 and no2 in producing ho were commonly reported gligorovski et al 2015 minero et al 2007 takeda et al 2004 fe ion species particularly fe ii fe iii complexes mainly hydroxo and organic complexes can participate in fenton photo fenton reactions to generate ho that causes omps degradation in sunlit aquatic environments the photochemistry of fe has been reviewed previously and two representative equations eqs 4 and 5 concerning ho production are shown below lueder et al 2020 vione et al 2014 the importance of these reactions depends on specific water bodies where the ph is low enough and the concentrations of fe ii fe iii are sufficiently high gligorovski et al 2015 this is because fenton photo fenton reactions are favored under low ph conditions ph 2 3 feng and nansheng 2000 4 feoh2 hv fe2 ho 5 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho photodegradation of omps can be influenced by co3 2 hco3 mainly due to the generation of the carbonate radical ion co3 that reacts with omps in sunlit water bodies co3 is a selective oxidant with e nhe co3 co3 2 1 59 v huie et al 1991 which is lower than that of ho while its steady state concentration is estimated to be two orders of magnitude higher than that of ho sulzberger et al 1997 the reactions between co3 and omps mainly occur via electron transfer or a hydrogen abstraction mechanism liu et al 2018 thus co3 plays an important role in photodegradation of some omps containing electron rich structures such as nitrogen and sulfur containing compounds thiols and aromatic compounds anilines and phenols busset et al 2007 de laurentiis et al 2014 mazellier et al 2007 sun et al 2020 wu and linden 2010 co3 is a secondary radical because as shown in eqs 6 and 7 the co3 is generated through either reaction between co3 2 hco3 and ho or between co3 2 and excited species i e excited triplet state of dom and omps 3dom 3omps yan et al 2019 6 hco3 co3 2 ho co3 h2o ho 7 co3 2 3dom 3omp co3 reaction 6 is highly ph dependent because of the dissociation of carbonic acid to co3 2 and hco3 that occurs at different ph values pka1 6 3 and pka2 10 3 vione et al 2014 the generation of co3 is more strongly favored when ph increases from 6 to 9 circumneutral ph as co3 2 is more reactive than hco3 toward ho k hco3 ho 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 k co3 2 ho 3 9 108 m 1 s 1 and the proportion of co3 2 increases when the ph increases zhou et al 2020 eq 7 is important only under specific conditions waters with high doc canonica et al 2005 and in most cases eq 6 is the dominant reaction for generating co3 in natural water bodies halide ions can react mainly through an oxidation reaction with photochemically produced ho or 3dom to form various halogen radical species x x2 and xy where x and y stand for cl br or i parker and mitch 2016 zhang and parker 2018 zhang et al 2018a 8 ho x hox 9 hox ho x 10 hox h h2o x 11 hox x y ho x2 xy 12 3dom x dom x 13 3dom 2x or x y dom x2 xy compared with x x2 and xy are dominant in halide containing sunlit waters concentrations of all types of x2 are estimated to be three orders of magnitude higher than all x because x especially for cl are abundant which can rapidly react with x to form x2 xy ershov 2004 yang and pignatello 2017 in seawater the steady state concentrations of br and brcl are estimated to be 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than the concentration of ho zhang and parker 2018 these halogen radicals can be quenched by hco3 co3 to form co3 and by dom to form dom radical halogen radicals can react with omps via halogenation cheng et al 2021 and many polyhalogenated omps can be produced these omps can exhibit serious ecological risks lallas 2001 on the other hand halogen radicals can also react with omps through oxidation reactions where halogen atoms are not introduced into the reaction products wang et al 2021a since the reaction between halogen radicals and the omps is a redox reaction the redox potential is pertinent to the reaction the reduction potential of cl e nhe 2 5 v is the highest among all the halogen radicals others range from 1 1 to 2 2 v and is slightly lower than that of ho e nhe 2 7 v indicating that cl has high reactivity toward many omps wardman 1989 halogen radicals can react with saturated aliphatic compounds via hydrogen abstraction olefinic compounds via addition reaction aromatic compounds via addition reaction electron abstraction and organosulfur species adduct formation or sulfur oxidation wang et al 2021a zhang and parker 2018 in addition to the generation of halogen radicals parker et al 2013 have reported that an increase in ionic strength can slow down intra organic matter electron transfer of 3dom resulting in higher steady state concentrations of 3dom 3dom ss elevation of 3dom ss by halide ions has also been observed in further studies as well as the quenching of excited singlet state dom 1dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 higher 3dom ss can promote photodegradation when 3dom is critical to photodegradation chen et al 2019 li et al 2016b suppression of photodegradation by halide ions was also observed for 17β estradiol a phenol and this was attributed to the inhibition of electron transfer pathways between 3dom and 17β estradiol grebel et al 2012 parker et al 2013 further research is needed to clarify the relative importance between the elevation of 3dom ss and inhibition of the electron transfer pathways by halide ions in the photodegradation of omps regarding halide specific effects previous studies have found that cl and br can enhance photobleaching of dom grebel et al 2009 grebel et al 2012 thereby decreasing the sensitizing ability of dom and inhibiting photodegradation halide ions like br may also exhibit a heavy atom effect on photodegradation which can promote intersystem crossing from the excited singlet state to the excited triplet state and influence the photodegradation as a consequence koziar and cowan 1977 li et al 2016a 4 2 dissolved organic matter dom is ubiquitous in environmental water bodies and it can widely absorb solar radiation up to 500 nm nebbioso and piccolo 2013 after absorbing light dom can produce various ppris such as 1dom aqueous electron e aq superoxide o2 h2o2 3dom 1o2 and ho which contribute to photodegradation fig 3 dom can also inhibit photodegradation for example by competing for light with omps and quenching ppris generated during photodegradation 4 2 1 promotion effects carbonyl structures and aromatic compounds are the main chromophores of dom these chromophores absorb solar radiation and first produce 1dom with a short lifetime and low steady state concentration in environmental waters boyle et al 2009 1dom has high reactivity and has been shown to play a pivotal role in the formation of some ppris such as e aq and charge transfer state dom dom the excited singlet state aromatic groups mainly phenol and its derivatives such as aromatic carboxylic acids köhler et al 1985 and aromatic amino acids mossoba et al 1982 in 1dom can eject e aq the e aq generated plays an insignificant role in omps attenuation in environmental waters because it is produced only inside the dom microenvironment and mostly recombines with cations before escaping into the bulk solution zepp et al 1987 only hydrophobic omps with a very high octanol water partition coefficient k ow such as mirex k ow 106 29 burns et al 1996 1997 can bind with dom so that e aq can react to them 1dom can also produce dom through direct intramolecular electron transfer mckay et al 2016 sharpless and blough 2014 these dom states are formed as a result of the transfer of an electron either partially or completely from an electron rich donor e g hydroxy or alkoxy benzenes to an electron poor acceptor e g carbonyl containing moieties like aromatic ketones and quinones mckay et al 2016 to date dom is widely regarded as the major ppri responsible for the production of o2 ma et al 2020 zhang et al 2012 electron rich phenolic moieties are precursors of dom which further verified that dom is the precursor of o2 o2 often acts as a weak oxidant with e nhe o2 h2o2 0 91 v playing an important role in the redox speciation of dissolved metals in natural water bodies ma et al 2020 catalyzed or uncatalyzed disproportionation of o2 can produce h2o2 cooper and lean 1989 petasne and zika 1987 scully et al 1996 which is an important ppri because it can further generate ho through fenton reactions southworth and voelker 2003 although only about 12 35 of o2 is transformed to h2o2 via dismutation le roux et al 2021 where another portion of o2 undergoes photoinduced loss possibly by reacting with dom ma et al 2020 o2 is still considered the most important ppri for producing h2o2 aromatic carbonyl and quinone groups in 1dom about 4 8 can be transformed to 3dom through intersystem crossing mckay 2020 although 3dom is less reactive than 1dom 3dom has a longer lifetime and higher steady state concentration 10 14 to 10 12 m thereby making it an important ppri in environmental waters mcneill and canonica 2016 3dom can directly react with omps via oxidation e g electron transfer proton coupled electron transfer or other related mechanisms or energy transfer mcneill and canonica 2016 and is also the precursor of 1o2 and ho mainly ho like species 3dom tends to react with aromatic anilines and electron rich phenols via an oxidation mechanism it mainly acts as an oxidant and thus should have a higher reduction potential than the target compound plenty of examples of oxidation with 3dom were summarized by mcneill and canonica 2016 for energy transfer reactions with 3dom a prerequisite is that the compound should have lower excited triplet energy e t than that of 3dom the reaction between o2 and 3dom that forms 1o2 is a typical energy transfer reaction it requires only 94 kj mol 1 zepp et al 1977 1o2 occurs in sunlit dom solutions with steady state concentrations ranging from 10 12 to 10 15 m which is in the same range as 3dom mcneill and canonica 2016 peterson et al 2012 1o2 is a selective oxidant and can react rapidly with only certain omps such as phenolates and furans ossola et al 2019 as well as indoles imidazoles and some easily oxidized amino acids boreen et al 2008 latch et al 2003b it is notable that the distributions of 1o2 exhibit a microheterogeneity because the species is produced in a microenvironment of dom and sometimes it reaches higher steady state concentration in the hydrophobic sites of dom compared with that in the bulk solution grandbois et al 2008 latch and mcneill 2006 therefore hydrophobic omps that can bind to dom are possibly susceptible to reaction with 1o2 in addition to 1o2 it is often reported that only compounds containing dienes can react with 3dom through energy transfer via compounds such as sorbic acid grebel et al 2011 isoprene and sorbic alcohol zhou et al 2019a and the corresponding products are their cis trans isomers since dienes structures rarely occur in omps oxidation of omps by 3dom is more common than energy transfer li et al 2015 2016a 3dom are mixtures of different excited triplet state species which means the e t is distribution rather than a definite value zepp et al 1985 employed diene probes and demonstrated that about 37 of 3dom had high e t 250 kj mol 1 labeled as high energy 3dom hi 3dom the remainder was labeled as low energy 3dom 94 kj mol 1 e t 250 kj mol 1 recently zhou et al 2019a used sorbic alcohol e t 250 kj mol 1 as a hi 3dom probe and found that the average proportion of hi 3dom in 15 different types of dom was 33 close to the 37 reported previously zepp et al 1985 further work by wang et al 2020a confirmed the high reactivity of hi 3dom in the photodegradation of omps using 11 different types of doms notably the proportion of hi 3dom depended on the source of dom with the proportion being higher in autochthonous freshwater dom than allochthonous freshwater dom zhou et al 2019a a more recent study indicated that about 58 of the hi 3dom generated from leaf litter soil stream water and lake water samples can react with 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp a widely used electron transfer probe verifying that hi 3dom is possibly important in oxidation of omps wasswa et al 2022 they also reported the precursors of hi 3dom were photo resistant and bio refractory meaning that hi 3dom may be more important in reaction with omps and generating 1o2 even after undergoing environmental processes like photobleaching and biodegradation furthermore guo et al 2021 found that maricultural seawater dom s dom can generate more hi 3dom than s dom with less influence of mariculture contributing to the high reactivity of 3dom this is the first time to quantify hi 3dom in s dom given that s dom is different from freshwater dom in many aspects detailed in section 4 2 3 however further study is needed to clarify whether hi 3dom plays an important role in the overall photodegradation of omps in the natural environment as has been assumed 3dom is a precursor of ho which is a highly reactive radical that reacts with omps at a near diffusion controlled rate ho production by dom also exhibits microheterogeneity similar to that of 1o2 where more ho is possibly produced inside the hydrophobic core of dom yan et al 2021 hence hydrophobic omps that can enter the dom microenvironment are possibly specifically susceptible to photodegradation however in sunlit surface waters the steady state concentration of ho 10 16 10 18 m is much lower than that of 3dom or 1o2 even though direct photolysis of nitrite nitrate or photo fenton reactions can elevate the steady state concentration of ho mack and bolton 1999 white et al 2003 zepp et al 1992 regarding the production of ho there is still a dispute as to whether ho is produced by 3dom or other precursors like dom in dom solutions exposed to sunlight mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 in addition to free ho the generation of ho like species has also been reported including lower energy hydroxylation intermediates that react with omps at a slightly lower rate than free ho reacts with them and quinones are regarded as the precursors of these species gan et al 2008 liu et al 2019 page et al 2011 although studies usually do not distinguish between them in measurement the presence of ho like species can be confirmed by using methane which selectively quenches ho rather than ho like species page et al 2011 two pathways were proposed for the production of ho namely h2o2 dependent and h2o2 independent pathways mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 the percentage for the h2o2 dependent pathway varied among the dom samples page et al 2011 in the h2o2 independent pathway it has been observed that the steady state concentrations of 3dom and 1o2 increased while the quantum yield of ho decreased after quenching of 1dom glover and rosario ortiz 2013 implying that ho and 1o2 do not share the same precursor 3dom and that 1dom may contribute to ho production sun et al 2015 found that direct photolysis of substituted phenols specifically carboxylate substituted phenols may be an important source of ho in dom two feasible pathways were proposed 1 the carboxylate substituted phenol generates an e aq and a phenol cation radical then the phenol cation radical either undergoes deprotonation and forms ho or 2 is transformed to a dihydroxycyclohexadienyl radical intermediate that finally eliminates ho however the importance of this mechanism is not clear because good correlation has not been observed between the quantum yield for ho production and the dom electron donating capacity edc which is mainly due to polyphenol moieties in dom mckay et al 2017 this lack of good correlation could be due to the small experimental database the heterogeneity in producing ho from different substituted phenols sun et al 2015 and the fact that some polyphenolic ho precursors are formed only after dom is irradiated berto et al 2016 thus further studies are needed to clarify the production mechanism of ho in dom solutions and in particular the correlation between the quantum yield for ho production and edc should be investigated using irradiated dom 4 2 2 inhibition effects of dom light screening and quenching are the two main inhibition effects of dom on the photodegradation of omps canonica and laubscher 2008 chin et al 2004 the light screening effect is based on the fact that dom competes for light with the omps resulting in inhibition of the direct photolysis the light screening effect is unavoidable for most omps because direct photolysis is induced mainly by short wavelength light which overlaps the absorption spectra of dom under solar radiation in addition to omps dom also screens and weakens radiation for other photosensitizers such as no3 no2 inhibiting their photolysis that yields ho vione et al 2014 phenolic moieties are mainly responsible for the quenching effects in dom solutions these electron rich compounds can transfer an electron to 3dom thereby consuming 3dom but this inhibition effect is not predominant in sunlit natural water bodies canonica et al 2000 a recent study reported that quenching of hi 3dom is more apparent than that of low energy 3dom owing to the higher redox potential of hi 3dom zhou et al 2019a on the other hand the phenolic moieties can reduce the reactive intermediates generated from the oxidation reaction between 3dom and omps for example oxidation of aromatic anilines by 3dom forms a cation radical aromatic aniline after the loss of an electron electron rich phenolic moieties can transfer an electron to the cation radical reducing it back to its parent compound thus inhibiting the reaction wenk and canonica 2012 previous studies have reported that the content of phenolic moieties in autochthonous dom is lower than that in allochthonous dom guo et al 2021 zhou et al 2019a and thus the quenching effects is less obvious in autochthonous dom bahnmüller et al 2014 wang et al 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 additionally canonica and laubscher 2008 reported that the quenching effects were observed in the photodegradation of omps containing phenols anilines and the like and that the inhibition efficiencies were different for different compounds photobleaching of dom can be considered as an indirect inhibition effect of dom after photobleaching of dom its photo reactivity is decreased helms et al 2009 2014 moran et al 2000 niu et al 2014 in photobleaching the chromophores are photochemically destroyed either through direct destruction of the dom molecules by light or reactions between dom and ppris after photobleaching of dom the rate of photodegradation of omps in the same solutions could decrease the photodegradation rate of omps decreased as the length of irradiation time increased and the decrease was highly dependent on the characteristics of both the dom and omps niu et al 2014 using solid state 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy helms et al 2014 found that aromatic carbon was preferentially removed while carbohydrate like and amide peptide like carbons remained after photobleaching for up to 110 days 4 2 3 seawater dom vs freshwater dom although seawater covers 71 of the earth s surface and acts as an important sink of omps less attention has been paid to the effects of s dom on the photodegradation of omps compared with freshwater dom this is due to the difficulty of extracting s dom from seawater that typically has high salinity and relatively low dom content s dom is mainly autochthonous dom derived from cellular excretions of marine phytoplankton and bacteria s dom normally undergoes photobleaching for a long time and can be influenced by anthropogenic sources such as mariculture in coastal regions hence the effects of s dom on the photodegradation of omps can differ from those of freshwater dom reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis ro ed technology is normally used to extract s dom due to its high recovery efficiency zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2018 extracted s dom by ro ed and found that s dom influenced by mariculture activities exhibited higher photo reactivity higher ppris production quantum yield light absorption rate and 3dom reactivity than s dom extracted from more pristine seawater wang et al 2019 also found that compared with reference freshwater dom suwannee river fulvic acid and suwannee river natural organic matter srnom s dom undergoes more photobleaching in which a lower content of c c and c o functional groups is observed however compared with freshwater dom s dom enhanced the photodegradation of both 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone and nebivolol to a greater extent which was attributed to the higher reactivity of 3dom with the omps and fewer antioxidants in the s dom wang et al 2020b 2019 further work by guo et al 2021 indicated that hi 3dom is not responsible for the higher reactivity of 3dom from s dom than that from freshwater dom in contrast a lower content of phenolic moieties that lessened inhibition explained the higher reactivity of 3dom from s dom however the s dom was extracted only from coastal areas in the bohai sea and further studies concerning the photochemistry of s dom from other regions are needed 4 3 suspended solids and coexisting pollutants suspended solids such as sand clay particulate organic matter and phytoplankton are also ubiquitous in surface waters these components can influence the underwater light environment adsorb omps and affect photosensitizing processes kirk 1985 lund hansen 2004 rose et al 2014 shang et al 2015 possibly altering the photodegradation of omps for example suspended solids can inhibit the photodegradation of sulfamethoxazole and the inhibition effects become stronger with increasing concentration of the suspended sediments niu et al 2013 the inhibition effect was mainly due to the suppression of ho generation while adsorption of sulfamethoxazole on solids played an insignificant role thirumavalavan et al 2012 attributed the effect of suspended solids to turbidity and light attenuation and their study showed that the photodegradation of microcystin lr was impeded when the turbidity increased notably a variety of omps rather than a single one may coexist in the same water body and thus the photodegradation of an omp can be influenced by the coexisting omps generally the coexisting omps can have multifarious effects on the photodegradation processes jentzsch et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b depending on the intended functions of the coexisting omps for example uv absorbers used in polymers are designed to absorb photon energy and then to release the excitation energy in the form of heat so they can compete for photons with the target omp during photodegradation primary antioxidants are capable of reacting with ppris thus preventing further propagation of oxidation reactions the antioxidants can also consume the generated ppris and prevent further reactions with the target omp hunt 2000 in addition recent studies have reported that trace amounts of co existing omps can also increase the photodegradation of other omps in waters jentzsch et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b zhou et al 2019b for example bezafibrate bzf displayed faster photodegradation in the presence of fenofibrate acid fnfa in ultrapure water wastewater treatment plant effluent water and the receiving river water despite the usual resistance of bzf to degradation the promotional effect of fnfa was due to its ability to generate 1o2 and e aq further tests conducted with srnom 5 0 and 10 0 mg l and bzf 5 0 mg l in the presence and absence of fnfa 1 0 mg l revealed that the presence of fnfa induced much faster photodegradation of bzf than the presence of srnom zhou et al 2019b hence the influence of co existing omps on each other s degradation can be important in surface waters despite their lower concentration compared with dom however the influences of co exposure of the omps on mutual photodegradation has hardly been studied in water environments given the increased detection of diverse omps in surface waters further investigations are necessary to elucidate the influence of co existing omps on their mutual persistence in environmental waters 5 major physical factors for photodegradation of omps photodegradation is also influenced by physical environmental factors such as the depth of water latitude temporal variation diurnal and seasonal and temperature koumaki et al 2015 mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 zepp and cline 1977 those physical effects have received less attention than the water matrix because the physical effects are caused by variation of the light intensity and the wavelength profile apart from the diversity of photochemical reactions however changes in physical factors cannot be ignored when aiming to understand the photochemical reactions and the overall fate of omps for example thermal lake stratification can determine the vertical distribution of omp concentrations as a result of the vertical mixing process and photolysis in the surface layer rehrl et al 2020 assuming the same wavelength profile the rate of photodegradation would be proportional to the photon influx in fact most studies involving in situ photodegradation experiments performed at different locations and different times i e different latitudes and seasons might be more readily comparable if the effects of physical factors on light conditions are better understood 5 1 latitude sunshine duration and cloud conditions vary depending on latitude this would obviously influence the availability of underwater light and thus light absorption by photosensitizers or omps annual irradiance measured over the period 1951 1960 shows a substantial change with latitude fig 4 landsberg 1961 lewis 1987 the total annual irradiance on the earth s surface is maximal at the equator theoretically the tropical latitudes 0 to 25 should have the highest annual irradiance fig 4 theoretical earth surface because the sun shines almost directly over these areas however the subtropical latitudes 25 to 40 were observed to have the highest annual irradiance fig 4 land masses this is because cloud conditions can influence the amount of solar radiation that reaches the earth s surface clouds can decrease the solar flux by up to 70 of the initial solar radiation that is transmitted through the atmosphere to the surface janjai et al 2011 the effect of cloud cover on decreasing light transmission has been estimated to be between 31 for uvb radiation and 72 for photosynthetically active radiation par musiolková et al 2021 in addition the uneven distribution of moisture causes the transmissivity of the atmosphere to be unusually high over the subtropical land masses thus more light can reach the earth s surface at subtropical latitudes than in tropical regions lewis 1987 given a constant attenuation coefficient daily irradiance at latitudes between 10 n and 5 s shows peaks twice a year in march and september lewis 1987 the annual minimum daily irradiance for a constant attenuation coefficient near the equator would be approximately 85 of the annual maximum daily irradiance the range of minima on the tropical latitudes is significantly higher and the minimum daily irradiance at 30 latitude is approximately 50 of the minimum at the equator fig 4 the relative importance of shorter wavelengths also varies depending on the latitude which possibly affects the absorption spectra and the rate of photodegradation of omps schmitt et al 2021 due to the tilt of the earth s axis of rotation solar energy is received at a low angle at high latitudes hence the distribution of net energy per unit area is much less than that in the tropics also higher latitudes above 50 often have the shortest sunshine duration annually and have more cloudy and rainy weather at latitudes higher than 66 7 the polar region no direct energy is received at all from the sun for at least part of the year roots 1989 therefore the degradation rate and the half life times that are determined experimentally need to be corrected to estimate the actual degradation rate in the different regions furthermore the attenuation of light by clouds has uncertainties with respect to the climatic reduction of light intensity at various geographical locations indirect relationships of latitude with the water matrix and photochemistry can be identified based on the environmental conditions of the surface water for instance lakes located in high latitude regions may be covered with ice for much of the year so sunlight can barely reach the underlying water unless the ice melts the photochemical process may likely cease to exist due to the efficient attenuation of light sommaruga 2001 moreover several water bodies in high latitude nordic countries experience noticeable browning a gradual increase in dom concentration weyhenmeyer et al 2016 such browning could affect photoreactions by enhancing processes that are triggered by 3dom and 1o2 over those induced by ho co3 and direct photolysis calderaro and vione 2020 in addition to shifting the photodegradation pathways toward 3dom the increase in dom could also lower the photodegradation rate constants and increase the photochemical persistence of omps vione and scozzaro 2019 recent studies have updated the solar irradiance spectra between 70 s and 70 n at different times of the year and these were validated against high resolution spectroradiometer measurements apell and mcneill 2019 simulations of ppri production using the updated solar irradiance spectra show that the spectrum of sunlight plays a role that is as important as the role of light intensity in determining ppri production furthermore the dependence of ppri production on the solar irradiance spectra has recently been evaluated by designing reactors equipped with monochromatic led lights for the experiments the result show that the quantum yields of ris decreased with an increasing wavelength from 375 to 490 nm and notably decreased to zero above 490 nm wu et al 2021 5 2 seasonal and diurnal cycles the solar irradiance varies daily and seasonally due to the rotation and revolution of the earth and the temporal variation of sunlight affects the photodegradation of omps in terms of daily variation the photochemical persistence of omps can be prolonged for omps with photodegradation t 1 2 being over days because no photodegradation occurs at nighttime for example recent studies indicated that the photodegradation t 1 2 of omps can be significantly underestimated if the variation of the intensity of sunlight with the time of day is not considered zhou et al 2018 chen et al 2019 guo et al 2021 on the other hand the variations i e seasonal and diurnal of the water matrix such as ph no2 no3 and dom together with the irradiance of sunlight affected the photochemical processes including the overall kinetics of the omp photo transformations vione et al 2018 compared with freshwater and estuarine systems the attenuation of sunlight in seawater is generally the weakest zhou et al 2018 and thus such differences will also highly likely affect the photochemical rates and processes as a whole the diurnal solar light variations in nigeria tropic soneye et al 2019 and northeast china mid latitude zhou et al 2018 are presented in fig 5 a and 5b respectively the solar intensity increases from 7 am reaching a maximum at around noon and decreases to 0 wm 2 at around 6 pm the variation in the intensity of solar light suggested that the photodegradation rate of omps should likewise show a variation although photodegradation studies usually simulate a solar intensity at noon which could largely overestimate the degradation rate of the omps in addition as shown in fig 5a variation of the diurnal pattern of light intensity over the seasons can also be observed such differences in light intensity are caused by the attenuation of light by aerosol particles in the dry season and increased cloudiness and humidity in the wet season stratification is also a seasonal phenomenon that commonly occurs in lakes and reservoirs which also influences the photochemical processes in waters for example lake water typically undergoes stratification in summer in temperate climates the epilimnion is the surface layer of water and thus receives more illumination meaning that photodegradation processes will be more active there in contrast the hypolimnion is poorly illuminated due to light screening by the overlying water column so photochemical processes are limited or negligible vione 2020 the epilimnion and hypolimnion evolve differently and thus a depth profile gradient is generated with respect to the concentration of photodegradable omps avetta et al 2016 if the omp is completely photodegraded in the epilimnion the stratification phase considerably slows down the overall degradation kinetics vione and scozzaro 2019 a recent study investigated the photodegradation of 23 omps in the free water surface constructed wetland during the summer and winter in southern france 43 85 n for the 23 omps studied direct photolysis was the predominant process in summer while indirect photodegradation was more significant in winter although the light intensity was higher in summer the no3 concentration was higher in winter enhancing the formation of ho that promoted the wintertime indirect photodegradation mathon et al 2019 in addition a 7 year survey in a stream in the usa observed seasonal variation of no3 in which no3 concentrations were high during summer while low from mid autumn to late spring the low no3 concentrations were attributable to the maximum availability of sunlight irradiance in late spring and the seasonal input of leaves to the stream in autumn mulholland and hill 1997 another study conducted in the guadiana river spain has also shown that photodegradation is more important in summer than in winter vione et al 2018 in the months with the highest clear sky sunlight irradiance i e june and july the river water showed low no3 concentrations and high dom levels this phenomenon may be quite typical of the surface water bodies as the minima for no3 and the maxima for doc concentrations occur frequently in summer in several surface water environments vione et al 2018 5 3 water depth underwater light intensity is generally attenuated with increasing water depth due to various components in the water column such as phytoplankton particles dom ions and water itself h2o absorbs mainly red light around 700 nm which is one of the reasons for the color of the sea hale and querry 1973 sunlight attenuation underwater alters the availability of light and affects the photochemical reactions of omps and photosensitizers zhou et al 2018 light absorption and scattering are the main causes of light attenuation in the water bodies kirk 1977 in general the intensity of light decreases exponentially with depth as described by eq 14 14 i z i 0e ez where i z and i 0 are the intensities of light wm 2 or quanta m 2s 1 at depth z m and just below the surface respectively and e is the vertical attenuation coefficient m 1 for downward irradiance scheffer 2004 which is affected by water matrix components such as dom and inorganic ions the depth of this photic environment varies depending on the water matrix and the wavelength of light avetta et al 2016 boreen et al 2003 vione and scozzaro 2019 the depth of light penetration generally refers to the depth at which the light has been attenuated by 99 zepp and cline 1977 turbid lakes and estuaries show a light penetration depth of 0 3 m while the clearest oceans have a penetration depth up to 150 m gons et al 1997 in terms of wavelength the depth of light penetration in freshwater is low for uv blue and red light whereas green and yellow transmit to deeper water levine and macnichol 1982 moreover the wavelength profile of the irradiation shifts vertically in water depending on the water matrix minero et al 2007 the absorption effects of dom change depending on the wavelength profile especially for light with wavelengths below 500 nm therefore the penetration depth for sunlight is greater in waters containing lower concentrations of dom and the corresponding rates of photo transformation may be larger bracchini et al 2007 in addition the enhancement of photoreactions in shallow water is more conspicuous for processes triggered by uv absorbing species such as no3 no2 vione and scozzaro 2019 previous studies concluded that uv light is attenuated by water within tens of centimeters of depth in lakes with a high dom concentration and turbidity in both cases the photochemical reactions are significantly affected by the light attenuation huovinen et al 2003 leavitt et al 1997 markager and vincent 2000 it has also been reported that the steady state concentration of 1o2 in lake waters decreased by a factor of 8 8 when the depth increased from 0 m to 20 m indicating that depth is an important factor in determining indirect photochemical processes partanen et al 2021 another study employing the apex model demonstrated that the photochemical half lives t 1 2 of three omps ibuprofen carbamazepine and diclofenac are almost linearly correlated with depth vione et al 2018 in addition to the variation of light attenuation with depth photochemical reactions in the surface layer z 0 m differ from those in bulk water because the surface layer air water creates a unique environment that can promote unique chemical reactions george et al 2015 kappes et al 2021 for example interfaces covered with fatty acids are ubiquitous in the environment and fatty acids are believed to be photochemically inert in the actinic region however direct photolysis of fatty acids has been shown to occur and complex volatile organic compounds are generated at an air water interface coated solely with a monolayer of carboxylic acid rossignol et al 2016 likewise photochemical reactions may also occur at the water sediment interface in water bodies where the light is not completely attenuated at the bottom of the water column these photochemical water sediment interface reactions might determine the fate of many hydrophobic omps because sorption by sediments is an important removal pathway for omps golovko et al 2020 koba et al 2018 nevertheless the photochemical reactions at interfaces have receive relatively little attention and further studies are needed 5 4 temperature in general the temperature is higher in summer than in winter and decreases with increasing water depth and latitude several photodegradation studies have highlighted the impact of temperature on the photodegradation process for instance mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 studied the effect of temperature on ho formation using five different types of dom isolates at four or five different temperatures within the range of 10 40 c the apparent activation energies ea for ho formation from the doms kj mol 1 were obtained using the arrhenius equation eq 15 15 ln ф a e a rt ln a where ф a is the apparent quantum yield of ho through dom photolysis r is the universal gas constant kj k 1 mol 1 t is the absolute temperature k and a is the pre exponential factor plots of ln ф a vs 1 t revealed significant slopes indicating the temperature dependency of ho formation through photolysis of the dom isolates in addition the photolysis of p benzoquinone was studied by applying the arrhenius equation to the production of phenol through p benzoquinone photolysis and the loss of p benzoquinone it was revealed that ф a of formation of phenol through p benzoquinone photolysis was temperature independent while ф a of p benzoquinone loss was temperature independent when the temperature was over 23 c and temperature dependent when the temperature was less than 23 c mckay and rosario ortiz 2015 zhu and kieber 2018 studied the photolysis of acetaldehyde glyoxal and methylglyoxal in north pacific seawater under simulated solar radiation and revealed the apparent quantum yield of acetaldehyde was temperature independent while those for glyoxal and methylglyoxal were temperature dependent kieber et al 2014 determined the impact of temperature on the apparent quantum yield for photochemically producing h2o2 in seawater samples collected from stations located in antarctica the pacific ocean the gulf of mexico and the several other sites located on the east coast of the united states their experimental results revealed that the apparent quantum yields for h2o2 production increased within the temperature range of 0 35 c with an average factor of 1 8 every 10 c the study indicated that the decrease of temperature and irradiation toward the polar region was mainly responsible for the decrease in h2o2 production in the seawater as indicated above the temperature effects on the photochemical transformations in the aquatic environment are significant although the level of influence varies depending on the omps or the process of concern therefore it is necessary to acknowledge temperature as an important physical factor influencing photochemical reactions in water 6 major knowledge gaps and challenges the dom photochemistry is complex and has not been comprehensively explored further investigations are needed with a specific focus on topics such as the production mechanisms of ho the role of hi 3dom in photodegradation and the photo reactivity of less studied dom e g s dom further research efforts are needed to develop prediction models for parameters necessary to describe the kinetics of omp photodegradation quantum yield second order rate constant etc thus the model applicability can be improved in terms of domain and prediction accuracy at present it is impossible to exhaustively determine the kinetics parameters of all omps experimentally given the recent development of computing performance and new calculating methods research is encouraged to apply computational calculations e g quantum chemical calculation molecular dynamics simulation and machine learning to aquatic photochemical study as they can provide insights at a molecular level lereche et al 2021 vialykh et al 2020 westermayr and marquetand 2021 xia et al 2022 modeling of photodegradation rates of omps in water bodies is required for their comprehensive understanding which possibly supports sustainable application and discharge of organic chemicals in environment although the current models such as apex is kinetics based and practical there is scope for further development such as inclusion of the reactivity of actual 3dom quantum yields for the formation of ppris in different water matrix and reactions involving halogen radicals photochemical and biological processes have close linkages in aquatic environment in terms of degradation and toxicity of omps and thus the comprehensive experimental studies elucidating actual environmental processes should also receive attention photodegradation has been shown to enhance the toxicity of omps in some cases so researchers must also pay attention to degradation pathways and the potential toxicity of byproducts vione and carena 2020 computational toxicology can be of great help in assessing the ecotoxicity of products as standard chemicals are not always available the available photochemistry studies are biased toward temperate and subarctic regions and thus more attention should be paid to tropical regions where the incident solar radiation is more intense and many developing countries may have to deal with serious pollution caused by omps a standard protocol for indirect photodegradation studies is needed to provide meaningful data to allow comparative research and ecological risk assessment recommendations for the determination of 1o2 quantum yield is one such example ossola et al 2021 in general the increasing diversity of omps in water bodies is responsible for multifarious photodegradation which poses challenges both in environmental science and environmental management for maintaining sustainable aquatic ecosystems 7 conclusions chemical pollution by omps has become a serious environmental issue and thus understanding the fate of omps is essential for ecological risk assessment this review highlighted photodegradation as a major removal process of many omps in the aquatic environment its significance and processes depend on both physical and chemical conditions which are pertinent to the persistence of omps physical condition basically determines overall energy input for photochemical reactions while water matrix i e inorganic ions dom suspended solids and coexisting pollutants determines reaction pathways and rates in both direct and indirect photolysis in particular s dom exhibits high photochemical reactivity on photodegradation of major types of omps such as sulfa drugs given that seawater is an important sink of omps photochemical studies regarding s dom extracted from seawater should be supplemented for comprehensively understanding of the fate of omps in seawater in addition to such experimental studies to elucidate each pathway this review also pointed out the importance of integrating different approaches such as modeling based on theoretical and empirical equations and comprehensive experiment combining photochemical and biological processes those challenges support the design and implementation of reasonable and practical methods for the management of omps in aquatic environment in this sense we hope this review will stimulate further investigation of photodegradation processes and the fate of omps declaration of

15073,plastic pollution in water bodies is an unresolved environmental issue that damages all aquatic environments and causes economic and health problems accurate detection of macroplastic litter plastic items 5 mm in water is essential to estimate the quantities compositions and sources identify emerging trends and design preventive measures or mitigation strategies in recent years researchers have demonstrated the potential of computer vision cv techniques based on deep learning dl for automated detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies however a systematic review to describe the state of the art of the field is lacking here we provide such a review and we highlight current knowledge gaps and suggest promising future research directions the review compares 34 papers with respect to their application and modeling related criteria the results show that the researchers have employed a variety of dl architectures implementing different cv techniques to detect macroplastic litter in various aquatic environments however key knowledge gaps must be addressed to overcome the lack of i dl based macroplastic litter detection models with sufficient generalization capability ii dl based quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots and iii scalable macroplastic litter monitoring strategies based on robust dl based quantification we advocate for the exploration of data centric artificial intelligence approaches and semi supervised learning to develop models with improved generalization capabilities these models can boost the development of new methods for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots and allow for structural monitoring strategies that leverage robust dl based quantification while the identified gaps concern

growing concern with the potential to cause environmental and economic damage and possible effects on human health gonzález fernández et al 2021 lebreton et al 2018 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 estimated global emissions of plastic waste to aquatic ecosystems range from 19 to 23 million metric tons in 2016 bellou et al 2021 borrelle et al 2020 jambeck et al 2015 rivers are the main source of marine plastic pollution with estimated riverine plastic emissions of 0 8 to 2 7 million metric tons into oceans each year lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 furthermore marine plastic litter may wash up on beaches and shores and substantial amounts of discarded plastic litter has also been detected in lakes imhof et al 2018 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 detecting and quantifying macroplastic litter plastic items 5 mm is necessary to assess water pollution levels and develop monitoring strategies for designing effective preventive measures conducting targeted cleaning campaigns and devising mitigation interventions van emmerik et al 2022b common detection methods include in situ methodologies such as sampling and visual observations grøsvik et al 2018 hardesty et al 2017 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 more recently methods based on computer vision cv have been proposed to replace these accurate but time consuming and labor intensive in situ methodologies with automatic detection from images kylili et al 2020 2019 van lieshout et al 2020 in particular researchers focused on deep learning dl methods a subset of flexible machine learning ml techniques reaching state of the art performances in many fields of science and technology including water resources management and engineering sit et al 2020 dl belongs to the family of representation learning techniques that replace manual feature engineering via automatic discovery of the representations needed for feature detection from raw data lecun et al 2015 this allows dl models to reach state of the art performances in all the generic computer vision cv tasks related to aquatic macroplastic litter detection such as image classification ic object detection od and image segmentation is chai et al 2021 while preliminary results are promising this specific field is still in its infancy van emmerik and schwarz 2020 the researchers must increase their efforts to devise dl based applications that can help tackling plastic pollution in water bodies at scale to help build the road ahead this paper presents a critical review outlining the state of the art of dl based detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies the main purposes of this review are 1 to improve researchers understanding of dl based macroplastic litter detection by conducting a thorough assessment of the current state of the field 2 to identify key knowledge gaps and 3 to provide future research directions concerning promising methodologies and novel applications to address these gaps the paper is structured as follows the methodology used to select and analyze the reviewed papers is described in section 2 section 3 thoroughly reviews the selected papers with critical discussion points section 4 identifies a series of knowledge gaps linked to suggested future research directions finally section 5 provides conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 search methodology in this review we analyzed 34 peer reviewed journal papers and conference proceedings retrieved from the scopus and web of science databases we employed the following steps to identify these papers firstly we searched for papers published until the end of 2021 by employing three sets of keywords 1 deep learning related keywords included deep learning neural network artificial intelligence and machine learning 2 macroplastic litter related keywords included plastic trash litter debris and garbage 3 water bodies keywords included marine sea ocean beach shore river channel canal waterway and lake the literature search identified papers containing combinations of these terms in their titles keywords and abstract after reviewing the abstracts of all papers matching the inclusion criteria we selected 33 papers with the first publication dating back to 2016 valdenegro toro 2016 finally we conducted a snowball search by checking the citations of these publications the procedure yielded a total of 34 papers which are listed in table 1 along with the most important details these papers are ordered by the type of water bodies and then by publication year within type in table 1 if the study features different cv tasks the review considers each of these tasks separately when multiple architectures are tested we report only the architecture achieving the highest performances which is listed in the model architecture column of table 1 2 2 review methodology fig 1 shows the most relevant factors used to classify and analyze the selected 34 papers the factors are i the water body ies polluted by macroplastic litter reviewed and discussed

macroplastic litter including the type of cv task s and model architecture s for each cv task section 3 3 iv whether the authors resorted to data augmentation da and transfer learning tl techniques to improve model performances section 3 4 v the generalization capability of macroplastic litter detection models section 3 5 and vi details on the metric s used for performance evaluation section 3 6 3 review and discussion 3 1 water bodies polluted by macroplastic litter fig 2 shows the distribution of water bodies and dataset sources in the reviewed literature some papers are counted multiple times since they either consider multiple water bodies jakovljevic et al 2020 kylili et al 2020 panwar et al 2020 watanabe et al 2019 wolf et al 2020 or employ multiple dataset sources hegde et al 2021 watanabe et al 2019 wu et al 2020 most studies dealt with macroplastic pollution in real settings with the exception of two studies that considered a controlled artificial environment ae valdenegro toro 2016a and wu et al 2020 collected data in a water tank for model training and test which is time saving and cost effective however they did not investigate the generalization capability of dl models from studies in ae to field case studies field applications are different from studies in ae because it is generally difficult to replicate the wide variety of litter and environmental conditions e g natural lighting witnessed in real settings valdenegro toro 2016 we encourage further studies to test the performance of dl models trained with ae data when applied to real scenarios to assess the overall suitability of this approach and to allow future benchmarking of different methods we categorized the bodies of water examined in the reviewed papers into i beaches and shores ii marine underwater iii marine surface iv rivers including natural rivers waterways urban channels and their banks and v lakes most of the studies 18 out of 34 papers focused on macroplastic pollution in marine environments including marine underwater 11 papers marine surface 7 papers and beaches and shores 12 papers fewer studies were concerned with river pollution 6 papers and only one study dealt with macroplastic litter in lakes this is somewhat expected since contrary to the consolidated body of knowledge for macroplastic pollution in marine environments the first scientific studies on the quantification of riverine macroplastic litter date only to the early 2010s blettler et al 2018 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 the first studies concerning lakes are even more recent imhof et al 2018 3 2 dataset on macroplastic litter 3 2 1 employed dataset sources researchers collected input data using imaging devices such as standard digital cameras underwater cameras cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs or manned aircrafts cameras mounted on phones as well as satellite cameras and sonar technologies as shown in fig 2 camera images 12 out of 34 papers underwater camera images 11 papers and airborne imagery 8 papers are the three most popular dataset sources while 4 studies have used phone images and only 1 study resorted to sonar images or satellite imagery due to affordable costs and user friendliness digital cameras are popular data gathering devices regardless of the studied body of water mustafah et al 2012 fixed cameras are installed on bridges to monitor floating macroplastic litter on the river surface van lieshout et al 2020 one disadvantage is the limited coverage due to their fixed positions and limited viewpoints cameras attached to a vessel can survey broader areas de vries et al 2021 kylili et al 2019 although these surveying activities are time consuming and labor intensive compared to fixed installations five studies used camera images which were partially or completely retrieved from structured databases e g imagenet dataset deng et al 2009 or via internet e g google two of these studies kylili et al 2021 2020 extracted images from the imagenet dataset panwar et al 2020 retrieved images from the taco dataset proença and simões 2020 and directly utilized the images with annotations from the dataset battula et al 2020 extracted images from a kaggle dataset 1 1 https www kaggle com asdasdasasdas garbage classification and labeled images with bounding boxes to train and test od model hegde et al 2021 retrieved unlabelled images from google and manually created the annotations to develop and test their models researchers mainly used underwater cameras to collect images under the water surface e g cameras attached to remotely operated vehicles rovs wu et al 2020 or vessels politikos et al 2021 nine studies used underwater camera images which were partially or completely retrieved from public databases or internet this drastically reduces the cost of sampling activities in marine underwater environments where sampling requires laborious diving operations expensive rovs and or autonomous underwater vehicles auvs valdenegro toro 2016 five of these studies bajaj et al 2021 fulton et al 2019 marin et al 2021 xue et al 2021b 2021a extracted data from the deep sea debris database 2 2 japan agency for marine earth science and technology deep sea debris database available at http www godac jamstec go jp catalog dsdebris e index html provided by japan agency for marine earth science and technology four studies hegde et al 2021 marin et al 2021 musić et al 2020 wu et al 2020 retrieved images from internet while authors of these studies had to manually produce the annotations one study deng et al 2021 directly utilized the images with annotations from the trashcan dataset hong et al 2020 researchers collected airborne imagery using cameras mounted on uavs 7 papers or placed under manned aircrafts 1 paper uavs grant versatility since operators can easily customize the flight route and flight height to obtain images at different locations and with different ground sample distances fallati et al 2019 furthermore uavs allows surveying otherwise hard to reach locations zhang et al 2017 and eliminate the limitations of fixing sensors on bridges or other infrastructure however no fly zones restrict flying uavs e g nearby airports researchers may also need special training and licenses to operate uavs thus increasing the operational costs and in some cases countries making the use of uavs difficult if not impossible as shown in fig 2 uavs are particularly suitable for field sampling activities along beaches since these present fewer flight restrictions and obstacles that can potentially interfere with the uavs flight e g buildings only four studies used mobile phones to collect images phones are easily available for citizens thus could substantially contribute to citizen science initiatives for data collection modern smart phones with high resolution cameras can obtain high quality images and thus meet the needs of accurate sampling while sonar devices are preferred instruments for target and object recognition in underwater environments e g fish classification and fishery assessment mccann et al 2018 only one study in the reviewed literature applied sonar devices to collect underwater images valdenegro toro 2016 although the relatively higher sampling costs hinder the development of autonomous detection and classification directly using sonar images qin et al 2021 sonar devices are promising for underwater plastic monitoring as suggested by a recent study broere et al 2021 sonar sampling can cover a larger area underwater where rovs or divers cannot safely dive neupane and seok 2020 because sound waves travel further in water for these reasons we encourage further studies to assess their suitability for detecting macroplastic litter under water surface especially in real world settings one study mifdal et al 2021 retrieved sentinel 2 imagery on floating marine macroplastic litter from the google earth engine dataset catalog these data are globally available and free of charge but do not contain specific annotations for macroplastic litter after collecting and labeling the satellite imagery the authors trained dl models to detect floating objects on the sea surface compared with other dataset sources satellite imagery can provide broader geographical coverage that is significant for hotspots monitoring and global environmental monitoring on the other hand satellite imagery is not appropriate to detect small and isolated macroplastic litter floating on the vast sea surface and cannot be used for observing underwater litter watanabe et al 2019 3 2 2 dataset labels authors do not usually categorize macroplastic litter and other types of litter in their datasets using labels that reflect international guidelines and standards if we consider the categories defined by the oslo and paris conventions ospar wenneker and oosterbaan 2010 we identify 12 categories of macroplastic litter i e bags bottles nets caps lids industrial packaging plastic sheeting cups buckets cutlery trays straws shoes sandals containers rope and floats buoys and 5 categories of other litter i e glass paper cardboard rubber metal and cloth across all surveyed datasets when ospar defines multiple sub categories of one plastic product and the specific sub category is unclear in reviewed papers we only report its general category for example while bags is categorized into 6 sub categories in ospar e g small plastic bags and fertilizer animal feed bags we only report bags in this paper several studies 13 out of 34 papers detected plastic in a binary fashion among these only three studies garcia garin et al 2021 kako et al 2020 van lieshout et al 2020 specifically detected the presence of macroplastic litter in images the remaining studies detected macroplastic litter by including it in a generic litter or trash or debris category a larger group of studies detected more than 2 classes 22 papers among these one study kylili et al 2019 detected different types of plastic products nine studies provided a refined categorization for other types of litter for example panwar et al 2020 categorized the objects into glass metal paper and plastic one study tharani et al 2021 detected macroplastic litter by considering three different sizes included in three generic categories i e small trash medium trash and large trash the remaining studies 11 papers detected different plastic products as well as other object categories for instance watanabe et al 2019 classified the objects as plastic bottles plastic bags drift wood and other debris gathering a balanced dataset with accurate labels becomes challenging as the number of classes increases we identify 9 studies marin et al 2021 martin et al 2021 musić et al 2020 politikos et al 2021 tharani et al 2021 thiagarajan and satheesh kumar 2019 tian et al 2021 wolf et al 2020 xue et al 2021b working with unbalanced datasets featuring classes with very scarce data e g shoes plastic cups string and cord depending on the sensor used and its resolution small objects e g straws toothpicks and cotton buds may be far less visible than others tharani et al 2021 to improve detection of rare items or small items we need to collect more data at higher resolutions wolf et al 2020 3 2 3 dataset size and split the dataset size column of table 1 reports the size of dataset used in the reviewed papers not including the data generated via da for one study wu et al 2020 only the dataset size including the data generated with da could be reported fig 3 shows the distribution of dataset sizes the number of images per dataset source as reported in 29 of the reviewed papers see table 1 the dataset size of phone images is small because two other datasets containing phone images and another kind of dataset source watanabe et al 2019 wu et al 2020 are featured in the multiple category the size of another dataset containing phone images putra and prabowo 2021 is unclear thus it was not reported in fig 3 one dataset containing 100 000 images de vries et al 2021 is much larger than all the others these time lapse images were collected at intervals between 2 s and 10 s during the ocean cleanup s north pacific mission 3 research expedition the average dataset length is of around 9000 images according to arya et al 2020 ic generally requires more than 5000 labeled images for each class to train a model with acceptable performances for binary detection problems this entails that at least 10 000 images are needed to develop a sufficiently robust detection model in the reviewed literature 11 studies conducted ic tasks see table 1 apart from two studies gonçalves et al 2020 thiagarajan and satheesh kumar 2019 all other 9 studies reported both the specific dataset size and the number of classes in datasets according to the suggestions of arya et al 2020 with the exception of papakonstantinou et al 2021 valdenegro toro 2016 these studies did not collect sufficient raw data for model training and validation considering the number of classes therefore all studies lacking sufficient data adopted tl and or da to improve the performances see section 3 4 similar considerations may be drawn also for studies presenting od and is applications multiple researchers e g martin et al 2021 and van lieshout et al 2020 stressed the importance of a large scale dataset for dl based detection of macroplastic litter furthermore three studies kylili et al 2019 musić et al 2020 van lieshout et al 2020 showed that the increase of training dataset size leads to superior detection performance for example van lieshout et al 2020 developed a dl model to detect floating macroplastic litter in rivers across jakarta indonesia using a binary classification approach the precision i e the proportion of objects correctly identified as macroplastic litter with respect to total detections raised from 49 4 to 59 4 when increasing the number of labels in the training dataset from about 2000 to 10 000 this study also showed that increasing dataset size further from 10 000 to 24 000 resulted in smaller improvements from 59 4 indeed after training with sufficient data to learn basic representations performance for cv tasks tend to grow logarithmically with dataset size sun et al 2017 therefore we suggest gathering and labeling training data with respect to the level of performance required to address the specific challenge the dataset split column of table 1 reports the train validation test splits of the dataset used among 26 papers reporting dataset split 10 reported the use of both a validation and a test dataset the validation dataset is commonly used to select the best model by monitoring overfitting during training on the other hand the test dataset is employed to assess the generalization capability of the model for unseen data it is not clear whether the remaining studies used part of the training data for validation and model selection or if they used the test dataset for that purpose similarly some papers report the use of a validation dataset but not that of a test dataset in general we recommend to split the dataset into training 80 validation 10 and test 10 datasets to facilitate robust model selection and unbiased estimation of the generalization error on unseen data 3 3 computer vision tasks for macroplastic litter detection 3 3 1 cv task types general cv tasks are image classification ic object detection od and image segmentation is chai et al 2021 fig 4 shows an example of dl model architecture the typical labeling procedure used and the output of different cv tasks all reviewed studies resorted to supervised learning for developing the detection models in supervised learning the model is trained to perform its task from examples of paired input output data where the output data is carefully labeled or annotated by humans ic is the process of classifying the entire image into one category single label classification or multiple categories multi label classification wei et al 2016 the labeling procedure of ic includes annotating a given image with one class label or multiple class labels see fig 4 top panel on the other hand od algorithms automatically identify the class and location of different objects in images the labeling task of od requires the annotation of objects with class labels and bounding boxes see fig 4 middle panel consequently the output of od models are bounding boxes and class labels for each detected instance is divides an image into multiple segments with similar characteristics enabling a pixel by pixel identification of objects of interest the labeling task requires assigning corresponding labels and pixel wise masks to target objects see fig 4 bottom panel chai et al 2021 we identify two types of is among reviewed papers semantic segmentation jakovljevic et al 2020 kako et al 2020 mifdal et al 2021 tharani et al 2021 and instance segmentation deng et al 2021 kylili et al 2021 semantic segmentation assigns category labels to each pixel in images while instance segmentation assigns category labels and instance identities to each object pixel chai et al 2021 thus semantic segmentation is more suitable to quantify the area occupied by macroplastic litter while instance segmentation is more appropriate to discriminate different macroplastic items table 1 shows that researchers prefer od methods to detect macroplastic litter in aquatic environments 23 out of 34 papers od can concurrently identify the type and location of objects in images thus estimating the number of macroplastic items in an image van lieshout et al 2020 ic 11 papers is also popular since it is simpler to implement especially by deploying one of the many successful architectures already available from the cv literature only 6 studies resorted to is arguably because of the substantial amount of time required to properly label the datasets jabari et al 2021 referring to ic models all reviewed papers employed single label algorithms i e binary classifiers and multi class classifiers these methods can only process images containing one type of object at a time on the other hand multi label classifiers can identify multiple categories of objects in one image e g macroplastic litter metal and rubber chai et al 2021 although these classifiers can better capture the diversity of litter in natural environments no reviewed paper resorted to multi label ic although most studies 24 out of 34 papers conducted cv tasks only for detection purposes 10 studies also attempted the quantification of macroplastic litter of these 9 papers quantified the number of macroplastic items via od de vries et al 2021 martin et al 2021 song et al 2021 van lieshout et al 2020 ic garcia garin et al 2021 gonçalves et al 2020 papakonstantinou et al 2021 wolf et al 2020 or is kylili et al 2021 for example gonçalves et al 2020 cut one original image into small portions and performed ic to classify each portion into litter or no litter the number of macroplastic items in one image was then calculated by the sum of the number of litter portions however if there are portions containing more than one item performing ic tasks will lead to the deviation between the predicted results and the ground truth some studies also post processed the model results to compute spatial litter concentrations in items m2 or items km2 5 papers fluxes in items min m 1 paper mass concentrations in g m2 1 paper or mass in kg 1 paper for instance martin et al 2021 computed the concentrations of plastic bottles in beaches by averaging the number of correctly detected bottles over the tested area and computed its mass concentrations by multiplying concentrations with respect to the median weights of bottles retrieved from martin et al 2019 kylili et al 2021 computed the total mass of litter in beaches by tallying the known mass of all macroplastic items predicted by the dl model van lieshout et al 2020 computed the macroplastic fluxes floating in rivers by dividing the number of items detected per time unit by the river width kako et al 2020 computed macroplastic volumes via is they first detected the edges of macroplastic litter on images which were then superimposed on a digital surface model containing location and altitude data over a beach this allowed the litter volume to be computed from the heights and base area surrounded by the edges 3 3 2 model architectures for each cv task most reviewed publications 33 out of 34 papers used convolutional neural networks cnns based architectures such as yolo networks xue et al 2021b and vgg networks kylili et al 2020 only one study kako et al 2020 used a more conventional three layered multilayer perceptron mlp neural network compared with mlp cnn can take advantage of the spatial patterns implicit in raw images besides the properties of cnn i e local connections and weight sharing enable it to learn representations with fewer trainable parameters than mlp ming and xiaolin 2015 these characteristics have allowed cnn to outperform mlp zhang et al 2018 and to be more widely used for cv however none of the reviewed papers featured current state of the art architectures such as vision transformers e g swin transformer liu et al 2022a and convnexts zhuang liu et al 2022b in ic tasks four studies employed the vggnet architecture probably because this architecture was proposed in 2014 and has been applied since then successfully in many fields ajit et al 2020 custom cnn architectures 4 papers are also popular mainly to develop parsimonious models with limited parameters that better match data availability and largely reduce computational efforts for example one study valdenegro toro 2016 employed a custom 4 layered cnn with 930 000 parameters much less than the 143 47 million parameters of a deeper vgg model with 19 layers marin et al 2021 cnn based od algorithms are divided into two stage algorithms and one stage algorithms in two stage algorithms the first stage generates a set of bounding box proposals that are classified and detected in the second stage chai et al 2021 on the other hand one stage algorithms perform classification and bounding box prediction concurrently in a single forward pass of the network yolo networks 11 papers are the most frequently used od architectures among the reviewed papers yolo networks are popular one stage architectures thanks to their fast processing speed which can reach the standards required for real time video processing redmon et al 2016 although yolo networks are faster than other architectures its accuracy may be lower than that of some two stage od algorithms such as faster r cnn which has been used in two reviewed papers u net 3 papers is the most frequently employed is architecture huang et al 2020 one study jakovljevic et al 2020 employed resunet50 which is based on a hybrid between the popular resnet he et al 2016 and u net architectures building blocks of resnet pre trained on the imagenet dataset are added to the u net two studies deployed dl models resnet 50 neural network battula et al 2020 and ssd mobilenet v2 hegde et al 2021 to perform od in edge computing devices e g processing boards connected to fixed cameras or installed in rovs for example hegde et al 2021 stored a trained detection model in a raspberry pi board the device used the model to detect macroplastic litter from the surrounding environment as sampled by the attached underwater camera model complexity plays an important role for dl models that will eventually run in real time or on edge computing devices researchers should thus further investigate the suitability of small architectures with good classification performances such as mobilenetv2 2 4 million parameters dong et al 2020 and squeezenetv1 1 2 million parameters gholami et al 2018 these light architectures can be easily transferred to edge devices and play a significant role in tackling macroplastic pollution in water bodies pruning algorithms can successfully reduce model complexity and enable edge computing for instance tian et al 2021 proposed a pruned yolo v4 capable of accurate od for underwater camera images with only 7 of the original parameters 3 4 techniques to improve dl model performances 3 4 1 transfer learning transfer learning tl involves the transfer of prior knowledge from a related task to a new task pan and yang 2010 when applied to dl models tl entails reusing parts of a model pre trained on very large datasets e g imagenet dataset using computing clusters this operation improves learning of the new task by 1 providing a better starting point for training and preventing the model from falling into local minima fulton et al 2019 2 limiting the number of parameters to be optimized to a subset of the layers of the network and 3 reducing data labeling efforts by reducing the amount of training data needed to reach satisfactory performances on the new task most of the reviewed papers 19 out of 34 papers adopted tl regardless of the cv task performed for example musić et al 2020 performed ic task to detect five categories of litter i e plastic glass metal paper and cardboard they pre trained the vgg16 on imagenet dataset and fine tuned the final layers of the vgg16 on a new dataset containing images from these five categories of litter although the objects in imagenet are quite different from the detected litter the pre trained model improves detection because it recognizes generic features e g edges and basic shapes in its early layers researchers usually used models pre trained on the imagenet dataset or the common objects in context coco dataset lin et al 2014 imagenet is preferred for ic 5 papers but also applied for od 2 papers and is 2 papers the coco dataset is a common choice for od 6 papers the cifar 10 dataset recht et al 2018 and the pascal voc dataset everingham et al 2010 have also been used while several authors resorted to tl to develop their models with the exception of marin et al 2021 no studies have thoroughly assessed its benefits with respect to training from scratch or fine tuning the entire architecture not just the classifier such investigations can be justified by the reported good performances of small architectures such as mobilenetv2 and squeezenetv1 furthermore the representation learned on large open source datasets may not always reflect typical features of images with macroplastic litter e g variety of litter presence of water in the background 3 4 2 data augmentation data augmentation da reduces model overfitting by increasing the amount of available training data via augmentation or transformation of the images in the original training dataset shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 this technique can also improve the performances of models when dealing with imbalanced datasets by creating more samples of underrepresented classes da usually involves automatic procedures performing geometrical transformations as well as color space transformations on available images the da methods used in reviewed papers include flipping 11 papers rotation 10 papers zooming in out 4 papers shifting 4 papers noise addition 3 papers cropping 2 papers shearing 2 papers copy paste augmentation 2 papers changes in brightness 1 paper and mosaic data augmentation 1 paper fig 5 shows an example of several da techniques copy paste augmentation is an advanced da technique whose purpose is to copy objects from a source image and paste them to a target image ghiasi et al 2021 for example lin et al 2021 employed such technique to superimpose labeled target objects cropped from real world images against realistic backgrounds mosaic data augmentation combines 4 cropped images to create a synthetic image that is often used for data augmentation in od tasks lin et al 2021 flipping is the most popular choice as it preserves the original features of macroplastic litter in the images and maintains fidelity with respect to the original label on the other hand the addition of noise or changes in brightness may alter the original images too much thus degrading model performances rotation zooming in shifting cropping shearing and mosaic data augmentation may instead lead to the omission of some of the originals objects of interest in the new images forcing relabeling and partially nullifying the benefits of da shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 while most studies 20 out of 34 papers applied da see table 1 only three studies have thoroughly evaluated the benefits of da with respect to training the same architecture on the original dataset van lieshout et al 2020 showed that model precision marginally raised from 59 4 to 63 4 when using flipping data augmentation methods lin et al 2021 also showed the model performances increased slightly when employing mosaic data augmentation musić et al 2020 used copy paste augmentation by superimposing computer generated macroplastic litter on realistic backgrounds however adding these images to the training dataset resulted in poorer prediction performances on the real world dataset thus researchers should discuss the benefits of different da method for macroplastic litter detection models in more depth 3 5 generalization capability dl models for cv exploit spatial inductive biases and shared weights to recognize features and objects regardless of their position in the image battaglia et al 2018 while this favors generalization to unseen data good detection performances at a single location or for similar environmental conditions do not guarantee that the model can be successfully applied or transferred to other situations and case studies achieving satisfactory out of domain generalization capability is a prerequisite for deploying large scale monitoring strategies based on dl especially with respect to transferability across different bodies of water locations and device setups we identify four different forms of out of domain generalization capability in the reviewed papers 1 geographical generalization capability 2 environmental generalization capability 3 non aquatic generalization capability and 4 device setup generalization capability geographical generalization capability represents the generalization capability of the model at different locations under roughly the same environmental conditions such as weather presence of waves wind conditions and terrain shading environmental generalization capability refers model testing in different environmental conditions non aquatic generalization capability involves models trained with data from non aquatic environments and tested on aquatic environments or vice versa lastly device setup generalization capability represents the generalization capability for different device setups such as the flight altitude of uavs or the setting angle between a fixed camera and the water surface despite the importance of generalization only few studies 9 out of 34 papers directly addressed these aspects with two studies fallati et al 2019 van lieshout et al 2020 considering two different forms of generalization capability see table 1 the majority of these 9 studies are with respect to geographical generalization capability 6 papers five papers fallati et al 2019 kako et al 2020 martin et al 2021 papakonstantinou et al 2021 van lieshout et al 2020 studied geographical generalization capability by training and testing on different case studies respectively for example papakonstantinou et al 2021 trained dl models on uav images captured from certain beaches and tested it on uav images collected from different beaches compared with geographical generalization capability there are less studies concerning non aquatic generalization capability 2 papers device setup generalization capability 2 papers and environmental generalization capability 1 paper for instance panwar et al 2020 trained a model on images of macroplastic litter gathered across streets and forests and tested it on images with macroplastic litter under the sea surface and on beaches song et al 2021 assessed device setup generalization capability by using a phone mounted on a tripod to collect training and test data from different heights at one beach fallati et al 2019 evaluated environmental generalization capability by collecting training and test data at different time of the day the authors also used a uav to collect training and test data at different beaches to assess the geographical generalization capability of the model among the 9 papers addressing generalization capability 4 papers battula et al 2020 kako et al 2020 panwar et al 2020 song et al 2021 did not discuss the performances of dl models trained and tested in different conditions only 1 paper papakonstantinou et al 2021 reported promising geographical generalization capability with a precision metric of 83 the models in the remaining studies did not show satisfactory generalization performances when tested for different geographical environmental or device setup conditions with reported precision between 20 and 63 8 for example van lieshout et al 2020 showed that the performances of a trained model working reasonably well for one location deteriorated quickly for an unseen location with a decrease in precision from 68 7 to 54 these new images featured substantially more organic material e g leaves and branches than those used for training the presence of organic material unaccounted for during training thus hindered robust detection of floating macroplastic litter the authors also showed that the generalization performances increased when including images from different locations in the training dataset in general we believe the community should increase efforts to develop dl models with robust generalization that can operate well across different conditions 3 6 performance evaluation the metric column of table 1 reports the performance metrics used by the authors when these reflect common options used for cv padilla et al 2020 wambugu et al 2021 and are unambiguous for ic tasks the majority of studies used the overall accuracy oa metric 9 out of 11 papers to evaluate performances over all classes precision 6 papers recall 7 papers and f1 score 6 papers were the most popular choices to evaluate performances for each class these metrics should be preferred for imbalanced datasets since oa misrepresents the minority classes for example wolf et al 2020 worked on an imbalanced dataset including 18 categories of objects although good average performance were reported for all classes oa 71 minority classes such as carton 25 images in total were poorly detected f1 score 0 46 for binary od common metrics include recall 4 out of 8 papers precision 2 papers and f1 score 2 papers for multi class od the majority of studies employed average precision ap 8 out of 17 papers and mean average precision map 11 papers to assess performances for each class object and over all classes respectively the value of these metrics depends largely on the selected threshold for determining the intersection over union iou a number that quantifies the degree of overlap between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes with some exceptions deng et al 2021 panwar et al 2020 politikos et al 2021 putra and prabowo 2021 song et al 2021 watanabe et al 2019 xue et al 2021b these important thresholds are rarely reported in reviewed papers based on common benchmarks e g coco and pascal voc we recommend using a threshold iou 0 5 when estimating fluxes e g number of items across the river width per unit of time while higher thresholds e g up to 0 95 should be used to quantify mass concentrations e g hotspot areas for binary semantic segmentation tasks two studies kako et al 2020 mifdal et al 2021 used pixel accuracy metrics to assess performances on detecting macroplastic litter for multi class semantic segmentation tasks one paper jakovljevic et al 2020 used precision recall and f1 score metrics to evaluate performances for each class no papers reported results in terms of iou or mean iou which are the preferred metrics for semantic segmentation as they account for unbalanced datasets for multi class instance segmentation one paper deng et al 2021 employed map to evaluate performances over all classes the performance column of table 1 reports the test value of the most representative metric across all classes however since the proposed methodologies have been tested on different macroplastic datasets in disparate experimental settings a direct comparison is unfeasible more interestingly some papers report encouraging evidence on the effectiveness of dl methods with respect to accurate but time consuming sampling methods for instance de vries et al 2021 found a satisfactory correlation r2 0 7 between dl detected spatial concentrations of macroplastics on the sea surface and manta trawling ground truth observations song et al 2021 reported a small error 5 between the number of litter items on a beach yielded by actual counting and those detected by yolo v5 kako et al 2020 reported similar figures 5 for the volumetric difference of beached plastic debris between surveys and mlp based is these results suggest that using dl for automatic detection and quantification of macroplastic litter is a valid alternative to traditional sampling methodologies 4 knowledge gaps and future directions our review shows that the majority of reviewed papers focus on detecting macroplastic litter in marine environments while less attention is devoted to detecting freshwater macroplastic litter recent research indicated that most plastic debris leaking into the environment does not reach the oceans but instead accumulates in river systems tramoy et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2022a weideman et al 2020 resulting in damaged ecosystems blettler et al 2018 monitoring the source transport and sink points of riverine macroplastic litter is thus essential to quantify global macroplastic pollution transport and effectively reduce pollution van emmerik and schwarz 2020 therefore we advocate for greater efforts on applying dl to tackle riverine macroplastic pollution problems in the future based on the findings reported in section 3 we identify three major knowledge gaps regardless of the body of water 1 there is a lack of dl based detection models with robust generalization performances this includes models that can detect macroplastic litter for a certain water body for different geographical environmental device setup conditions as well as models that can generalize across different case studies e g waterway networks within a country 2 the current literature mainly focuses on quantifying the number of macroplastic items there is a lack of dl based methods for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots accurate quantification is essential to estimate pollution impacts devise targeted cleaning interventions and evaluate the success of mitigation efforts 3 stemming from the first two gaps we emphasize the lack of research to inform the design of structural monitoring strategies exploiting robust dl based quantification based on the above knowledge gaps we propose three future research directions to bridge the corresponding gaps these include i the development of a general dl model to detect macroplastic litter ii future dl based applications for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots and iii the development of dl based monitoring strategies while these knowledge gaps and research directions concern all bodies of water we underline their importance with respect to riverine ecosystems this consideration reflects their major role in transport and storage of macroplastic litter van emmerik et al 2022a as well as feasibility with respect to extensive monitoring of marine ecosystems 4 1 development of a general macroplastic litter detection model section 3 5 shows that despite some promising initial efforts research on the generalization capability of dl models for detecting macroplastic litter is insufficient most papers focus on detecting macroplastic litter on a specific case study but lack an in depth analysis on generalization besides review results show that the models proposed so far do not retain satisfactory performances under different geographical environmental or device setup conditions researchers should thus increase efforts to bridge this gap possibly by exploiting new trends in ml such as data centric ai and semi supervised machine learning as suggested in the following paragraphs 4 1 1 data centric artificial intelligence regardless of the cv task our review shows that several known model architectures perform reasonably well for detecting macroplastic litter in individual case studies further improvements can be obtained by resorting to the latest state of the art models such as vision transformers paul and chen 2022 or convnexts liu et al 2022b however we suggest that achieving higher generalization performances may require shifting the focus from model architectures to data this is the core idea behind the emerging field of data centric artificial intelligence ai which aims to improve model performances by training on cleaner and more informative datasets motamedi et al 2021 several studies have shown the benefits of employing these approaches for a wide variety of cv related industrial applications im et al 2021 tang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020b these approaches usually entail improving the quality of existing data by resorting to pre processing techniques systematic labeling and expert knowledge for instance sun glints on the surface of rivers can lead to the misclassification of floating objects jakovljevic et al 2020 some pre processing techniques such as contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization can dilute the effects of these unwanted reflections and boost model performances as shown already for applications in defect detection and eye tracking im et al 2021 singvi et al 2012 enforcing consistency in the labeling procedure can results in similar improvements jain et al 2021 manual labeling may introduce significant human error and bias in data which in turn may severely undermine model performances clear guidelines with illustrative examples and cross checking between multiple labelers strengthen the consistency of labeled data towards achieving reliable performances lavitas et al 2021 similar to what discussed in section 3 2 2 labels for dl based litter detection should reflect ospar categories wenneker and oosterbaan 2010 or plastic categories used in crowdwater van emmerik et al 2020 to facilitate their usage and allow for joining multiple sources to train models with better generalization performances the data centric approach also favors the collection of additional data from in situ experiments whenever possible in particular we suggest gathering more training images at various sampling locations under different environmental conditions van lieshout et al 2020 and extending the collection to different devices and instrumental settings for extensive monitoring applications e g river networks nation wide initiatives we also recommend collecting more data about rare and small items e g straws cups shoes strings and cords the choice of data gathering devices can refer to their characteristics reported in section 3 2 1 the monitoring aims and available resources the researchers should prevent privacy violation when using phones cameras or uavs to sample in a public location e g urban waterways researchers can resort some privacy preserving approaches in human and human activity recognition e g image style transformation and differential privacy jung 2020 alternatively researchers should resort to da techniques to increase the number of the images collected in the field review results show that most authors employ traditional augmentation techniques e g flipping transformation with few studies assessing the benefits of advanced augmentation techniques such as copy paste augmentation described in section 3 4 2 contrary to some traditional techniques this augmentation procedure does not change the original features of target macroplastic litter or omits objects in the newly generated images while musić et al 2020 did not report improved performances studies form other fields suggest substantial benefits for different cv tasks dwibedi et al 2017 ghiasi et al 2021 xu et al 2021 by following the data centric approach researchers can develop a large open dataset with carefully labeled images that can be used for model development pre training and fair benchmarking 4 1 2 semi supervised learning methods all reviewed studies employ supervised learning methods to detect macroplastic litter to achieve good generalization performances supervised learning requires large amount of labeled data obtained with substantial efforts professional knowledge and skills recently the ai researchers are increasing efforts to develop alternative methods based on semi supervised learning that greatly reduce the need of costly supervision misra and van der maaten 2020 this approach entails a preliminary step based on self supervised learning e g the process of learning meaningful representations from images via pretext tasks that do not require annotations after pre training the model is fine tuned for prediction on a specific downstream task which requires a limited amount of labelled data fig 6 shows an example of semi supervised learning for macroplastic litter detection adapted from noroozi and favaro 2016 firstly we need to carefully label a few images and keep the remaining unlabeled these images are chosen to maximize the informative content of the labeled dataset e g images with good representations of different macroplastic litter different sampling locations and different environmental conditions next a cnn is trained on a large number of unlabeled images by solving the jigsaw puzzle problem as a pretext task in the jigsaw task we randomly crop a window red dashed box in fig 6 from an image divide it into a 3 3 grid and randomly select a tile yellow dashed box in each cell these tiles numbered from 1 to 9 are reordered by a randomly selected permutation e g 9 8 7 6 1 2 3 4 5 from a predefined permutation set the training dataset for the pretext task is generated by retaining a subset of all potential permutations e g 100 for each image the pretext task entails reconstructing the original image from its permutations after training the representations of unlabeled data learned by the cnn are transferred to the downstream task i e macroplastic litter detection by fine tuning the cnn via supervised learning on a limited number of carefully labeled images semi supervised learning can be a better alternative to supervised learning methods because of the lower cost of annotating data and the competitive model performances 4 2 quantification of riverine macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots our review shows that the current literature mainly focuses on detecting macroplastic litter in water and only few studies link dl based detection to the quantification of macroplastic litter mainly with respect to the number of macroplastic items only one study van lieshout et al 2020 quantifies the floating macroplastic fluxes and no studies quantifies the extension of floating macroplastic hotspots although stakeholders require this information to design cleaning campaigns and mitigate the impact of pollution on the environment and human health tasseron et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2018 considering the significance of riverine macroplastic pollution future studies should focus on the development of new methods for quantifying macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots in riverine environments 1 macroplastic mass fluxes macroplastic fluxes and mass fluxes can be expressed as the number and the mass of macroplastic items across the river width per unit of time respectively van emmerik et al 2018 to quantify them we recommend gathering images by installing fixed cameras on hydraulic infrastructures e g bridges at various locations along the river or river network and train the dl model on these images performing od tasks can precisely quantify the number of items by detecting each item in images with a bounding box see fig 4 the latest versions of yolo networks e g yolo v7 wang et al 2022 are the most promising architectures to detect litter fast and accurately then a limited number of experiments must be conducted by i sampling litter using nets ii counting the number of samples and iii weighing them the sampled average densities can be computed by dividing the weight of litter by the number of items in experiments finally we can predict the number of riverine litter on tested area and then post process the results to compute the fluxes by dividing by the recording time van lieshout et al 2020 mass fluxes can be obtained by multiplying fluxes with respect to sampled average densities van emmerik et al 2018 2 mass of macroplastic litter in hotspots macroplastic hotspots are locations where a large amount of macroplastic litter accumulates on the water surface due to favorable morphological and environmental conditions moy et al 2018 we suggest collecting hotspot images at various locations along rivers using uavs that can provide an overview of pollution with low human labor costs and high resolution images vriend et al 2020 and train the dl model on these images studies from other fields suggest dl based semantic segmentation methods can precisely quantify the area of target objects kang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a thus we believe that semantic segmentation can provide reliable estimations of the area occupied by hotspots next limited experiments are needed to i collect hotspot images and measure the true area of them ii sample litter in these hotspots e g using nets and iii weigh litter the spatial average densities of hotspots can be computed by dividing the weight of the litter by the true area occupied by them after accounting for image resolution e g pixel to area ratio the mass of macroplastic litter in hotspots can be obtained by multiplying the pixels identified as hotspots by the is algorithm by the spatial average densities 4 3 dl based monitoring of riverine macroplastic litter monitoring the source transport distribution sink points and trends of riverine macroplastic litter is essential for decision makers to devise mitigation strategies and conduct targeted cleaning campaigns van emmerik et al 2022b vriend et al 2020 designing effective monitoring strategies helps implement these activities more efficiently nonetheless the review shows that no papers in the literature considered the design and implementation of structural monitoring strategies exploiting dl based quantification to devise automated strategies for long term monitoring of riverine macroplastic litter we propose integrating robust dl based macroplastic litter quantification in the roadmap proposed by van emmerik et al 2022b the roadmap consists of three steps or levels i method development ii baseline assessment and iii long term monitoring the first step focuses on assessing available monitoring techniques and methodologies in order to lay the foundations for developing a suitable strategy the second step aims at establishing baseline measurements to get a first estimate on the magnitude of the problem as well as providing insights for improving the monitoring protocol in the long run the latter step is concerned with the exploitation of structural monitoring for higher level tasks such as inferring trends estimating the effects of policy changes on the level of pollution or mapping transport pathways while these steps are sequential the roadmap is a cyclical approach for continuous improvement of structural monitoring via incorporation of new insights monitoring goals priorities and data this iterative design can be successfully mapped to the continuous integration continuous deployment process implemented for ml based solution which is known as machine learning operations mlops ruf et al 2021 mlops enables long term utilization and refinement of ml based solutions by automating all key phases such as data management model deployment and model validation the integration of mlops into the roadmap of van emmerik et al 2022b could results in the following steps leading to dl based structural monitoring of macroplastic litter the first step could include the selection of dl tasks e g ic od and is dl architectures e g yolo and monitoring devices e g cameras and drones for the specific problem in the second step the mlops infrastructure could be initially deployed on selected pilot projects to train baseline dl models and validate their performance this will require systematic data gathering and ground truth measurements e g visual inspection of recordings comparison against visual counting and sampling litter distributions from clean up initiatives after establishing a satisfactory baseline long term monitoring on the selected pilot study ies can start concurrently the infrastructure can be strategically extended employing the baseline dl models for monitoring at new locations following the data centric ai approach see section 4 1 1 we can add novel accurately labeled images at these new or existing locations to improve the generalization capability of the baseline models this could also include adding litter categories of interests underrepresented in the training dataset or performing tailored ground truth validation for more accurate quantification as witnessed in other fields of application ruf et al 2021 we believe several iterations of the proposed mlops approach may lead to robust and automated structural monitoring of macroplastic litter 5 conclusions this paper reviewed the current research concerning deep learning dl based detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies and proposed key knowledge gaps and future directions the following knowledge gaps were identified based on the critical review and discussion of 34 reviewed papers 1 the lack of dl models with satisfactory generalization capability that are able to detect macroplastic litter in a given water body in a robust manner under different geographical environmental and device setup conditions 2 in terms of applications there is a lack of dl based methods for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots 3 no reviewed papers perform the design of structural monitoring strategies exploiting robust dl based quantification to address above gaps the following research directions are suggested 1 future research is required to develop a robust dl model that has better generalization capabilities i e that is able to detect macroplastic litter in a more reliable and consistent manner irrespective of geographical environmental and other conditions this can be done by exploiting new methods in machine learning such as data centric artificial intelligence ai methods and semi supervised machine learning 2 more efforts should go into developing better methods for quantifying macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots we identify potential methods of quantifying the macroplastic mass fluxes by performing object detection tasks and quantifying the mass of macroplastic litter in hotspots by conducting semantic segmentation tasks 3 the community should focus on developing and validating automated dl based quantification for structural monitoring of macroplastic litter we propose to approach this important task by integrating mlops technologies in the general framework for long term monitoring proposed by van emmerik et al 2022b while the identified gaps and suggested research directions concern all bodies of water we highlight their importance with respect to riverine ecosystems which are currently understudied despite their major role in transport and storage of litter this review has the following limitations 1 comparing the performances across different studies was difficult since models are evaluated on different dataset and results are reported with different metrics 2 the code and data used in most studies are not open to the public therefore we could not perform basic checks on their quality and 3 this work considered only peer reviewed journal papers and conference proceedings as such we did not take into account project reports or other type of publications e g project blogs conference abstracts which may present interesting results concerning the application in the field of reviewed or other dl models we expect dl to be a promising method to advance automatic detection of macroplastic litter in all bodies of water this is an emerging research field that requires more efforts including multidisciplinary research

15073,plastic pollution in water bodies is an unresolved environmental issue that damages all aquatic environments and causes economic and health problems accurate detection of macroplastic litter plastic items 5 mm in water is essential to estimate the quantities compositions and sources identify emerging trends and design preventive measures or mitigation strategies in recent years researchers have demonstrated the potential of computer vision cv techniques based on deep learning dl for automated detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies however a systematic review to describe the state of the art of the field is lacking here we provide such a review and we highlight current knowledge gaps and suggest promising future research directions the review compares 34 papers with respect to their application and modeling related criteria the results show that the researchers have employed a variety of dl architectures implementing different cv techniques to detect macroplastic litter in various aquatic environments however key knowledge gaps must be addressed to overcome the lack of i dl based macroplastic litter detection models with sufficient generalization capability ii dl based quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots and iii scalable macroplastic litter monitoring strategies based on robust dl based quantification we advocate for the exploration of data centric artificial intelligence approaches and semi supervised learning to develop models with improved generalization capabilities these models can boost the development of new methods for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots and allow for structural monitoring strategies that leverage robust dl based quantification while the identified gaps concern

estimated global emissions of plastic waste to aquatic ecosystems range from 19 to 23 million metric tons in 2016 bellou et al 2021 borrelle et al 2020 jambeck et al 2015 rivers are the main source of marine plastic pollution with estimated riverine plastic emissions of 0 8 to 2 7 million metric tons into oceans each year lebreton et al 2017 meijer et al 2021 furthermore marine plastic litter may wash up on beaches and shores and substantial amounts of discarded plastic litter has also been detected in lakes imhof et al 2018 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 detecting and quantifying macroplastic litter plastic items 5 mm is necessary to assess water pollution levels and develop monitoring strategies for designing effective preventive measures conducting targeted cleaning campaigns and devising mitigation interventions van emmerik et al 2022b common detection methods include in situ methodologies such as sampling and visual observations grøsvik et al 2018 hardesty et al 2017 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 more recently methods based on computer vision cv have been proposed to replace these accurate but time consuming and labor intensive in situ methodologies with automatic detection from images kylili et al 2020 2019 van lieshout et al 2020 in particular researchers focused on deep learning dl methods a subset of flexible machine learning ml techniques reaching state of the art performances in many fields of science and technology including water resources management and engineering sit et al 2020 dl belongs to the family of representation learning techniques that replace manual feature engineering via automatic discovery of the representations needed for feature detection from raw data lecun et al 2015 this allows dl models to reach state of the art performances in all the generic computer vision cv tasks related to aquatic macroplastic litter detection such as image classification ic object detection od and image segmentation is chai et al 2021 while preliminary results are promising this specific field is still in its infancy van emmerik and schwarz 2020 the researchers must increase their efforts to devise dl based applications that can help tackling plastic pollution in water bodies at scale to help build the road ahead this paper presents a critical review outlining the state of the art of dl based detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies the main purposes of this review are 1 to improve researchers understanding of dl based macroplastic litter detection by conducting a thorough assessment of the current state of the field 2 to identify key knowledge gaps and 3 to provide future research directions concerning promising methodologies and novel applications to address these gaps the paper is structured as follows the methodology used to select and analyze the reviewed papers is described in section 2 section 3 thoroughly reviews the selected papers with critical discussion points section 4 identifies a series of knowledge gaps linked to suggested future research directions finally section 5 provides conclusions 2 methodology 2 1 search methodology in this review we analyzed 34 peer reviewed journal papers and conference proceedings retrieved from the scopus and web of science databases we employed the following steps to identify these papers firstly we searched for papers published until the end of 2021 by employing three sets of keywords 1 deep learning related keywords included deep learning neural network artificial intelligence and machine learning 2 macroplastic litter related keywords included plastic trash litter debris and garbage 3 water bodies keywords included marine sea ocean beach shore river channel canal waterway and lake the literature search identified papers containing combinations of these terms in their titles keywords and abstract after reviewing the abstracts of all papers matching the inclusion criteria we selected 33 papers with the first publication dating back to 2016 valdenegro toro 2016 finally we conducted a snowball search by checking the citations of these publications the procedure yielded a total of 34 papers which are listed in table 1 along with the most important details these papers are ordered by the type of water bodies and then by publication year within type in table 1 if the study features different cv tasks the review considers each of these tasks separately when multiple architectures are tested we report only the architecture achieving the highest performances which is listed in the model architecture column of table 1 2 2

valdenegro toro 2016a and wu et al 2020 collected data in a water tank for model training and test which is time saving and cost effective however they did not investigate the generalization capability of dl models from studies in ae to field case studies field applications are different from studies in ae because it is generally difficult to replicate the wide variety of litter and environmental conditions e g natural lighting witnessed in real settings valdenegro toro 2016 we encourage further studies to test the performance of dl models trained with ae data when applied to real scenarios to assess the overall suitability of this approach and to allow future benchmarking of different methods we categorized the bodies of water examined in the reviewed papers into i beaches and shores ii marine underwater iii marine surface iv rivers including natural rivers waterways urban channels and their banks and v lakes most of the studies 18 out of 34 papers focused on macroplastic pollution in marine environments including marine underwater 11 papers marine surface 7 papers and beaches and shores 12 papers fewer studies were concerned with river pollution 6 papers and only one study dealt with macroplastic litter in lakes this is somewhat expected since contrary to the consolidated body of knowledge for macroplastic pollution in marine environments the first scientific studies on the quantification of riverine macroplastic litter date only to the early 2010s blettler et al 2018 van emmerik and schwarz 2020 the first studies concerning lakes are even more recent imhof et al 2018 3 2 dataset on macroplastic litter 3 2 1 employed dataset sources researchers collected input data using imaging devices such as standard digital cameras underwater cameras cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles uavs or manned aircrafts cameras mounted on phones as well as satellite cameras and sonar technologies as shown in fig 2 camera images 12 out of 34 papers underwater camera images 11 papers and airborne imagery 8 papers are the three most popular dataset sources while 4 studies have used phone images and only 1 study resorted to sonar images or satellite imagery due to affordable costs and user friendliness digital cameras are popular data gathering devices regardless of the studied body of water mustafah et al 2012 fixed cameras are installed on bridges to monitor floating macroplastic litter on the river surface van lieshout et al 2020 one disadvantage is the limited coverage due to their fixed positions and limited viewpoints cameras attached to a vessel can survey broader areas de vries et al 2021 kylili et al 2019 although these surveying activities are time consuming and labor intensive compared to fixed installations five studies used camera images which were partially or completely retrieved from structured databases e g imagenet dataset deng et al 2009 or via internet e g google two of these studies kylili et al 2021 2020 extracted images from the imagenet dataset panwar et al 2020 retrieved images from the taco dataset proença and simões 2020 and directly utilized the images with annotations from the dataset battula et al 2020 extracted images from a kaggle dataset 1 1 https www kaggle com asdasdasasdas garbage classification and labeled images with bounding boxes to train and test od model hegde et al 2021 retrieved unlabelled images from google and manually created the annotations to develop and test their models researchers mainly used underwater cameras to collect images under the water surface e g cameras attached to remotely operated vehicles rovs wu et al 2020 or vessels politikos et al 2021 nine studies used underwater camera images which were partially or completely retrieved from public databases or internet this drastically reduces the cost of sampling activities in marine underwater environments where sampling requires laborious diving operations expensive rovs and or autonomous underwater vehicles auvs valdenegro toro 2016 five of these studies bajaj et al 2021 fulton et al 2019 marin et al 2021 xue et al 2021b 2021a extracted data from the deep sea debris database 2 2 japan agency for marine earth science and technology deep sea debris database available at http www godac jamstec go jp catalog dsdebris e index html provided by japan agency for marine earth science and technology four studies hegde et al 2021 marin et al 2021 musić et al 2020 wu et al 2020 retrieved images from internet while authors of these studies had to manually produce the annotations one study deng et al 2021 directly utilized the images with annotations from the trashcan dataset hong et al 2020 researchers collected airborne imagery using cameras mounted on uavs 7 papers or placed under manned aircrafts 1 paper uavs grant versatility since operators can easily customize the flight route and flight height to obtain images at different locations and with different ground sample distances fallati et al 2019 furthermore uavs allows surveying otherwise hard to reach locations zhang et al 2017 and eliminate the limitations of fixing sensors on bridges or other infrastructure however no fly zones restrict flying uavs e g nearby airports researchers may also need special training and licenses to operate uavs thus increasing the operational costs and in some cases countries making the use of uavs difficult if not impossible as shown in fig 2 uavs are particularly suitable for field sampling activities along beaches since these present fewer flight restrictions and obstacles that can potentially interfere with the uavs flight e g buildings only four studies used mobile phones to collect images phones are easily available for citizens thus could substantially contribute to citizen science initiatives for data collection modern smart phones with high resolution cameras can obtain high quality images and thus meet the needs of accurate sampling while sonar devices are preferred instruments for target and object recognition in underwater environments e g fish classification and fishery assessment mccann et al 2018 only one study in the reviewed literature applied sonar devices to collect underwater images valdenegro toro 2016 although the relatively higher sampling costs hinder the development of autonomous detection and classification directly using sonar images qin et al 2021 sonar devices are promising for underwater plastic monitoring as suggested by a recent study broere et al 2021 sonar sampling can cover a larger area underwater where rovs or divers cannot safely dive neupane and seok 2020 because sound waves travel further in water for these reasons we encourage further studies to assess their suitability for detecting macroplastic litter under water surface especially in real world settings one study mifdal et al 2021 retrieved sentinel 2 imagery on floating marine macroplastic litter from the google earth engine dataset catalog these data are globally available and free of charge but do not contain specific annotations for macroplastic litter after collecting and labeling the satellite imagery the authors trained dl models to detect floating objects on the sea surface compared with other dataset sources satellite imagery can provide broader geographical coverage that is significant for hotspots monitoring and global environmental monitoring on the other hand satellite imagery is not appropriate to detect small and isolated macroplastic litter floating on the vast sea surface and cannot be used for observing underwater litter watanabe et al 2019 3 2 2 dataset labels authors do not usually categorize macroplastic litter and other types of litter in their datasets using labels that reflect international guidelines and standards if we consider the categories defined by the oslo and paris conventions ospar wenneker and oosterbaan 2010 we identify 12 categories of macroplastic litter i e bags bottles nets caps lids industrial packaging plastic sheeting cups buckets cutlery trays straws shoes sandals containers rope and floats buoys and 5 categories of other litter i e glass paper cardboard rubber metal and cloth across all surveyed datasets when ospar defines multiple sub categories of one plastic product and the specific sub category is unclear in reviewed papers we only report its general category for example while bags is categorized into 6 sub categories in ospar e g small plastic bags and fertilizer animal feed bags we only report bags in this paper several studies 13 out of 34 papers detected plastic in a binary fashion among these only three studies garcia garin et al 2021 kako et al 2020 van lieshout et al 2020 specifically detected the presence of macroplastic litter in images the remaining studies detected macroplastic litter by including it in a generic litter or trash or debris category a larger group of studies detected more than 2 classes 22 papers among these one study kylili et al 2019 detected different types of plastic products nine studies provided a refined categorization for other types of litter for example panwar et al 2020 categorized the objects into glass metal paper and plastic one study tharani et al 2021 detected macroplastic litter by considering three different sizes included in three generic categories i e small trash medium trash and large trash the remaining studies 11 papers detected different plastic products as well as other object categories for instance watanabe et al 2019 classified the objects as plastic bottles plastic bags drift wood and other debris gathering a balanced dataset with accurate labels becomes challenging as the number of classes increases we identify 9 studies marin et al 2021 martin et al 2021 musić et al 2020 politikos et al 2021 tharani et al 2021 thiagarajan and satheesh kumar 2019 tian et al 2021 wolf et al 2020 xue et al 2021b working with unbalanced datasets featuring classes with very scarce data e g shoes plastic cups string and cord depending on the sensor used and its resolution small objects e g straws toothpicks and cotton buds may be far less visible than others tharani et al 2021 to improve detection of rare items or small items we need to collect more data at higher resolutions wolf et al 2020 3 2 3 dataset size and split the dataset size column of table 1 reports the size of dataset used in the reviewed papers not including the data generated via da for one study wu et al 2020 only the dataset size including the data generated with da could be reported fig 3 shows the distribution of dataset sizes the number of images per dataset source as reported in 29 of the reviewed papers see table 1 the dataset size of phone images is small because two other datasets containing phone images and another kind of dataset source watanabe et al 2019 wu et al 2020 are featured in the multiple category the size of another dataset containing phone images putra and prabowo 2021 is unclear thus it was not reported in fig 3 one dataset containing 100 000 images de vries et al 2021 is much larger than all the others these time lapse images were collected at intervals between 2 s and 10 s during the ocean cleanup s north pacific mission 3 research expedition the average dataset length is of around 9000 images according to arya et al 2020 ic generally requires more than 5000 labeled images for each class to train a model with acceptable performances for binary detection problems this entails that at least 10 000 images are needed to develop a sufficiently robust detection model in the reviewed literature 11 studies conducted ic tasks see table 1 apart from two studies gonçalves et al 2020 thiagarajan and satheesh kumar 2019 all other 9 studies reported both the specific dataset size and the number of classes in datasets according to the suggestions of arya et al 2020 with the exception of papakonstantinou et al 2021 valdenegro toro 2016 these studies did not collect sufficient raw data for model training and validation considering the number of classes therefore all studies lacking sufficient data adopted tl and or da to improve the performances see section 3 4 similar considerations may be drawn also for studies presenting od and is applications multiple researchers e g martin et al 2021 and van lieshout et al 2020 stressed the importance of a large scale dataset for dl based detection of macroplastic litter furthermore three studies kylili et al 2019 musić et al 2020 van lieshout et al 2020 showed that the increase of training dataset size leads to superior detection performance for example van lieshout et al 2020 developed a dl model to detect floating macroplastic litter in rivers across jakarta indonesia using a binary classification approach the precision i e the proportion of objects correctly identified as macroplastic litter with respect to total detections raised from 49 4 to 59 4 when increasing the number of labels in the training dataset from about 2000 to 10 000 this study also showed that increasing dataset size further from 10 000 to 24 000 resulted in smaller improvements from 59 4 indeed after training with sufficient data to learn basic representations performance for cv tasks tend to grow logarithmically with dataset size sun et al 2017 therefore we suggest gathering and labeling training data with respect to the level of performance required to address the specific challenge the dataset split column of table 1 reports the train validation test splits of the dataset used among 26 papers reporting dataset split 10 reported the use of both a validation and a test dataset the validation dataset is commonly used to select the best model by monitoring overfitting during training on the other hand the test dataset is employed to assess the generalization capability of the model for unseen data it is not clear whether the remaining studies used part of the training data for validation and model selection or if they used the test dataset for that purpose similarly some papers report the use of a validation dataset but not that of a test dataset in general we recommend to split the dataset into training 80 validation 10 and test 10 datasets to facilitate robust model selection and unbiased estimation of the generalization error on unseen data 3 3 computer vision tasks for macroplastic litter detection 3 3 1 cv task types general cv tasks are image classification ic object detection od and image segmentation is chai et al 2021 fig 4 shows an example of dl model architecture the typical labeling procedure used and the output of different cv tasks all reviewed studies resorted to supervised learning for developing the detection models in supervised learning the model is trained to perform its task from examples of paired input output data where the output data is carefully labeled or annotated by humans ic is the process of classifying the entire image into one category single label classification or multiple categories multi label classification wei et al 2016 the labeling procedure of ic includes annotating a given image with one class label or multiple class labels see fig 4 top panel on the other hand od algorithms automatically identify the class and location of different objects in images the labeling task of od requires the annotation of objects with class labels and bounding boxes see fig 4 middle panel consequently the output of od models are bounding boxes and class labels for each detected instance is divides an image into multiple segments with similar characteristics enabling a pixel by pixel identification of objects of interest the labeling task requires assigning corresponding labels and pixel wise masks to target objects see fig 4 bottom panel chai et al 2021 we identify two types of is among reviewed papers semantic segmentation jakovljevic et al 2020 kako et al 2020 mifdal et al 2021 tharani et al 2021 and instance segmentation deng et al 2021 kylili et al 2021 semantic segmentation assigns category labels to each pixel in images while instance segmentation assigns category labels and instance identities to each object pixel chai et al 2021 thus semantic segmentation is more suitable to quantify the area occupied by macroplastic litter while instance segmentation is more appropriate to discriminate different macroplastic items table 1 shows that researchers prefer od methods to detect macroplastic litter in aquatic environments 23 out of 34 papers od can concurrently identify the type and location of objects in images thus estimating the number of macroplastic items in an image van lieshout et al 2020 ic 11 papers is also popular since it is simpler to implement especially by deploying one of the many successful architectures already available from the cv literature only 6 studies resorted to is arguably because of the substantial amount of time required to properly label the datasets jabari et al 2021 referring to ic models all reviewed papers employed single label algorithms i e binary classifiers and multi class classifiers these methods can only process images containing one type of object at a time on the other hand multi label classifiers can identify multiple categories of objects in one image e g macroplastic litter metal and rubber chai et al 2021 although these classifiers can better capture the diversity of litter in natural environments no reviewed paper resorted to multi label ic although most studies 24 out of 34 papers conducted cv tasks only for detection purposes 10 studies also attempted the quantification of macroplastic litter of these 9 papers quantified the number of macroplastic items via od de vries et al 2021 martin et al 2021 song et al 2021 van lieshout et al 2020 ic garcia garin et al 2021 gonçalves et al 2020 papakonstantinou et al 2021 wolf et al 2020 or is kylili et al 2021 for example gonçalves et al 2020 cut one original image into small portions and performed ic to classify each portion into litter or no litter the number of macroplastic items in one image was then calculated by the sum of the number of litter portions however if there are portions containing more than one item performing ic tasks will lead to the deviation between the predicted results and the ground truth some studies also post processed the model results to compute spatial litter concentrations in items m2 or items km2 5 papers fluxes in items min m 1 paper mass concentrations in g m2 1 paper or mass in kg 1 paper for instance martin et al 2021 computed the concentrations of plastic bottles in beaches by averaging the number of correctly detected bottles over the tested area and computed its mass concentrations by multiplying concentrations with respect to the median weights of bottles retrieved from martin et al 2019 kylili et al 2021 computed the total mass of litter in beaches by tallying the known mass of all macroplastic items predicted by the dl model van lieshout et al 2020 computed the macroplastic fluxes floating in rivers by dividing the number of items detected per time unit by the river width kako et al 2020 computed macroplastic volumes via is they first detected the edges of macroplastic litter on images which were then superimposed on a digital surface model containing location and altitude data over a beach this allowed the litter volume to be computed from the heights and base area surrounded by the edges 3 3 2 model architectures for each cv task most reviewed publications 33 out of 34 papers used convolutional neural networks cnns based architectures such as yolo networks xue et al 2021b and vgg networks kylili et al 2020 only one study kako et al 2020 used a more conventional three layered multilayer perceptron mlp neural network compared with mlp cnn can take advantage of the spatial patterns implicit in raw images besides the properties of cnn i e local connections and weight sharing enable it to learn representations with fewer trainable parameters than mlp ming and xiaolin 2015 these characteristics have allowed cnn to outperform mlp zhang et al 2018 and to be more widely used for cv however none of the reviewed papers featured current state of the art architectures such as vision transformers e g swin transformer liu et al 2022a and convnexts zhuang liu et al 2022b in ic tasks four studies employed the vggnet architecture probably because this architecture was proposed in 2014 and has been applied since then successfully in many fields ajit et al 2020 custom cnn architectures 4 papers are also popular mainly to develop parsimonious models with limited parameters that better match data availability and largely reduce computational efforts for example one study valdenegro toro 2016 employed a custom 4 layered cnn with 930 000 parameters much less than the 143 47 million parameters of a deeper vgg model with 19 layers marin et al 2021 cnn based od algorithms are divided into two stage algorithms and one stage algorithms in two stage algorithms the first stage generates a set of bounding box proposals that are classified and detected in the second stage chai et al 2021 on the other hand one stage algorithms perform classification and bounding box prediction concurrently in a single forward pass of the network yolo networks 11 papers are the most frequently used od architectures among the reviewed papers yolo networks are popular one stage architectures thanks to their fast processing speed which can reach the standards required for real time video processing redmon et al 2016 although yolo networks are faster than other architectures its accuracy may be lower than that of some two stage od algorithms such as faster r cnn which has been used in two reviewed papers u net 3 papers is the most frequently employed is architecture huang et al 2020 one study jakovljevic et al 2020 employed resunet50 which is based on a hybrid between the popular resnet he et al 2016 and u net architectures building blocks of resnet pre trained on the imagenet dataset are added to the u net two studies deployed dl models resnet 50 neural network battula et al 2020 and ssd mobilenet v2 hegde et al 2021 to perform od in edge computing devices e g processing boards connected to fixed cameras or installed in rovs for example hegde et al 2021 stored a trained detection model in a raspberry pi board the device used the model to detect macroplastic litter from the surrounding environment as sampled by the attached underwater camera model complexity plays an important role for dl models that will eventually run in real time or on edge computing devices researchers should thus further investigate the suitability of small architectures with good classification performances such as mobilenetv2 2 4 million parameters dong et al 2020 and squeezenetv1 1 2 million parameters gholami et al 2018 these light architectures can be easily transferred to edge devices and play a significant role in tackling macroplastic pollution in water bodies pruning algorithms can successfully reduce model complexity and enable edge computing for instance tian et al 2021 proposed a pruned yolo v4 capable of accurate od for underwater camera images with only 7 of the original parameters 3 4 techniques to improve dl model performances 3 4 1 transfer learning transfer learning tl involves the transfer of prior knowledge from a related task to a new task pan and yang 2010 when applied to dl models tl entails reusing parts of a model pre trained on very large datasets e g imagenet dataset using computing clusters this operation improves learning of the new task by 1 providing a better starting point for training and preventing the model from falling into local minima fulton et al 2019 2 limiting the number of parameters to be optimized to a subset of the layers of the network and 3 reducing data labeling efforts by reducing the amount of training data needed to reach satisfactory performances on the new task most of the reviewed papers 19 out of 34 papers adopted tl regardless of the cv task performed for example musić et al 2020 performed ic task to detect five categories of litter i e plastic glass metal paper and cardboard they pre trained the vgg16 on imagenet dataset and fine tuned the final layers of the vgg16 on a new dataset containing images from these five categories of litter although the objects in imagenet are quite different from the detected litter the pre trained model improves detection because it recognizes generic features e g edges and basic shapes in its early layers researchers usually used models pre trained on the imagenet dataset or the common objects in context coco dataset lin et al 2014 imagenet is preferred for ic 5 papers but also applied for od 2 papers and is 2 papers the coco dataset is a common choice for od 6 papers the cifar 10 dataset recht et al 2018 and the pascal voc dataset everingham et al 2010 have also been used while several authors resorted to tl to develop their models with the exception of marin et al 2021 no studies have thoroughly assessed its benefits with respect to training from scratch or fine tuning the entire architecture not just the classifier such investigations can be justified by the reported good performances of small architectures such as mobilenetv2 and squeezenetv1 furthermore the representation learned on large open source datasets may not always reflect typical features of images with macroplastic litter e g variety of litter presence of water in the background 3 4 2 data augmentation data augmentation da reduces model overfitting by increasing the amount of available training data via augmentation or transformation of the images in the original training dataset shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 this technique can also improve the performances of models when dealing with imbalanced datasets by creating more samples of underrepresented classes da usually involves automatic procedures performing geometrical transformations as well as color space transformations on available images the da methods used in reviewed papers include flipping 11 papers rotation 10 papers zooming in out 4 papers shifting 4 papers noise addition 3 papers cropping 2 papers shearing 2 papers copy paste augmentation 2 papers changes in brightness 1 paper and mosaic data augmentation 1 paper fig 5 shows an example of several da techniques copy paste augmentation is an advanced da technique whose purpose is to copy objects from a source image and paste them to a target image ghiasi et al 2021 for example lin et al 2021 employed such technique to superimpose labeled target objects cropped from real world images against realistic backgrounds mosaic data augmentation combines 4 cropped images to create a synthetic image that is often used for data augmentation in od tasks lin et al 2021 flipping is the most popular choice as it preserves the original features of macroplastic litter in the images and maintains fidelity with respect to the original label on the other hand the addition of noise or changes in brightness may alter the original images too much thus degrading model performances rotation zooming in shifting cropping shearing and mosaic data augmentation may instead lead to the omission of some of the originals objects of interest in the new images forcing relabeling and partially nullifying the benefits of da shorten and khoshgoftaar 2019 while most studies 20 out of 34 papers applied da see table 1 only three studies have thoroughly evaluated the benefits of da with respect to training the same architecture on the original dataset van lieshout et al 2020 showed that model precision marginally raised from 59 4 to 63 4 when using flipping data augmentation methods lin et al 2021 also showed the model performances increased slightly when employing mosaic data augmentation musić et al 2020 used copy paste augmentation by superimposing computer generated macroplastic litter on realistic backgrounds however adding these images to the training dataset resulted in poorer prediction performances on the real world dataset thus researchers should discuss the benefits of different da method for macroplastic litter detection models in more depth 3 5 generalization capability dl models for cv exploit spatial inductive biases and shared weights to recognize features and objects regardless of their position in the image battaglia et al 2018 while this favors generalization to unseen data good detection performances at a single location or for similar environmental conditions do not guarantee that the model can be successfully applied or transferred to other situations and case studies achieving satisfactory out of domain generalization capability is a prerequisite for deploying large scale monitoring strategies based on dl especially with respect to transferability across different bodies of water locations and device setups we identify four different forms of out of domain generalization capability in the reviewed papers 1 geographical generalization capability 2 environmental generalization capability 3 non aquatic generalization capability and 4 device setup generalization capability geographical generalization capability represents the generalization capability of the model at different locations under roughly the same environmental conditions such as weather presence of waves wind conditions and terrain shading environmental generalization capability refers model testing in different environmental conditions non aquatic generalization capability involves models trained with data from non aquatic environments and tested on aquatic environments or vice versa lastly device setup generalization capability represents the generalization capability for different device setups such as the flight altitude of uavs or the setting angle between a fixed camera and the water surface despite the importance of generalization only few studies 9 out of 34 papers directly addressed these aspects with two studies fallati et al 2019 van lieshout et al 2020 considering two different forms of generalization capability see table 1 the majority of these 9 studies are with respect to geographical generalization capability 6 papers five papers fallati et al 2019 kako et al 2020 martin et al 2021 papakonstantinou et al 2021 van lieshout et al 2020 studied geographical generalization capability by training and testing on different case studies respectively for example papakonstantinou et al 2021 trained dl models on uav images captured from certain beaches and tested it on uav images collected from different beaches compared with geographical generalization capability there are less studies concerning non aquatic generalization capability 2 papers device setup generalization capability 2 papers and environmental generalization capability 1 paper for instance panwar et al 2020 trained a model on images of macroplastic litter gathered across streets and forests and tested it on images with macroplastic litter under the sea surface and on beaches song et al 2021 assessed device setup generalization capability by using a phone mounted on a tripod to collect training and test data from different heights at one beach fallati et al 2019 evaluated environmental generalization capability by collecting training and test data at different time of the day the authors also used a uav to collect training and test data at different beaches to assess the geographical generalization capability of the model among the 9 papers addressing generalization capability 4 papers battula et al 2020 kako et al 2020 panwar et al 2020 song et al 2021 did not discuss the performances of dl models trained and tested in different conditions only 1 paper papakonstantinou et al 2021 reported promising geographical generalization capability with a precision metric of 83 the models in the remaining studies did not show satisfactory generalization performances when tested for different geographical environmental or device setup conditions with reported precision between 20 and 63 8 for example van lieshout et al 2020 showed that the performances of a trained model working reasonably well for one location deteriorated quickly for an unseen location with a decrease in precision from 68 7 to 54 these new images featured substantially more organic material e g leaves and branches than those used for training the presence of organic material unaccounted for during training thus hindered robust detection of floating macroplastic litter the authors also showed that the generalization performances increased when including images from different locations in the training dataset in general we believe the community should increase efforts to develop dl models with robust generalization that can operate well across different conditions 3 6 performance evaluation the metric column of table 1 reports the performance metrics used by the authors when these reflect common options used for cv padilla et al 2020 wambugu et al 2021 and are unambiguous for ic tasks the majority of studies used the overall accuracy oa metric 9 out of 11 papers to evaluate performances over all classes precision 6 papers recall 7 papers and f1 score 6 papers were the most popular choices to evaluate performances for each class these metrics should be preferred for imbalanced datasets since oa misrepresents the minority classes for example wolf et al 2020 worked on an imbalanced dataset including 18 categories of objects although good average performance were reported for all classes oa 71 minority classes such as carton 25 images in total were poorly detected f1 score 0 46 for binary od common metrics include recall 4 out of 8 papers precision 2 papers and f1 score 2 papers for multi class od the majority of studies employed average precision ap 8 out of 17 papers and mean average precision map 11 papers to assess performances for each class object and over all classes respectively the value of these metrics depends largely on the selected threshold for determining the intersection over union iou a number that quantifies the degree of overlap between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes with some exceptions deng et al 2021 panwar et al 2020 politikos et al 2021 putra and prabowo 2021 song et al 2021 watanabe et al 2019 xue et al 2021b these important thresholds are rarely reported in reviewed papers based on common benchmarks e g coco and pascal voc we recommend using a threshold iou 0 5 when estimating fluxes e g number of items across the river width per unit of time while higher thresholds e g up to 0 95 should be used to quantify mass concentrations e g hotspot areas for binary semantic segmentation tasks two studies kako et al 2020 mifdal et al 2021 used pixel accuracy metrics to assess performances on detecting macroplastic litter for multi class semantic segmentation tasks one paper jakovljevic et al 2020 used precision recall and f1 score metrics to evaluate performances for each class no papers reported results in terms of iou or mean iou which are the preferred metrics for semantic segmentation as they account for unbalanced datasets for multi class instance segmentation one paper deng et al 2021 employed map to evaluate performances over all classes the performance column of table 1 reports the test value of the most representative metric across all classes however since the proposed methodologies have been tested on different macroplastic datasets in disparate experimental settings a direct comparison is unfeasible more interestingly some papers report encouraging evidence on the effectiveness of dl methods with respect to accurate but time consuming sampling methods for instance de vries et al 2021 found a satisfactory correlation r2 0 7 between dl detected spatial concentrations of macroplastics on the sea surface and manta trawling ground truth observations song et al 2021 reported a small error 5 between the number of litter items on a beach yielded by actual counting and those detected by yolo v5 kako et al 2020 reported similar figures 5 for the volumetric difference of beached plastic debris between surveys and mlp based is these results suggest that using dl for automatic detection and quantification of macroplastic litter is a valid alternative to traditional sampling methodologies 4 knowledge gaps and future directions our review shows that the majority of reviewed papers focus on detecting macroplastic litter in marine environments while less attention is devoted to detecting freshwater macroplastic litter recent research indicated that most plastic debris leaking into the environment does not reach the oceans but instead accumulates in river systems tramoy et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2022a weideman et al 2020 resulting in damaged ecosystems blettler et al 2018 monitoring the source transport and sink points of riverine macroplastic litter is thus essential to quantify global macroplastic pollution transport and effectively reduce pollution van emmerik and schwarz 2020 therefore we advocate for greater efforts on applying dl to tackle riverine macroplastic pollution problems in the future based on the findings reported in section 3 we identify three major knowledge gaps regardless of the body of water 1 there is a lack of dl based detection models with robust generalization performances this includes models that can detect macroplastic litter for a certain water body for different geographical environmental device setup conditions as well as models that can generalize across different case studies e g waterway networks within a country 2 the current literature mainly focuses on quantifying the number of macroplastic items there is a lack of dl based methods for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots accurate quantification is essential to estimate pollution impacts devise targeted cleaning interventions and evaluate the success of mitigation efforts 3 stemming from the first two gaps we emphasize the lack of research to inform the design of structural monitoring strategies exploiting robust dl based quantification based on the above knowledge gaps we propose three future research directions to bridge the corresponding gaps these include i the development of a general dl model to detect macroplastic litter ii future dl based applications for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots and iii the development of dl based monitoring strategies while these knowledge gaps and research directions concern all bodies of water we underline their importance with respect to riverine ecosystems this consideration reflects their major role in transport and storage of macroplastic litter van emmerik et al 2022a as well as feasibility with respect to extensive monitoring of marine ecosystems 4 1 development of a general macroplastic litter detection model section 3 5 shows that despite some promising initial efforts research on the generalization capability of dl models for detecting macroplastic litter is insufficient most papers focus on detecting macroplastic litter on a specific case study but lack an in depth analysis on generalization besides review results show that the models proposed so far do not retain satisfactory performances under different geographical environmental or device setup conditions researchers should thus increase efforts to bridge this gap possibly by exploiting new trends in ml such as data centric ai and semi supervised machine learning as suggested in the following paragraphs 4 1 1 data centric artificial intelligence regardless of the cv task our review shows that several known model architectures perform reasonably well for detecting macroplastic litter in individual case studies further improvements can be obtained by resorting to the latest state of the art models such as vision transformers paul and chen 2022 or convnexts liu et al 2022b however we suggest that achieving higher generalization performances may require shifting the focus from model architectures to data this is the core idea behind the emerging field of data centric artificial intelligence ai which aims to improve model performances by training on cleaner and more informative datasets motamedi et al 2021 several studies have shown the benefits of employing these approaches for a wide variety of cv related industrial applications im et al 2021 tang et al 2021 zhou et al 2020b these approaches usually entail improving the quality of existing data by resorting to pre processing techniques systematic labeling and expert knowledge for instance sun glints on the surface of rivers can lead to the misclassification of floating objects jakovljevic et al 2020 some pre processing techniques such as contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization can dilute the effects of these unwanted reflections and boost model performances as shown already for applications in defect detection and eye tracking im et al 2021 singvi et al 2012 enforcing consistency in the labeling procedure can results in similar improvements jain et al 2021 manual labeling may introduce significant human error and bias in data which in turn may severely undermine model performances clear guidelines with illustrative examples and cross checking between multiple labelers strengthen the consistency of labeled data towards achieving reliable performances lavitas et al 2021 similar to what discussed in section 3 2 2 labels for dl based litter detection should reflect ospar categories wenneker and oosterbaan 2010 or plastic categories used in crowdwater van emmerik et al 2020 to facilitate their usage and allow for joining multiple sources to train models with better generalization performances the data centric approach also favors the collection of additional data from in situ experiments whenever possible in particular we suggest gathering more training images at various sampling locations under different environmental conditions van lieshout et al 2020 and extending the collection to different devices and instrumental settings for extensive monitoring applications e g river networks nation wide initiatives we also recommend collecting more data about rare and small items e g straws cups shoes strings and cords the choice of data gathering devices can refer to their characteristics reported in section 3 2 1 the monitoring aims and available resources the researchers should prevent privacy violation when using phones cameras or uavs to sample in a public location e g urban waterways researchers can resort some privacy preserving approaches in human and human activity recognition e g image style transformation and differential privacy jung 2020 alternatively researchers should resort to da techniques to increase the number of the images collected in the field review results show that most authors employ traditional augmentation techniques e g flipping transformation with few studies assessing the benefits of advanced augmentation techniques such as copy paste augmentation described in section 3 4 2 contrary to some traditional techniques this augmentation procedure does not change the original features of target macroplastic litter or omits objects in the newly generated images while musić et al 2020 did not report improved performances studies form other fields suggest substantial benefits for different cv tasks dwibedi et al 2017 ghiasi et al 2021 xu et al 2021 by following the data centric approach researchers can develop a large open dataset with carefully labeled images that can be used for model development pre training and fair benchmarking 4 1 2 semi supervised learning methods all reviewed studies employ supervised learning methods to detect macroplastic litter to achieve good generalization performances supervised learning requires large amount of labeled data obtained with substantial efforts professional knowledge and skills recently the ai researchers are increasing efforts to develop alternative methods based on semi supervised learning that greatly reduce the need of costly supervision misra and van der maaten 2020 this approach entails a preliminary step based on self supervised learning e g the process of learning meaningful representations from images via pretext tasks that do not require annotations after pre training the model is fine tuned for prediction on a specific downstream task which requires a limited amount of labelled data fig 6 shows an example of semi supervised learning for macroplastic litter detection adapted from noroozi and favaro 2016 firstly we need to carefully label a few images and keep the remaining unlabeled these images are chosen to maximize the informative content of the labeled dataset e g images with good representations of different macroplastic litter different sampling locations and different environmental conditions next a cnn is trained on a large number of unlabeled images by solving the jigsaw puzzle problem as a pretext task in the jigsaw task we randomly crop a window red dashed box in fig 6 from an image divide it into a 3 3 grid and randomly select a tile yellow dashed box in each cell these tiles numbered from 1 to 9 are reordered by a randomly selected permutation e g 9 8 7 6 1 2 3 4 5 from a predefined permutation set the training dataset for the pretext task is generated by retaining a subset of all potential permutations e g 100 for each image the pretext task entails reconstructing the original image from its permutations after training the representations of unlabeled data learned by the cnn are transferred to the downstream task i e macroplastic litter detection by fine tuning the cnn via supervised learning on a limited number of carefully labeled images semi supervised learning can be a better alternative to supervised learning methods because of the lower cost of annotating data and the competitive model performances 4 2 quantification of riverine macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots our review shows that the current literature mainly focuses on detecting macroplastic litter in water and only few studies link dl based detection to the quantification of macroplastic litter mainly with respect to the number of macroplastic items only one study van lieshout et al 2020 quantifies the floating macroplastic fluxes and no studies quantifies the extension of floating macroplastic hotspots although stakeholders require this information to design cleaning campaigns and mitigate the impact of pollution on the environment and human health tasseron et al 2020 van emmerik et al 2018 considering the significance of riverine macroplastic pollution future studies should focus on the development of new methods for quantifying macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots in riverine environments 1 macroplastic mass fluxes macroplastic fluxes and mass fluxes can be expressed as the number and the mass of macroplastic items across the river width per unit of time respectively van emmerik et al 2018 to quantify them we recommend gathering images by installing fixed cameras on hydraulic infrastructures e g bridges at various locations along the river or river network and train the dl model on these images performing od tasks can precisely quantify the number of items by detecting each item in images with a bounding box see fig 4 the latest versions of yolo networks e g yolo v7 wang et al 2022 are the most promising architectures to detect litter fast and accurately then a limited number of experiments must be conducted by i sampling litter using nets ii counting the number of samples and iii weighing them the sampled average densities can be computed by dividing the weight of litter by the number of items in experiments finally we can predict the number of riverine litter on tested area and then post process the results to compute the fluxes by dividing by the recording time van lieshout et al 2020 mass fluxes can be obtained by multiplying fluxes with respect to sampled average densities van emmerik et al 2018 2 mass of macroplastic litter in hotspots macroplastic hotspots are locations where a large amount of macroplastic litter accumulates on the water surface due to favorable morphological and environmental conditions moy et al 2018 we suggest collecting hotspot images at various locations along rivers using uavs that can provide an overview of pollution with low human labor costs and high resolution images vriend et al 2020 and train the dl model on these images studies from other fields suggest dl based semantic segmentation methods can precisely quantify the area of target objects kang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a thus we believe that semantic segmentation can provide reliable estimations of the area occupied by hotspots next limited experiments are needed to i collect hotspot images and measure the true area of them ii sample litter in these hotspots e g using nets and iii weigh litter the spatial average densities of hotspots can be computed by dividing the weight of the litter by the true area occupied by them after accounting for image resolution e g pixel to area ratio the mass of macroplastic litter in hotspots can be obtained by multiplying the pixels identified as hotspots by the is algorithm by the spatial average densities 4 3 dl based monitoring of riverine macroplastic litter monitoring the source transport distribution sink points and trends of riverine macroplastic litter is essential for decision makers to devise mitigation strategies and conduct targeted cleaning campaigns van emmerik et al 2022b vriend et al 2020 designing effective monitoring strategies helps implement these activities more efficiently nonetheless the review shows that no papers in the literature considered the design and implementation of structural monitoring strategies exploiting dl based quantification to devise automated strategies for long term monitoring of riverine macroplastic litter we propose integrating robust dl based macroplastic litter quantification in the roadmap proposed by van emmerik et al 2022b the roadmap consists of three steps or levels i method development ii baseline assessment and iii long term monitoring the first step focuses on assessing available monitoring techniques and methodologies in order to lay the foundations for developing a suitable strategy the second step aims at establishing baseline measurements to get a first estimate on the magnitude of the problem as well as providing insights for improving the monitoring protocol in the long run the latter step is concerned with the exploitation of structural monitoring for higher level tasks such as inferring trends estimating the effects of policy changes on the level of pollution or mapping transport pathways while these steps are sequential the roadmap is a cyclical approach for continuous improvement of structural monitoring via incorporation of new insights monitoring goals priorities and data this iterative design can be successfully mapped to the continuous integration continuous deployment process implemented for ml based solution which is known as machine learning operations mlops ruf et al 2021 mlops enables long term utilization and refinement of ml based solutions by automating all key phases such as data management model deployment and model validation the integration of mlops into the roadmap of van emmerik et al 2022b could results in the following steps leading to dl based structural monitoring of macroplastic litter the first step could include the selection of dl tasks e g ic od and is dl architectures e g yolo and monitoring devices e g cameras and drones for the specific problem in the second step the mlops infrastructure could be initially deployed on selected pilot projects to train baseline dl models and validate their performance this will require systematic data gathering and ground truth measurements e g visual inspection of recordings comparison against visual counting and sampling litter distributions from clean up initiatives after establishing a satisfactory baseline long term monitoring on the selected pilot study ies can start concurrently the infrastructure can be strategically extended employing the baseline dl models for monitoring at new locations following the data centric ai approach see section 4 1 1 we can add novel accurately labeled images at these new or existing locations to improve the generalization capability of the baseline models this could also include adding litter categories of interests underrepresented in the training dataset or performing tailored ground truth validation for more accurate quantification as witnessed in other fields of application ruf et al 2021 we believe several iterations of the proposed mlops approach may lead to robust and automated structural monitoring of macroplastic litter 5 conclusions this paper reviewed the current research concerning deep learning dl based detection of macroplastic litter in water bodies and proposed key knowledge gaps and future directions the following knowledge gaps were identified based on the critical review and discussion of 34 reviewed papers 1 the lack of dl models with satisfactory generalization capability that are able to detect macroplastic litter in a given water body in a robust manner under different geographical environmental and device setup conditions 2 in terms of applications there is a lack of dl based methods for the quantification of macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots 3 no reviewed papers perform the design of structural monitoring strategies exploiting robust dl based quantification to address above gaps the following research directions are suggested 1 future research is required to develop a robust dl model that has better generalization capabilities i e that is able to detect macroplastic litter in a more reliable and consistent manner irrespective of geographical environmental and other conditions this can be done by exploiting new methods in machine learning such as data centric artificial intelligence ai methods and semi supervised machine learning 2 more efforts should go into developing better methods for quantifying macroplastic mass fluxes and hotspots we identify potential methods of quantifying the macroplastic mass fluxes by performing object detection tasks and quantifying the mass of macroplastic litter in hotspots by conducting semantic segmentation tasks 3 the community should focus on developing and validating automated dl based quantification for structural monitoring of macroplastic litter we propose to approach this important task by integrating mlops technologies in the general framework for long term monitoring proposed by van emmerik et al 2022b while the identified gaps and suggested research directions concern all bodies of water we highlight their importance with respect to riverine ecosystems which are currently understudied despite their major role in transport and storage of litter this review has the following limitations 1 comparing the performances across different studies was difficult since models are evaluated on different dataset and results are reported with different metrics 2 the code and data used in most studies are not open to the public therefore we could not perform basic checks on their quality and 3 this work considered only peer reviewed journal papers and conference proceedings as such we did not take into account project reports or other type of publications e g project blogs conference abstracts which may present interesting results concerning the application in the field of reviewed or other dl models we expect dl to be a promising method to advance automatic detection of macroplastic litter in all bodies of water this is an emerging research field that requires more efforts including multidisciplinary research

15074,microbial extracellular electron transfer eet plays a crucial role in bioenergy production and resource recovery from wastewater interdisciplinary efforts have been made to unveil eet processes at various spatial scales from nanowires to microbial aggregates electrical conductivity has been frequently measured as an indicator of eet efficiency in this review the conductivity of nanowires biofilms and granular sludge was summarized and factors including subjects measurement methods and conducting conditions that affect the conductivity difference were discussed in detail the high conductivity of nanowires does not necessarily result in efficient eet in microbial aggregates due to the existence of non conductive substances and contact resistance improving the conductivity measurement of microbial aggregates is important because it enables the calculation of an eet flux from conductivity and a comparison of the flux with mass transfer coefficients this review provides new insight into the significance characterization and optimization of eet in microbial aggregates during a wastewater treatment process keywords extracellular electron transfer conductivity nanowires biofilms granular sludge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extracellular electron transfer eet is a common process between electroactive microbes eams and extracellular substrates or partners where the electrons are exchanged moscoviz et al 2020 rabaey and rozendal 2010 the process of eet is of great significance for both ecosystems as it drives the biogeochemical cycles of essential elements lovley and holmes 2022 marsili et al 2008 tremblay et al 2017 and sustainable waste treatment as it can facilitate bioremediation and bioenergy recovery hernandeza and newman 2001 malvankar et al 2015 reported progresses included but were not limited to methane production while methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge bioreactors exchanged electrons with exoelectrogens directly rather than hydrogen or formate direct interspecies electron transfer diet rotaru et al 2014 electricity generation of eams from organic compounds by employing microbial electrochemical systems mess logan et al 2006 and value added bio refinery products such as alcohols medium chain and long chain fatty acids kumar et al 2018 moscoviz et al 2016 a profound understanding of eet mechanisms in microbial aggregates is necessary and will promote their application in biochemical wastewater treatment and energy recovery two ways for eams to perform eet have been identified indirect electron transfer pathways mediated by exogenous or endogenous electron shuttles e g quinones neutral red riboflavins humic acids vesicles extracellular dna etc hernandeza and newman 2001 liu et al 2020b marsili et al 2008 mckinlay and zeikus 2004 myers and myers 2004 newman and kolter 2000 park and zeikus 2000 saunders et al 2020 and direct electron transfer pathways mediated by redox proteins and nanowires anchored on the cell surface kracke et al 2015 rabaey and rozendal 2010 reguera et al 2005 fig 1 a intensive research has been performed to study the direct electron transfer of eet diverse redox proteins were recognized as mediators in this process shi et al 2016 typically multiheme c type cytochromes c cyts cyma fcca mtra mtrc omca in shewanella oneidensis fig 1b and omcs omcz and omcb in geobacter sulfurreducens fig 1c kim et al 2005 leang et al 2003 liu et al 2021b mehta et al 2006 myers and myers 2004 gorby et al 2006 other studies revealed that long distance eet mostly depended on the electrically conductive filaments of eams malvankar and lovley 2014 such as pilin based structure in g sulfurreducens nanowires fig 1c malvankar et al 2015 reguera et al 2005 and extensions of outer membranes and periplasms in s oneidensis mr 1 nanowires fig 1b pirbadian et al 2014 two mechanisms for electron transport through nanowires or redox proteins have been proposed one is metallic like conductivity malvankar et al 2011 in which electrons do not localize on a single molecule but move along the chain fluently edwards et al 2008 conductive g sulfurreducens nanowire networks led to an elevated conductivity of g sulfurreducens biofilms on electrodes and the conductivity decreased with temperature which resembles the conductive characteristics of metal materials malvankar et al 2011 the other mechanism is electron hopping in which electrons hop from a reduced molecule to a neighboring oxidized molecule mccreery 2004 it is common for biofilms with s oneidensis multiheme cytochromes chains pirbadian and el naggar 2012 long distance eet was also reported for microbes other than g sulfurreducens and s oneidensis in a microbial fuel cell mfc study lysinibacillus varians gy32 a filamentous unicellular gram positive bacterium was found to weave its nanowires into a conductive network on the electrode surface with a cell length up to 1 08 mm yang et al 2021 cyanobacteria a group of photosynthetic bacteria lived on water electrolysis in biological photovoltaic cells and transferred electrons through nanowires mccormick et al 2015 cable bacteria a new group of multicellular microbes with a maximum length of 5 cm generates electrical currents across centimeter scale distances by forming long filaments consisting of unbranched chains of cells meysman 2018 fig 1d the diversity of electroactive bacteria and nanowires results in multiple possibilities of eet pathways numerous efforts including electrode material modification and microbial engineering have been made to enhance the performance of eet some specific functional groups such as aryldiazonium cations iannaci et al 2020 and dna furst et al 2018 immobilized on electrode surfaces can significantly improve the interaction between microbes and electrodes modifying cell surfaces with synthetic curli by microbial engineering is also an effective way to improve cell adhesion suo et al 2019 these strategies are beneficial for eet performance but can be limited to eet process optimization at the single cell level however eet in microbial aggregates is more complicated than in redox proteins or nanowires due to the aggregates diverse microbial community and complex structure this review focuses on eet characterization methods for nanowires and two typical microbial aggregates biofilms and granular sludge among various measures conductivity measured by electrochemical method is the most frequently selected for assessing eet processes however it is important to note that by determining the conductivity a particular eet process which is electron transfer between cells outer membranes and extracellular electron carriers e g mineral and electrode is measured lovley 2008 lovley and holmes 2022 shi et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 many studies measured the conductivity of nanowires and aggregates but the measurement results have yet to be fully compiled compared and analyzed this review effort aimed to fill this gap through a thorough analysis of existing data a significant variability in conductivity was found from nanowires to biofilms to granular sludge and even within each subject category 2 methods for characterizing eet processes the process of eet greatly depends on the structure and electrochemical characteristics of redox proteins or shuttles involved in nanowires and aggregates the characterization methods of eet processes can be divided into indirect e g spectroscopy microscopy and molecular biology and direct methods electrochemical measurements 2 1 spectroscopy microscopy and molecular biology methods various instruments have been employed to examine spectroscopy microscopy and molecular biology properties of electron mediators during eet fig 2 uv vis spectroscopy was applied to study the redox state of cytochromes in s loihica pv 4 based on the high absorption coefficient of heme in cytochromes nakamura et al 2009 raman spectroscopy was employed to identify special cytochromes as a characteristic peak in the spectra was correlated to the relative content of the cytochromes according to the peak area with the specific excitation wavelength heidary et al 2020 synchrotron x ray microdiffraction and rocking curve x ray diffraction were employed to observe the tight arrangement of aromatic amino acids in g sulfurreducens nanowires malvankar et al 2015 microscopy has also been a useful tool for visualizing nanowires and their activity ambient electrostatic force microscopy efm and atomic force microscopy afm are two known instruments whose probes can serve as force sensors to map the topography of nanowires it was reported that charge propagation along individual g sulfurreducens nanowires was observed using efm malvankar et al 2014 molecular biology analyses such as genome editing or sequencing were used to study the electrochemical activity of key proteins expressed by electroactive bacteria involved in eet gu et al 2021 comparing the reduction capacity of a wild type with a mutant xiao et al revealed a dynamic role of cyma in s oneidensis mr 1 centered eet processes which was significantly weakened under slow extracellular electron release conditions xiao et al 2023 although these methods significantly perfound our understanding of eet mechanisms a quantitative assessment of eet effiency rate has to date predorminately relied on electrochemical methods an advanced real time microscopic characterization of eet developed from traditional microscopic imaging was recently carried out to investigate the mechanism of eet fig 2 the membrane of s oneidensis mr 1 was labeled with fluorescent cationic dyes thioflavin t and the fluorescence intensity changed with the potential which was considered strongly correlates with eet pirbadian et al 2020 this measurement was particularly advantageous with a high spatiotemporal resolution to study the dynamics of eet on the electrode surface or during the respiration of other solid phase electron acceptors pirbadian et al 2020 besides some researchers have noticed that s oneidensis mr 1 has a unique structural dispersion pattern which would change with the redox state of the outer membrane cytochrome complex when a ray of white light is incident and thus employed structural color microscopy to examine the ongoing status of eet at the nondestructive subcellular scale xia et al 2021 lately the cytochromes on individual s oneidensis living cells were visualized by applying quantum dot labeling total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and single particle tracking chong et al 2022 a quantitative study of the cytochromes lateral diffusive dynamics was conducted to unveil the impact of diffusion on eet 2 2 electrochemical measurement characterizing the electrochemical activity of redox proteins or nanowires is important but uncovering the eet process within microbial aggregate needs additional techniques electrochemical measurement methods such as cyclic voltammetry cv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis chronoamperometry ca and linear sweep voltammetry lsv can reveal and quantify changes in redox proteins the normalized potential of peaks in cv curves suggested that the cytochromes omcb omcz and omcs were involved with eet in electrochemically active biofilms richter et al 2009 chronoamperometry and square wave voltammetry swv were employed along with in situ fluorescence microscopy to monitor the real time s oneidensis mr 1 anodic process the current was found mostly generated by the inner biofilm close to the electrode surface while the eet between the outer biofilm and electrode was very weak zhang et al 2021 among those metrics for evaluating the eet performance of different microbial aggregates conductivity is a key metric that can be measured through a well established methodology and can be employed to indicate and compare their eet ability the i v curve or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis combined with an equivalent circuit can be used to calculate electron transfer resistance in nanowires or aggregates kretzschmar and harnisch 2021 then the resistance can be transformed into conductivity which describes the electron transfer resistance per unit distance according to the subjects morphology parameters and electrode structure parameters conductivity is a more convenient metric for evaluating and comparing eet ability between different subjects to discover the most effective eet mechanism however for different subjects different conductivity measurement methods and devices may apply the conductivity of nanowires was determined by conductive probe atomic force microscopy cp afm via a conductive tip and gold electrodes fig 3 a reguera et al 2005 the conductivity of aggregates was tested on special electrodes like split electrodes or interdigitated microelectrode arrays idas for microbes naturally or artificially attaching to the electrode fig 3a malvankar et al 2011 snider et al 2012 summers et al 2010 a summary of measured conductivity of nanowire biofilm and granular sludge from 42 previous studies was presented in fig 3b the conductivity of nanowires ranges from 10 to 108 μs cm with a maximum value of 9 77 108 μs cm tan et al 2016a fig 3b the conductivity of the biofilm ranges from 10 to 103 μs cm and the maximum value is 5000 μs cm of g sulfurreducens kn400 strain malvankar et al 2012a fig 3b the conductivity of granular sludge ranges from 1 to 30 μs cm and the maximum is 36 7 μs cm shrestha et al 2014 fig 3b the conductivity of different subjects spans a range of more than 6 orders of magnitude even for the same subject the measurement results also vary greatly from each other for example the conductivity of biofilm varies by 3 orders of magnitude this may be attributed to various factors such as methods and experimental conditions the enormous variability in the reported conductivities among studies greatly restrained the understanding of eet performance subsequently studies on conductivity of nanowires and microbial aggregates biofilm and granular sludge were discussed including measurement methods results and relative factors 3 conductivity of nanowires 3 1 analytic methods the conductivity of a nanowire is normally measured by employing cp afm with a voltage applied across the sample andolfi and cannistraro 2005 by maintaining a constant force on the tip the topography and current images can be recorded simultaneously so that the conductive properties can be related to the morphology of the sample investigated fig 4 a andolfi and cannistraro 2005 when the conductivity of an individual nanowire with a diameter from 2 5 to 4 nm was measured using cp afm a highly responsive current up to 8 na along the nanowire was generated reguera et al 2005 and the conductivity σ μs cm was calculated as el naggar et al 2010 1 σ g l a where g μs is the conductance value from the linear fit of the current a voltage v curve l cm is the length of the wire between two probes and a cm2 is the cross section area of the nanowire 3 2 experimental data and extrinsic factors among nanowires of various microbes e g rhodopseudomonas palustris venkidusamy et al 2015 s oneidensis el naggar et al 2010 escherichia coli shapiro et al 2022 desulfovibrio ferrophilus liang et al 2021 syntrophus aciditrophicus walker et al 2020 and methanospirillum hungatei poweleit et al 2016 the nanowire of g sulfurreducens was of particular interest as for eet research adhikari et al 2016 gu et al 2021 liu et al 2021b tan et al 2016a tan et al 2016b tan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yalcin et al 2020 it was also noticeable that the nanowires of different microbes exhibit a broad range of conductivity from 102 to 108 μs cm again this may be attributed to the nanowire s protein structures and test conditions a rich content of aromatic amino acids in nanowire s protein components was recognized as a major contributor to the high conductivity of nanowire through the development of π π stacking that facilitates the electron transport vargas et al 2013 as evidence in an artificially cultivated strain of g sulfurreducens aro 5 mutant with aromatic amino acids replaced by alanine the conductivity of its nanowires decreased by 10 vargas et al 2013 besides aromatic amino acids the density of aromatic residues in the nanowire s protein content also positively affected its conductivity previous research found a much higher density of aromatic residues in nanowire s protein contents of g metallireducens 0 155 than that of g uranireducens 0 065 and used it to explain the higher conductivity of g metallireducens nanowires by 6 orders of magnitude than g uranireducens nanowires tan et al 2017 a further investigation on different types of aromatic amino acids revealed their influence on nanowire s conductivity promoting tryptophan expression led to a 2000 fold increase in the conductivity of g sulfurreducens nanowires tan et al 2016a phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan introduced to e coli nanowires resulted in a 10 fold 18 fold and 84 fold increase in its conductivity respectively shapiro et al 2022 a recent study investigated two categories of c type cytochromes assembled nanowires i e omcs and omcz fig 4b their contents in the nanowires were highly correlated with the nanowires conductivity wang et al 2019 specifically the conductivity of omcz nanowires was 3 107 μs cm 1000 times higher than that of omcs nanowires fig 4c yalcin et al 2020 a comparison of edge to edge heme heme distances showed that omcs has only two heme pairs within π π stacking distance 3 5 4 å whereas omcz has five heme pairs fig 4b yalcin et al 2020 besides the β sheet in the secondary structure of purified omcz nanowires a more conductive form was 7 fold more abundant than omcs nanowires yalcin et al 2020 as a test condition parameter ph was found to significantly affect the conductivity of nanowires decreasing ph from 7 to 2 caused a large increase in the conductivity of both omcs and omcz nanowires by 100 times yalcin et al 2020 because of protein conformational changes into a β sheet rich structure enhancing π π stacking between hemes and thereby yielding a longer mean free path for electrons for high conductivity fig 4d yalcin and malvankar 2020 given the importance of nanowires in microbial eet processes scientists have proactively looked into nanowires structure and associated genes in the past two decades in 2005 reguera et al firstly found that the electrically conductive pili e pili of g sulfurreducens are type iv pili made of pila monomer reguera et al 2005 and for a long time most researchers believed that the nanowire of g sulfurreducens was expressed by pila gene however a few questions remain unanswered for example deleting the pila gene resulted in no existence of nanowires or conductivity of the biofilm richter et al 2012 with precision instruments probing the fine structure of proteins such as cryo electron microscopy cryo em recent studies found that the nanowire of g sulfurreducens consists of stacked multiheme cytochromes wang et al 2019 and the nanowire composed of the pila monomer is not conductive but affects the formation of omcs and omcz nanowires the fact is that g sulfurreducens binds pila n to pila c to assemble heterodimeric pili which can promote the secretion of omcs and omcz nanowires gu et al 2021 fig 4e the conductivity of pila n c heterodimeric pili is 20 times lower than that of omcs nanowires fig 4f gu et al 2021 therefore different eet mechanisms of nanowires will lead to significant variability in the nanowires conductivity which further extends their effects to microbial aggregates many previous studies observed that the conductivity of microbial aggregates is surprisingly reduced from that of nanowires a calculation based on the data used in fig 3 shows that the average reported conductivity of biofilm is 5 61 102 μs cm followed by granular sludge 9 34 μs cm both far lower than that of nanowires 6 76 107 μs cm a recent study revealed that this decline even initiated once after the nanowire networks formed where the measured conductivity of nanowire networks was found merely 0 109 μs cm enormously lowered from that of an individual nanowire 510 μs cm shapiro et al 2022 however this modification suggests that the gap resistance between disordered nanowires when nanowire networks form cannot be neglected as it leads to decreased conductivity 4 conductivity of microbial aggregates a similar situation would arise in microbial aggregates such as biofilms and granular sludge where eet process needs to overcome the large resistance in nanowire networks as well in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps as essential components of aggregates have been confirmed to impact eet in both positive and negative ways zhu et al 2022 it was reported that the proteins in eps is beneficial for eet xiao and zhao 2017 zhou et al 2020 but non electroactive exopolysaccharides accounting for a great share in eps can be inhibitory this section discusses the measurement methods and influence factors of conductivity of biofilms and granular sludge 4 1 conductivity of biofilm as a biofilm containing electroactive microbes can naturally attach to a solid surface its conductivity is normally measured through electrochemical methods by growing on idas or split electrodes and exchanging electrons with them fig 5 a plenty of experiments were employed to measure the conductivity of biofilm and evaluate biofilm s eet ability the reported results span a wide range from 10 to 103 μs cm fig 3 three important factors leading to the large variability are electrode designs measuring methods and microbe status in biofilms a detailed analysis of each factor is provided in the following sections 4 1 1 effects of electrode designs on biofilm conductivity similar to nanowires the conductivity of biofilms can be calculated as yates et al 2016 2 σ s v s d i s d where i sd a is the source drain current s is the electrode configuration geometric factor dependent on length and width of the electrodes length and width of the gap separating the electrodes and thickness of the biofilm and v sd v is bias voltage between the source and drain electrodes for ida and split electrodes different equations are available for s calculation after combing them with eq 2 the conductivity can be calculated with eq 3 for idas yates et al 2016 and eq 4 for split electrodes malvankar et al 2011 3 σ g π l ln 4 b a 4 σ g π l ln 8 g π a where g μs is the conductance value from the linear fit of the current voltage curve g μm is the biofilm thickness l cm is the length of the gap in the electrode a cm is the half width of the gap and b cm is the distance from the center of a gap to the center of the adjacent electrode band due to the different parameters of these two types of electrodes including gap distance electrode surface area and the number of electrode pairs the results derived from different types of electrodes may vary as fig 5a shows idas are a variation of the double band electrode configuration with a longer electrode smaller electrode surface area and narrower gap width usually 5 μm while split electrodes are two shorter and larger electrodes separated by a wider gap 5 μm yates et al 2016 however the influence of the type of electrodes is minimal fig 5b the gap width of split electrodes has an even more significant impact conductivity of g sulfurreducencs biofilms was reported to increase with the electrode gap width fig 5c d liu et al 2020a a possible reason is that a wider electrode gap might stimulate the production of nanowires or cytochromes in biofilms to achieve long distance eet malvankar et al 2012b which artificially raises the conductivity 4 1 2 effects of measurement methods on biofilm conductivity two methods have been used to measure the conductivity of biofilm constant current voltage methods and electrochemical gating measurement egm performing constant current voltage measurement is convenient it merely requires a constant stimulating voltage v sd applied across the source and drain electrode fig 6 a with a recorded response current i sd between the source and drain the conductivity of biofilms was determined as i sd v sd this method does not control the potential of electrodes that may influence the electroactivity of microbes in contrast the egm applied different potentials on the source or drain electrode to establish a potential difference between them so that the redox activity of proteins in a biofilm can correspond to the plots of the curve under different electrode potentials representing the conducting ability of microbial aggregates two types of egm were performed by applying a certain potential only on the source electrode and a bias between the source and the drain electrode single electrode controlled egm or applying two different potentials both on the source and drain electrode double electrodes controlled egm fig 6b and c it is essential that an applied voltage is involved in performing both constant current voltage and single electrode controlled egm leading to a significant effect that background current will be inevitably generated while electrons are transferred during an eet process yates et al 2016 taking the background current into account the electron transport by eet is overestimated this well explains a fact arose after an investigation of reported biofilm conductivities measured by different methods fig 6d that results with constant current voltage and single electrode controlled egm 10 103 μs cm were mostly higher than that with double electrodes controlled egm 5 to 22 4 μs cm 4 1 2 effects of biofilm status on conductivity the conductivity of biofilm can be measured with or without carbon source turnover and nonturnover respectively carbon source is the most important component in medium because it determines the metabolic activity of microbes further influents their electrochamical activity an investigation among the reported results in those studies revealed that turnover condition led to higher result than nonturnover condition in which all substance were exhausted fig 7 metabolic biofilms with substrate can produce electron shuttles which faciltate electron transfer within biofilms and lead to the high conductivity ding et al 2016 in order to achieve the non turnover condition part of soluable electron meditors would be lost and led to the decrease in biofilm conductivity additionlly the production of metbaolic current might be obscure isd which also could led the high conductanc of biofilm with metabolism of substrate yates et al 2016 specifically the conductivity of pure cultured g sulferreducens biofilms growing on an ida electrode was measured with a gap width of 5 μm a higher conductivity value was obtained 9 μs cm under turnover than nonturnover 5 25 μs cm conditions for mixed cultured biofilm higher conductivity was still with turnover condition 9 5 μs cm than nonturnover 7 5 μs cm fig 7 yates et al 2018 yates et al 2015 other researchers repeatly measured the conductivity of pure cultured g sulferreducens biofilm on a split electrode with a gap width of 5 μm and found very similar results to the former study mentioned higher under turnover condition as well fig 7 liu et al 2020a a possible reason is that the interaction between microorganisms improves the electrical activity of the mixed biofilm besides the factors discussed above a biofilm s conductivity may also be affected by its thickness hussain et al 2021 buffer concentration dhar et al 2017 and growth phase of biofilm li et al 2018 with an increased average geobacter biofilm thickness from 19 to 45 μm the biofilm s conductivity significantly increased from 630 to 1430 μs cm hussain et al 2021 a study measured the conductivity under different pbs concentrations 100 50 and 2 5 mm and found that the geobacter enriched biofilm s conductivity reduced with decreased buffer concentration this was considered a result of the inhibited metabolism activity of microbes caused by low buffer concentration dhar et al 2017 some researchers examined the conductivity of mixed species methanogenic biofilm in different metabolic phase fermentation methanogenic exoelectrogenic and determined that the conductivity would increase from 33 7 to 307 4 μs cm when the biofilm well developed into the exoelectrogenic period li et al 2018 4 2 conductivity of granular sludge like the biofilm granular sludge is a form of microbial aggregates that has been widely employed in wasterwater treatment a typical application of granular sludge is to faciliate the production of methane gas in uasb reactors through conductance network built by eams li et al 2020b the conductivity of granular sludge is a key indicator of the performence of diet within it which is measured by performing constant current voltage method with a split electrode fig 8 a an equation for calculating the conductivity is listed as 5 barua et al 2018 5 σ l r s where r ω is the resistance calculated from i sd a v sd v l cm is the width of non conductive gap between the two electrodes and s cm2 is the cross sectional area many previous studies measured the conductivity of granular sludge fig 8b indicating that most results were around 1 10 μs cm for non stimulated granular sludge stimulating diet in granular sludge is widely practiced to improve the conductivity with increased abundance of eams e g geobactoer fig 8b adding conductive materials and optimizing carbon sources are two effective methods to stimulate diet and a high conductivity is obtained fig 8b various conductive materials e g carbon cloth carbon fiber granular activated carbon gac biochar and nitrogen doped sludge carbon n sc were found capable of promoting diet barua et al 2018 lei et al 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 yan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2018 through those efforts the conductivity of granular sludge could reach a relatively high level fig 8b conductive materials enable an extra pathway for electron transfer that adds on insufficient electrically conductive extracellular appendages in granular sludge as well as provide high surface area for attaching more biomass resulting in increased conductivity of granular sludge providing carbon sources favored by eams also pose postive effects on the diet whithin granular sludge conductivity is positively correlated to the abundance of genus geobacter which prefer establishing diet by metabolising ethanol and microbes in the ethanol stimulated enrichments hold a great possibility to proceed diet fig 8b shrestha et al 2014 summers et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 it is noteworthy that the conductivity of granular sludge is much lower than that of biofilms mainly because of a larger interface resistance and calculation error during measurement for granular sludge the test granular sludge was collected from reactors and manually crushed with a cover glass to form a confluent film that spread across the nonconductive gap zhao et al 2016 this operation inevitably destroyed the inner structure of granular sludge and causes considerable interface resistance on the electrode leading to underestimates of the sludge s conductivity in contrast the biofilms about to be measured are naturally growing on the electrode with an electrode biofilm interface built by a high abundance of redox proteins which significantly decrease the interface resistance due to the granulate shape of sludge it is hard to ensure that every sample fills in the gap tightly while biofilm growth on the electrode can form a more smooth coverage without any crack which otherwise would result in a larger resistance in the gap in addition some studies only considered granular sludge at the gap and ignored granular sludge at the electrode interface when calculating conductivity jin et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 caizán juanaren et al measured the conductivity of 28 anaerobic granular sludge samples collected from full scale wastewater treatment reactors using a constant voltage method based on a gap electrode and for almost 80 of the samples their conductivity values were below 4 5 μs cm caizán juanarena et al 2020 in conclusion the conductivity of anaerobic granular sludge lacks sufficient and accurate determination and its significance needs further investigation 5 from conductivity to eet fluxes and a comparison with electron donor transfer based on accurate measurement of conductivity further application of it is a crucial issue interspecies electron transfer involves not only eet but also electron donor transfer edt e g hydrogen in microbial aggregates it is usually hoped to compare eet and edt models in the optimization of engineering regulation technology a previous modeling study compared eet with formate and hydrogen mediated interspecies electron transfer storck et al 2016 formate mediated interspecies electron transfer showed the fastest transfer rate however the result was derived under ideal conditions with several assumptions currently it is necessary to compare eet and edt through experiments the driving force of eet is potential gradients in microbial aggregates while edt is mainly driven by concentration gradient fig 9 thus two dynamics models of eet and edt in microbial aggregates can be established by ohm s law and fick s law the two dynamics equations are listed as 6 and 7 6 j eet σ f d u d l 7 j edt d m d c m d l where j eet e mol m2 s is electron transfer flux σ μs cm is conductivity f is the faraday s constant 96 485 c mol u is potential v l is the transfer distance j edt mol m2 s is electron donor transfer flux d m m2 s is mass transfer coefficient and c m mol is the concentration of electron donors the derivation of eq 6 is available in supplementary materials although conductivity is easy to measure it is difficult to directly compare conductivity with mass transfer coefficient due to their different dimensionality to address the dilemma a relationship between conductivity and electron transfer coefficient was established from the perspective of dynamics yates et al 2015 previous studies indicated that in microbial aggregates redox proteins are the carrier of electrons and the electron transfer can be modeled by electron hopping where the electron can hop from an oxidation coenzyme center to a reduction coenzyme center fig 9 strycharz glaven et al 2011 thus eq 6 can be restructured into eq 8 8 j eet σ f d u d l d e d c red d l d e d c ox d l where d e m2 s is electron diffusion coefficient c red mol and c ox mol are oxidation and reduction coenzyme concentrations respectively to obtain d e j eet is replaced by i sd the equation is as follow 9 i sd n f s d e d c red d l n f s d e d c ox d l where i sd a is source drain current n is the number of electron transfer f is the faraday s constant 96 485 c mol s m2 is the cross sectional area of biofilm on source drain electrode to avoid the measurement of redox coenzyme concentrations square wave voltammetry swv was used by a previous report saunders et al 2020 thus the electron diffusion coefficient can be calculated by eqs 10 and 11 10 i swv n f a d e π l p φ d c red d l n f a d e π l p φ d c ox d l 11 i sd i swv s π l p d e a φ where i swv a is swv peak current a is electrode area cm2 π is pi about 3 14 l p is the pulse width nm φ is a normalization constant according to ohm s law eqs 12 and 13 the relationship between conductivity and electron diffusion coefficient can be deduced as follow eq 9 12 i sd σ a v sd 13 d e σ 2 a 4 v sd φ 2 i swv s 2 π l p where σ μs cm is conductivity v sd v is the applied voltage between drain electrode and source electrode in brief the corresponding electron diffusion coefficient can be calculated by the obtained conductivity to realize the comparability between the electron transfer coefficient and mass transfer coefficient at the same microbial aggregates recently some researchers had calculated the diffusion coefficient of electron using the same method saunders et al 2020 the result indicated that the diffusion coefficient of electron ranged from 10 10 m2 s 10 9 m2 s in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms the electron transfer coefficient calculated by conductivity may be of practical significance in comparison with mass transfer coefficient this comparison is expected to provide valuable reference for the development of directional control technology in practical engineering 6 conclusions and outlook electrical conductivity is widely employed as an essential metric to evaluate eet performance this study reviews and analyzes existing knowledge about the conductivity of nanowires and microbial aggregates biofilm and granular sludge including measurement methodology experimental data and theories several key findings and notes are listed as follows against a misbelief nanowires and microbial aggregates have substantially different conductivity levels the conductivity of nanowires can be as high as 108 μs cm even close to that of metal materials although microbial aggregates in wastewater treatment may contain abundant nanowires they are not highly conductive the reasons for the relatively low conductivity of microbial aggregates include 1 they contain massive amounts of non conductive substances e g polysaccharides carriers etc li et al 2020a 2 the conductivity of nanowire networks in microbial aggregates formed via lap connections and others is far lower than that of individual nanowires shapiro et al 2022 thus the high conductivity of microscopic nanowires cannot be inferred as the high conductivity of macroscopic microbial aggregates and vice versa thus it is feasible to reduce the contact resistance and improve the interaction between microbes and electrodes through advanced material and microbial engineering technologies in the future several factors can cause a large variability in the measured conductivity of nanowires and microbial aggregates for nanowires biofilms and granular sludge the reported conductivity values vary greatly in the literature the conductivity measurement of nanowires has been significantly improved thanks to the advancement in instrumentation like afm the variation among the existing results is primarily caused by varying protein structures with microbes and the lack of precise ph control when performing the conductivity measurement however for microbial aggregates it is more difficult to accurately measure their conductivity and the physics behind is much more complicated the measurement methods and devices have a large influence and if not standardized can cause substantial variability in derived conductivity values microbial aggregates could exist and behave differently during a conductivity test than in an actual wastewater treatment process for example to test the conductivity of granular sludge a sample must be collected and manually pressed to fill the electrode gap s in an ida or split electrode changes in the sludge sample s physical properties e g morphology and porosity along with insufficient contact with the electrode can create measurement uncertainty and bias thus the test result may not truly reflect electron transfer characteristics in the granules future research should focus on method standardization for the in situ measurement of the conductivity of microbial aggregates due to the heterogeneous nature of microbial aggregates special attention should be paid to the uneven distribution of eet processes in both spatial and temporal domains a framework is proposed to enable the calculation of the eet flux in microbial aggregates from conductivity and a comparison with electron donor transfer the purpose of accurately measuring and regulating conductivity is to enhance eet in microbial aggregates thereby improving the efficiency of a biochemical wastewater treatment process a process similar to eet in microbial aggregates is the transfer of electron donors e g hydrogen the transfer of hydrogen also plays a critical role in methane production from anaerobic granular sludge it is important to compare the two transfer processes electrons and electron donors in the same microbial aggregate since they are closely coupled in a wastewater treatment process the comparison is enabled by deriving j eet extracellular electron diffusion flux from conductivity as described by eqs 8 13 the comparation between eet and edt determines which is the restrictive step of watstewater treatment leading to a clear orientation to regulatee its performance in the future declaration of competing interest all authors

15074,microbial extracellular electron transfer eet plays a crucial role in bioenergy production and resource recovery from wastewater interdisciplinary efforts have been made to unveil eet processes at various spatial scales from nanowires to microbial aggregates electrical conductivity has been frequently measured as an indicator of eet efficiency in this review the conductivity of nanowires biofilms and granular sludge was summarized and factors including subjects measurement methods and conducting conditions that affect the conductivity difference were discussed in detail the high conductivity of nanowires does not necessarily result in efficient eet in microbial aggregates due to the existence of non conductive substances and contact resistance improving the conductivity measurement of microbial aggregates is important because it enables the calculation of an eet flux from conductivity and a comparison of the flux with mass transfer coefficients this review provides new insight into the significance characterization and optimization of eet in microbial aggregates during a wastewater treatment process keywords extracellular electron transfer conductivity nanowires biofilms granular sludge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extracellular electron transfer eet is a common process between electroactive microbes eams and extracellular substrates or partners where the electrons are exchanged moscoviz et al 2020 rabaey and rozendal 2010 the process of eet is of great significance for both ecosystems as it drives the biogeochemical cycles of essential elements lovley and holmes 2022 marsili et al 2008 tremblay et al 2017 and sustainable waste treatment as it can facilitate bioremediation and bioenergy recovery hernandeza and newman 2001 malvankar et al 2015 reported progresses included but were not limited to methane production while methanogens in anaerobic granular sludge bioreactors exchanged electrons with exoelectrogens directly rather than hydrogen or formate direct interspecies electron transfer diet rotaru et al 2014 electricity generation of eams from organic compounds by employing microbial electrochemical systems mess logan et al 2006 and value added bio refinery products such as alcohols medium chain and long chain fatty acids kumar et al 2018 moscoviz et al 2016 a profound understanding of eet mechanisms in microbial aggregates is necessary and will promote their application in biochemical wastewater treatment and energy recovery two ways for eams to perform eet have been identified indirect electron transfer pathways mediated by exogenous or endogenous electron shuttles e g quinones neutral red riboflavins humic acids vesicles extracellular dna etc hernandeza and newman 2001 liu et al 2020b marsili et al 2008 mckinlay and zeikus 2004 myers and myers 2004 newman and kolter 2000 park and zeikus 2000 saunders et al 2020 and direct electron transfer pathways mediated by redox proteins and nanowires anchored on the cell surface kracke et al 2015 rabaey and rozendal 2010 reguera et al 2005 fig 1 a intensive research has been performed to study the direct electron transfer of eet diverse redox proteins were recognized as mediators in this process shi et al 2016 typically multiheme c type cytochromes c cyts cyma fcca mtra mtrc omca in shewanella oneidensis fig 1b and omcs omcz and omcb in geobacter sulfurreducens fig 1c kim et al 2005 leang et al 2003 liu et al 2021b mehta et al 2006 myers and myers 2004 gorby et al 2006 other studies revealed that long distance eet mostly depended on the electrically conductive filaments of eams malvankar and lovley 2014 such as pilin based structure in g sulfurreducens nanowires fig 1c malvankar et al 2015 reguera et al 2005 and extensions of outer membranes and periplasms in s oneidensis mr 1 nanowires fig 1b pirbadian et al 2014 two mechanisms for electron transport through nanowires or redox proteins have been proposed one is metallic like conductivity malvankar et al 2011 in which electrons do not localize on a single molecule but move along the chain fluently edwards et al 2008 conductive g sulfurreducens nanowire networks led to an elevated conductivity of g sulfurreducens biofilms on electrodes and the conductivity decreased with temperature which resembles the conductive characteristics of metal materials malvankar et al 2011 the other mechanism is electron hopping in which electrons hop from a reduced molecule to a neighboring oxidized molecule mccreery 2004 it is common for biofilms with s oneidensis multiheme cytochromes chains pirbadian and el naggar 2012 long distance eet was also reported for microbes other than g sulfurreducens and s oneidensis in a microbial fuel cell mfc study lysinibacillus varians gy32 a filamentous unicellular gram positive bacterium was found to weave its nanowires into a conductive network on the electrode surface with a cell length up to 1 08 mm yang et al 2021 cyanobacteria a group of photosynthetic bacteria lived on water electrolysis in biological photovoltaic cells and transferred electrons through nanowires mccormick et al 2015 cable bacteria a new group of multicellular microbes with a maximum length of 5 cm generates electrical currents across centimeter scale distances by forming long filaments consisting of unbranched chains of cells meysman 2018 fig 1d the diversity of electroactive bacteria and nanowires results in multiple possibilities of eet pathways numerous efforts including electrode material modification and microbial engineering have been made to enhance the performance of eet some specific functional groups such as aryldiazonium cations iannaci et al 2020 and dna furst et al 2018 immobilized on electrode surfaces can significantly improve the interaction between microbes and electrodes modifying cell surfaces with synthetic curli by microbial engineering is also an effective way to improve cell adhesion suo et al 2019 these strategies are beneficial for eet performance but can be limited to eet process optimization at the single cell level however eet in microbial aggregates is more complicated than in redox proteins or nanowires due to the aggregates diverse microbial community and complex structure this review focuses on eet characterization methods for nanowires and two typical microbial aggregates biofilms and granular sludge among various measures conductivity measured by electrochemical method is the most frequently selected for assessing eet processes however it is important to note that by determining the conductivity a particular eet process which is electron transfer between cells outer membranes and extracellular electron carriers e g mineral and electrode is measured lovley 2008 lovley and holmes 2022 shi et al 2016 yuan et al 2021 many studies measured the conductivity of nanowires and aggregates but the measurement results have yet to be fully compiled compared and analyzed this review effort aimed to fill this gap through a thorough analysis of existing data a significant variability in conductivity was found from nanowires to biofilms to granular sludge and even within each subject category 2 methods for characterizing eet processes the process of eet greatly depends on the structure and electrochemical characteristics of redox proteins or shuttles involved in nanowires and aggregates the characterization methods of eet processes can be divided into indirect e g spectroscopy microscopy and molecular biology and direct methods electrochemical measurements 2 1 spectroscopy microscopy and molecular biology methods various instruments have been employed to examine spectroscopy microscopy and molecular biology properties of electron mediators during eet fig 2 uv vis spectroscopy was applied to study the redox state of cytochromes in s loihica pv 4 based on the high absorption coefficient of heme in cytochromes nakamura et al 2009 raman spectroscopy was employed to identify special cytochromes as a characteristic peak in the spectra was correlated to the relative content of the cytochromes according to the peak area with the specific excitation wavelength heidary et al 2020 synchrotron x ray microdiffraction and rocking curve x ray diffraction were employed to observe the tight arrangement of aromatic amino acids in g sulfurreducens nanowires malvankar et al 2015 microscopy has also been a useful tool for visualizing nanowires and their activity ambient electrostatic force microscopy efm and atomic force microscopy afm are two known instruments whose probes can serve as force sensors to map the topography of nanowires it was reported that charge propagation along individual g sulfurreducens nanowires was observed using efm malvankar et al 2014 molecular biology analyses such as genome editing or sequencing were used to study the electrochemical activity of key proteins expressed by electroactive bacteria involved in eet gu et al 2021 comparing the reduction capacity of a wild type with a mutant xiao et al revealed a dynamic role of cyma in s oneidensis mr 1 centered eet processes which was significantly weakened under slow extracellular electron release conditions xiao et al 2023 although these methods significantly perfound our understanding of eet mechanisms a quantitative assessment of eet effiency rate has to date predorminately relied on electrochemical methods an advanced real time microscopic characterization of eet developed from traditional microscopic imaging was recently carried out to investigate the mechanism of eet fig 2 the membrane of s oneidensis mr 1 was labeled with fluorescent cationic dyes thioflavin t and the fluorescence intensity changed with the potential which was considered strongly correlates with eet pirbadian et al 2020 this measurement was particularly advantageous with a high spatiotemporal resolution to study the dynamics of eet on the electrode surface or during the respiration of other solid phase electron acceptors pirbadian et al 2020 besides some researchers have noticed that s oneidensis mr 1 has a unique structural dispersion pattern which would change with the redox state of the outer membrane cytochrome complex when a ray of white light is incident and thus employed structural color microscopy to examine the ongoing status of eet at the nondestructive subcellular scale xia et al 2021 lately the cytochromes on individual s oneidensis living cells were visualized by applying quantum dot labeling total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and single particle tracking chong et al 2022 a quantitative study of the cytochromes lateral diffusive dynamics was conducted to unveil the impact of diffusion on eet 2 2 electrochemical measurement characterizing the electrochemical activity of redox proteins or nanowires is important but uncovering the eet process within microbial aggregate needs additional techniques electrochemical measurement methods such as cyclic voltammetry cv electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis chronoamperometry ca and linear sweep voltammetry lsv can reveal and quantify changes in redox proteins the normalized potential of peaks in cv curves suggested that the cytochromes omcb omcz and omcs were involved with eet in electrochemically active biofilms richter et al 2009 chronoamperometry and square wave voltammetry swv were employed along with in situ fluorescence microscopy to monitor the real time s oneidensis mr 1 anodic process the current was found mostly generated by the inner biofilm close to the electrode surface while the eet between the outer biofilm and electrode was very weak zhang et al 2021 among those metrics for evaluating the eet performance of different microbial aggregates conductivity is a key metric that can be measured through a well established methodology and can be employed to indicate and compare their eet ability the i v curve or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis combined with an equivalent circuit can be used to calculate electron transfer resistance in nanowires or aggregates kretzschmar and harnisch 2021 then the resistance can be transformed into conductivity which describes the electron transfer resistance per unit distance according to the subjects morphology parameters and electrode structure parameters conductivity is a more convenient metric for evaluating and comparing eet ability between different subjects to discover the most effective eet mechanism however for different subjects different conductivity measurement methods and devices may apply the conductivity of nanowires was determined by conductive probe atomic force microscopy cp afm via a conductive tip and gold electrodes fig 3 a reguera et al 2005 the conductivity of aggregates was tested on special electrodes like split electrodes or interdigitated microelectrode arrays idas for microbes naturally or artificially attaching to the electrode fig 3a malvankar et al 2011 snider et al 2012 summers et al 2010 a summary of measured conductivity of nanowire biofilm and granular sludge from 42 previous studies was presented in fig 3b the conductivity of nanowires ranges from 10 to 108 μs cm with a maximum value of 9 77 108 μs cm tan et al 2016a fig 3b the conductivity of the biofilm ranges from 10 to 103 μs cm and the maximum value is 5000 μs cm of g sulfurreducens kn400 strain malvankar et al 2012a fig 3b the conductivity of granular sludge ranges from 1 to 30 μs cm and the maximum is 36 7 μs cm shrestha et al 2014 fig 3b the conductivity of different subjects spans a range of more than 6 orders of magnitude even for the same subject the measurement results also vary greatly from each other for example the conductivity of biofilm varies by 3 orders of magnitude this may be attributed to various factors such as methods and experimental conditions the enormous variability in the reported conductivities among studies greatly restrained the understanding of eet performance subsequently studies on conductivity of nanowires and microbial aggregates biofilm and granular sludge were discussed including measurement methods results and relative factors 3 conductivity of nanowires 3 1 analytic methods the conductivity of a nanowire is normally measured by employing cp afm with a voltage applied across the sample andolfi and cannistraro 2005 by maintaining a constant force on the tip the topography and current images can be recorded simultaneously so that the conductive properties can be related to the morphology of the sample investigated fig 4 a andolfi and cannistraro 2005 when the conductivity of an individual nanowire with a diameter from 2 5 to 4 nm was measured using cp afm a highly responsive current up to 8 na along the nanowire was generated reguera et al 2005 and the conductivity σ μs cm was calculated as el naggar et al 2010 1 σ g l a where g μs is the conductance value from the linear fit of the current a voltage v curve l cm is the length of the wire between two probes and a cm2 is the cross section area of the nanowire 3 2 experimental data and extrinsic factors among nanowires of various microbes e g rhodopseudomonas palustris venkidusamy et al 2015 s oneidensis el naggar et al 2010 escherichia coli shapiro et al 2022 desulfovibrio ferrophilus liang et al 2021 syntrophus aciditrophicus walker et al 2020 and methanospirillum hungatei poweleit et al 2016 the nanowire of g sulfurreducens was of particular interest as for eet research adhikari et al 2016 gu et al 2021 liu et al 2021b tan et al 2016a tan et al 2016b tan et al 2017 wang et al 2019 yalcin et al 2020 it was also noticeable that the nanowires of different microbes exhibit a broad range of conductivity from 102 to 108 μs cm again this may be attributed to the nanowire s protein structures and test conditions a rich content of aromatic amino acids in nanowire s protein components was recognized as a major contributor to the high conductivity of nanowire through the development of π π stacking that facilitates the electron transport vargas et al 2013 as evidence in an artificially cultivated strain of g sulfurreducens aro 5 mutant with aromatic amino acids replaced by alanine the conductivity of its nanowires decreased by 10 vargas et al 2013 besides aromatic amino acids the density of aromatic residues in the nanowire s protein content also positively affected its conductivity previous research found a much higher density of aromatic residues in nanowire s protein contents of g metallireducens 0 155 than that of g uranireducens 0 065 and used it to explain the higher conductivity of g metallireducens nanowires by 6 orders of magnitude than g uranireducens nanowires tan et al 2017 a further investigation on different types of aromatic amino acids revealed their influence on nanowire s conductivity promoting tryptophan expression led to a 2000 fold increase in the conductivity of g sulfurreducens nanowires tan et al 2016a phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan introduced to e coli nanowires resulted in a 10 fold 18 fold and 84 fold increase in its conductivity respectively shapiro et al 2022 a recent study investigated two categories of c type cytochromes assembled nanowires i e omcs and omcz fig 4b their contents in the nanowires were highly correlated with the nanowires conductivity wang et al 2019 specifically the conductivity of omcz nanowires was 3 107 μs cm 1000 times higher than that of omcs nanowires fig 4c yalcin et al 2020 a comparison of edge to edge heme heme distances showed that omcs has only two heme pairs within π π stacking distance 3 5 4 å whereas omcz has five heme pairs fig 4b yalcin et al 2020 besides the β sheet in the secondary structure of purified omcz nanowires a more conductive form was 7 fold more abundant than omcs nanowires yalcin et al 2020 as a test condition parameter ph was found to significantly affect the conductivity of nanowires decreasing ph from 7 to 2 caused a large increase in the conductivity of both omcs and omcz nanowires by 100 times yalcin et al 2020 because of protein conformational changes into a β sheet rich structure enhancing π π stacking between hemes and thereby yielding a longer mean free path for electrons for high conductivity fig 4d yalcin and malvankar 2020 given the importance of nanowires in microbial eet processes scientists have proactively looked into nanowires structure and associated genes in the past two decades in 2005 reguera et al firstly found that the electrically conductive pili e pili of g sulfurreducens are type iv pili made of pila monomer reguera et al 2005 and for a long time most researchers believed that the nanowire of g sulfurreducens was expressed by pila gene however a few questions remain unanswered for example deleting the pila gene resulted in no existence of nanowires or conductivity of the biofilm richter et al 2012 with precision instruments probing the fine structure of proteins such as cryo electron microscopy cryo em recent studies found that the nanowire of g sulfurreducens consists of stacked multiheme cytochromes wang et al 2019 and the nanowire composed of the pila monomer is not conductive but affects the formation of omcs and omcz nanowires the fact is that g sulfurreducens binds pila n to pila c to assemble heterodimeric pili which can promote the secretion of omcs and omcz nanowires gu et al 2021 fig 4e the conductivity of pila n c heterodimeric pili is 20 times lower than that of omcs nanowires fig 4f gu et al 2021 therefore different eet mechanisms of nanowires will lead to significant variability in the nanowires conductivity which further extends their effects to microbial aggregates many previous studies observed that the conductivity of microbial aggregates is surprisingly reduced from that of nanowires a calculation based on the data used in fig 3 shows that the average reported conductivity of biofilm is 5 61 102 μs cm followed by granular sludge 9 34 μs cm both far lower than that of nanowires 6 76 107 μs cm a recent study revealed that this decline even initiated once after the nanowire networks formed where the measured conductivity of nanowire networks was found merely 0 109 μs cm enormously lowered from that of an individual nanowire 510 μs cm shapiro et al 2022 however this modification suggests that the gap resistance between disordered nanowires when nanowire networks form cannot be neglected as it leads to decreased conductivity 4 conductivity of microbial aggregates a similar situation would arise in microbial aggregates such as biofilms and granular sludge where eet process needs to overcome the large resistance in nanowire networks as well in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps as essential components of aggregates have been confirmed to impact eet in both positive and negative ways zhu et al 2022 it was reported that the proteins in eps is beneficial for eet xiao and zhao 2017 zhou et al 2020 but non electroactive exopolysaccharides accounting for a great share in eps can be inhibitory this section discusses the measurement methods and influence factors of conductivity of biofilms and granular sludge 4 1 conductivity of biofilm as a biofilm containing electroactive microbes can naturally attach to a solid surface its conductivity is normally measured through electrochemical methods by growing on idas or split electrodes and exchanging electrons with them fig 5 a plenty of experiments were employed to measure the conductivity of biofilm and evaluate biofilm s eet ability the reported results span a wide range from 10 to 103 μs cm fig 3 three important factors leading to the large variability are electrode designs measuring methods and microbe status in biofilms a detailed analysis of each factor is provided in the following sections 4 1 1 effects of electrode designs on biofilm conductivity similar to nanowires the conductivity of biofilms can be calculated as yates et al 2016 2 σ s v s d i s d where i sd a is the source drain current s is the electrode configuration geometric factor dependent on length and width of the electrodes length and width of the gap separating the electrodes and thickness of the biofilm and v sd v is bias voltage between the source and drain electrodes for ida and split electrodes different equations are available for s calculation after combing them with eq 2 the conductivity can be calculated with eq 3 for idas yates et al 2016 and eq 4 for split electrodes malvankar et al 2011 3 σ g π l ln 4 b a 4 σ g π l ln 8 g π a where g μs is the conductance value from the linear fit of the current voltage curve g μm is the biofilm thickness l cm is the length of the gap in the electrode a cm is the half width of the gap and b cm is the distance from the center of a gap to the center of the adjacent electrode band due to the different parameters of these two types of electrodes including gap distance electrode surface area and the number of electrode pairs the results derived from different types of electrodes may vary as fig 5a shows idas are a variation of the double band electrode configuration with a longer electrode smaller electrode surface area and narrower gap width usually 5 μm while split electrodes are two shorter and larger electrodes separated by a wider gap 5 μm yates et al 2016 however the influence of the type of electrodes is minimal fig 5b the gap width of split electrodes has an even more significant impact conductivity of g sulfurreducencs biofilms was reported to increase with the electrode gap width fig 5c d liu et al 2020a a possible reason is that a wider electrode gap might stimulate the production of nanowires or cytochromes in biofilms to achieve long distance eet malvankar et al 2012b which artificially raises the conductivity 4 1 2 effects of measurement methods on biofilm conductivity two methods have been used to measure the conductivity of biofilm constant current voltage methods and electrochemical gating measurement egm performing constant current voltage measurement is convenient it merely requires a constant stimulating voltage v sd applied across the source and drain electrode fig 6 a with a recorded response current i sd between the source and drain the conductivity of biofilms was determined as i sd v sd this method does not control the potential of electrodes that may influence the electroactivity of microbes in contrast the egm applied different potentials on the source or drain electrode to establish a potential difference between them so that the redox activity of proteins in a biofilm can correspond to the plots of the curve under different electrode potentials representing the conducting ability of microbial aggregates two types of egm were performed by applying a certain potential only on the source electrode and a bias between the source and the drain electrode single electrode controlled egm or applying two different potentials both on the source and drain electrode double electrodes controlled egm fig 6b and c it is essential that an applied voltage is involved in performing both constant current voltage and single electrode controlled egm leading to a significant effect that background current will be inevitably generated while electrons are transferred during an eet process yates et al 2016 taking the background current into account the electron transport by eet is overestimated this well explains a fact arose after an investigation of reported biofilm conductivities measured by different methods fig 6d that results with constant current voltage and single electrode controlled egm 10 103 μs cm were mostly higher than that with double electrodes controlled egm 5 to 22 4 μs cm 4 1 2 effects of biofilm status on conductivity the conductivity of biofilm can be measured with or without carbon source turnover and nonturnover respectively carbon source is the most important component in medium because it determines the metabolic activity of microbes further influents their electrochamical activity an investigation among the reported results in those studies revealed that turnover condition led to higher result than nonturnover condition in which all substance were exhausted fig 7 metabolic biofilms with substrate can produce electron shuttles which faciltate electron transfer within biofilms and lead to the high conductivity ding et al 2016 in order to achieve the non turnover condition part of soluable electron meditors would be lost and led to the decrease in biofilm conductivity additionlly the production of metbaolic current might be obscure isd which also could led the high conductanc of biofilm with metabolism of substrate yates et al 2016 specifically the conductivity of pure cultured g sulferreducens biofilms growing on an ida electrode was measured with a gap width of 5 μm a higher conductivity value was obtained 9 μs cm under turnover than nonturnover 5 25 μs cm conditions for mixed cultured biofilm higher conductivity was still with turnover condition 9 5 μs cm than nonturnover 7 5 μs cm fig 7 yates et al 2018 yates et al 2015 other researchers repeatly measured the conductivity of pure cultured g sulferreducens biofilm on a split electrode with a gap width of 5 μm and found very similar results to the former study mentioned higher under turnover condition as well fig 7 liu et al 2020a a possible reason is that the interaction between microorganisms improves the electrical activity of the mixed biofilm besides the factors discussed above a biofilm s conductivity may also be affected by its thickness hussain et al 2021 buffer concentration dhar et al 2017 and growth phase of biofilm li et al 2018 with an increased average geobacter biofilm thickness from 19 to 45 μm the biofilm s conductivity significantly increased from 630 to 1430 μs cm hussain et al 2021 a study measured the conductivity under different pbs concentrations 100 50 and 2 5 mm and found that the geobacter enriched biofilm s conductivity reduced with decreased buffer concentration this was considered a result of the inhibited metabolism activity of microbes caused by low buffer concentration dhar et al 2017 some researchers examined the conductivity of mixed species methanogenic biofilm in different metabolic phase fermentation methanogenic exoelectrogenic and determined that the conductivity would increase from 33 7 to 307 4 μs cm when the biofilm well developed into the exoelectrogenic period li et al 2018 4 2 conductivity of granular sludge like the biofilm granular sludge is a form of microbial aggregates that has been widely employed in wasterwater treatment a typical application of granular sludge is to faciliate the production of methane gas in uasb reactors through conductance network built by eams li et al 2020b the conductivity of granular sludge is a key indicator of the performence of diet within it which is measured by performing constant current voltage method with a split electrode fig 8 a an equation for calculating the conductivity is listed as 5 barua et al 2018 5 σ l r s where r ω is the resistance calculated from i sd a v sd v l cm is the width of non conductive gap between the two electrodes and s cm2 is the cross sectional area many previous studies measured the conductivity of granular sludge fig 8b indicating that most results were around 1 10 μs cm for non stimulated granular sludge stimulating diet in granular sludge is widely practiced to improve the conductivity with increased abundance of eams e g geobactoer fig 8b adding conductive materials and optimizing carbon sources are two effective methods to stimulate diet and a high conductivity is obtained fig 8b various conductive materials e g carbon cloth carbon fiber granular activated carbon gac biochar and nitrogen doped sludge carbon n sc were found capable of promoting diet barua et al 2018 lei et al 2016 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 yan et al 2017 zhuang et al 2018 through those efforts the conductivity of granular sludge could reach a relatively high level fig 8b conductive materials enable an extra pathway for electron transfer that adds on insufficient electrically conductive extracellular appendages in granular sludge as well as provide high surface area for attaching more biomass resulting in increased conductivity of granular sludge providing carbon sources favored by eams also pose postive effects on the diet whithin granular sludge conductivity is positively correlated to the abundance of genus geobacter which prefer establishing diet by metabolising ethanol and microbes in the ethanol stimulated enrichments hold a great possibility to proceed diet fig 8b shrestha et al 2014 summers et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 it is noteworthy that the conductivity of granular sludge is much lower than that of biofilms mainly because of a larger interface resistance and calculation error during measurement for granular sludge the test granular sludge was collected from reactors and manually crushed with a cover glass to form a confluent film that spread across the nonconductive gap zhao et al 2016 this operation inevitably destroyed the inner structure of granular sludge and causes considerable interface resistance on the electrode leading to underestimates of the sludge s conductivity in contrast the biofilms about to be measured are naturally growing on the electrode with an electrode biofilm interface built by a high abundance of redox proteins which significantly decrease the interface resistance due to the granulate shape of sludge it is hard to ensure that every sample fills in the gap tightly while biofilm growth on the electrode can form a more smooth coverage without any crack which otherwise would result in a larger resistance in the gap in addition some studies only considered granular sludge at the gap and ignored granular sludge at the electrode interface when calculating conductivity jin et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 caizán juanaren et al measured the conductivity of 28 anaerobic granular sludge samples collected from full scale wastewater treatment reactors using a constant voltage method based on a gap electrode and for almost 80 of the samples their conductivity values were below 4 5 μs cm caizán juanarena et al 2020 in conclusion the conductivity of anaerobic granular sludge lacks sufficient and accurate determination and its significance needs further investigation 5 from conductivity to eet fluxes and a comparison with electron donor transfer based on accurate measurement of conductivity further application of it is a crucial issue interspecies electron transfer involves not only eet but also electron donor transfer edt e g hydrogen in microbial aggregates it is usually hoped to compare eet and edt models in the optimization of engineering regulation technology a previous modeling study compared eet with formate and hydrogen mediated interspecies electron transfer storck et al 2016 formate mediated interspecies electron transfer showed the fastest transfer rate however the result was derived under ideal conditions with several assumptions currently it is necessary to compare eet and edt through experiments the driving force of eet is potential gradients in microbial aggregates while edt is mainly driven by concentration gradient fig 9 thus two dynamics models of eet and edt in microbial aggregates can be established by ohm s law and fick s law the two dynamics equations are listed as 6 and 7 6 j eet σ f d u d l 7 j edt d m d c m d l where j eet e mol m2 s is electron transfer flux σ μs cm is conductivity f is the faraday s constant 96 485 c mol u is potential v l is the transfer distance j edt mol m2 s is electron donor transfer flux d m m2 s is mass transfer coefficient and c m mol is the concentration of electron donors the derivation of eq 6 is available in supplementary materials although conductivity is easy to measure it is difficult to directly compare conductivity with mass transfer coefficient due to their different dimensionality to address the dilemma a relationship between conductivity and electron transfer coefficient was established from the perspective of dynamics yates et al 2015 previous studies indicated that in microbial aggregates redox proteins are the carrier of electrons and the electron transfer can be modeled by electron hopping where the electron can hop from an oxidation coenzyme center to a reduction coenzyme center fig 9 strycharz glaven et al 2011 thus eq 6 can be restructured into eq 8 8 j eet σ f d u d l d e d c red d l d e d c ox d l where d e m2 s is electron diffusion coefficient c red mol and c ox mol are oxidation and reduction coenzyme concentrations respectively to obtain d e j eet is replaced by i sd the equation is as follow 9 i sd n f s d e d c red d l n f s d e d c ox d l where i sd a is source drain current n is the number of electron transfer f is the faraday s constant 96 485 c mol s m2 is the cross sectional area of biofilm on source drain electrode to avoid the measurement of redox coenzyme concentrations square wave voltammetry swv was used by a previous report saunders et al 2020 thus the electron diffusion coefficient can be calculated by eqs 10 and 11 10 i swv n f a d e π l p φ d c red d l n f a d e π l p φ d c ox d l 11 i sd i swv s π l p d e a φ where i swv a is swv peak current a is electrode area cm2 π is pi about 3 14 l p is the pulse width nm φ is a normalization constant according to ohm s law eqs 12 and 13 the relationship between conductivity and electron diffusion coefficient can be deduced as follow eq 9 12 i sd σ a v sd 13 d e σ 2 a 4 v sd φ 2 i swv s 2 π l p where σ μs cm is conductivity v sd v is the applied voltage between drain electrode and source electrode in brief the corresponding electron diffusion coefficient can be calculated by the obtained conductivity to realize the comparability between the electron transfer coefficient and mass transfer coefficient at the same microbial aggregates recently some researchers had calculated the diffusion coefficient of electron using the same method saunders et al 2020 the result indicated that the diffusion coefficient of electron ranged from 10 10 m2 s 10 9 m2 s in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms the electron transfer coefficient calculated by conductivity may be of practical significance in comparison with mass transfer coefficient this comparison is expected to provide valuable reference for the development of directional control technology in practical engineering 6 conclusions and outlook electrical conductivity is widely employed as an essential metric to evaluate eet performance this study reviews and analyzes existing knowledge about the conductivity of nanowires and microbial aggregates biofilm and granular sludge including measurement methodology experimental data and theories several key findings and notes are listed as follows against a misbelief nanowires and microbial aggregates have substantially different conductivity levels the conductivity of nanowires can be as high as 108 μs cm even close to that of metal materials although microbial aggregates in wastewater treatment may contain abundant nanowires they are not highly conductive the reasons for the relatively low conductivity of microbial aggregates include 1 they contain massive amounts of non conductive substances e g polysaccharides carriers etc li et al 2020a 2 the conductivity of nanowire networks in microbial aggregates formed via lap connections and others is far lower than that of individual nanowires shapiro et al 2022 thus the high conductivity of microscopic nanowires cannot be inferred as the high conductivity of macroscopic microbial aggregates and vice versa thus it is feasible to reduce the contact resistance and improve the interaction between microbes and electrodes through advanced material and microbial engineering technologies in the future several factors can cause a large variability in the measured conductivity of nanowires and microbial aggregates for nanowires biofilms and granular sludge the reported conductivity values vary greatly in the literature the conductivity measurement of nanowires has been significantly improved thanks to the advancement in instrumentation like afm the variation among the existing results is primarily caused by varying protein structures with microbes and the lack of precise ph control when performing the conductivity measurement however for microbial aggregates it is more difficult to accurately measure their conductivity and the physics behind is much more complicated the measurement methods and devices have a large influence and if not standardized can cause substantial variability in derived conductivity values microbial aggregates could exist and behave differently during a conductivity test than in an actual wastewater treatment process for example to test the conductivity of granular sludge a sample must be collected and manually pressed to fill the electrode gap s in an ida or split electrode changes in the sludge sample s physical properties e g morphology and porosity along with insufficient contact with the electrode can create measurement uncertainty and bias thus the test result may not truly reflect electron transfer characteristics in the granules future research should focus on method standardization for the in situ measurement of the conductivity of microbial aggregates due to the heterogeneous nature of microbial aggregates special attention should be paid to the uneven distribution of eet processes in both spatial and temporal domains a framework is proposed to enable the calculation of the eet flux in microbial aggregates from conductivity and a comparison with electron donor transfer the purpose of accurately measuring and regulating conductivity is to enhance eet in microbial aggregates thereby improving the efficiency of a biochemical wastewater treatment process a process similar to eet in microbial aggregates is the transfer of electron donors e g hydrogen the transfer of hydrogen also plays a critical role in methane production from anaerobic granular sludge it is important to compare the two transfer processes electrons and electron donors in the same microbial aggregate since they are closely coupled in a wastewater treatment process the comparison is enabled by deriving j eet extracellular electron diffusion flux from conductivity as described by eqs 8 13 the comparation between eet and edt determines which is the restrictive step of watstewater treatment leading to a clear orientation to regulatee its performance in the future declaration of competing interest all authors
