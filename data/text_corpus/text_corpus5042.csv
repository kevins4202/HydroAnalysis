25210,biological invasion is considered the subsequent most important threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction and is documented as a main cause of global biodiversity loss and species extinction species distribution models can be used to identify areas that are at risk for invasions by harmful invasive alien species ias if ias have not yet spread to all suitable habitats we tested the potential of combining two or more independent but complementary modelling methods to enhance the accuracy of spatial predictions we used the modelling tools maxent garp and bioclim with presence only data of the ias yushania maling maling bamboo from darjeeling himalaya to develop distribution maps modelling tools were chosen based on their performance with presence only data area under curve auc 0 7 as well as their differences in underlying modelling concept and statistics the models combine occurrence records with topographic climatic and vegetative predictors derived from satellite data by combining the 3 selected models in an ensemble approach we were able to minimize the spatial uncertainty related to suitable habitat prediction for yushania maling while both garp and bioclim consistently performed at an auc 0 7 both our ensemble model and maxent performed better with an auc of 0 95 and 0 94 respectively moderately and highly suitable habitats for yushania maling predicted by models correlated well with survey records except for garp where we found the model to over predict suitability outside of the species known ecological niche our findings identify the best modelling approach enhancing overall explanatory power of habitat suitability models our findings show that an ensemble approach should be used to ensure appropriate mitigation measures are applied in the appropriate places enhancing overall effectiveness both ecologically as well as economically it was shown that yushania maling is indeed a threat to the ecosystems in the region and while the species potential habitat may decrease in some areas with climate change other areas will become more suitable for it abbreviations auc area under curve dem digital elevation model em ensemble model

keywords yushania maling invasive species ensemble model maxent garp bioclim 1 introduction the darjeeling district in the himalaya region india is a hotspot for biodiversity endemism and micro diversity over past decades rapid population growth has led to increasing anthropogenic disturbances in the region and a consistent increase in pressure on the environment the inflating level of anthropogenic activity a growing ecological susceptibility due to climate change disturbances and other factors make the area prone to invasions by non native species invasive alien species ias are species that are capable of getting established outside their natural ranges they commonly show a high potential for spread and can become established outside their historical range causing often irreversible damage to the environment biological invasions have led to the extinction of thousands of endemic species in the past few hundred years mooney and drake 1987 and have homogenized the world s flora and fauna hobbs 2000 in the darjeeling region such invasions are causing considerable ecological damage to the native flora and fauna sekar 2012 yushania maling gamble is a native invasive species to the region the species was previously known as arundinaria maling majumdar et al 1989 in the yushania genus of bamboo in the grass family starting in the late 1980ies first occurrences were recorded in india s darjeeling district chi son and renvoize 1989 since then the species has been spreading at an alarming rate damaging the native fauna and flora roy et al 2016 by rapidly outcompeting native species stapleton 1997 the management and mitigation of ias has been at the center of attention of scientific research for many decades elton 1958 while numerous studies demonstrate the dramatic effect of invaders on recipient ecosystems mack et al 2000 other studies are working towards possible ways to tackle the challenges arising from biological invasions guisan and zimmermann 2000 scott 2002 as well as guisan and thuiller 2005 for example demonstrate the importance of species distribution modelling sdm in general and describe a variety of methods available for the prediction of a species potential habitat jiménez valverde et al 2011 advocate the role that sdm can play in risk assessment and conservation timely information about areas under risk of being invaded can help in devising effective control and eradication strategies aiding decision making by resources managers government agencies and non government organizations one way to identify potential areas of spread of invasive species is through modelling their current distribution padalia et al 2014 followed by species environment matching for areas outside a species current range the accuracy and performance of individual sdm varies widely among methods and species elith et al 2006 marmion et al 2009 methods integrating multiple individual models provide robust estimates of potential species distributions araujo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 ensemble maps that highlight areas of agreement among model predictions offer a way to reduce the uncertainty of basing management activities on solely one sdm model the importance of study manifolds taking into account that there are limited related studies in the past an increasing availability of spatial data as well as high resolution bio climatic data have continuously enhanced the prerequisites needed for successful sdm and assessment of factors affecting the magnitude and extent of a potential invasion using such data ensemble models em have the potential to provide more robust estimates of suitable habitat for a given invasive species at a given time meller et al 2014 poulos et al 2012 leading to robust sdm in em the predictions of a group of base models are combined to generate more accurate composite predictions particularly when analysing the risk of ias that have not yet spread to all suitable habitats the determination of species environment relationships can be challenging stohlgren et al 2010 in such cases em have the potential to highlight areas of agreement among models using a range of modelling techniques araujo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 stohlgren et al 2010 in recent years em methods have been improved in a variety of ways to produce more accurate estimates of species distribution and to facilitate conservation measures for e g comte 2013 assessed the influence of species non detection in modelling species distributions with an ensemble consensus approach and compared it with an occupancy model that accounted for species imperfect detection and found consensus models to outperform the occupancy models for the highly detectable species forester et al 2013 integrated two independent complementary methods em and statistical phylogeography and produced robust assessments of climate change impacts on species distributions whereas meller et al 2014 evaluated and compared the pre selection and post selection consensus approaches in conservation prioritization breiner et al 2015 in addition to introducing fresh approach of using ensembles of small models esm to model the distribution of rare species tested the approach more comprehensively on a large number of species including a transferability assessment recently naimi and araújo 2016 created a r based platform for species distribution modelling enabling ensembles of models to be fitted and evaluated the r package can generate ensembles of sdms and offers variety of options for the evaluation of the produced projections of species potential distributions in space and time a very recent r package ecospat developed by cola et al 2017 provide adequate functions to run the very recently proposed ensemble of small models esm approach breiner et al 2016 further using the r based package biomod2 devloped by thuiller et al 2016 gillard et al 2017 performed ensemble forecasting by using nine different algorithms including three regression based methods two classification based and four machine learning methods to forecast current and future potential distribution of three invasive plant taxa while it is generally understood that sdm derived using em can have a stronger explanatory power than sdm from individual models little is known about both the ideal combination of base models in an em and whether or not the benefits of em shown for well researched cases can also be obtained when working with limited data from specific case study regions where decision makers are facing pressure to act in a first step we therefore assess our first hypothesis h0 1 model performance of maxent garp and bioclim is similar to that of em when using field data for yushania maling successfully deriving an ideal modelling approach using limited real world data will additionally allow us to investigate a second hypothesis directly aimed to assist decision makers h0 2 the spread of yushania maling is limited no currently unaffected areas in the region are at risk of being invaded by answering this hypothesis areas under risk can be identified and required policies can be developed to ensure timely and appropriate counter measurements are implemented when it comes to ensuring a longer term applicability of answer to these two hypotheses it becomes evident that climate change has to be addressed as well climate change might impact the distribution and potential habitat of invasive yushania maling and eventually affect the effectiveness of control measures therefore to identify the impacts of climate change on potential distribution of yushania maling and to aid the long term ias management plan we investigate our third hypothesis h0 3 there is no difference in the potential habitat of yushania maling under a changing climate 2 methods and material to answer our hypotheses occurrence data was collected that together with additional data on bio climate and other ecological parameters were used to develop an em in the following we will be describing the study area our approach for collecting data in the field as well as the approach used for modelling 2 1 study area the study area is located in the darjeeling himalayas fig 1 india the area is located at 87 59 e 88 53 e to 27 14 n 26 27 n and includes the himalayan parts of sikkim nepal bhutan and bangladesh encompassing an area of 8812 km2 the region is home to a diverse alpine flora belonging to 60 families and 297 genera covering 60 of all alpine plant families and 10 of all the alpine genera known worldwide körner 1999 the total number of vascular plant species recorded across the region 1400 75 species is more than double of that recorded for the european alps new zealand alps and the rocky mountains region 600 650 species mark and adams 1973 hadley 1987 ozenda 1995 remarkably the darjeeling himalayas region is one of smallest regions in terms of geographic area yet has the highest number of species per km2 the area covers 3 national parks and 7 wildlife sanctuaries singalilia np neora valley np gorumara np jorepokhri salamander wls senchal wls mahananda wls chapramari wls pangolakha wls barsay wls and kitam wls the area is additionally covering a variety of climatic zones with distinct attributes leading to a comparably high overall biodiversity the region is also a source of vast variety of medicinal plants which are extensively used by local communities about 400 plant species mostly herbaceous endemics of high medicinal value are harvested in the high elevation grasslands of sikkim himalaya rai et al 2000 eventual loss of endemic herbs would greatly affect the socio economic structure of the community ecological alteration of the landscape and the associated changes in ecosystem structure and function following intrusion of yushania maling will substantially impact local livelihoods replacement of conifers and important flora like rhododendrons takus magnolia betula quercus etc will affect timber supply and wildlife in the area 2 2 data collection yushania maling in the study area based on a 1 km2 grid 56 locations were selected at which occurrence records of yushania maling was collected the surveys were carried out during the post monsoon period results were used for model parameter fitting 2 3 bioclimatic data and mapping current bioclimatic information at 1 km2 resolution is required to determine suitability of a specific area for yushania maling we derived 19 bioclimatic variables for the region from the world climatic research centre hijmans et al 2005 using diva gis software appendix table 4 additionally land use cover was generated from landsat satellite imagery obtained from usgs https www usgs gov the land use land cover map lulc of the case study area was prepared using landsat data from the year of the study to assess mapping accuracy kappa coefficient smits et al 1999 a discrete multivariate technique for assessment of mapping accuracy was used the kappa accuracy of the map was computed as 0 82 the geographic dimensions of environmental layers for the study area and pixel size was homogenised using the spatial analyst tool in arcgis ver 10 1 we reduced our full set of 23 environmental variables appendix table 4 to those with a significant impact by assessing their level of contribution to the final model using maxent variables with higher maximum entropy gains were retained further exclusion of the variables was carried out by examining co linearity the results of this assessment can be found in the appendix table 5 of each pair of highly cross correlated variables pearson correlation coefficient r 0 90 one was chosen considering its biological relevance to the species and ease of interpretation for inclusion in the model kumar and stohlgren 2009 for example if annual temperature and temperature seasonality were highly correlated we kept temperature seasonality since it captured a seasonal variability in temperature ultimately 5 significant environmental variables were selected for modelling potential habitat suitability of yushania maling table 1 table 2 illustrates the strength contribution of each of the 5 selected variables for yushania maling in describing their potential habitat suitability distribution max temperature of the warmest month was found to be the most significantly limiting factor for the species distribution in the case study area 2 4 current species distribution models for comparing model performance and to develop an ensemble prediction map for yushania maling in our case study area we chose 3 current species distribution modelling tools 1 bioclim version 5 1 nix 1986 martin 1996 2 garp version 0 5 stockwell 1999 and 3 maxent version 3 3 3e phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 the chosen models are easy to use batchable and have been providing regular robust estimates of predictions in various research wisz et al 2008 moreover they do not need absence information to model the distribution the models have proven to perform well with presence only data and differ both conceptually as well as statistically elith et al 2006 kelly and goulden 2008 while the models garp and bioclim have been established well before maxent their underlying modelling approaches have shown to be less efficient in comparison elith et al 2006 the sdms represents the inherent relationship between species presence and a set of environmental conditions but different sdm methods model this relationship differently based on underlying principle for e g bioclim deals with this relationship as a binary predictor and broadly defined bioclimatic envelope whereas maxent and garp include much complex nonlinear functions to model the relationship ju and santos 2012 bioclim was the first sdm to be developed for use by the wider public and laid the groundwork for most of the modelling tools existing today including garp and maxent booth et al 2013 the model interpolates a species bioclimatic envelope which is a summary of climatic conditions at locations where the species has been recorded hutchinson 1982 nix 1986 martin 1996 bioclim describes each species bioclimatic envelope in a range based manner suggesting that all locations with climatic parameters that fit within the extreme values determined at places of current species occurrences can be considered suitable habitat carpenter et al 1993 bioclim s categorical output is mapped to probabilities of 1 0 0 5 and 0 0 respectively garp the genetic algorithm for rule set prediction can find non random correlations between the presence and absence of a species and environmental variables it allows building species prediction models based on atomic logistic regression bioclimatic envelope and negated bioclimatic envelope rules and uses a super algorithm in a dynamic machine learning environment to do so payne and stockwell 1996 stockwell and peterson 2002 anderson et al 2003 garp works in an iterative process of rule selection evaluation testing and incorporating or rejecting to produce a heterogeneous rule set summarizing a species ecological requirement anderson et al 2002 maxent is the most current of the 3 tools and its development was in part based on previously developed sdms maxent is a software for modelling species niches and distribution by applying a machine learning technique called maximum entropy modelling from a set of environmental e g climatic grids and georeferenced occurrences the model expresses a probability distribution where each grid cell has a predicted suitability of conditions for the species phillips et al 2017 the software uses a generative approach rather than discriminative which can be an advantage when underlying data is limited additionally it allows direct integration with gis software such as arcgis making data handling and mapping of model outputs easy 2 5 modelling comparison ensemble modelling and future potential distribution prediction in a first step we created current probability maps showing habitat suitability for yushania maling with each of the 3 base modelling tools bioclim garp and maxent we used 75 randomly assigned occurrences as training dataset with the remaining 25 used as test dataset for generating modelling output from bioclim all values were kept at default levels in the modelling tool each model prediction was combined to represent composite prediction with an output pixel value ranging from 0 1 bioclim outputs are categorical probability values of 0 0 5 and 1 to generate single binary predictions using garp the logit rule was applied using default parameters 0 01 convergence limit and 1000 maximum iterations logit rules are an adaptation of logistic regression models or a form of regression where outputs are transformed into probabilities stockwell 1999 the linear limiting feature functions which are equal to continuous environmental variables were used to train maxent after realizing the small occurrence dataset and identifying appropriate feature shapes as suggested by merow et al 2013 initially the multiplier value was set to a very small value e g 0 02 with a default set of parameters leading to a highly over fitted model subsequently the multiplier value was increased and the modelled distribution and changes in auc area under curve or area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was analyzed following an approach by padalia et al 2014 jackknife resampling was used to identify those variables that contributed most to the model the method provides a systematic method of resampling and leads to improved estimates of the sample parameter and a lower sampling bias tukey 1958 the logistic output of maxent with habitat suitability values ranging from 0 unsuitable to 1 optimal habitat was recorded accordingly habitat suitability was classified as unsuitable 0 0 25 least suitable 0 25 0 50 moderately suitable 0 50 0 75 and highly suitable 0 75 1 00 for garp and bioclim habitat suitability was classified as unsuitable 0 5 and suitable 0 5 in a second step we converted these habitat suitability maps into binary maps showing potential habitat versus the area not suitable for the yushania maling this step was necessary to allow the comparison of outputs of all 3 models and the creation of an em for the conversion to binary maps we selected a threshold from our test data in which the specificity was equal to sensitivity following an approach described by stohlgren et al 2010 finally we developed an em based map for yushania maling using a simple weighted summation approach for combining the 3 binary maps and then multiplying the resulting map by individual model performance following an approach described by poulos et al 2012 we chose the weighted summation approach due to its straightforward output that allows easy interpretation marmion et al 2009 ensemble scores in the modelled output represent the degree of model agreement a pixel with a value of zero indicates that none of the models predicted species occurrence at a specific location larger values indicated a higher prediction agreement among the 3 models which suggested that these locations were robustly estimated to be suitable habitat in a third step we projected the trained maxent model into future climates hadcm3 a2a and b2a scenarios using projection feature utility in maxent following padalia et al 2015 we retained the same thresholding criteria as discussed above in current maxent model in order to categorize into likewise occurrence probabilities model accuracy was assessed using the threshold independent receiver operating characteristic roc auc method auc is widely used for comparing species distribution model performance or statistical model performance in general the roc curve is defined by plotting sensitivity against 1 minus specificity across the range of possible thresholds sensitivity and specificity are used to take into account all elements of a confusion matrix true and false presences and absences the roc curve describes the relationship between the proportion of observed presences correctly predicted sensitivity and the proportion of observed absences incorrectly predicted 1 minus specificity a high auc score reflects that the model can discriminate accurately between locations at which the species is present or absent the auc measures model performance that ranges from 0 to 1 a model performs well when the auc is large usually auc values of 0 9 indicate high accuracy values of 0 70 0 9 indicate good accuracy and values between 0 5 and 0 7 indicate low accuracy for our model auc values were calculated using a web based calculator for roc curves eng 2006 we generated 100 pseudo absence points using arcmap by randomly generating points using a 100 km buffer around species presence records following poulos et al 2012 fig 2 displays the overall structure of the modelling approach 3 results 3 1 prediction of potential distribution model performances of maxent garp and bioclim were not similar to that of em the overall area of suitable habitat calculated using maxent garp bioclim and em were 1853 km2 2881 km2 2703 km2 and 2972 km2 respectively moreover spatial uncertainties also could not entirely be eliminated the modelling results obtained using maxent showed potential habitat for yushania maling in darjeeling phulbazar jourbunglow sukiapokhri rangli rangliot kalimpong parts of darjeeling district and adjoining areas of nepal bhutan and sikkim fig 3 while the results obtained using garp identified areas of suitable habitat in kalimpong gorubathan bhutan mirik jourbungalow and sukiapokhri that are overall larger than those derived using maxent and bioclim furthermore results obtained using bioclim showed an increased area suitability in sikkim and mirik compared to results obtained using other models field data and modelling outputs indicate that areas experiencing maximum temperatures between 12 4 20 c in the warmest months fig 4 and elevations of 1300 to 3 400 m above mean sea level mamsl are suitable for yushania maling suitable habitat for yushania maling was identified as up to a maximum elevation of 3400 mamsl in nepal adjoining to darjeeling district as well as at 2800 mamsl towards bhutan this modelled suitable region is also the maximum species richness zone 1500 2500 mamsl vetaas and grytnes 2002 although the predictive capacity of individual models differed as for example shown in auc scores area predicted to be suitable habitat matched with species ecology and field survey data in all cases except for garp which was found to over predict habitat suitability outside of the ias known ecological niche moderately and highly suitable habitat 0 5 probability for yushania maling predicted by models correlated well with occurrence records from field sampling table 3 the jackknife test identified max temperature of warmest month and min temperature of coldest month fig 5 as the most important environmental variables for predicting potential habitat suitability of yushania maling in the study area of the four modelling algorithms em and maxent did perform best with auc values 0 95 and 0 94 respectively garp and bioclim ranked the lowest with aucs of 0 82 and 0 71 while auc values were marginally different between em and maxent our results suggest that em has a higher accuracy compared to results individually derived using garp or bioclim maxent predictions and high ensemble scores were well in accordance with the presence records of y maling 3 2 impact of climate change fig 6 shows the potential range of yushania maling habitat modelled for the year 2050 under a2a and b2a climate change scenarios the results show that the yushania maling distribution area in a2a scenario remains relatively similar to its current distribution with 1853 km2 and 1883 km2 respectively however a transition is observed from moderately suitable areas to highly suitable in areas close to bhutan and in the north of darjeeling for scenario b2a the total area suitable for y maling was smaller 1840 km2 than that obtained under current climatic conditions and the a2a scenario the highly suitable areas 0 75 probability decreased from 260 km2 or 2 95 in a2a scenario to 245 km2 or 2 78 in size in the b2a scenario 4 discussion conclusions today various methods exist to assess potential habitat but only few studies directly compare their explanatory power specifically with ias is question in this study we visualized the differences between all three models from the simplest bioclim to the most advanced maxent we eliminated each model s potential drawbacks by adopting an ensemble approach while garp and bioclim performed consistent maxent and em did outperform them even though our em had the highest auc score for invasive yushania maling maxent did perform insignificantly lower accordingly our study revealed major variations in the area suitable for yushania maling derived using the selected modelling approaches therefore our first hypothesis h0 1 model performance of maxent garp and bioclim is similar to that of em when using field data for yushania maling was rejected our results generally support the use of em over individual sdms however em does not always outperform all other models in this case the individual maxent model delivered more accurate results nonetheless em can provide more realistic simulations of species spread and distribution because of the fact that they highlight the mutual areas of agreement among the individual models araujo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 and further can accommodate wide arrange of algorithms so a decision to perform ensemble modelling with three well established sdm approaches can based on the following grounds a bioclim is one of the oldest known sdms and is widely used in different studies by a wide range of authors e g cunningham et al 2002 steinbauer et al 2008 loiselle et al 2003 meynecke 2004 walther et al 2004 but the method was criticised for the inclusion of unnecessary parameters leading to omissions errors i e areas being classified as climatically unsuitable while the ias was in fact able to get established there kriticos and randall 2001 chilcott et al 2003 williams et al 2003 b garp has an excellent predictive ability and is insensitive to bioclim s challenges with dimensionality of environmental data peterson and cohoon 1999 but both approaches tend to over predict habitat peterson 2001 padalia et al 2014 c the accuracy of garp models has been analyzed generally for species whose distributions are already known e g anderson et al 2002 2003 e g peterson 2003 loiselle et al 2003 furthermore there is no significant differences in model accuracy between garp and bioclim elith et al 2006 loiselle et al 2003 all models did show significant differences in spatial habitat predictions reflecting the inherent inter model uncertainty suggesting that predictive power significantly varies depending on the statistical algorithms used as also shown in a study by elith et al 2006 uncertainties exist in all statistical models phillips et al 2006 2009 however including weak base models in an em can weaken overall results stohlgren et al 2010 we therefore included only sdms with an auc of 0 7 or above while some knowledge of model performance is required to choose the ones to combine in ensemble modelling we considered the most commonly used models for our dataset to aid choosing from a wider range of models in the future a pairwise comparison of high performing algorithms could be considered our results show that em performed equally good as maxent which is in line with the findings from studies carried out by stohlgren et al 2010 and poulos et al 2012 however in our case performance differences between maxent and em were minimal and do not necessarily justify the extra work required to build an em selection of models do greatly influence the results though we tested the high performing models but still there are no previous related comparison studies using the same set of sdms for em our results might be affected by sampling bias non availability of absence data and individual model variances moreover we didn t calculated confidence intervals for our predictions so similar advance studies in the future would validate our choice of em furthermore ias habitat cannot entirely be defined by bioclimatic variables alone hence we suggest that future studies also address the effects of human induced spread we combined yushania maling habitat forecasts using the simple weighted summation approach as it offers a simple and straightforward way to unite various species distribution models and its output is easy to interpret our em produced good spatial correlation between potential habitat and actual presence relative to single algorithm predictions however the way in which individual model outputs are combined also affects the em results various ensemble methods are now available but one based on average function algorithms is likely to increase the accuracy of species distribution forecasts and thus exhibiting substantial potential for numerous conservation applications marmion et al 2009 to fully understand the reasons for em behaviour and results a wider study is required that addresses which aspects of em have the biggest impact on species distribution forecasts our modelling output shows that temperate conifer and broad leaved mixed forests are a preferred habitat for y maling which in turn leads to the outcome that protected areas like singallila np barsay wls neora valley np and senchal wls some of which are currently unaffected buy the species offer highly suitable habitat for the species this indicates a specifically high threat given the ecological relevance of these protected areas accordingly and not surprisingly we are therefore able to also reject our second hypothesis h0 2 the spread of yushania maling is limited no currently unaffected areas in the region are at risk of being invaded the invasion potential of yushania maling in darjeeling himalayas has reached alarming levels and is a great concern for policy makers in the region roy et al 2016 however there is lack of scientific information available regarding the management of invasive y maling while digging up and or repeatedly cutting bamboo plants appears to be the most successful countermeasure as reported by locals a better knowledge of habitat requirements will allow to ensure that the most sensitive areas are prioritized the distribution maps produced from this study will assist policy and decision makers to ensure all efforts to have the highest effectiveness overall our findings are in line with those presented by roy et al 2016 the authors used a graph theoretic network approach and maxent to model the potential connectivity of invasive species through natural areas and map their potential distribution the authors found that the forested regions of singalilla np senchal wls and neora valley np were the key vertices for the spread of y maling a finding that is in line with the results reported in this study however the authors modelled y maling suitability at elevations between 3600 and 1600 mamsl while we considered a wider range 3400 1300 mamsl when running maxent separately with additional elevation information table 4 using a wider elevation range was made possible by using different input predictor variables as well as model fitting and calibration techniques still both studies identified temperate conifer and broad leaved mixed forests as y maling s preferred habitat with the study at hand providing additional insight on the variation in spatial prediction patterns our results of climate change impacts on the distributions of invasive y maling show that in the a2a scenario higher rate of population growth and energy use the area suitable for the species increases by 30 km2 locations near bhutan and north of darjeeling will provide suitable habitat for a successful invasion in difference to that when applying scenario b2a lower rate of population growth and energy use the suitable area decreased to 13 km2 when compared to the current potential distribution of 1853 km2 thus we reject our third hypothesis h0 3 there is no difference in the potential habitat of yushania maling under a changing climate north west regions of darjeeling himalayas and regions of bhutan were found to be more uncertain with respect to habitat suitability in both the scenarios this might be due to high elevation changes in the region however we found that the overall spatial pattern of habitat distributions of y maling remains very similar to its present distribution a finding that will greatly help in formulating long term conservation and eradication plans climate change is inevitable and the himalayas are warming at much higher rates than the global average of 0 74 c over the last 100 years kumar 2012 kumar 2012 found that the higher elevations in the north of sikkim himalaya to be particularly affected by changes in climate with an 18 loss of endemic species based on our projections under scenario a2a and recent reports of increased anthropogenic pressure in the region such as intense hydropower development pandit and grumbine 2012 grumbine and pandit 2013 combined with ongoing deforestation pandit et al 2006 urbanization and tourism grumbine and pandit 2013 challenges in the region are likely to increase accordingly studies like the one at hand are of increasing relevance when it comes to directing mitigation efforts finally we advocate that em must be created using well trained individual models pertaining to idea that the better the individual forecast the better the resulting em will be resource managers should aim to use em over individual models to fully harness its potential to provide more realistic species distribution simulations a step that will with the advancement of technology will become increasingly easy acknowledgements this work has been carried out within the framework of the project

anthropogenic activity a growing ecological susceptibility due to climate change disturbances and other factors make the area prone to invasions by non native species invasive alien species ias are species that are capable of getting established outside their natural ranges they commonly show a high potential for spread and can become established outside their historical range causing often irreversible damage to the environment biological invasions have led to the extinction of thousands of endemic species in the past few hundred years mooney and drake 1987 and have homogenized the world s flora and fauna hobbs 2000 in the darjeeling region such invasions are causing considerable ecological damage to the native flora and fauna sekar 2012 yushania maling gamble is a native invasive species to the region the species was previously known as arundinaria maling majumdar et al 1989 in the yushania genus of bamboo in the grass family starting in the late 1980ies first occurrences were recorded in india s darjeeling district chi son and renvoize 1989 since then the species has been spreading at an alarming rate damaging the native fauna and flora roy et al 2016 by rapidly outcompeting native species stapleton 1997 the management and mitigation of ias has been at the center of attention of scientific research for many decades elton 1958 while numerous studies demonstrate the dramatic effect of invaders on recipient ecosystems mack et al 2000 other studies are working towards possible ways to tackle the challenges arising from biological invasions guisan and zimmermann 2000 scott 2002 as well as guisan and thuiller 2005 for example demonstrate the importance of species distribution modelling sdm in general and describe a variety of methods available for the prediction of a species potential habitat jiménez valverde et al 2011 advocate the role that sdm can play in risk assessment and conservation timely information about areas under risk of being invaded can help in devising effective control and eradication strategies aiding decision making by resources managers government agencies and non government organizations one way to identify potential areas of spread of invasive species is through modelling their current distribution padalia et al 2014 followed by species environment matching for areas outside a species current range the accuracy and performance of individual sdm varies widely among methods and species elith et al 2006 marmion et al 2009 methods integrating multiple individual models provide robust estimates of potential species distributions araujo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 ensemble maps that highlight areas of agreement among model predictions offer a way to reduce the uncertainty of basing management activities on solely one sdm model the importance of study manifolds taking into account that there are limited related studies in the past an increasing availability of spatial data as well as high resolution bio climatic data have continuously enhanced the prerequisites needed for successful sdm and assessment of factors affecting the magnitude and extent of a potential invasion using such data ensemble models em have the potential to provide more robust estimates of suitable habitat for a given invasive species at a given time meller et al 2014 poulos et al 2012 leading to robust sdm in em the predictions of a group of base models are combined to generate more accurate composite predictions particularly when analysing the risk of ias that have not yet spread to all suitable habitats the determination of species environment relationships can be challenging stohlgren et al 2010 in such cases em have the potential to highlight areas of agreement among models using a range of modelling techniques araujo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 stohlgren et al 2010 in recent years em methods have been improved in a variety of ways to produce more accurate estimates of species distribution and to facilitate conservation measures for e g comte 2013 assessed the influence of species non detection in modelling species distributions with an ensemble consensus approach and compared it with an occupancy model that accounted for species imperfect detection and found consensus models to outperform the occupancy models for the highly detectable species forester et al 2013 integrated two independent complementary methods em and statistical phylogeography and produced robust assessments of climate change impacts on species distributions whereas meller et al 2014 evaluated and compared the pre selection and post selection consensus approaches in conservation prioritization breiner et al 2015 in addition to introducing fresh approach of using ensembles of small models esm to model the distribution of rare species tested the approach more comprehensively on a large number of species including a transferability assessment recently naimi and araújo 2016 created a r based platform for species distribution modelling enabling ensembles of models to be fitted and evaluated the r package can generate ensembles of sdms and offers variety of options for the evaluation of the produced projections of species potential distributions in space and time a very recent r package ecospat developed by cola et al 2017 provide adequate functions to run the very recently proposed ensemble of small models esm approach breiner et al 2016 further using the r based package biomod2 devloped by thuiller et al 2016 gillard et al 2017 performed ensemble forecasting by using nine different algorithms including three regression based methods two classification based and four machine learning methods to forecast current and future potential distribution of three invasive plant taxa while it is generally understood that sdm derived using em can have a stronger explanatory power than sdm from individual models little is known about both the ideal combination of base models in an em and whether or not the benefits of em shown for well researched cases can also be obtained when working with limited data from specific case study regions where decision makers are facing pressure to act in a first step we therefore assess our first hypothesis h0 1 model performance of maxent garp and bioclim is similar to that of em when using field data for yushania maling successfully deriving an ideal modelling approach using limited real world data will additionally allow us to investigate a second hypothesis directly aimed to assist decision makers h0 2 the spread of yushania maling is limited no currently unaffected areas in the region are at risk of being invaded by answering this hypothesis areas under risk can be identified and required policies can be developed to ensure timely and appropriate counter measurements are implemented when it comes to ensuring a longer term applicability of answer to these two hypotheses it becomes evident that climate change has to be addressed as well climate change might impact the distribution and potential habitat of invasive yushania maling and eventually affect the effectiveness of control measures therefore to identify the impacts of climate change on potential distribution of yushania maling and to aid the long term ias management plan we investigate our third hypothesis h0 3 there is no difference in the potential habitat of yushania maling under a changing climate 2 methods and material to answer our hypotheses occurrence data was collected that together with additional data on bio climate and other ecological parameters were used to develop an em in the following we will be describing the study area our approach for collecting data in the field as well as the approach used for modelling 2 1 study area the study area is located in the darjeeling himalayas fig 1 india the area is located at 87 59 e 88 53 e to 27 14 n 26 27 n and includes the himalayan parts of sikkim nepal bhutan and bangladesh encompassing an area of 8812 km2 the region is home to a diverse alpine flora belonging to 60 families and 297 genera covering 60 of all alpine plant families and 10 of all the alpine genera known worldwide körner 1999 the total number of vascular plant species recorded across the region 1400 75 species is more than double of that recorded for the european alps new zealand alps and the rocky mountains region 600 650 species mark and adams 1973 hadley 1987 ozenda 1995 remarkably the darjeeling himalayas region is one of smallest regions in terms of geographic area yet has the highest number of species per km2 the area covers 3 national parks and 7 wildlife sanctuaries singalilia np neora valley np gorumara np jorepokhri salamander wls senchal wls mahananda wls chapramari wls pangolakha wls barsay wls and kitam wls the area is additionally covering a variety of climatic zones with distinct attributes leading to a comparably high overall biodiversity the region is also a source of vast variety of medicinal plants which are extensively used by local communities about 400 plant species mostly herbaceous endemics of high medicinal value are harvested in the high elevation grasslands of sikkim himalaya rai et al 2000 eventual loss of endemic herbs would greatly affect the socio economic structure of the community ecological alteration of the landscape and the associated changes in ecosystem structure and function following intrusion of yushania maling will substantially impact local livelihoods replacement of conifers and important flora like rhododendrons takus magnolia betula quercus etc will affect timber supply and wildlife in the area 2 2 data collection yushania maling in the study area based on a 1 km2 grid 56 locations were selected at which occurrence records of yushania maling was collected the surveys were carried out during the post monsoon period results were used for model parameter fitting 2 3 bioclimatic data and mapping current bioclimatic information at 1 km2 resolution is required to determine suitability of a specific area for yushania maling we derived 19 bioclimatic variables for the region from the world climatic research centre hijmans et al 2005 using diva gis software appendix table 4 additionally land use cover was generated from landsat satellite imagery obtained from usgs https www usgs gov the land use land cover map lulc of the case study area was prepared using landsat data from the year of the study to assess mapping accuracy kappa coefficient smits et al 1999 a discrete multivariate technique for assessment of mapping accuracy was used the kappa accuracy of the map was computed as 0 82 the geographic dimensions of environmental layers for the study area and pixel size was homogenised using the spatial analyst tool in arcgis ver 10 1 we reduced our full set of 23 environmental variables appendix table 4 to those with a significant impact by assessing their level of contribution to the final model using maxent variables with higher maximum entropy gains were retained further exclusion of the variables was carried out by examining co linearity the results of this assessment can be found in the appendix table 5 of each pair of highly cross correlated variables pearson correlation coefficient r 0 90 one was chosen considering its biological relevance to the species and ease of interpretation for inclusion in the model kumar and stohlgren 2009 for example if annual temperature and temperature seasonality were highly correlated we kept temperature seasonality since it captured a seasonal variability in temperature ultimately 5 significant environmental variables were selected for modelling potential habitat suitability of yushania maling table 1 table 2 illustrates the strength contribution of each of the 5 selected variables for yushania maling in describing their potential habitat suitability distribution max temperature of the warmest month was found to be the most significantly limiting factor for the species distribution in the case study area 2 4 current species distribution models for comparing model performance and to develop an ensemble prediction map for yushania maling in our case study area we chose 3 current species distribution modelling tools 1 bioclim version 5 1 nix 1986 martin 1996 2 garp version 0 5 stockwell 1999 and 3 maxent version 3 3 3e phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 the chosen models are easy to use batchable and have been providing regular robust estimates of predictions in various research wisz et al 2008 moreover they do not need absence information to model the distribution the models have proven to perform well with presence only data and differ both conceptually as well as statistically elith et al 2006 kelly and goulden 2008 while the models garp and bioclim have been established well before maxent their underlying modelling approaches have shown to be less efficient in comparison elith et al 2006 the sdms represents the inherent relationship between species presence and a set of environmental conditions but different sdm methods model this relationship differently based on underlying principle for e g bioclim deals with this relationship as a binary predictor and broadly defined bioclimatic envelope whereas maxent and garp include much complex nonlinear functions to model the relationship ju and santos 2012 bioclim was the first sdm to be developed for use by the wider public and laid the groundwork for most of the modelling tools existing today including garp and maxent booth et al 2013 the model interpolates a species bioclimatic envelope which is a summary of climatic conditions at locations where the species has been recorded hutchinson 1982 nix 1986 martin 1996 bioclim describes each species bioclimatic envelope in a range based manner suggesting that all locations with climatic parameters that fit within the extreme values determined at places of current species occurrences can be considered suitable habitat carpenter et al 1993 bioclim s categorical output is mapped to probabilities of 1 0 0 5 and 0 0 respectively garp the genetic algorithm for rule set prediction can find non random correlations between the presence and absence of a species and environmental variables it allows building species prediction models based on atomic logistic regression bioclimatic envelope and negated bioclimatic envelope rules and uses a super algorithm in a dynamic machine learning environment to do so payne and stockwell 1996 stockwell and peterson 2002 anderson et al 2003 garp works in an iterative process of rule selection evaluation testing and incorporating or rejecting to produce a heterogeneous rule set summarizing a species ecological requirement anderson et al 2002 maxent is the most current of the 3 tools and its development was in part based on previously developed sdms maxent is a software for modelling species niches and distribution by applying a machine learning technique called maximum entropy modelling from a set of environmental e g climatic grids and georeferenced occurrences the model expresses a probability distribution where each grid cell has a predicted suitability of conditions for the species phillips et al 2017 the software uses a generative approach rather than discriminative which can be an advantage when underlying data is limited additionally it allows direct integration with gis software such as arcgis making data handling and mapping of model outputs easy 2 5 modelling comparison ensemble modelling and future potential distribution prediction in a first step we created current probability maps showing habitat suitability for yushania maling with each of the 3 base modelling tools bioclim garp and maxent we used 75 randomly assigned occurrences as training dataset with the remaining 25 used as test dataset for generating modelling output from bioclim all values were kept at default levels in the modelling tool each model prediction was combined to represent composite prediction with an output pixel value ranging from 0 1 bioclim outputs are categorical probability values of 0 0 5 and 1 to generate single binary predictions using garp the logit rule was applied using default parameters 0 01 convergence limit and 1000 maximum iterations logit rules are an adaptation of logistic regression models or a form of regression where outputs are transformed into probabilities stockwell 1999 the linear limiting feature functions which are equal to continuous environmental variables were used to train maxent after realizing the small occurrence dataset and identifying appropriate feature shapes as suggested by merow et al 2013 initially the multiplier value was set to a very small value e g 0 02 with a default set of parameters leading to a highly over fitted model subsequently the multiplier value was increased and the modelled distribution and changes in auc area under curve or area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve was analyzed following an approach by padalia et al 2014 jackknife resampling was used to identify those variables that contributed most to the model the method provides a systematic method of resampling and leads to improved estimates of the sample parameter and a lower sampling bias tukey 1958 the logistic output of maxent with habitat suitability values ranging from 0 unsuitable to 1 optimal habitat was recorded accordingly habitat suitability was classified as unsuitable 0 0 25 least suitable 0 25 0 50 moderately suitable 0 50 0 75 and highly suitable 0 75 1 00 for garp and bioclim habitat suitability was classified as unsuitable 0 5 and suitable 0 5 in a second step we converted these habitat suitability maps into binary maps showing potential habitat versus the area not suitable for the yushania maling this step was necessary to allow the comparison of outputs of all 3 models and the creation of an em for the conversion to binary maps we selected a threshold from our test data in which the specificity was equal to sensitivity following an approach described by stohlgren et al 2010 finally we developed an em based map for yushania maling using a simple weighted summation approach for combining the 3 binary maps and then multiplying the resulting map by individual model performance following an approach described by poulos et al 2012 we chose the weighted summation approach due to its straightforward output that allows easy interpretation marmion et al 2009 ensemble scores in the modelled output represent the degree of model agreement a pixel with a value of zero indicates that none of the models predicted species occurrence at a specific location larger values indicated a higher prediction agreement among the 3 models which suggested that these locations were robustly estimated to be suitable habitat in a third step we projected the trained maxent model into future climates hadcm3 a2a and b2a scenarios using projection feature utility in maxent following padalia et al 2015 we retained the same thresholding criteria as discussed above in current maxent model in order to categorize into likewise occurrence probabilities model accuracy was assessed using the threshold independent receiver operating characteristic roc auc method auc is widely used for comparing species distribution model performance or statistical model performance in general the roc curve is defined by plotting sensitivity against 1 minus specificity across the range of possible thresholds sensitivity and specificity are used to take into account all elements of a confusion matrix true and false presences and absences the roc curve describes the relationship between the proportion of observed presences correctly predicted sensitivity and the proportion of observed absences incorrectly predicted 1 minus specificity a high auc score reflects that the model can discriminate accurately between locations at which the species is present or absent the auc measures model performance that ranges from 0 to 1 a model performs well when the auc is large usually auc values of 0 9 indicate high accuracy values of 0 70 0 9 indicate good accuracy and values between 0 5 and 0 7 indicate low accuracy for our model auc values were calculated using a web based calculator for roc curves eng 2006 we generated 100 pseudo absence points using arcmap by randomly generating points using a 100 km buffer around species presence records following poulos et al 2012 fig 2 displays the overall structure of the modelling approach 3 results 3 1 prediction of potential distribution model performances of maxent garp and bioclim were not similar to that of em the overall area of suitable habitat calculated using maxent garp bioclim and em were 1853 km2 2881 km2 2703 km2 and 2972 km2 respectively moreover spatial uncertainties also could not entirely be eliminated the modelling results obtained using maxent showed potential habitat for yushania maling in darjeeling phulbazar jourbunglow sukiapokhri rangli rangliot kalimpong parts of darjeeling district and adjoining areas of nepal bhutan and sikkim fig 3 while the results obtained using garp identified areas of suitable habitat in kalimpong gorubathan bhutan mirik jourbungalow and sukiapokhri that are overall larger than those derived using maxent and bioclim furthermore results obtained using bioclim showed an increased area suitability in sikkim and mirik compared to results obtained using other models field data and modelling outputs indicate that areas experiencing maximum temperatures between 12 4 20 c in the warmest months fig 4 and elevations of 1300 to 3 400 m above mean sea level mamsl are suitable for yushania maling suitable habitat for yushania maling was identified as up to a maximum elevation of 3400 mamsl in nepal adjoining to darjeeling district as well as at 2800 mamsl towards bhutan this modelled suitable region is also the maximum species richness zone 1500 2500 mamsl vetaas and grytnes 2002 although the predictive capacity of individual models differed as for example shown in auc scores area predicted to be suitable habitat matched with species ecology and field survey data in all cases except for garp which was found to over predict habitat suitability outside of the ias known ecological niche moderately and highly suitable habitat 0 5 probability for yushania maling predicted by models correlated well with occurrence records from field sampling table 3 the jackknife test identified max temperature of warmest month and min temperature of coldest month fig 5 as the most important environmental variables for predicting potential habitat suitability of yushania maling in the study area of the four modelling algorithms em and maxent did perform best with auc values 0 95 and 0 94 respectively garp and bioclim ranked the lowest with aucs of 0 82 and 0 71 while auc values were marginally different between em and maxent our results suggest that em has a higher accuracy compared to results individually derived using garp or bioclim maxent predictions and high ensemble scores were well in accordance with the presence records of y maling 3 2 impact of climate change fig 6 shows the potential range of yushania maling habitat modelled for the year 2050 under a2a and b2a climate change scenarios the results show that the yushania maling distribution area in a2a scenario remains relatively similar to its current distribution with 1853 km2 and 1883 km2 respectively however a transition is observed from moderately suitable areas to highly suitable in areas close to bhutan and in the north of darjeeling for scenario b2a the total area suitable for y maling was smaller 1840 km2 than that obtained under current climatic conditions and the a2a scenario the highly suitable areas 0 75 probability decreased from 260 km2 or 2 95 in a2a scenario to 245 km2 or 2 78 in size in the b2a scenario 4 discussion conclusions today various methods exist to assess potential habitat but only few studies directly compare their explanatory power specifically with ias is question in this study we visualized the differences between all three models from the simplest bioclim to the most advanced maxent we eliminated each model s potential drawbacks by adopting an ensemble approach while garp and bioclim performed consistent maxent and em did outperform them even though our em had the highest auc score for invasive yushania maling maxent did perform insignificantly lower accordingly our study revealed major variations in the area suitable for yushania maling derived using the selected modelling approaches therefore our first hypothesis h0 1 model performance of maxent garp and bioclim is similar to that of em when using field data for yushania maling was rejected our results generally support the use of em over individual sdms however em does not always outperform all other models in this case the individual maxent model delivered more accurate results nonetheless em can provide more realistic simulations of species spread and distribution because of the fact that they highlight the mutual areas of agreement among the individual models araujo and new 2007 marmion et al 2009 and further can accommodate wide arrange of algorithms so a decision to perform ensemble modelling with three well established sdm approaches can based on the following grounds a bioclim is one of the oldest known sdms and is widely used in different studies by a wide range of authors e g cunningham et al 2002 steinbauer et al 2008 loiselle et al 2003 meynecke 2004 walther et al 2004 but the method was criticised for the inclusion of unnecessary parameters leading to omissions errors i e areas being classified as climatically unsuitable while the ias was in fact able to get established there kriticos and randall 2001 chilcott et al 2003 williams et al 2003 b garp has an excellent predictive ability and is insensitive to bioclim s challenges with dimensionality of environmental data peterson and cohoon 1999 but both approaches tend to over predict habitat peterson 2001 padalia et al 2014 c the accuracy of garp models has been analyzed generally for species whose distributions are already known e g anderson et al 2002 2003 e g peterson 2003 loiselle et al 2003 furthermore there is no significant differences in model accuracy between garp and bioclim elith et al 2006 loiselle et al 2003 all models did show significant differences in spatial habitat predictions reflecting the inherent inter model uncertainty suggesting that predictive power significantly varies depending on the statistical algorithms used as also shown in a study by elith et al 2006 uncertainties exist in all statistical models phillips et al 2006 2009 however including weak base models in an em can weaken overall results stohlgren et al 2010 we therefore included only sdms with an auc of 0 7 or above while some knowledge of model performance is required to choose the ones to combine in ensemble modelling we considered the most commonly used models for our dataset to aid choosing from a wider range of models in the future a pairwise comparison of high performing algorithms could be considered our results show that em performed equally good as maxent which is in line with the findings from studies carried out by stohlgren et al 2010 and poulos et al 2012 however in our case performance differences between maxent and em were minimal and do not necessarily justify the extra work required to build an em selection of models do greatly influence the results though we tested the high performing models but still there are no previous related comparison studies using the same set of sdms for em our results might be affected by sampling bias non availability of absence data and individual model variances moreover we didn t calculated confidence intervals for our predictions so similar advance studies in the future would validate our choice of em furthermore ias habitat cannot entirely be defined by bioclimatic variables alone hence we suggest that future studies also address the effects of human induced spread we combined yushania maling habitat forecasts using the simple weighted summation approach as it offers a simple and straightforward way to unite various species distribution models and its output is easy to interpret our em produced good spatial correlation between potential habitat and actual presence relative to single algorithm predictions however the way in which individual model outputs are combined also affects the em results various ensemble methods are now available but one based on average function algorithms is likely to increase the accuracy of species distribution forecasts and thus exhibiting substantial potential for numerous conservation applications marmion et al 2009 to fully understand the reasons for em behaviour and results a wider study is required that addresses which aspects of em have the biggest impact on species distribution forecasts our modelling output shows that temperate conifer and broad leaved mixed forests are a preferred habitat for y maling which in turn leads to the outcome that protected areas like singallila np barsay wls neora valley np and senchal wls some of which are currently unaffected buy the species offer highly suitable habitat for the species this indicates a specifically high threat given the ecological relevance of these protected areas accordingly and not surprisingly we are therefore able to also reject our second hypothesis h0 2 the spread of yushania maling is limited no currently unaffected areas in the region are at risk of being invaded the invasion potential of yushania maling in darjeeling himalayas has reached alarming levels and is a great concern for policy makers in the region roy et al 2016 however there is lack of scientific information available regarding the management of invasive y maling while digging up and or repeatedly cutting bamboo plants appears to be the most successful countermeasure as reported by locals a better knowledge of habitat requirements will allow to ensure that the most sensitive areas are prioritized the distribution maps produced from this study will assist policy and decision makers to ensure all efforts to have the highest effectiveness overall our findings are in line with those presented by roy et al 2016 the authors used a graph theoretic network approach and maxent to model the potential connectivity of invasive species through natural areas and map their potential distribution the authors found that the forested regions of singalilla np senchal wls and neora valley np were the key vertices for the spread of y maling a finding that is in line with the results reported in this study however the authors modelled y maling suitability at elevations between 3600 and 1600 mamsl while we considered a wider range 3400 1300 mamsl when running maxent separately with additional elevation information table 4 using a wider elevation range was made possible by using different input predictor variables as well as model fitting and calibration techniques still both studies identified temperate conifer and broad leaved mixed forests as y maling s preferred habitat with the study at hand providing additional insight on the variation in spatial prediction patterns our results of climate change impacts on the distributions of invasive y maling show that in the a2a scenario higher rate of population growth and energy use the area suitable for the species increases by 30 km2 locations near bhutan and north of darjeeling will provide suitable habitat for a successful invasion in difference to that when applying scenario b2a lower rate of population growth and energy use the suitable area decreased to 13 km2 when compared to the current potential distribution of 1853 km2 thus we reject our third hypothesis h0 3 there is no difference in the potential habitat of yushania maling under a changing climate north west regions of darjeeling himalayas and regions of bhutan were found to be more uncertain with respect to habitat suitability in both the scenarios this might be due to high elevation changes in the region however we found that the overall spatial pattern of habitat distributions of y maling remains very similar to its present distribution a finding that will greatly help in formulating long term conservation and eradication plans climate change is inevitable and the himalayas are warming at much higher rates than the global average of 0 74 c over the last 100 years kumar 2012 kumar 2012 found that the higher elevations in the north of sikkim himalaya to be particularly affected by changes in climate with an 18 loss of endemic species based on our projections under scenario a2a and recent reports of increased anthropogenic pressure in the region such as intense hydropower development pandit and grumbine 2012 grumbine and pandit 2013 combined with ongoing deforestation pandit et al 2006 urbanization and tourism grumbine and pandit 2013 challenges in the region are likely to increase accordingly studies like the one at hand are of increasing relevance when it comes to directing mitigation efforts finally we advocate that em must be created using well trained individual models pertaining to idea that the better the individual forecast the better the resulting em will be resource managers should aim to use em over individual models to fully harness its potential to provide more realistic species distribution simulations a step that will with the advancement of technology will become increasingly easy acknowledgements this work has been carried out within the framework of the project

25211,forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating global climate change and this role has recently been further reinforced by the paris agreement however our knowledge with respect to the trade offs between timber production and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems is still seriously deficient therefore the overall goal of this study is to quantitatively analyze the effects of a set of economic and ecological constraints on the joint production capacity for forest timber and carbon by alternative forest management strategies for a large forest in northeastern china the proposed forest planning models integrate four alternative forest management strategies namely the timber oriented management strategy tms the carbon oriented management strategy cms the multiobjective management strategy mms and the resource restricted management strategy rms four different planning scenarios for each strategy were further generated by successively adding one additional constraint which mainly included the even flow of timber production the adjacent constraints of harvest activities and the minimum targets of carbon sequestration over a 50 year planning horizon the results showed that increasing the prices of carbon resulted in positive quadratic polynomial total and carbon net present values npvs positive logistic carbon sequestration and stocks and negative logistic harvest of timber and its npv for optimal forest management plans in which the carbon price of 100 per ton was a significant threshold for balancing the harvest of timber and carbon sequestration in addition to the cms our tested spatial and nonspatial constraints all showed significant effects on optimal forest management plans when a realistic carbon price i e 20 ton 1 from the carbon trading market in china during 2014 2017 was employed in which decreases of approximately 29 34 and 25 08 were observed for total npv when twenty percent deviations in harvest volume between any two consecutive periods were employed additionally two periods of green up constraints could further reduce the total npv by approximately 17 87 and 15 73 for tms and mms respectively when compared with their base scenarios however increasing the minimum carbon target by one percent reduced the total npv by approximately 29 44 per hectare per year when evaluated for rms our optimization framework not only can be replicated in other regions with similar characteristics but also contributes to the ongoing debate about the trade offs between carbon sequestration and wood production benefits keywords forest management timber production carbon sequestration area restriction model green up constraint carbon price 1 introduction forest management operations usually have significant effects on the structure and function of forest ecosystems therefore there is an obvious need to model the effects of various forest management prescriptions on the evolution of forest ecosystems over time to choose optimal management alternatives forest management optimization can provide the most desirable forest plans i e the temporal and spatial configuration of management actions in terms of the global objectives and constraints of the entire forest enterprise additionally it can be used to quantitatively analyze the potential uncertainty and risk of complex forest decision making processes including forest inventory errors growth prediction errors the performance of various product markets the preferences of decision makers the unpredictability of natural hazards and the effects of climatic changes pasalodos tato et al 2013 bettinger et al 2013 in recent decades public concerns about forest management have gradually transformed from traditional timber production goals to ecosystem based services e g carbon sequestration biodiversity wildlife habitat and recreational e g landscape aesthetics oxygen production values however the interactions among these multitudinous goods and services of forest ecosystems can either be viewed as a trade off or a synergy cademus et al 2014 which are usually present in typical nonlinear relationships meanwhile some additional nonlinear constraints are also necessary when other additional objectives are integrated and the interactions between the objective and predefined spatial constraints are also ambiguous thus considering more objectives may significantly increase the complexity of traditional harvest scheduling models and analyses of these problems are also becoming more time consuming and resource demanding recently the role of forest ecosystems in mitigating global climatic changes has been further supported by the paris agreement framework convention on climate change 2015 which was approved by approximately 175 countries worldwide in 2015 therefore each country that ratified the paris agreement should implement appropriate policies and provide positive incentives for reducing emissions for preventing deforestation and forest degradation and for increasing the carbon stocks of forests framework convention on climate change 2015 however the carbon benefits provided by forest ecosystems are generally considered to conflict with traditional timber production thus incorporating carbon objectives into the forest management planning process has created large challenges in forestry research and development in recent years some papers have successfully integrated carbon objectives into forest planning models for example backéus et al 2006 bourque et al 2007 hennigar et al 2008 raymer et al 2011 and chen et al 2011 incorporated carbon objectives into forest harvest scheduling models using traditional mathematical programming i e linear programming goal programming krcmar et al 2005 yousefpour and hanewinkel 2009 and baskent and keles 2009 further incorporated other forest management objectives e g biodiversity water and oxygen beyond timber and carbon benefits into forest planning models using linear programming these studies have increased our knowledge of the trade offs between timber production and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems but they focused only on nonspatial planning problems obviously the specific management prescription implemented in any given management unit or stand may have significant effects on the adjacent units e g the clear cutting prescription of one stand may increase the risk of wind damage zeng et al 2007 dupont et al 2015 or bark injury behjou 2014 in a neighboring stand therefore it is nearly impossible to simultaneously address several important social concerns in forest management practices without considering the spatial details planning problems can usually be classified into two categories i e spatial planning models and nonspatial planning models based on whether they contain the necessary spatial information generally nonspatial forest planning models are formulated with continuous variables i e the percentage or hectares of a specific stand in contrast spatial forest planning models mostly focus on basic management units or stands in which the decision variables are typically represented by binary variables that can take only the values of 0 or 1 there are various ways in which forest harvest spatial constraints can be integrated into forest planning processes mcdill and braze 2000 however the unit restriction model and the area restriction model are two of the most frequently used spatial constraint types in the forestry literature bettinger et al 2002 crowe and nelson 2005 öhman 2011 tóth et al 2013 borges et al 2015 these two approaches may be suitable for different planning problems murray 1999 and selecting an approach mainly depends on the size of the stand relative to the maximum opening area generally if the average size of the management units or stands across the forest landscape is similar to the maximum opening area then two arbitrary neighboring units cannot be simultaneously harvested under the unit restriction model planning approach however in the area restriction model planning approach two or more neighboring units can be harvested in the same period or in adjacent periods as long as their combined area does not exceed the maximum opening area murray 1999 in fact the unit restriction model can be treated as a special case of the area restriction model thus the area restriction model is typically a much more powerful and complex approach than the unit restriction model the effects of various harvest adjacency constraints on a set of important forestry planning problems have been evaluated by several previous studies that mainly focused on forest economic and commodity production boston and bettinger 1999 tóth et al 2013 wildlife habitat preservation bettinger et al 2002 öhman 2011 forest landscape maintenance baskent and jordan 2002 and water production baskent and keles 2009 the study by dong et al 2015a b to the best of our knowledge is the only study that has included carbon benefits in the consideration of harvest adjacency constraints i e area restriction model in forest planning however dong et al 2015a b focused only on the results of a set of different age class structures and did not consider the effects of various economic and ecological oriented forest management strategies on the carbon sequestration function of forest ecosystems the overall goal of this study is to quantitatively analyze the effects of a set of economic and ecological constraints on optimal management plans that include four alternative forest management strategies for a large forest in northeastern china our hypotheses were as follows 1 a threshold carbon price might exist that affects the balance between harvesting timber and keeping trees to sequester carbon and 2 spatial constraints may have much larger effects than nonspatial constraints on joint economic profitability when forest timber and carbon objective are considered simultaneously therefore the specific objectives are to 1 develop a spatially explicit forest management planning model that simultaneously considers carbon and timber benefits of forest ecosystems 2 optimize the proposed planning model using a heuristic simulated annealing process 3 analyze the sensitivity of the optimal management plan to various carbon prices and 4 evaluate the effects of a set of economic and ecological constraints on the optimal management plans for the alternative forest management strategies in all analyses the results are presented and examined based on the amount and the net present value npv of timber production and carbon sequestration over a planning horizon of 50 years 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area the study area of pangu forest farm is situated in heilongjiang province in the northeastern region of china fig 1 the study area comprises an area of 123 423 ha and approximately 96 72 of this area is subject to harvest scheduling the remaining area is mainly composed of settlements wetlands and mining areas the forested area has 325 compartments and 6421 subcompartments or stands with an average size of 19 21 ha each stand has different species ages site qualities and stages of development the forest contains coniferous and broadleaf species along with some forest openings the main tree species are larch larix gmelinii and birch betula platyphylla other species found in this area include pinus sylvestris picea asperata populus davidiana and salix matsudana of the total initial growing stock of 9 44 106 m3 the initial growing stocks are 2 43 106 m3 for larch forest 25 67 1 62 106 m3 for birch forest 17 17 3 16 106 m3 for mixed coniferous forest 33 46 2 02 106 m3 for mixed coniferous broadleaf forest 21 37 and 0 22 106 m3 for mixed broadleaf forest 2 30 the age class structure of the planning area is illustrated in table 1 2 2 forest planning model forest ecosystems provide a wide range of goods and services such as provisioning services e g timber and nontimber products regulating services e g soil protection and water resources cultural services e g recreation and employment opportunities and supporting services e g biodiversity and oxygen production all these services are important for human well being and environmental health however not all of these services can be quantitatively estimated in a way that is suitable for integration into the forest management planning process meanwhile because of global climatic changes in recent decades the current integration of carbon management objectives into the forest harvest scheduling process has drawn interest to novel goods and services provided by forest ecosystems in forest management practices thus this analysis is focused only on forest timber production and carbon sequestration rather than on the incorporation of several other forest values 2 2 1 timber production the development of forests was simulated using the standard stand level growth and yield model system of wang 2012 which consists of a site index diameter increment height increment tree survival basal area increment and volume models for all tree species in the study area fig 2 the volumes of various timber products i e sawlogs mining pole and firewood resulting from selective cutting at any age were determined by the available merchantable volume ratio tables db23 t 870 2004 2004 the allocated proportion of various timber products was significantly different for different species site qualities and mean stand diameters the financial information associated with timber production included all revenues and costs from harvest activities such as wood assortments revenues logging costs and management costs the prices of the various timber products of the five forest types were retrieved from the 2012 pricelist from the forestry department of heilongjiang province in northeast china the logging costs and management costs were estimated to be us 9 08 per m3 and 4 54 per hectare for this analysis respectively all revenues and costs were discounted to npvs using a 3 real discount rate as is generally applied to the financial analysis of forestry related activities baskent and keles 2009 dong et al 2015a b therefore the formulations associated with timber production can be presented as 1 h v t k i 1 m j 1 n p i t k a i v i j t x i j t t k 2 h v t 1 t h v t t 1 1 t k 1 k h v t k 3 p v t t i m b e r k 1 k p v t k t i m b e r k 1 k pr i t k l c h v t k t 4 n p v t i m b e r t 1 t p v t t i m b e r 1 p t 0 5 t p l where m is the number of management units i is an arbitrary harvest unit n is the number of management prescriptions j is an arbitrary management prescription k is the number of wood products k is an arbitrary wood production value containing the three wood products in this study i e sawlogs mining pole and firewood ai is the area of unit i vijt is the harvested volume per hectare of unit i with prescription j in period t and xijt is a binary variable indicating whether unit i is harvested with prescription j during time period t additionally pitk is the proportion of product k for unit i during time period t which was different for different ages and mean diameters even within the same unit hvtk is the total volume of product k in period t hvt is the total volume of all timber products for each time period hv is the total harvested volume during the entire planning horizon lc is the logging cost per cubic meter volume pr ik is the price of product k for unit i pv tk timber is the total present value of product k in timber period t pv t timber is the total present value of all products in time period t tpl is the time period length p is the discount rate in percentage and npvtimber is the total discounted npv of timber production during the entire planning horizon eq 1 specifies the harvest accounting variables of product k from time period t hvtk eq 2 first assigns the accounting variable hvtk to the total harvest accounting variables of all timber products for period t hvt and then aggregates the variable hvt to form the total harvest accounting variables of all timber products hv during the entire time horizon eq 3 first assigns the present value of product k from period t to the accounting variable pv tk timber and then it calculates the total present value of all time products in time period t pv t timber finally eq 4 is used to sum the total discounted npv of timber production during the entire time horizon npvtimber as implemented here all the revenues and costs associated with timber production would be discounted at the midpoint of each time period 2 2 2 carbon sequestration the carbon stocks and sequestration values for the entire forest ecosystems are typically difficult to quantify as the carbon flux process in forests might be influenced by various compartments such as living forest biomass e g trees shrubs and herbs soil organic matter and wood based products e g sawlogs mining pole and boards due to the enormous uncertainty and the significant spatial heterogeneity as well as the inaccurate information about the soil layer and understory vegetation i e shrub layer herb layer and litter layer of forest ecosystems the carbon stocks of these compartments were not included in the calculations in this analysis additionally the carbon stocks of various wood products were not considered in this paper mainly due to a lack of suitable models and reliable data on the releasing process of wood carbon in our study area therefore the biomass calculated here is related only to the above ground and below ground biomass of living trees with a dbh greater than 5 cm the volume for each forest stand was calculated using the standard stand level growth and yield model system wang 2012 and the corresponding living tree biomass was estimated using a fixed biomass conversion factor of 0 8992 for larch forest 0 9518 for birch forest 0 7986 for mixed coniferous forest 0 9284 for coniferous broadleaf forest and 1 1389 for mixed broadleaf forest which were determined using abundant anatomical trees across the entire region of northeastern china dong 2015 the total dry weight biomass of a management unit was finally converted to total stored carbon by multiplying by 0 45 therefore the net carbon sequestration in successive periods may be estimated as the difference in the total remaining carbon stock on forestland between one period and the previous period the financial value of carbon sequestration during the evaluated time horizon was determined by multiplying a carbon price with the amount of carbon sequestration in each time period and the resulting value was discounted to the npv using a real discount rate the carbon price was applied to the whole planning horizon and was also fixed for the whole planning horizon thus the formulations associated with carbon sequestration can be presented as 5 c s t i 1 m j 1 n a i c i j t x i j t t 6 δ t c s t c s t 1 t 7 p v t c a r b o n p c δ t t 8 n p v c a r b o n t 1 t p v t c a r b o n 1 p t 0 5 t p l where cijt represents the residual carbon stocks per hectare of unit i with prescription j in time period t cs t and cs t 1 are the amount of residual carbon stocks in time periods t and t 1 respectively t denotes the amount of net carbon sequestration from time period t 1 to time period t pc is the price of carbon stock per ton pv t carbon is the present value of net carbon sequestration in time period t and npvcarbon is the total discounted npv of net carbon sequestration during the entire time horizon for the whole study area eq 5 comprises the residual carbon stock accounting variable cs t which represents the total quantity of the carbon stock of the whole forestland in time period t eq 6 represents the amount of net carbon sequestration during time period t t namely the difference in the total carbon stocks of the whole forestland from time period t to time period t 1 eq 7 is used to calculate the total present value of carbon sequestration in time period t pv t carbon eq 8 sums the total discounted npv of carbon sequestration during the entire time horizon npvcarbon again the revenues of carbon sequestration were also discounted using a 3 discount rate at the midpoint of each time period 2 2 3 planning formulation the developed forest plans covered a 50 year time horizon that was divided into ten 5 year periods the timber production and carbon sequestration of the forest ecosystems were both calculated at the stand level the possible management prescriptions included three intensities of selective cutting treatments or the option to do nothing the selective cutting treatments included low intensity 10 middle intensity 20 and high intensity 30 harvest activities which were all retrieved from the forest management policy of heilongjiang province in northeastern china all treatments and the growth and yield projections of actual stands were assumed to occur at the midpoint of each period the minimum age at which the selective cutting treatment was applied in natural larch forests mixed coniferous forests and mixed coniferous broadleaf forests was 60 years and the minimum age for treatment in natural birch forests and mixed broadleaf forests was 40 years therefore the management objective was to maximize the discounted npvs of timber production and net carbon sequestration over the entire time horizon 9 maximize z npvx subject to 10 b l h v t 1 h v t b h h v t 1 t 1 2 t 1 11 t 1 t c s t c s 12 a i x i j t k n i s i m 1 t m a k x k j m u max i 13 i m a g e i j t a g e s min t j 14 t 1 t x i j t 1 i 15 x i j t 0 1 where z is the objective function that indicates the sum of the cumulative npv of the timber and carbon values in eqs 4 and 8 respectively x is a variable that represents one of the timber and carbon values or the total summed value of timber and carbon bl is the lower bound on the decrease in harvest level from one period to the next bh is the upper bound on the increase in harvest level from one period to the next cs represents the minimum target of the amount of carbon sequestration during the entire horizon k is an arbitrary management unit that is either adjacent to unit i or adjacent to a management unit that is adjacent to unit i n i is the entire set of all management units adjacent to management unit i s i is the entire set of all management units adjacent to the set of management units n i adjacent to management unit i which were formulated in the form of a recursive function murray 1999 t is an arbitrary time period and tm is the set of near time periods which represent the typical green up constraints murray 1999 for a 2 year green up constraint tm m1 t 2 m2 t 1 m3 t m4 t 1 m5 t 2 if mz 0 then tm 0 and if mz t then tm t u max is the assumed maximum concurrent harvest area ageijt is the stand age of management unit i when it was managed with prescription j in time period t and ages min is the minimum harvest age assumed for forest type s in which s is a variable that represents one of the five forest types eq 9 specifies the objective function of this problem i e to maximize the discounted npv of the timber and carbon values during the entire time horizon eq 10 restricts the deviation in harvest volume from one period to the next within an assumed proportion i e 20 in this analysis eq 11 indicates that the minimum carbon sequestration target identified for the planning horizon should not be violated eq 12 represents the area restriction model of the adjacency constraints provided by murray 1999 as implemented here a slight modification of the original area restriction model was employed i e the adjacency constraints focused only on the harvest time mainly because the clear cutting activities could not be utilized in this analysis eq 13 limits the minimum thinning age for each unit eq 14 prevents each management unit from being harvested more than once during the entire time horizon finally eq 15 indicates that all decision variables should be binary i e the arbitrary management unit should not be managed by two different management prescriptions throughout the entire planning horizon for testing purposes four categorical planning procedures were generated from previous formulations as part of alternative management strategies table 2 the objectives of the first category i e scenarios c1 c4 were to maximize the cumulative npv of carbon sequestration referring to the carbon oriented management strategy cms the objectives of the second category i e scenarios t1 t4 referring to the timber oriented management strategy tms were to maximize the cumulative npv of timber production the objectives of the third category i e scenarios m1 m4 which represented the multiobjective forest management strategy mms were to maximize the cumulative npvs of timber production and carbon sequestration together these three categories should all be subjected to the base constraints i e eqs 13 15 the even flow constraints of timber production eq 10 the green up constraints with zero periods i e eq 10 and the green up constraints with two periods eq 10 in addition to the three categories of constraints mentioned above the planning objectives of the fourth category referring to the resource restricted management strategy rms were to maximize the cumulative npvs of timber production and carbon sequestration together however this category should be further subjected to the minimum carbon sequestration targets i e eq 11 that are typically specified by forest managers and decision makers as implemented here the minimum carbon sequestration targets were calculated as the level of carbon sequestration over the entire time horizon in scenario t4 plus the percentages of the differences in carbon sequestration between scenarios c4 and t4 the percentages were assumed to be 20 40 60 and 80 in this analysis since carbon prices have significant effects on the forest planning process backéus et al 2006 raymer et al 2011 the effects of eight different levels of carbon prices i e 0 20 60 100 200 300 400 and 500 per ton of carbon on the forest planning in scenario m4 were quantitatively evaluated the value of 0 per ton of carbon reflects the present situation where the carbon objective has not been considered in forest management practices the values of 20 and 60 per ton of carbon represent the realistic range of carbon prices in the chinese market for carbon trading in 2014 2017 the values of 100 200 300 400 and 500 per ton of carbon are some relatively higher carbon prices that have been employed in other scientific studies backéus et al 2006 2 3 optimization technique due to the enormous complexity of the planning processes in our study the satisfactory forest plan for each planning scenario was developed using a heuristic process called simulated annealing which is a scheduling process that was inspired by the cooling process of hot material fig 3 simulated annealing has been used to address a set of forestry planning problems for example boston and bettinger 1999 crowe and nelson 2005 and pukkala and kurttila 2005 used simulated annealing to solve the adjacency restricted harvest scheduling problem öhman öhman 2011 used simulated annealing to model old growth interior bettinger et al 2002 used simulated annealing to schedule timber harvests subjected to wildlife habitat quality goals baskent and jordan 2002 employed simulated annealing to maintain forest landscape structure and dong et al 2015a b utilized simulated annealing to model the trade offs between forest timber production and carbon sequestration though simulated annealing has certain substantive limitations that may be worrisome to some forest planners this heuristic algorithm has been shown to provide very good solutions to various complex forest planning problems when compared to other commonly used heuristic algorithms bettinger et al 2002 pukkala and kurttila 2005 such as the monte carlo simulation the tabu search the threshold accepting method and the genetic algorithm in forest resource management the simulated annealing process begins with a feasible forest plan which is generated either randomly or using a deterministic method the simulated annealing search process then modifies the forest plan one aspect at a time which is called a move a move n s m of a solution s is a set of solutions that can be generated from s by a simple move m i e randomly changing either harvest timing or prescription or randomly changing both of them simultaneously for just one unit in our scenario to prevent the premature convergence to a local optimum moves that improve the quality of the forest plan are always acceptable however nonimproving moves may also be acceptable based on a probability 16 p exp u n e w u o l d t where u new is the objective function value of the proposed solution u old is the objective function value of the current solution and t is the current temperature of the annealing process which determines the probability of accepting nonimproving moves four parameters must be specified prior to using a simulated annealing algorithm the initial temperature the cooling rate the number of iterations to be performed at each temperature and a stopping criterion i e the final temperature these parameters are usually case specific which is useful for determining how long the search process should be run therefore arriving at an appropriate parameter set for a simulated annealing search process is always somewhat of an art the trial and error method is one of the most commonly used approaches used to determine the appropriate parameter values for specific planning problems in the forestry literature boston and bettinger 1999 strimbu and paun 2013 based on a series of quantitative simulations the appropriate parameter values for our planning problems were 10 000 degrees for the initial temperature 10 degrees for the final temperature 0 995 for cooling rate and 300 iterations at each respective temperature this process resulted in approximately 413 700 iterations per independent run the forest planning models that used the simulated annealing algorithm were encoded within the microsoft visual basic 6 0 programming language the solutions of each planning scenario were generated using a 2 6 ghz core i5 cpu with 4 gigabytes of ram and a windows 7 pro 32 bit operating system to minimize the random effects of simulated annealing ten feasible solutions were generated for each planning scenario from a random and feasible initial solution while only the best solution for each scenario i e the maximum objective function value was selected and analyzed in this paper as demonstrated in bettinger et al 2002 strimbu and paun 2013 and dong et al 2015a b 3 results 3 1 effects of carbon price on optimal management the effects of carbon price on the optimal forest management plan were evaluated only for scenario m4 in which the objective function was to maximize the joint discounted npvs of timber production and carbon sequestration of the forest ecosystem using a 3 discounting rate table 3 the total npv of the optimal management plan was 232 58 million when the carbon sequestration from the forest ecosystem was not considered as a source of income when the carbon price of 0 ton 1 was employed however the total npvs of the optimal joint plans reached 243 15 and 265 48 million respectively when the revenues from carbon sequestration were included with a realistic carbon price i e 20 and 60 ton 1 these values meant that revenues increased by approximately 4 54 and 14 15 respectively when compared to a carbon price of 0 ton 1 increasing the carbon price from 100 to 500 ton 1 further increased the revenues of the optimal management plans by about one to three times with respect to the plan with a carbon price of 0 ton 1 the timber npv with respect to the total npv of the optimal management plan decreased significantly with the increases in carbon price namely decreasing from 100 when the carbon price was 0 ton 1 to 8 14 when the carbon price was 500 ton 1 however the carbon npv and its percentage with respect to the total npv of the optimal management plans both increased significantly the npvs of total and carbon can both be estimated using a quadratic polynomial while the timber npv should be estimated using an inverse logistic function in which the determination coefficients i e r2 are all larger than 0 99 the amount of produced timber sequestered carbon and residual carbon stocks in the optimal management plans were almost the same when carbon prices ranged from 0 to 100 ton 1 however with the continued increases in carbon price i e 200 500 ton 1 the amount of timber production in the optimal management plans significantly decreased but the amount of carbon sequestration and residual carbon stocks increased significantly the abovementioned three variables can all be predicted using the logistic function and the values of r2 were as large as 0 95 when the carbon price was 0 ton 1 the assigned total harvest area was approximately 101 26 thousand hectares which accounted for approximately 82 01 of the total forestland within this management plan approximately 96 03 of the total harvest area was assigned with high intensity thinning activities however low intensity and middle intensity thinning activities accounted for only 0 94 and 4 29 respectively the assigned harvest area and their allocation patterns were almost the same when the carbon price was 0 ton 1 and when the carbon prices varied from 20 to 100 ton 1 the total assigned harvest area significantly decreased i e 82 19 thousand hectares when the carbon price was 300 ton 1 and the association patterns of the three thinning intensities were almost equal to each other increasing the carbon price to 500 ton 1 further decreased the assigned harvest area which accounted for only approximately 40 29 of the total forestland in contrast to the optimal management plan with the carbon price of 0 ton 1 the percentage of low intensity thinning within the optimal management plan when the carbon price was 500 ton 1 was significantly larger than that of the high intensity thinning activities the harvest area of total and middle intensity thinning can both be estimated using a quadratic polynomial r 2 0 9974 and 0 8525 respectively while the relationship between the harvest area and carbon price were respectively forward and inverse logistic functions for low r 2 0 9978 and high r 2 0 9942 intensity the amount of timber production and carbon sequestration in planning scenario m4 over the time period and the various carbon prices are illustrated in fig 4 as expected as the carbon price increased the timber volume produced in each period distinctly decreased however the differences in the amount of harvested timber in each period were not significant when the carbon prices varied from 0 to 100 ton 1 as the carbon price gradually increased the assigned harvested timber of each period decreased significantly compared with the harvest when the carbon price was assumed to be 0 ton 1 in all analyses of the carbon prices the assigned harvests of timber for each period were all subjected to the even flow of harvest volume objective in eq 10 for carbon objectives the differences in the amount of carbon sequestration in each period were also not significant when the carbon prices varied from 0 to 100 ton 1 however significant declining trends in the amounts of carbon sequestration were observed over the time periods when the carbon price ranged from 200 to 500 ton 1 the quantity of carbon sequestration in the first period of each 50 year planning plan was approximately three times larger than that in the last period for all of the higher carbon prices 3 2 effects of various constraints on optimal management the effects of various constraints on the optimal management plans were evaluated for all alternative forest management scenarios in table 2 using a realistic carbon price i e 20 ton 1 for carbon trading in the chinese market during 2014 2017 the npvs of the total timber and carbon of the sixteen alternative forest management scenarios are illustrated in fig 5 the differences in the npv of the total timber and carbon components for scenarios c1 through c4 were all difficult to distinguish when the carbon revenues were maximized individually for the timber production objectives t1 t4 scenario t1 produced a higher npv of total revenues than did the other scenarios over the planning horizon the even flow constraints of harvest volume i e scenario t2 had a significant negative effect on the total npv when compared to that of scenario t1 with the output reduced by approximately 29 34 the adjacency constraints i e scenario t3 had no significant effects on the optimal management plans when compared with those of scenario t2 and this was primarily because larger openings were used in this analysis however the total npv of the optimal management plans decreased significantly 17 87 when the green up constraints i e scenario t4 were further incorporated into scenario t3 the changes in the total npv in the mms i e scenarios m1 m4 were perfectly consistent with those in the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 mainly due to the relatively low carbon price i e 20 ton 1 employed in the planning processes however the responses of carbon npv to various constraints showed obvious opposite trends with respect to the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 and mms i e scenarios m1 m4 as expected as the minimum carbon target increased the npv of the produced timber decreased however increases in the npv of carbon were generated when the minimum carbon sequestration targets were incorporated into scenario m4 as emphasized here all revenues of timber and carbon objectives were profitable in the planning scenarios except for the carbon benefits in scenarios t1 and m1 which indicated that an unreasonable amount of timber was harvested under these planning scenarios during the planning horizon the amount of timber production carbon sequestration and carbon stocks of the various forest management strategies shown in fig 5 further verified the conclusions from an economic perspective when carbon revenues were the unique management objective the various constraints i e scenarios c1 c4 had no significant effects on the optimal management plans scenarios t3 and m3 produced more timber than did the other scenarios over the planning horizon while the amounts of timber produced in scenarios t4 and m4 were the lowest when evaluated for the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 and mms i e scenarios m1 m4 the values of carbon sequestration over the planning horizon all demonstrated significant increasing trends as the complexity of the planning formulations increased in contrast the carbon stocks had no significant increasing trend except for scenarios t4 and m4 as the minimum carbon sequestration target increased the amount of timber production decreased significantly however the quantities of carbon sequestration and residual carbon stocks both significantly increased when evaluated for planning scenarios r1 r4 the changes in timber production and carbon sequestration over time periods for the alternative forest management strategies are shown in fig 6 the amount of timber production for the cms i e scenarios c1 c4 showed a gradual increasing trend over the time periods in contrast the amount of carbon sequestration decreased significantly for scenarios c1 c4 as emphasized here the differences in timber production and carbon sequestration in the cms i e scenarios c1 c4 were all not significant over the evaluated time periods for the tms the amount of timber production in scenario t1 decreased significantly over the time periods specifically the harvest volume in the first period was approximately 2377 33 thousand m3 but the harvest volume in the last period was only approximately 0 30 thousand m3 as expected the amount of carbon sequestered in scenario t1 increased significantly over the time periods from 1576 57 to 287 88 thousand tons however the timber production and carbon sequestration values were almost the same for the optimal forest management plans of scenarios t2 and t3 which was mainly due to the larger openings that were used scenario t4 usually produced less timber in the first period but had approximately equal timber in the latter periods when compared with scenarios t2 and t3 the amount of carbon sequestration in scenario t4 showed significant opposite trends again the changes in timber production and carbon sequestration in the mms i e scenarios m1 m4 were all almost the same as the values in the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 finally the changes in timber production for scenarios r1 through r4 were all not evident over the evaluated time periods however the carbon sequestration decreased significantly over the time periods except for scenarios r1 and r2 in addition the amount of timber production within each period decreased dramatically for scenarios r1 r4 i e when the minimum carbon sequestration targets were used and increased but the amount of carbon sequestration significantly increased larger differences for carbon sequestration were observed in the first period i e approximately 189 94 thousand tons in the first period but the differences decreased significantly in the later periods i e approximately 32 23 thousand tons in the last period 4 discussions this study formulated a spatially explicit forest management planning model that incorporated carbon objectives into traditional forest harvest scheduling processes the effects of various carbon prices economic constraints and ecological constraints were quantitatively evaluated for certain alternative forest management strategies the results of the model outputs showed that increasing the amount of carbon sequestration can be attained at a significant cost in terms of forgone timber production and revenue returns similar results were also found in backéus et al 2006 baskent and keles 2009 baskent et al 2011 and raymer et al 2011 therefore if forest management organizations can alter or adjust their forest management policies such as from a tms to a mms they should evaluate the potential revenues and costs of these management strategies as well as the necessary constraints as demonstrated in this paper the unit monetary values of carbon are a critical financial economic factor that not only affects the revenues of optimal management plans but also has significant effects on the amount of timber production and carbon sequestration over the planning horizon clearly for long term forest management planning in northeastern china increasing the carbon price from 0 to 500 ton 1 significantly increased the amount of carbon sequestration however this practice also had dramatically negative effects on timber production in the optimal management plans the threshold value that affected the balance between harvesting timber and keeping trees to sequester carbon was estimated to be 100 per ton however this might be somewhat overestimated when compared with realistic carbon prices mainly because 1 not all the components of carbon sequestration related to forests and forestry were included which leads to an overestimation of carbon price when using an optimization technique 2 some uncertainty factors in the optimal management plans were not included for such large and lengthy planning efforts 3 some subsidies from the central and local government for management i e forest tending projects and protection i e natural forest protection projects of forest resources were also not considered from the perspective of optimization if a wide range of carbon prices can be evaluated as implemented in backéus et al 2006 raymer et al 2011 and qin et al 2017 then the amount of carbon sequestered can be treated as a dependent variable while the price of carbon can be treated as an independent variable and their relations can then be understood using a linear or nonlinear function which may be more practical in forest management practices however this method is of course an empirical result and is impossible to utilize in other regions thus the intrinsic mechanism regarding the trade offs between carbon price and carbon sequestration still requires further research efforts meanwhile all the price parameters including carbon and timber prices used in this analysis were deterministic however the introduction of a carbon price would affect the other prices in reality such as timber prices logging costs and discounting rates if one were to assume that the dynamics of all these prices would be utilized in the planning process then the methodology in this paper could relatively easily be reinforced by incorporating the adaptive prediction models of various prices into the model structure as constraints however we must leave this area of investigation for future research efforts mainly due to the lack of necessary predictive models for prices in this region the harvest volume flow constraints are inherent parts of any harvest scheduling model around the world e g boston and bettinger 1999 murray 1999 seidl et al 2007 öhman 2011 dong et al 2015a b and these constraints are often recognized as important to forest product industries to ensure the full utilization of equipment and labor martins et al 2014 the results of our forest management scenarios showed that the impacts of even flow constraints on timber production were all significant with the reductions in timber npv being as large as 29 34 and 25 08 for the tms and mms respectively when the even flow constraints eq 10 were incorporated into the planning formulations this result was perfectly in line with that from the study by baskent and keles 2009 in which the npv of revenues decreased by approximately 24 08 when the even flow objective was considered however a slight increasing trend i e approximately 5 10 was observed for the cms mainly because the amount of timber production under this management strategy was much lower than those of the other management strategies i e by an average of 9 13 in the harvest levels under other strategies thus the limitations of even flow on the optimal management plans caused fluctuations however the main drawback of developing a forest plan with an even flow objective is that the harvest level in one time period can limit the harvest levels in all the other time periods bettinger et al 2007 the reason for this may be that the harvest patterns of timber production are highly dependent on the initial landscape conditions such as the age class distribution stand density and site quality for example the harvest levels in older forests were usually significantly greater than those in younger forests zhu and bettinger 2008 as emphasized here the abovementioned studies analyzed only the trade offs between the even flow of harvest timber and economic maximization from the perspective of wood supply capacity from forest ecosystems while ignoring the importance of demand from the wood market in forestry johnson and scheurman 1997 have suggested numerous techniques for optimizing timber harvest and investment in public and private forests managed on an even aged basis therefore if the demand for timber from the wood market can be estimated in advance then this demand could be further employed in place of the even flow of timber requirements which might be more meaningful from the perspective of forest management practice spatial restrictions on the location and timing of harvest activities play an important role in maintaining the stability of landscape structures and the diversity of forest ecosystem services therefore spatial restrictions have become increasingly important mainly due to the recent developments in forest management regulations e g boston and bettinger 2006 and forest certification programs e g sustainable forestry initiative 2015 harvest adjacency and green up constraints are the most commonly used spatial restriction types in the forestry literature many studies have shown that increasing the assumed maximum opening size or decreasing the green up periods may be economically beneficial however these actions may also intensify the processes of landscapes or wildlife habitats fragmenting e g boston and bettinger 2006 martins et al 2014 borges et al 2015 dong et al 2015a b in this larger modeling effort the negative effects of adjacency constraints i e the green up constraints with zero period on the optimal management plans were all not significant in contrast approximately 5 10 0 40 and 1 31 increases in the total npv were observed for the cms tms and mms respectively the reasons for this result may be that 1 the average size of management units approximately 19 15 10 80 ha across the forest landscape was very different from the assumed maximum opening area i e 40 ha in this analysis and 2 the set of possible choices i e 30 potential management prescriptions for each forest stand was much greater than other planning instances thus the limitations of the adjacency constraints on the harvest activities might not be as strict as those implemented in other studies such as those by crowe and nelson 2005 boston and bettinger 2006 and tóth et al 2013 however our results from figs 5 and 6 further indicated that increasing the length of green up constraints from 0 to 2 periods had significant effects on the optimal management plans and the reductions in the total npvs were approximately 4 48 17 87 and 15 73 for the cms tms and mms respectively resource restrictions in forest ecosystems usually play very decisive roles in terms of carbon sequestration the reason for this may be that some of the forest stands have previously been protected to meet carbon objectives rather than be harvested for timber as expected the optimal forest management plans gradually changed toward lower harvesting values and increased protection values as the restrictions imposed by the minimum carbon objective increased the npv of the optimal management plans of the rms i e scenarios r1 r4 would be significantly decreased by an average of approximately 29 44 ha 1 yr 1 if the minimum carbon target was increased by only one percent this result also corresponded to a decrease of approximately 0 45 m3 ha 1 yr 1 in timber production and an increase of approximately 0 26 ton ha 1 yr 1 in carbon sequestration for the optimal forest management plans similar results were also reported in a study by keleş and başkent 2007 in which a decrease in timber of approximately 5 23 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and an increase in carbon of approximately 1 06 ton ha 1 yr 1 were observed when the minimum carbon target was increased by one percent obviously the magnitude of the increases in timber and the decreases in carbon are highly dependent on the planning strategies that are implemented for spatially explicit forest management planning problems which are typically formulated based on model i of johnson and scheurman 1997 it is well known that this kind of planning problem can be solved with normal linear programming tools e g glpk cbc cplex gurobi or lingo when the problem sizes are limited however some enhanced techniques such as the generalized management units formulation the bucket formulation the path formulation and the cluster packing formulation tóth et al 2013 might be more helpful to mitigate their disadvantages of being time consuming and not good at handling the spatial constraints of harvest activities when the planning problem sizes become very large as implemented in this paper i e 6421 units 10 periods 4 potential prescriptions however we also must admit that spatial problems are still difficult to formulate and solvers can require considerable time to process as these issues highly depend on the size and the complexity of planning problems meanwhile many previously studies have confirmed that the precision of simulated annealing can meet the requirements of forest management very well e g boston and bettinger 1999 bettinger et al 2002 pukkala and kurttila 2005 even when compared with the results from relaxed i e ignoring the spatial constraints linear programming boston and bettinger 1999 for an example reported that simulated annealing found the highest solution value for three of the four planning problems with different age class structures and were all less than 4 from the objective function values of relaxed linear programming therefore the robust simulated annealing algorithm was employed to solve our planning problem the coefficients of variation of the ten objective function values for each planning scenario only varied from 3 71 to 13 98 indicating relatively higher stability of the results from simulated annealing when using a self validation process that recommended by bettinger et al 2009 however some improved heuristic algorithms including simulated annealing such as the neighborhood search dong et al 2015a b hybrid search li et al 2010 and revision search bettinger et al 2015 are all promising for improving the optimization ability in addition a relatively outmoded programming language i e visual basic 6 0 was employed in this paper thus attempting to utilize other advanced programming languages e g c vb net may substantially shorten the optimization time a final point of discussion is that not all the components of carbon sequestration related to forests and forestry were included such as the carbon in the understory vegetation litter and soil levels in the forest ecosystem and carbon in the wood products in the forestry market in the field of forestry backéus et al 2006 baskent and keles 2009 and baskent et al 2011 have successfully incorporated the carbon components of various wood products into the planning process using strategies related to the lifetime of wood products seidl et al 2007 and bottalico et al 2016 incorporated almost all the carbon components of forests and forestry in a framework of multipurpose forest management planning using certain process based stand level estimators such as the 3 pg and invest models these valuable publications are all beneficial and promote the development of forest management planning however the applicability of these models has not been verified in our study area and some parameters within these models should be calibrated using our experimental datasets in addition removing nutrients e g stemwood and reducing organic matter inputs into forest soils through different harvesting intensities may affect long term forest soil fertility and stand productivity mack et al 2014 in turn affecting the carbon sink capacity of forest ecosystems especially on sites with coarse textured soils and low soil organic matter powers et al 2005 however this feedback is still difficult to quantify using mathematical formulas and it is currently impossible to integrate this relationship into the forest management planning process 5 conclusions this paper focused on a single forest area in northeastern china and the study was limited to only two forest values rather than incorporating many other forest values e g water soil biodiversity however it was sufficiently effective to illustrate the effects of a set of tested economic and ecological constraints on alternative forest management strategies the prices of carbon had significant nonlinear effects on the economic benefits and the amount of timber production and carbon sequestration when evaluated for scenario m4 using a 3 discounting rate in which increasing the prices of carbon from 0 to 500 per ton resulted in positive quadratic polynomial total and carbon npvs r 2 0 9996 and 0 9970 positive logistic carbon sequestration and stocks r 2 0 9830 and 0 9730 and negative logistic harvest of timber and its npv r 2 0 9890 and 0 9902 for optimal forest management plans the carbon price of 100 per ton was found to be a significant threshold for balancing the harvest of timber and carbon sequestration in addition to the cms our tested spatial and nonspatial constraints all showed significant effects on optimal forest management plans when a realistic carbon price i e 20 ton 1 from the carbon trading market in china during 2014 2017 was employed in which decreases of approximately 29 34 and 25 08 were observed for the total npv when twenty percent deviations in assigned harvest volume between any two consecutive periods were employed additionally two periods of green up constraints can further reduce the total npv by approximately 17 87 and 15 73 for tms and mms respectively when compared with their base scenarios however increasing the minimum carbon target by one percent reduced the total npv by approximately 29 44 ha 1 yr 1 when evaluated for the rms therefore the importance of evaluating the trade offs between forest economic benefits and ecological protections cannot be overemphasized for forest managers the above results are obviously strongly tied to the particularities of the study area although it is possible to transfer and implement our optimization framework in other regions when the necessary elements e g forest growth and yield models price parameters of various products are adequate however the effects of some uncertainties on the optimal management plans such as climatic changes unpredictable events e g wind damage fire hazard and insect injury and the intentions of decision makers may affect the applicability and these have been left

25211,forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating global climate change and this role has recently been further reinforced by the paris agreement however our knowledge with respect to the trade offs between timber production and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems is still seriously deficient therefore the overall goal of this study is to quantitatively analyze the effects of a set of economic and ecological constraints on the joint production capacity for forest timber and carbon by alternative forest management strategies for a large forest in northeastern china the proposed forest planning models integrate four alternative forest management strategies namely the timber oriented management strategy tms the carbon oriented management strategy cms the multiobjective management strategy mms and the resource restricted management strategy rms four different planning scenarios for each strategy were further generated by successively adding one additional constraint which mainly included the even flow of timber production the adjacent constraints of harvest activities and the minimum targets of carbon sequestration over a 50 year planning horizon the results showed that increasing the prices of carbon resulted in positive quadratic polynomial total and carbon net present values npvs positive logistic carbon sequestration and stocks and negative logistic harvest of timber and its npv for optimal forest management plans in which the carbon price of 100 per ton was a significant threshold for balancing the harvest of timber and carbon sequestration in addition to the cms our tested spatial and nonspatial constraints all showed significant effects on optimal forest management plans when a realistic carbon price i e 20 ton 1 from the carbon trading market in china during 2014 2017 was employed in which decreases of approximately 29 34 and 25 08 were observed for total npv when twenty percent deviations in harvest volume between any two consecutive periods were employed additionally two periods of green up constraints could further reduce the total npv by approximately 17 87 and 15 73 for tms and mms respectively when compared with their base scenarios however increasing the minimum carbon target by one percent reduced the total npv by approximately 29 44 per hectare per year when evaluated for rms our optimization framework not only can be replicated in other regions with similar characteristics but also contributes to the ongoing debate about the trade offs between carbon sequestration and wood production benefits keywords forest management timber production carbon sequestration area restriction model green up constraint carbon price 1 introduction forest management operations usually have significant effects on the structure and function of forest ecosystems therefore there is an obvious need to model the effects of various forest management prescriptions on the evolution of forest ecosystems over time to choose optimal management alternatives forest management optimization can provide the most desirable forest plans i e the temporal and spatial configuration of management actions in terms of the global objectives and constraints of the entire forest enterprise additionally it can be used to quantitatively analyze the potential uncertainty and risk of complex forest decision making processes including forest inventory errors growth prediction errors the performance of various product markets the preferences of decision makers the unpredictability of natural hazards and the effects of climatic changes pasalodos tato et al 2013 bettinger et al 2013 in recent decades public concerns about forest management have gradually transformed from traditional timber production goals to ecosystem based services e g carbon sequestration biodiversity wildlife habitat and recreational e g landscape aesthetics oxygen production values however the interactions among these multitudinous goods and services of forest ecosystems can either be viewed as a trade off or a synergy cademus et al 2014 which are usually present in typical nonlinear relationships meanwhile some additional nonlinear constraints are also necessary when other additional objectives are integrated and the interactions between the objective and predefined spatial constraints are also ambiguous thus considering more objectives may significantly increase the complexity of traditional harvest scheduling models and analyses of these problems are also becoming more time consuming and resource demanding recently the role of forest ecosystems in mitigating global climatic changes has been further supported by the paris agreement framework convention on climate change 2015 which was approved by approximately 175 countries worldwide in 2015 therefore each country that ratified the paris agreement should implement appropriate policies and provide positive incentives for reducing emissions for preventing deforestation and forest degradation and for increasing the carbon stocks of forests framework convention on climate change 2015 however the carbon benefits provided by forest ecosystems are generally considered to conflict with traditional timber production thus incorporating carbon objectives into the forest management planning process has created large challenges in forestry research and development in recent years some papers have successfully integrated carbon objectives into forest planning models for example backéus et al 2006 bourque et al 2007 hennigar et al 2008 raymer et al 2011 and chen et al 2011 incorporated carbon objectives into forest harvest scheduling models using traditional mathematical programming i e linear programming goal programming krcmar et al 2005 yousefpour and hanewinkel 2009 and baskent and keles 2009 further incorporated other forest management objectives e g biodiversity water and oxygen beyond timber and carbon benefits into forest planning models using linear programming these studies have increased our knowledge of the trade offs between timber production and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems but they focused only on nonspatial planning problems obviously the specific management prescription implemented in any given management unit or stand may have significant effects on the adjacent units e g the clear cutting prescription of one stand may increase the risk of wind damage zeng et al 2007 dupont et al 2015 or bark injury behjou 2014 in a neighboring stand therefore it is nearly impossible to simultaneously address several important social concerns in forest management practices without considering the spatial details planning problems can usually be classified into two categories i e spatial planning models and nonspatial planning models based on whether they contain the necessary spatial information generally nonspatial forest planning models are formulated with continuous variables i e the percentage or hectares of a specific stand in contrast spatial forest planning models mostly focus on basic management units or stands in which the decision variables are typically represented by binary variables that can take only the values of 0 or 1 there are various ways in which forest harvest spatial constraints can be integrated into forest planning processes mcdill and braze 2000 however the unit restriction model and the area restriction model are two of the most frequently used spatial constraint types in the forestry literature bettinger et al 2002 crowe and nelson 2005 öhman 2011 tóth et al 2013 borges et al 2015 these two approaches may be suitable for different planning problems murray 1999 and selecting an approach mainly depends on the size of the stand relative to the maximum opening area generally if the average size of the management units or stands across the forest landscape is similar to the maximum opening area then two arbitrary neighboring units cannot be simultaneously harvested under the unit restriction model planning approach however in the area restriction model planning approach two or more neighboring units can be harvested in the same period or in adjacent periods as long as their combined area does not exceed the maximum opening area murray 1999 in fact the unit restriction model can be treated as a special case of the area restriction model thus the area restriction model is typically a much more powerful and complex approach than the unit restriction model the effects of various harvest adjacency constraints on a set of important forestry planning problems have been evaluated by several previous studies that mainly focused on forest economic and commodity production boston and bettinger 1999 tóth et al 2013 wildlife habitat preservation bettinger et al 2002 öhman 2011 forest landscape maintenance baskent and jordan 2002 and water production baskent and keles 2009 the study by dong et al 2015a b to the best of our knowledge is the only study that has included carbon benefits in the consideration of harvest adjacency constraints i e area restriction model in forest planning however dong et al 2015a b focused only on the results of a set of different age class structures and did not consider the effects of various economic and ecological oriented forest management strategies on the carbon sequestration function of forest ecosystems the overall goal of this study is to quantitatively analyze the effects of a set of economic and ecological constraints on optimal management plans that include four alternative forest management strategies for a large forest in northeastern china our hypotheses were as follows 1 a threshold carbon price might exist that affects the balance between harvesting timber and keeping trees to sequester carbon and 2 spatial constraints may have much larger effects than nonspatial constraints on joint economic profitability when forest timber and carbon objective are considered simultaneously therefore the specific objectives are to 1 develop a spatially explicit forest management planning model that simultaneously considers carbon and timber benefits of forest ecosystems 2 optimize the proposed planning model using a heuristic simulated annealing process 3 analyze the sensitivity of the optimal management plan to various carbon prices and 4 evaluate the effects of a set of economic and ecological constraints on the optimal management plans for the alternative forest management strategies in all analyses the results are presented and examined based on the amount and the net present value npv of timber production and carbon sequestration over a planning horizon of 50 years 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study area the study area of pangu forest farm is situated in heilongjiang province in the northeastern region of china fig 1 the study area comprises an area of 123 423 ha and approximately 96 72 of this area is subject to harvest scheduling the remaining area is mainly composed of settlements wetlands and mining areas the forested area has 325 compartments and 6421 subcompartments or stands with an average size of 19 21 ha each stand has different species ages site qualities and stages of development the forest contains coniferous and broadleaf species along with some forest openings the main tree species are larch larix gmelinii and birch betula platyphylla other species found in this area include pinus sylvestris picea asperata populus davidiana and salix matsudana of the total initial growing stock of 9 44 106 m3 the initial growing stocks are 2 43 106 m3 for larch forest 25 67 1 62 106 m3 for birch forest 17 17 3 16 106 m3 for mixed coniferous forest 33 46 2 02 106 m3 for mixed coniferous broadleaf forest 21 37 and 0 22 106 m3 for mixed broadleaf forest 2 30 the age class structure of the planning area is illustrated in table 1 2 2 forest planning model forest ecosystems provide a wide range of goods and services such as provisioning services e g timber and nontimber products regulating services e g soil protection and water resources cultural services e g recreation and employment opportunities and supporting services e g biodiversity and oxygen production all these services are important for human well being and environmental health however not all of these services can be quantitatively estimated in a way that is suitable for integration into the forest management planning process meanwhile because of global climatic changes in recent decades the current integration of carbon management objectives into the forest harvest scheduling process has drawn interest to novel goods and services provided by forest ecosystems in forest management practices thus this analysis is focused only on forest timber production and carbon sequestration rather than on the incorporation of several other forest values 2 2 1 timber production the development of forests was simulated using the standard stand level growth and yield model system of wang 2012 which consists of a site index diameter increment height increment tree survival basal area increment and volume models for all tree species in the study area fig 2 the volumes of various timber products i e sawlogs mining pole and firewood resulting from selective cutting at any age were determined by the available merchantable volume ratio tables db23 t 870 2004 2004 the allocated proportion of various timber products was significantly different for different species site qualities and mean stand diameters the financial information associated with timber production included all revenues and costs from harvest activities such as wood assortments revenues logging costs and management costs the prices of the various timber products of the five forest types were retrieved from the 2012 pricelist from the forestry department of heilongjiang province in northeast china the logging costs and management costs were estimated to be us 9 08 per m3 and 4 54 per hectare for this analysis respectively all revenues and costs were discounted to npvs using a 3 real discount rate as is generally applied to the financial analysis of forestry related activities baskent and keles 2009 dong et al 2015a b therefore the formulations associated with timber production can be presented as 1 h v t k i 1 m j 1 n p i t k a i v i j t x i j t t k 2 h v t 1 t h v t t 1 1 t k 1 k h v t k 3 p v t t i m b e r k 1 k p v t k t i m b e r k 1 k pr i t k l c h v t k t 4 n p v t i m b e r t 1 t p v t t i m b e r 1 p t 0 5 t p l where m is the number of management units i is an arbitrary harvest unit n is the number of management prescriptions j is an arbitrary management prescription k is the number of wood products k is an arbitrary wood production value containing the three wood products in this study i e sawlogs mining pole and firewood ai is the area of unit i vijt is the harvested volume per hectare of unit i with prescription j in period t and xijt is a binary variable indicating whether unit i is harvested with prescription j during time period t additionally pitk is the proportion of product k for unit i during time period t which was different for different ages and mean diameters even within the same unit hvtk is the total volume of product k in period t hvt is the total volume of all timber products for each time period hv is the total harvested volume during the entire planning horizon lc is the logging cost per cubic meter volume pr ik is the price of product k for unit i pv tk timber is the total present value of product k in timber period t pv t timber is the total present value of all products in time period t tpl is the time period length p is the discount rate in percentage and npvtimber is the total discounted npv of timber production during the entire planning horizon eq 1 specifies the harvest accounting variables of product k from time period t hvtk eq 2 first assigns the accounting variable hvtk to the total harvest accounting variables of all timber products for period t hvt and then aggregates the variable hvt to form the total harvest accounting variables of all timber products hv during the entire time horizon eq 3 first assigns the present value of product k from period t to the accounting variable pv tk timber and then it calculates the total present value of all time products in time period t pv t timber finally eq 4 is used to sum the total discounted npv of timber production during the entire time horizon npvtimber as implemented here all the revenues and costs associated with timber production would be discounted at the midpoint of each time period 2 2 2 carbon sequestration the carbon stocks and sequestration values for the entire forest ecosystems are typically difficult to quantify as the carbon flux process in forests might be influenced by various compartments such as living forest biomass e g trees shrubs and herbs soil organic matter and wood based products e g sawlogs mining pole and boards due to the enormous uncertainty and the significant spatial heterogeneity as well as the inaccurate information about the soil layer and understory vegetation i e shrub layer herb layer and litter layer of forest ecosystems the carbon stocks of these compartments were not included in the calculations in this analysis additionally the carbon stocks of various wood products were not considered in this paper mainly due to a lack of suitable models and reliable data on the releasing process of wood carbon in our study area therefore the biomass calculated here is related only to the above ground and below ground biomass of living trees with a dbh greater than 5 cm the volume for each forest stand was calculated using the standard stand level growth and yield model system wang 2012 and the corresponding living tree biomass was estimated using a fixed biomass conversion factor of 0 8992 for larch forest 0 9518 for birch forest 0 7986 for mixed coniferous forest 0 9284 for coniferous broadleaf forest and 1 1389 for mixed broadleaf forest which were determined using abundant anatomical trees across the entire region of northeastern china dong 2015 the total dry weight biomass of a management unit was finally converted to total stored carbon by multiplying by 0 45 therefore the net carbon sequestration in successive periods may be estimated as the difference in the total remaining carbon stock on forestland between one period and the previous period the financial value of carbon sequestration during the evaluated time horizon was determined by multiplying a carbon price with the amount of carbon sequestration in each time period and the resulting value was discounted to the npv using a real discount rate the carbon price was applied to the whole planning horizon and was also fixed for the whole planning horizon thus the formulations associated with carbon sequestration can be presented as 5 c s t i 1 m j 1 n a i c i j t x i j t t 6 δ t c s t c s t 1 t 7 p v t c a r b o n p c δ t t 8 n p v c a r b o n t 1 t p v t c a r b o n 1 p t 0 5 t p l where cijt represents the residual carbon stocks per hectare of unit i with prescription j in time period t cs t and cs t 1 are the amount of residual carbon stocks in time periods t and t 1 respectively t denotes the amount of net carbon sequestration from time period t 1 to time period t pc is the price of carbon stock per ton pv t carbon is the present value of net carbon sequestration in time period t and npvcarbon is the total discounted npv of net carbon sequestration during the entire time horizon for the whole study area eq 5 comprises the residual carbon stock accounting variable cs t which represents the total quantity of the carbon stock of the whole forestland in time period t eq 6 represents the amount of net carbon sequestration during time period t t namely the difference in the total carbon stocks of the whole forestland from time period t to time period t 1 eq 7 is used to calculate the total present value of carbon sequestration in time period t pv t carbon eq 8 sums the total discounted npv of carbon sequestration during the entire time horizon npvcarbon again the revenues of carbon sequestration were also discounted using a 3 discount rate at the midpoint of each time period 2 2 3 planning formulation the developed forest plans covered a 50 year time horizon that was divided into ten 5 year periods the timber production and carbon sequestration of the forest ecosystems were both calculated at the stand level the possible management prescriptions included three intensities of selective cutting treatments or the option to do nothing the selective cutting treatments included low intensity 10 middle intensity 20 and high intensity 30 harvest activities which were all retrieved from the forest management policy of heilongjiang province in northeastern china all treatments and the growth and yield projections of actual stands were assumed to occur at the midpoint of each period the minimum age at which the selective cutting treatment was applied in natural larch forests mixed coniferous forests and mixed coniferous broadleaf forests was 60 years and the minimum age for treatment in natural birch forests and mixed broadleaf forests was 40 years therefore the management objective was to maximize the discounted npvs of timber production and net carbon sequestration over the entire time horizon 9 maximize z npvx subject to 10 b l h v t 1 h v t b h h v t 1 t 1 2 t 1 11 t 1 t c s t c s 12 a i x i j t k n i s i m 1 t m a k x k j m u max i 13 i m a g e i j t a g e s min t j 14 t 1 t x i j t 1 i 15 x i j t 0 1 where z is the objective function that indicates the sum of the cumulative npv of the timber and carbon values in eqs 4 and 8 respectively x is a variable that represents one of the timber and carbon values or the total summed value of timber and carbon bl is the lower bound on the decrease in harvest level from one period to the next bh is the upper bound on the increase in harvest level from one period to the next cs represents the minimum target of the amount of carbon sequestration during the entire horizon k is an arbitrary management unit that is either adjacent to unit i or adjacent to a management unit that is adjacent to unit i n i is the entire set of all management units adjacent to management unit i s i is the entire set of all management units adjacent to the set of management units n i adjacent to management unit i which were formulated in the form of a recursive function murray 1999 t is an arbitrary time period and tm is the set of near time periods which represent the typical green up constraints murray 1999 for a 2 year green up constraint tm m1 t 2 m2 t 1 m3 t m4 t 1 m5 t 2 if mz 0 then tm 0 and if mz t then tm t u max is the assumed maximum concurrent harvest area ageijt is the stand age of management unit i when it was managed with prescription j in time period t and ages min is the minimum harvest age assumed for forest type s in which s is a variable that represents one of the five forest types eq 9 specifies the objective function of this problem i e to maximize the discounted npv of the timber and carbon values during the entire time horizon eq 10 restricts the deviation in harvest volume from one period to the next within an assumed proportion i e 20 in this analysis eq 11 indicates that the minimum carbon sequestration target identified for the planning horizon should not be violated eq 12 represents the area restriction model of the adjacency constraints provided by murray 1999 as implemented here a slight modification of the original area restriction model was employed i e the adjacency constraints focused only on the harvest time mainly because the clear cutting activities could not be utilized in this analysis eq 13 limits the minimum thinning age for each unit eq 14 prevents each management unit from being harvested more than once during the entire time horizon finally eq 15 indicates that all decision variables should be binary i e the arbitrary management unit should not be managed by two different management prescriptions throughout the entire planning horizon for testing purposes four categorical planning procedures were generated from previous formulations as part of alternative management strategies table 2 the objectives of the first category i e scenarios c1 c4 were to maximize the cumulative npv of carbon sequestration referring to the carbon oriented management strategy cms the objectives of the second category i e scenarios t1 t4 referring to the timber oriented management strategy tms were to maximize the cumulative npv of timber production the objectives of the third category i e scenarios m1 m4 which represented the multiobjective forest management strategy mms were to maximize the cumulative npvs of timber production and carbon sequestration together these three categories should all be subjected to the base constraints i e eqs 13 15 the even flow constraints of timber production eq 10 the green up constraints with zero periods i e eq 10 and the green up constraints with two periods eq 10 in addition to the three categories of constraints mentioned above the planning objectives of the fourth category referring to the resource restricted management strategy rms were to maximize the cumulative npvs of timber production and carbon sequestration together however this category should be further subjected to the minimum carbon sequestration targets i e eq 11 that are typically specified by forest managers and decision makers as implemented here the minimum carbon sequestration targets were calculated as the level of carbon sequestration over the entire time horizon in scenario t4 plus the percentages of the differences in carbon sequestration between scenarios c4 and t4 the percentages were assumed to be 20 40 60 and 80 in this analysis since carbon prices have significant effects on the forest planning process backéus et al 2006 raymer et al 2011 the effects of eight different levels of carbon prices i e 0 20 60 100 200 300 400 and 500 per ton of carbon on the forest planning in scenario m4 were quantitatively evaluated the value of 0 per ton of carbon reflects the present situation where the carbon objective has not been considered in forest management practices the values of 20 and 60 per ton of carbon represent the realistic range of carbon prices in the chinese market for carbon trading in 2014 2017 the values of 100 200 300 400 and 500 per ton of carbon are some relatively higher carbon prices that have been employed in other scientific studies backéus et al 2006 2 3 optimization technique due to the enormous complexity of the planning processes in our study the satisfactory forest plan for each planning scenario was developed using a heuristic process called simulated annealing which is a scheduling process that was inspired by the cooling process of hot material fig 3 simulated annealing has been used to address a set of forestry planning problems for example boston and bettinger 1999 crowe and nelson 2005 and pukkala and kurttila 2005 used simulated annealing to solve the adjacency restricted harvest scheduling problem öhman öhman 2011 used simulated annealing to model old growth interior bettinger et al 2002 used simulated annealing to schedule timber harvests subjected to wildlife habitat quality goals baskent and jordan 2002 employed simulated annealing to maintain forest landscape structure and dong et al 2015a b utilized simulated annealing to model the trade offs between forest timber production and carbon sequestration though simulated annealing has certain substantive limitations that may be worrisome to some forest planners this heuristic algorithm has been shown to provide very good solutions to various complex forest planning problems when compared to other commonly used heuristic algorithms bettinger et al 2002 pukkala and kurttila 2005 such as the monte carlo simulation the tabu search the threshold accepting method and the genetic algorithm in forest resource management the simulated annealing process begins with a feasible forest plan which is generated either randomly or using a deterministic method the simulated annealing search process then modifies the forest plan one aspect at a time which is called a move a move n s m of a solution s is a set of solutions that can be generated from s by a simple move m i e randomly changing either harvest timing or prescription or randomly changing both of them simultaneously for just one unit in our scenario to prevent the premature convergence to a local optimum moves that improve the quality of the forest plan are always acceptable however nonimproving moves may also be acceptable based on a probability 16 p exp u n e w u o l d t where u new is the objective function value of the proposed solution u old is the objective function value of the current solution and t is the current temperature of the annealing process which determines the probability of accepting nonimproving moves four parameters must be specified prior to using a simulated annealing algorithm the initial temperature the cooling rate the number of iterations to be performed at each temperature and a stopping criterion i e the final temperature these parameters are usually case specific which is useful for determining how long the search process should be run therefore arriving at an appropriate parameter set for a simulated annealing search process is always somewhat of an art the trial and error method is one of the most commonly used approaches used to determine the appropriate parameter values for specific planning problems in the forestry literature boston and bettinger 1999 strimbu and paun 2013 based on a series of quantitative simulations the appropriate parameter values for our planning problems were 10 000 degrees for the initial temperature 10 degrees for the final temperature 0 995 for cooling rate and 300 iterations at each respective temperature this process resulted in approximately 413 700 iterations per independent run the forest planning models that used the simulated annealing algorithm were encoded within the microsoft visual basic 6 0 programming language the solutions of each planning scenario were generated using a 2 6 ghz core i5 cpu with 4 gigabytes of ram and a windows 7 pro 32 bit operating system to minimize the random effects of simulated annealing ten feasible solutions were generated for each planning scenario from a random and feasible initial solution while only the best solution for each scenario i e the maximum objective function value was selected and analyzed in this paper as demonstrated in bettinger et al 2002 strimbu and paun 2013 and dong et al 2015a b 3 results 3 1 effects of carbon price on optimal management the effects of carbon price on the optimal forest management plan were evaluated only for scenario m4 in which the objective function was to maximize the joint discounted npvs of timber production and carbon sequestration of the forest ecosystem using a 3 discounting rate table 3 the total npv of the optimal management plan was 232 58 million when the carbon sequestration from the forest ecosystem was not considered as a source of income when the carbon price of 0 ton 1 was employed however the total npvs of the optimal joint plans reached 243 15 and 265 48 million respectively when the revenues from carbon sequestration were included with a realistic carbon price i e 20 and 60 ton 1 these values meant that revenues increased by approximately 4 54 and 14 15 respectively when compared to a carbon price of 0 ton 1 increasing the carbon price from 100 to 500 ton 1 further increased the revenues of the optimal management plans by about one to three times with respect to the plan with a carbon price of 0 ton 1 the timber npv with respect to the total npv of the optimal management plan decreased significantly with the increases in carbon price namely decreasing from 100 when the carbon price was 0 ton 1 to 8 14 when the carbon price was 500 ton 1 however the carbon npv and its percentage with respect to the total npv of the optimal management plans both increased significantly the npvs of total and carbon can both be estimated using a quadratic polynomial while the timber npv should be estimated using an inverse logistic function in which the determination coefficients i e r2 are all larger than 0 99 the amount of produced timber sequestered carbon and residual carbon stocks in the optimal management plans were almost the same when carbon prices ranged from 0 to 100 ton 1 however with the continued increases in carbon price i e 200 500 ton 1 the amount of timber production in the optimal management plans significantly decreased but the amount of carbon sequestration and residual carbon stocks increased significantly the abovementioned three variables can all be predicted using the logistic function and the values of r2 were as large as 0 95 when the carbon price was 0 ton 1 the assigned total harvest area was approximately 101 26 thousand hectares which accounted for approximately 82 01 of the total forestland within this management plan approximately 96 03 of the total harvest area was assigned with high intensity thinning activities however low intensity and middle intensity thinning activities accounted for only 0 94 and 4 29 respectively the assigned harvest area and their allocation patterns were almost the same when the carbon price was 0 ton 1 and when the carbon prices varied from 20 to 100 ton 1 the total assigned harvest area significantly decreased i e 82 19 thousand hectares when the carbon price was 300 ton 1 and the association patterns of the three thinning intensities were almost equal to each other increasing the carbon price to 500 ton 1 further decreased the assigned harvest area which accounted for only approximately 40 29 of the total forestland in contrast to the optimal management plan with the carbon price of 0 ton 1 the percentage of low intensity thinning within the optimal management plan when the carbon price was 500 ton 1 was significantly larger than that of the high intensity thinning activities the harvest area of total and middle intensity thinning can both be estimated using a quadratic polynomial r 2 0 9974 and 0 8525 respectively while the relationship between the harvest area and carbon price were respectively forward and inverse logistic functions for low r 2 0 9978 and high r 2 0 9942 intensity the amount of timber production and carbon sequestration in planning scenario m4 over the time period and the various carbon prices are illustrated in fig 4 as expected as the carbon price increased the timber volume produced in each period distinctly decreased however the differences in the amount of harvested timber in each period were not significant when the carbon prices varied from 0 to 100 ton 1 as the carbon price gradually increased the assigned harvested timber of each period decreased significantly compared with the harvest when the carbon price was assumed to be 0 ton 1 in all analyses of the carbon prices the assigned harvests of timber for each period were all subjected to the even flow of harvest volume objective in eq 10 for carbon objectives the differences in the amount of carbon sequestration in each period were also not significant when the carbon prices varied from 0 to 100 ton 1 however significant declining trends in the amounts of carbon sequestration were observed over the time periods when the carbon price ranged from 200 to 500 ton 1 the quantity of carbon sequestration in the first period of each 50 year planning plan was approximately three times larger than that in the last period for all of the higher carbon prices 3 2 effects of various constraints on optimal management the effects of various constraints on the optimal management plans were evaluated for all alternative forest management scenarios in table 2 using a realistic carbon price i e 20 ton 1 for carbon trading in the chinese market during 2014 2017 the npvs of the total timber and carbon of the sixteen alternative forest management scenarios are illustrated in fig 5 the differences in the npv of the total timber and carbon components for scenarios c1 through c4 were all difficult to distinguish when the carbon revenues were maximized individually for the timber production objectives t1 t4 scenario t1 produced a higher npv of total revenues than did the other scenarios over the planning horizon the even flow constraints of harvest volume i e scenario t2 had a significant negative effect on the total npv when compared to that of scenario t1 with the output reduced by approximately 29 34 the adjacency constraints i e scenario t3 had no significant effects on the optimal management plans when compared with those of scenario t2 and this was primarily because larger openings were used in this analysis however the total npv of the optimal management plans decreased significantly 17 87 when the green up constraints i e scenario t4 were further incorporated into scenario t3 the changes in the total npv in the mms i e scenarios m1 m4 were perfectly consistent with those in the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 mainly due to the relatively low carbon price i e 20 ton 1 employed in the planning processes however the responses of carbon npv to various constraints showed obvious opposite trends with respect to the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 and mms i e scenarios m1 m4 as expected as the minimum carbon target increased the npv of the produced timber decreased however increases in the npv of carbon were generated when the minimum carbon sequestration targets were incorporated into scenario m4 as emphasized here all revenues of timber and carbon objectives were profitable in the planning scenarios except for the carbon benefits in scenarios t1 and m1 which indicated that an unreasonable amount of timber was harvested under these planning scenarios during the planning horizon the amount of timber production carbon sequestration and carbon stocks of the various forest management strategies shown in fig 5 further verified the conclusions from an economic perspective when carbon revenues were the unique management objective the various constraints i e scenarios c1 c4 had no significant effects on the optimal management plans scenarios t3 and m3 produced more timber than did the other scenarios over the planning horizon while the amounts of timber produced in scenarios t4 and m4 were the lowest when evaluated for the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 and mms i e scenarios m1 m4 the values of carbon sequestration over the planning horizon all demonstrated significant increasing trends as the complexity of the planning formulations increased in contrast the carbon stocks had no significant increasing trend except for scenarios t4 and m4 as the minimum carbon sequestration target increased the amount of timber production decreased significantly however the quantities of carbon sequestration and residual carbon stocks both significantly increased when evaluated for planning scenarios r1 r4 the changes in timber production and carbon sequestration over time periods for the alternative forest management strategies are shown in fig 6 the amount of timber production for the cms i e scenarios c1 c4 showed a gradual increasing trend over the time periods in contrast the amount of carbon sequestration decreased significantly for scenarios c1 c4 as emphasized here the differences in timber production and carbon sequestration in the cms i e scenarios c1 c4 were all not significant over the evaluated time periods for the tms the amount of timber production in scenario t1 decreased significantly over the time periods specifically the harvest volume in the first period was approximately 2377 33 thousand m3 but the harvest volume in the last period was only approximately 0 30 thousand m3 as expected the amount of carbon sequestered in scenario t1 increased significantly over the time periods from 1576 57 to 287 88 thousand tons however the timber production and carbon sequestration values were almost the same for the optimal forest management plans of scenarios t2 and t3 which was mainly due to the larger openings that were used scenario t4 usually produced less timber in the first period but had approximately equal timber in the latter periods when compared with scenarios t2 and t3 the amount of carbon sequestration in scenario t4 showed significant opposite trends again the changes in timber production and carbon sequestration in the mms i e scenarios m1 m4 were all almost the same as the values in the tms i e scenarios t1 t4 finally the changes in timber production for scenarios r1 through r4 were all not evident over the evaluated time periods however the carbon sequestration decreased significantly over the time periods except for scenarios r1 and r2 in addition the amount of timber production within each period decreased dramatically for scenarios r1 r4 i e when the minimum carbon sequestration targets were used and increased but the amount of carbon sequestration significantly increased larger differences for carbon sequestration were observed in the first period i e approximately 189 94 thousand tons in the first period but the differences decreased significantly in the later periods i e approximately 32 23 thousand tons in the last period 4 discussions this study formulated a spatially explicit forest management planning model that incorporated carbon objectives into traditional forest harvest scheduling processes the effects of various carbon prices economic constraints and ecological constraints were quantitatively evaluated for certain alternative forest management strategies the results of the model outputs showed that increasing the amount of carbon sequestration can be attained at a significant cost in terms of forgone timber production and revenue returns similar results were also found in backéus et al 2006 baskent and keles 2009 baskent et al 2011 and raymer et al 2011 therefore if forest management organizations can alter or adjust their forest management policies such as from a tms to a mms they should evaluate the potential revenues and costs of these management strategies as well as the necessary constraints as demonstrated in this paper the unit monetary values of carbon are a critical financial economic factor that not only affects the revenues of optimal management plans but also has significant effects on the amount of timber production and carbon sequestration over the planning horizon clearly for long term forest management planning in northeastern china increasing the carbon price from 0 to 500 ton 1 significantly increased the amount of carbon sequestration however this practice also had dramatically negative effects on timber production in the optimal management plans the threshold value that affected the balance between harvesting timber and keeping trees to sequester carbon was estimated to be 100 per ton however this might be somewhat overestimated when compared with realistic carbon prices mainly because 1 not all the components of carbon sequestration related to forests and forestry were included which leads to an overestimation of carbon price when using an optimization technique 2 some uncertainty factors in the optimal management plans were not included for such large and lengthy planning efforts 3 some subsidies from the central and local government for management i e forest tending projects and protection i e natural forest protection projects of forest resources were also not considered from the perspective of optimization if a wide range of carbon prices can be evaluated as implemented in backéus et al 2006 raymer et al 2011 and qin et al 2017 then the amount of carbon sequestered can be treated as a dependent variable while the price of carbon can be treated as an independent variable and their relations can then be understood using a linear or nonlinear function which may be more practical in forest management practices however this method is of course an empirical result and is impossible to utilize in other regions thus the intrinsic mechanism regarding the trade offs between carbon price and carbon sequestration still requires further research efforts meanwhile all the price parameters including carbon and timber prices used in this analysis were deterministic however the introduction of a carbon price would affect the other prices in reality such as timber prices logging costs and discounting rates if one were to assume that the dynamics of all these prices would be utilized in the planning process then the methodology in this paper could relatively easily be reinforced by incorporating the adaptive prediction models of various prices into the model structure as constraints however we must leave this area of investigation for future research efforts mainly due to the lack of necessary predictive models for prices in this region the harvest volume flow constraints are inherent parts of any harvest scheduling model around the world e g boston and bettinger 1999 murray 1999 seidl et al 2007 öhman 2011 dong et al 2015a b and these constraints are often recognized as important to forest product industries to ensure the full utilization of equipment and labor martins et al 2014 the results of our forest management scenarios showed that the impacts of even flow constraints on timber production were all significant with the reductions in timber npv being as large as 29 34 and 25 08 for the tms and mms respectively when the even flow constraints eq 10 were incorporated into the planning formulations this result was perfectly in line with that from the study by baskent and keles 2009 in which the npv of revenues decreased by approximately 24 08 when the even flow objective was considered however a slight increasing trend i e approximately 5 10 was observed for the cms mainly because the amount of timber production under this management strategy was much lower than those of the other management strategies i e by an average of 9 13 in the harvest levels under other strategies thus the limitations of even flow on the optimal management plans caused fluctuations however the main drawback of developing a forest plan with an even flow objective is that the harvest level in one time period can limit the harvest levels in all the other time periods bettinger et al 2007 the reason for this may be that the harvest patterns of timber production are highly dependent on the initial landscape conditions such as the age class distribution stand density and site quality for example the harvest levels in older forests were usually significantly greater than those in younger forests zhu and bettinger 2008 as emphasized here the abovementioned studies analyzed only the trade offs between the even flow of harvest timber and economic maximization from the perspective of wood supply capacity from forest ecosystems while ignoring the importance of demand from the wood market in forestry johnson and scheurman 1997 have suggested numerous techniques for optimizing timber harvest and investment in public and private forests managed on an even aged basis therefore if the demand for timber from the wood market can be estimated in advance then this demand could be further employed in place of the even flow of timber requirements which might be more meaningful from the perspective of forest management practice spatial restrictions on the location and timing of harvest activities play an important role in maintaining the stability of landscape structures and the diversity of forest ecosystem services therefore spatial restrictions have become increasingly important mainly due to the recent developments in forest management regulations e g boston and bettinger 2006 and forest certification programs e g sustainable forestry initiative 2015 harvest adjacency and green up constraints are the most commonly used spatial restriction types in the forestry literature many studies have shown that increasing the assumed maximum opening size or decreasing the green up periods may be economically beneficial however these actions may also intensify the processes of landscapes or wildlife habitats fragmenting e g boston and bettinger 2006 martins et al 2014 borges et al 2015 dong et al 2015a b in this larger modeling effort the negative effects of adjacency constraints i e the green up constraints with zero period on the optimal management plans were all not significant in contrast approximately 5 10 0 40 and 1 31 increases in the total npv were observed for the cms tms and mms respectively the reasons for this result may be that 1 the average size of management units approximately 19 15 10 80 ha across the forest landscape was very different from the assumed maximum opening area i e 40 ha in this analysis and 2 the set of possible choices i e 30 potential management prescriptions for each forest stand was much greater than other planning instances thus the limitations of the adjacency constraints on the harvest activities might not be as strict as those implemented in other studies such as those by crowe and nelson 2005 boston and bettinger 2006 and tóth et al 2013 however our results from figs 5 and 6 further indicated that increasing the length of green up constraints from 0 to 2 periods had significant effects on the optimal management plans and the reductions in the total npvs were approximately 4 48 17 87 and 15 73 for the cms tms and mms respectively resource restrictions in forest ecosystems usually play very decisive roles in terms of carbon sequestration the reason for this may be that some of the forest stands have previously been protected to meet carbon objectives rather than be harvested for timber as expected the optimal forest management plans gradually changed toward lower harvesting values and increased protection values as the restrictions imposed by the minimum carbon objective increased the npv of the optimal management plans of the rms i e scenarios r1 r4 would be significantly decreased by an average of approximately 29 44 ha 1 yr 1 if the minimum carbon target was increased by only one percent this result also corresponded to a decrease of approximately 0 45 m3 ha 1 yr 1 in timber production and an increase of approximately 0 26 ton ha 1 yr 1 in carbon sequestration for the optimal forest management plans similar results were also reported in a study by keleş and başkent 2007 in which a decrease in timber of approximately 5 23 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and an increase in carbon of approximately 1 06 ton ha 1 yr 1 were observed when the minimum carbon target was increased by one percent obviously the magnitude of the increases in timber and the decreases in carbon are highly dependent on the planning strategies that are implemented for spatially explicit forest management planning problems which are typically formulated based on model i of johnson and scheurman 1997 it is well known that this kind of planning problem can be solved with normal linear programming tools e g glpk cbc cplex gurobi or lingo when the problem sizes are limited however some enhanced techniques such as the generalized management units formulation the bucket formulation the path formulation and the cluster packing formulation tóth et al 2013 might be more helpful to mitigate their disadvantages of being time consuming and not good at handling the spatial constraints of harvest activities when the planning problem sizes become very large as implemented in this paper i e 6421 units 10 periods 4 potential prescriptions however we also must admit that spatial problems are still difficult to formulate and solvers can require considerable time to process as these issues highly depend on the size and the complexity of planning problems meanwhile many previously studies have confirmed that the precision of simulated annealing can meet the requirements of forest management very well e g boston and bettinger 1999 bettinger et al 2002 pukkala and kurttila 2005 even when compared with the results from relaxed i e ignoring the spatial constraints linear programming boston and bettinger 1999 for an example reported that simulated annealing found the highest solution value for three of the four planning problems with different age class structures and were all less than 4 from the objective function values of relaxed linear programming therefore the robust simulated annealing algorithm was employed to solve our planning problem the coefficients of variation of the ten objective function values for each planning scenario only varied from 3 71 to 13 98 indicating relatively higher stability of the results from simulated annealing when using a self validation process that recommended by bettinger et al 2009 however some improved heuristic algorithms including simulated annealing such as the neighborhood search dong et al 2015a b hybrid search li et al 2010 and revision search bettinger et al 2015 are all promising for improving the optimization ability in addition a relatively outmoded programming language i e visual basic 6 0 was employed in this paper thus attempting to utilize other advanced programming languages e g c vb net may substantially shorten the optimization time a final point of discussion is that not all the components of carbon sequestration related to forests and forestry were included such as the carbon in the understory vegetation litter and soil levels in the forest ecosystem and carbon in the wood products in the forestry market in the field of forestry backéus et al 2006 baskent and keles 2009 and baskent et al 2011 have successfully incorporated the carbon components of various wood products into the planning process using strategies related to the lifetime of wood products seidl et al 2007 and bottalico et al 2016 incorporated almost all the carbon components of forests and forestry in a framework of multipurpose forest management planning using certain process based stand level estimators such as the 3 pg and invest models these valuable publications are all beneficial and promote the development of forest management planning however the applicability of these models has not been verified in our study area and some parameters within these models should be calibrated using our experimental datasets in addition removing nutrients e g stemwood and reducing organic matter inputs into forest soils through different harvesting intensities may affect long term forest soil fertility and stand productivity mack et al 2014 in turn affecting the carbon sink capacity of forest ecosystems especially on sites with coarse textured soils and low soil organic matter powers et al 2005 however this feedback is still difficult to quantify using mathematical formulas and it is currently impossible to integrate this relationship into the forest management planning process 5 conclusions this paper focused on a single forest area in northeastern china and the study was limited to only two forest values rather than incorporating many other forest values e g water soil biodiversity however it was sufficiently effective to illustrate the effects of a set of tested economic and ecological constraints on alternative forest management strategies the prices of carbon had significant nonlinear effects on the economic benefits and the amount of timber production and carbon sequestration when evaluated for scenario m4 using a 3 discounting rate in which increasing the prices of carbon from 0 to 500 per ton resulted in positive quadratic polynomial total and carbon npvs r 2 0 9996 and 0 9970 positive logistic carbon sequestration and stocks r 2 0 9830 and 0 9730 and negative logistic harvest of timber and its npv r 2 0 9890 and 0 9902 for optimal forest management plans the carbon price of 100 per ton was found to be a significant threshold for balancing the harvest of timber and carbon sequestration in addition to the cms our tested spatial and nonspatial constraints all showed significant effects on optimal forest management plans when a realistic carbon price i e 20 ton 1 from the carbon trading market in china during 2014 2017 was employed in which decreases of approximately 29 34 and 25 08 were observed for the total npv when twenty percent deviations in assigned harvest volume between any two consecutive periods were employed additionally two periods of green up constraints can further reduce the total npv by approximately 17 87 and 15 73 for tms and mms respectively when compared with their base scenarios however increasing the minimum carbon target by one percent reduced the total npv by approximately 29 44 ha 1 yr 1 when evaluated for the rms therefore the importance of evaluating the trade offs between forest economic benefits and ecological protections cannot be overemphasized for forest managers the above results are obviously strongly tied to the particularities of the study area although it is possible to transfer and implement our optimization framework in other regions when the necessary elements e g forest growth and yield models price parameters of various products are adequate however the effects of some uncertainties on the optimal management plans such as climatic changes unpredictable events e g wind damage fire hazard and insect injury and the intentions of decision makers may affect the applicability and these have been left

canada graphical abstract common carp cyprinus carpio feeding and spawning behaviours when abundant negatively impact shallow water habitats essential for marsh ecosystem functioning a common coastal marsh restoration practice is to create barriers to carp movement into a marsh from connected lakes these barriers often do not exclude all carp from a marsh and the lower adult density and improved habitat may increase overall carp recruitment success a population model was created for delta marsh on lake manitoba canada varying the proportion of the total carp population spawning in the marsh indicates that with partial carp exclusion the improvement in spawning conditions increases carp population growth rate and decreases generation time increasing fishing mortality can help mitigate this effect indicating that a multi tiered management approach is best it is important that fish exclusion programs be implemented with awareness of this unanticipated result keywords carp exclusion

thresher et al 2014 and reduction of water levels after spawning yamamoto et al 2006 a customary control method is the use of fish exclusion screens that prevent the movement of carp into their preferred spawning grounds meredith et al 2006 these control operations range from labour intensive screened fishways where fish are hand sorted e g cootes paradise marsh canada lougheed and chow fraser 2001 to unmanned permanent screens placed in culverts preventing movement of all fish with maximum body widths greater than the screen bar spacings including native fish e g murray darling basin australia hillyard et al 2010 at delta marsh a coastal wetland on the south shore of lake manitoba canada screens that prevent the movement of large carp in lake manitoba where they overwinter from entering into delta marsh are deployed at the beginning of the carp spawning migration and are removed after most carp have spawned wrubleski et al 2016 at 70 mm bar spacing the screens should prevent migration of 99 of carp 630 mm in total length french et al 1999 however individuals smaller than 630 mm and early migrants may still access the marsh carp have a protracted spawning period and are extremely fecund stewart and watkinson 2004 the number of eggs increases with maternal size with the average carp producing hundreds of thousands of eggs swee and mccrimmon 1966 prior to the establishment of the delta marsh carp exclusion project in 2013 delta marsh had minimal submerged vegetation wrubleski et al 2016 and an abundant adult carp population carp recruitment is regulated by adult carp density predation and larval habitat bajer and sorensen 2010 bajer et al 2012 weber and brown 2013 most fish species that are known to regulate carp abundance through the predation of eggs or larvae do not exist in delta marsh e g centrarchidae bajer et al 2012 or exist in low abundance e g yellow perch perca flavescens this implies that carp recruitment is most likely regulated by availability of larval habitat and adult carp density with such high adult carp densities and a deteriorated marsh it is likely that very little successful carp recruitment occurred in the marsh in most years since the carp exclusion project started delta marsh has seen an increase in submersed vegetation and decreases in adult carp abundance reductions in the numbers of large adult carp have been shown to increase water clarity reduce nutrient levels and blue green algal blooms contribute to changes in the benthic and zooplankton communities and increase the abundance of submersed aquatic

marsh is unknown in similar systems female carp mature anywhere from age 3 or 5 swee and mccrimmon 1966 bajer and sorensen 2010 age at maturity for carp in the model was set to 5 years to be conservative the effect of the exclusions screens on the survival of eggs to the yoy stage h is unknown for delta marsh badiou 2005 estimated that for delta marsh every additional 100 kg ha of carp in the marsh would result in a 2 9 g m2 reduction in submerged vegetation biomass which relates directly to the amount of ideal larval carp habitat similarly bajer et al 2009 found that an increase in carp biomass was strongly correlated with the decline in percent vegetative cover in two shallow lakes in illinois usa these studies suggest that higher screen efficiency will result in an increase in carp spawning and larval habitat in the marsh in addition with increased screen efficiency the density of carp in the marsh would decrease alleviating density dependent effects on egg and larval

qualitative interpretation of the results for the purpose of this model we assume a linear relationship however the shape of the relationship between se and hm is unknown and should be determined empirically along with the value for c if precise values for λ are desired while delta marsh is the largest spawning habitat for carp on lake manitoba there are tributaries and other coastal wetlands watchorn et al 2012 that provide spawning habitat the effect of the spawning habitat on survival of eggs to the yoy stage outside of the protected marsh lake fecundity coefficient hl was varied from 0

of submerged vegetation lubinski et al 1986 the yoy stage may be more appropriately represented with different survival rates for the marsh and for lake manitoba which may differ in extent density etc of vegetative cover however the relationship between yoy survival and submerged vegetative cover is unknown directionally consistent with the effect on reproductive success and so would most likely be captured in hm and hl 2 4 model analysis the population modelling and analyses were performed in r r core team 2015 estimated population level parameters include carp population growth rate λ and generation time gt years that were calculated from the population matrix with the package popbio stubben and milligan 2007 according to caswell 2001 for λ 1 there is an increase in population growth for λ 1 the population is stable and for λ 1 the population is declining in abundance 3 results carp population growth rate λ for low values of lake fecundity coefficient hl ranging from 0 to 0 1 with increasing screen efficiency se will lead to an initial increase in λ of around 10 fig 4 growth rate peaks at intermediate screen efficiencies then declines to values lower than that of no exclusion se 0 at high screen efficincies increasing fishing intensities decreases the screen efficiency required to decrease λ below that of no exclusion increasing fishing mortality also decreases the overall maximum λ reached by the population as hl increases the decline in λ is delayed to higher se values model outcomes suggest that the partial exclusion of carp from the marsh increases population growth rate but can be mitigated somewhat by increasing harvest depending on se hl and fm simulated generation time for carp in delta marsh ranges from 5 to 8 5 years generation time gt decreases initially with increasing se followed by an increase in gt at a se around 90 but only for the lowest hl values and fishing intensities fig 5 for medium and high hl gt is consistently lower than what it would be without the screens with the lowest gt of 5 years at the highest fm the simulations suggest that partial exclusion of carp decreases the generation time of carp changing the model such that only the juveniles transitioning to the adult stage can access the marsh affected by screen efficiency e g by maturing at a size smaller than the screen excludes produces similar but less drastic changes in population growth rate and generation time over increasing screen efficiencies not shown increasing fishing intensity has a larger mediating effect on population growth rate as all adults are susceptible to harvest not shown 4 discussion restoration practices that attempt to exclude spawning carp to improve marsh habitats with partial carp exclusion may also improve spawning and recruitment conditions for carp the improved habitat and lower densities of spawning carp in the marsh could affect carp population dynamics we demonstrated that partial exclusion can result in a population growth rate that is higher than when there is no exclusion and is only lower than that of no exclusion when a substantial proportion of the population is excluded identification of the qualitative relationship between screen efficiency population growth rate and generation time for carp will facilitate the development of informed management strategies that may improve restoration of marsh habitats and adjacent waterbodies in this study we used a matrix population model which was parameterised to represent carp in delta marsh canada to determine the effect of partial exclusion of carp from the marsh carp population dynamics were simulated under the assumption that carp exclusion resulted in improved recruitment success for carp in the marsh an increase in carp population growth rate and a decrease in generation time were direct consequences of improved marsh habitat by partially excluding carp from the marsh to our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to examine how partial exclusion of carp from ideal spawning habitats could affect carp spawning efficiency in turn affecting carp population dynamics brown and gilligan 2014 similarly analysed the effectiveness of control methods using a meta population model for carp however they did not consider the effect of improved spawning success on population growth rate from varying the proportion of the population not susceptible to these control measures the interpretation of our model results are limited by assumptions regarding foundational relationships in the matrix population model there are three main elements of a matrix population model survival growth and reproduction in regards to survival we assumed that survival was related to the length of the individual and that average lengths for each stage were representative while other methods of calculating survival exist in the literature we chose the length based method because it has previously been applied to carp lechelt and bajer 2016 and is empirically supported gislason et al 2008 in addition we also assumed for simplicity that the survival of the yoy that spend their summer in the marsh would be the same as yoy that are in the lake for the full year yoy carp however prefer habitats with dense submerged vegetation lubinski et al 1986 which we assume would increase in the marsh with higher screen efficiencies the effect of partial carp exclusion on yoy survival should however be directionally consistent with the effect on recruitment with minimal effects on the qualitative interpretation of the results growth was represented in the matrix population model as the transition between stages and did not vary across screen efficiencies in the model factors that affect growth include population density and habitat variables lorenzen and enberg 2002 which will vary with screen efficiency the most important transition between the juvenile and adult stages depends on how juvenile carp are distributed between the lake and marsh the rate of carp return to delta marsh before they are adults is unknown for lake manitoba and so it would be difficult to incorporate effects of partial exclusion on this stage transition but should be considered if applied to other systems due to the lack of information we assumed a linear relationship between carp exclusion and the effect on reproduction in the marsh it is possible that this relationship would take other forms and future empirical studies should be performed to determine what they might be in addition in our model recruitment is directly related to the abundance of adult carp environment however is a strong predictor of recruitment for some fish species lobón cerviá and bradford 2014 szuwalski et al 2015 and may be important for carp phelps et al 2008 weber and brown 2013 the inclusion of the marsh and lake fecundity coefficients allows us to incorporate environmental effects on recruitment however if this relationship with the environment is strong enough to disentangle the stock recruitment relationship a more complicated model may be required the linking of demographic parameters e g growth rate mortality rate to environmental variability e g temperature dissolved oxygen concentration water levels increases fluctuations in population abundance dixon et al 1999 the effect of partial exclusion of carp on population growth rate and generation time depended on the spawning success outside of the protected marsh at high screen efficiency when carp are not able to use delta marsh as a spawning ground reproduction from the carp population may depend on flooding events that increase spawning habitat in the lake or other coastal wetlands and tributaries around lake manitoba king et al 2003 which along with the predicted changes to population parameters will lead to increased population variability in conclusion increased population growth and decreased generation time are interesting consequences of partial carp exclusion that have not been considered before unintentional outcomes of increasing or decreasing connectivity in aquatic systems can have profound effects on the ecosystem despite this they are often not considered and or incorporated in the management decision making process mclaughlin et al 2013 it is important that wetland managers be aware of this unanticipated result and should consider it when developing new fish exclusion projects our experience at delta marsh demonstrates that partial exclusion can be effective at improving marsh habitat however a decrease in carp population size may not be achieved by partial exclusion alone and multiple management strategies should be implemented at once what effect increased carp population growth and decreased generation time will have on lake manitoba and its coastal wetlands and tributaries is not known but should be monitored in the future conflict of interest none acknowledgements we thank

canada graphical abstract common carp cyprinus carpio feeding and spawning behaviours when abundant negatively impact shallow water habitats essential for marsh ecosystem functioning a common coastal marsh restoration practice is to create barriers to carp movement into a marsh from connected lakes these barriers often do not exclude all carp from a marsh and the lower adult density and improved habitat may increase overall carp recruitment success a population model was created for delta marsh on lake manitoba canada varying the proportion of the total carp population spawning in the marsh indicates that with partial carp exclusion the improvement in spawning conditions increases carp population growth rate and decreases generation time increasing fishing mortality can help mitigate this effect indicating that a multi tiered management approach is best it is important that fish exclusion programs be implemented with awareness of this unanticipated result keywords carp exclusion

thresher et al 2014 and reduction of water levels after spawning yamamoto et al 2006 a customary control method is the use of fish exclusion screens that prevent the movement of carp into their

establishment of the delta marsh carp exclusion project in 2013 delta marsh had minimal submerged vegetation wrubleski et al 2016 and an abundant adult carp population carp recruitment is regulated by adult carp density predation and larval habitat bajer and sorensen 2010 bajer et al 2012 weber and brown 2013 most fish species that are known to regulate carp abundance through the predation of eggs or larvae do not exist in delta marsh e g centrarchidae bajer et al 2012 or exist in low abundance e g yellow perch perca flavescens this implies that carp recruitment is most likely regulated by availability of larval habitat and adult carp density with such high adult carp densities and a deteriorated marsh it is likely that very little successful carp recruitment occurred in the marsh in most years since the carp exclusion project started delta marsh has seen an increase in submersed vegetation and decreases in adult carp abundance reductions in the numbers of large adult carp have been shown to increase water clarity reduce nutrient levels and blue green algal blooms contribute to changes in the benthic and zooplankton communities and increase the abundance of submersed aquatic macrophytes bonneau and scarnecchia 2014 kaemingk et al 2017 these habitat changes can in turn result in increased recruitment of carp carp spawn in shallow waters with abundant aquatic vegetation

growth rate and a decrease in generation time were direct consequences of improved marsh habitat by partially excluding carp from the marsh to our knowledge this is the first study of its kind to examine how partial exclusion of carp from ideal spawning habitats could affect carp spawning efficiency in turn affecting carp population dynamics brown and gilligan 2014 similarly analysed the effectiveness of control methods using a meta population model for carp however they did not consider the effect of improved spawning success on population growth rate from varying the proportion of the population not susceptible to these control measures the interpretation of our model results are limited by assumptions regarding foundational relationships in the matrix population model there are three main elements of a matrix population model survival growth and reproduction in regards to survival we assumed that survival was related to the length of the individual and that average lengths for each stage were representative while other methods of calculating survival exist in the literature we chose the length based method because it has previously been applied to carp lechelt and bajer 2016 and is empirically supported gislason et al 2008 in addition we also assumed for simplicity that the survival of the yoy that spend their summer in the marsh would be the same as yoy that are in the lake for the full year yoy carp however prefer habitats with dense submerged vegetation lubinski et al 1986 which we assume would increase in the marsh with higher screen efficiencies the effect of partial carp exclusion on yoy survival should however be directionally consistent with the effect on recruitment with minimal effects on the qualitative interpretation of the results growth was represented in the matrix population model as the transition between stages and did not vary across screen efficiencies in the model factors that affect growth include population density and habitat variables lorenzen and enberg 2002 which will vary with screen efficiency the most important transition between the juvenile and adult stages depends on how juvenile carp are distributed between the lake and marsh the rate of carp return to delta marsh before they are adults is unknown for lake manitoba and so it would be difficult to incorporate effects of partial exclusion on this stage transition but should be considered if applied to other systems due to the lack of information we assumed a linear relationship between carp exclusion and the effect on reproduction in the marsh it is possible that this relationship would take other forms and future empirical studies should be performed to determine what they might be in addition in our model recruitment is directly related to the abundance of adult carp environment however is a strong predictor of recruitment for some fish species lobón cerviá and bradford 2014 szuwalski et al 2015 and may be important for carp phelps et al 2008 weber and brown 2013 the inclusion of the marsh and lake fecundity coefficients allows us to incorporate environmental effects on recruitment however if this relationship with the environment is strong enough to disentangle the stock recruitment relationship a more complicated model may be required the linking of demographic parameters e g growth rate mortality rate to environmental variability e g temperature dissolved oxygen concentration water levels increases fluctuations in population abundance dixon et al 1999 the effect of partial exclusion of carp on population growth rate and generation time depended on the spawning success outside of the protected marsh at high screen efficiency when carp are not able to use delta marsh as a spawning ground reproduction from the carp population may depend on flooding events that increase spawning habitat in the lake or other coastal wetlands and tributaries around lake manitoba king et al 2003 which along with the predicted changes to population parameters will lead to increased population variability in conclusion increased population growth and decreased generation time are interesting consequences of partial carp exclusion that have not been considered before unintentional outcomes of increasing or decreasing connectivity in aquatic systems can have profound effects on the ecosystem despite this they are often not considered and or incorporated in the management decision making process mclaughlin et al 2013 it is important that wetland managers be aware of this unanticipated result and should consider it when developing new fish exclusion projects our experience at delta marsh demonstrates that partial exclusion can be effective at improving marsh habitat however a decrease in carp population size may not be achieved by partial exclusion alone and multiple management strategies should be implemented at once what effect increased carp population growth and decreased generation time will have on lake manitoba and its coastal wetlands and tributaries is not known but should be monitored in the future conflict of interest none acknowledgements we thank

25213,this study presented the suitable feeding habitat for target fish species using physical habitat simulations for both fishes and macroinvertebrates the suitable feeding habitat is a novel concept for the fish habitat that guarantees a certain level of feeding condition as well as the suitability of the physical habitat the study site is a 0 9 km long reach of the gongneung cheon stream which is a tributary of the han gang river in korea three dominant fish species were selected as target fishes such as rhinogobius brunneus zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus in order to consider the feeding condition of these fishes hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata were selected as target macroinvertebrates physical habitat simulations were carried out for both fishes and macroinvertebrates and the distributions of the suitable feeding habitat for the target fishes were provided it was shown that the suitable feeding habitat properly represents the quality of the target fishes habitats then the weighted usable area wua and weighted epi benthic feeding area wbfa for target fishes were compared and the results indicated that wbfa predicts fish abundance better than wua keywords suitable feeding habitat physical habitat simulation feeding condition macroinvertebrate weighted epi benthic feeding area 1 introduction physical habitat simulation phs is a numerical tool that quantifies the quality of habitats for target fish species in a stream phs evaluates the suitability of physical habitat in terms of flow depth velocity and substrate at a particular rate of discharge bovee 1982 booker and dunbar 2004 the outputs of phs are the composite suitability index csi and the weighted usable area wua which indicate the quality of habitats for target fish species in the study area the phs was originally developed for estimating instream flows downstream of large dams in north america milhous 1999 and has been applied to various problems in river management examples include the estimation of environmental flows papadaki et al 2014 nikghalb et al 2016 and the investigation of the effects of river restoration schemes particularly the effects of removing weirs im et al 2011 and dams gillenwater et al 2006 tomsic et al 2007 phs has also been applied to identify the impact of constructing hydraulic installations such as dams valentin et al 1996 yi et al 2014 boavida et al 2015 large wood structures he et al 2009 and spur dykes chang et al 2013 although previous applications of phs seem to have been successful it has often been criticized because its assessment of habitat quality is only affected by the physical habitat variables roussel et al 1999 pointed out that the conventional phs does not reflect fishes feeding condition rosenfeld and ptolemy 2012 also argued that phs which focuses on changes in available habitat at different discharge rates normally neglects prey abundance macroinvertebrates serve as a major source of food to fishes in streams food availability is known to directly affect the growth distribution and population of fishes jones 1986 muotka 1993 rosenfeld and boss 2001 devlin et al 2004 graeb et al 2004 moreover imbalances between the fish and macroinvertebrate communities can incur the degradation of fishes habitats brusven et al 1974 therefore the quality of fish habitats is determined not only by the physical habitat variables but also by prey abundance previous studies have indicated that the abundance of macroinvertebrates is affected by hydraulic parameters such as the froude number shear velocity flow velocity and substrate statzner 1981 culp et al 1983 brooks et al 2005 duan et al 2008 based on this various phss for macroinvertebrates have been carried out just as they have for fishes gore et al 1998 performed phs for macroinvertebrates to investigate the effect of artificial riffles in a stream gore et al used physical habitat simulation system phabsim and habitat suitability curves hscs for macroinvertebrates the simulation results showed that the benthic community s diversity had improved after the construction of artificial riffles waddle and holmquist 2013 carried out phss for rarefied number of species ept ephemeroptera plecoptera tricoptera and plecoptera in the tuolumme river us multivariate suitability curves were used for habitat simulations they found that water abstraction can degrade macroinvertebrate populations as a result of reducing the available wetted area kelly et al 2015 performed phss for deleatidium spp and ept in braided rivers in new zealand they found that downstream diversion decreased the biomass of macroinvertebrates these previous studies provide a possibility of predicting the prey abundance for fishes using the phss for macroinvertebrates this study proposed a method to predict the suitable feeding habitat for target fishes in a stream here a suitable feeding habitat refers to a suitable physical habitat with the favorable feeding condition for fishes the main challenge is that the conventional phss predict the suitability of fish habitat based only on the physical habitat condition the suitable feeding habitat is expected to represent the habitat quality better than the habitat predicted by the conventional phss the study site was selected as the gongneung cheon stream which is a tributary of the han gang river korea for the same study area im et al 2011 investigated the change in the physical habitat after a weir removal using the phs for the dominant fish later kim and choi 2017 carried out phss with hscs generated in the same study reach and presented csi distributions for both fishes and macroinvertebrates in the present study the suitable feeding habitat a novel concept for habitat quality is presented the target fishes were rhinogobius brunneus zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus and the target macroinvertebrates were hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata hscs for the target macroinvertebrates were constructed based on monitoring data from the han gang river basin phss for target macroinvertebrates and fishes were carried out and the csi distributions for both were presented the product of the csi for the target fishes and the csi for the target macroinvertebrates called csi the for epi benthic feeding csibf was obtained and used as an indicator for the suitable feeding habitat the wua and weighted epi benthic feeding area wbfa for target fishes were compared and discussed fig 1 shows a procedure of computing the suitable feeding habitat for fishes in the stream first habitat variables such as the flow depth velocity and substrate are obtained for a particular discharge via the hydraulic simulation using the results from the hydraulic simulation the habitat simulations are performed for both macroinvertebrates and fishes at this stage the composite suitability indices for macroinvertebrates and fishes are evaluated over the study area then the composite suitability index for the epi benthic feeding which is the product of the csi for the macroinvertebrates and the csi for fishes is computed finally the suitable feeding habitat defined by the habitat whose csi for epi benthic feeding is sufficiently high is predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and monitoring data fig 2 shows the study site which is a reach about 0 9 km long reach located at the upstream portion of the gongneung cheon stream the gongneung cheon stream a tributary of the han gang river is located in the kyeonggi province in the north western part of korea the gongneung cheon stream is 45 0 km long and has a watershed area of 253 1 km2 the discharge rates for drought flow q355 low flow q275 normal flow q185 and averaged wet flow q95 are 0 28 0 51 0 91 and 1 73 m3 s respectively korea institute of construction and technology 2008 here qn denotes the average flow discharge that is exceeded on n days of the year as shown in fig 2 the study reach includes pool and riffle sequences whose bed elevation profiles are shown in the following figure in the longitudinal direction fig 3 shows the changes of the thalweg and the median size of the bed sediment with the longitudinal distance the thalweg and sediment size profiles show the presence of pool and riffle sequences more evidently that is riffles are located about 200 m and 400 m from the upstream end and pools are about 330 m and 650 m from the upstream end interestingly the bed materials are coarse and fine in the riffles and pools respectively the locations of the macroinvertebrate monitoring stations are also plotted in fig 2 as can be seen in the figure st 1 and st 3 are located in the riffles and st 2 in a pool st 4 is located in a run an intermediate zone with a wavy water surface between the pool and riffle and a pool is located downstream from st 4 the median sizes of the bed sediment at st 1 st 4 are 6 0 0 9 5 5 and 2 0 mm respectively fig 4 shows the distribution of dominant fishes and macroinvertebrates obtained by field monitorings in the study site the field monitoring for fishes was conducted for the entire study reach in august 2006 it was found that rhinogobius brunneus was the most dominant fish followed by zacco platypus and peudogobio esocinus as shown in fig 4 a korea institute of construction and technology 2008 in this study these three dominant fishes were selected as the target fishes fig 4 b shows the distribution of the dominant macroinvertebrates in the study site the field monitoring for macroinvertebrates was conducted at the four monitoring sites shown in fig 3 in june 2006 field monitoring revealed that four macroinvertebrates were dominant in the study reach namely hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata and they accounted for 80 of the total macroinvertebrate community previous studies have found that these four macroinvertebrates serve as the main food sources for the three target fishes in the study site sone et al 2001 inoue et al 2005 chang et al 2008 katano 2011 2 2 hydraulic simulation in the present study the river2d model developed by steffler and blackburn 2002 was used for the flow computation the 2d hydraulic models have been used widely in the phss because of their acceptable accuracy and resolution with reasonable computational costs leclerc et al 1995 ghanem et al 1996 the river2d model solves 2d shallow water equations using the finite element method the shallow water equations consist of the following continuity and x and y momentum equations respectively 1 h t q x x q y y 0 2 q x t u q x x v q x y g 2 h 2 x g h s o x s f x 1 ρ h τ x x x 1 ρ h τ x y y 3 q x t u q y x v q y y g 2 h 2 y g h s o y s f y 1 ρ h τ y x x 1 ρ h τ y y y where t is the time x and y are the streamwise and transverse directions respectively h is the flow depth u v are the depth averaged velocities in the x y directions respectively q x q y are the unit discharges in the x y directions respectively s o x s o y are the bed slopes in the x y directions respectively s f x s f y are the friction slopes in the x y directions respectively τ i j is the horizontal turbulent stress tensor ρ is the water density and g is the gravitational acceleration the x and y components of the friction slope are respectively estimated by 4a b s f x n 2 u u 2 v 2 h 4 3 s f y n 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient in the same study area im et al 2011 calibrated the roughness coefficient for the normal flow and proposed n 0 027 which was used in the present study the flow model was validated by comparing the computed flow with measured data specifically the lateral profile of the computed velocity was compared with velocity data measured by large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv and detailed comparisons can be found in im et al 2011 2 3 habitat simulation 2 3 1 habitat suitability curves for the habitat simulation both knowledge based models and data driven models can be used the hsc is a representative knowledge based model data driven models include statistical models and artificial intelligence ai based models multiple linear regression model vadas and orth 2001 and generalized linear model labonne et al 2003 are statistical models ai based models include fuzzy logic jorde et al 2001 kerle et al 2002 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis method jung and choi 2015 and gene expression programming gep model choi and choi 2015 in this study hscs constructed by the method of gosse 1982 were used in habitat simulations for both fishes and macroinvertebrates this method is known to be simple but its results are reliable im et al 2018 the method of gosse gives suitability index values of 1 0 0 5 0 1 and 0 05 to the range of variables that encompasses 50 75 90 and 95 of the observations respectively fig 5 shows the hscs for the target fishes used in the present phss the hscs for rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus were proposed by kim and choi 2017 and the hscs for pseudogobio esocinus by kang 2010 the hscs for the three target fishes were constructed using the field monitoring data from the han gang river basin this is important because the phss may predict available habitat inappropriately when they use hscs generated in the other watershed glozier et al 1997 moir et al 2005 it can be seen in the figure that the optimal ranges of rhinogobius brunneus are 0 20 0 30 m 0 40 0 90 m s and 4 fine gravel for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively the respective ranges that zacco platypus prefers are 0 20 0 30 m 0 38 0 73 m s and 4 fine gravel for the flow depth velocity and substrate pseudogobio esocinus s optimal ranges are 0 34 0 54 m 0 00 0 17 m s and 2 silt for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are lotic fishes and pseudogobio esocinus is the lentic fish these features of the target fishes can be observed in the hscs fig 5 that is lotic fishes prefer shallow water high velocity and coarse substrate and lentic fishes prefer deep water low velocity and fine substrate in order to construct hscs for the target macroinvertebrates monitoring data obtained from the han gang river basin were used moe nier 2011 the total number of monitoring data is 340 the data include the population of macroinvertebrates water temperature turbidity flow depth velocity and substrates for the sake of convenience the monitored populations of the macroinvertebrates were converted into population density population m2 which is the number of individual macroinvertebrate per unit bed area in the present study for the phs for macroinvertebrates the same physical habitat variables as those for the fishes were used namely flow depth velocity and substrate fig 6 presents bubble diagrams showing the habitat characteristics for each target macroinvertebrate in the figure the observed population densities of macroinvertebrates are plotted against flow depth velocity and substrate and the size of bubble indicates the population density the figure indicates that hydropsyche kozhantschikovi baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata prefer shallow water high velocity and coarse substrate this is consistent with kwon et al 2013 report that these three macroinvertebrate species inhabit riffles with coarse substrates contrastingly chironomidae prefer deep water low velocity and fine substrate this conforms with the fact that chironomidae can be found in a wide range of aquatic habitats including both lotic and lentic environments and dwell in fine substrates frouz et al 2003 kwon et al 2013 fig 7 shows the hscs for the four target macroinvertebrates the monitoring data in fig 5 were used in the construction of the hscs it can be seen that hydropsyche kozhantschikovi prefers the ranges of 0 19 0 26 m 0 50 0 78 m s and 4 fine gravel for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively the ranges for each habitat variable preferred by baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata appear to be similar to the optimal ranges of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi however the ranges preferred by chironomadae are different i e 0 15 0 30 m 0 38 0 69 m s and 3 sand for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively that is this species prefers deep water low velocity and fine substrate compared to the other three macroinvertebrate species this is consistent with the distributions in fig 6 2 3 2 composite suitability index the csi for the target species both macroinvertebrates and fishes can be calculated by various methods examples include the multiplicative aggregation method the geometric mean method the minimum method and the weighted mean method in the present study the following weighted mean method was used to compute csi for target species 5 c s i i f h i h a f v i v b f s i s c where i m and f for macroinvertebrates and fishes respectively f h v i h v is the suitability value for each physical habitat variable h v here h v includes flow depth h velocity v and substrate s in eq 5 a b and c are weighting factors for h v and s respectively as can be seen from eq 5 the weighted mean method enables different weightings to each habitat variable easily which provides a clear advantage compared to the other methods because macroinvertebrates usually live on the stream bed the substrate is the most crucial factor among others quinn and hickey 1990 beisel et al 1998 buss et al 2004 brooks et al 2005 duan et al 2008 in the present study such values of weighting factors as a 0 260 b 0 327 and c 0 413 were used these weighting factors were proposed by li et al 2009 who used the analytic hierarchy process regarding fishes the same value was used for each weighting factor i e a b c 1 3 it was assumed that weighting factors rarely change across macroinvertebrate or fish species this can be supported by previous studies in the literature such as clark et al 2008 costa et al 2015 and armas vargas et al 2017 the csi computed by eq 5 indicates the quality of habitat for macroinvertebrate or fish species the individual csis can be combined to represent the quality of fish habitat considering the feeding condition holzapfel et al 2017 the idea is that fishes try to maximize their energy gains in relation to their energy costs when capturing prey gerking 1994 pyke et al 1977 holzapfel et al 2017 therefore adjacency or accessibility to prey is regarded as a critical factor of food availability fishes accessibility to macroinvertebrates can be expressed as the product of the csi for fishes and the csi for invertebrates given by csibf 6 c s i b f c s i f c s i m where csif and csim are the csis for fishes and macroinvertebrates respectively 2 3 3 suitable feeding habitat in order to define the suitable feeding habitat feeding habitat conditions should be categorized based on the csi for epi benthic feeding benjankar et al 2015 classified the quality of a habitat based on csi values namely no habitat poor habitat fair habitat good habitat and excellent habitat for csi values in the ranges of 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 0 respectively wei et al 2009 evaluated habitats as suitable when they had csi values in the range of 0 6 0 79 and highly suitable as having csi values in the range of 0 8 1 0 im et al 2018 defined highly suitable portion if the csi exceeds 0 6 in the present study feeding habitats were grouped based on the critical csi values determined by benjankar et al 2015 as shown in table 1 since the csi for epi benthic feeding is the product of the csi for fish and the csi for macroinvertebrate it is mostly lower than individual csi in the present study the suitable feeding habitat is defined as the suitable physical habitat c s i f 0 6 with suitable feeding conditions c s i m 0 6 thus the categories of good feeding habitat and excellent feeding habitat correspond to suitable feeding habitat 2 3 4 weighted usable area and weighted epi benthic feeding area in the conventional phs wua denotes the quantity of available habitat in the study area in the present study the quantity of available habitat that provides suitable feeding is represented by wbfa the wua and wbfa are respectively estimated by 7 w u a i 1 n c s i f i a i 8 w b f a i 1 n c s i b f i a i where n is the total number of cells and a i is the area of the i th cell the concept of the wbfa was first proposed by holzapfel et al 2017 to investigate the impact of hydropeaking flows on the feeding condition of fish species in this study the wua is compared with the total wbfa which is the summation of the wbfas for the four target macroinvertebrates 3 results and discussion in this section results from the phss for both macroinvertebrates and fishes are presented first the csi distributions of the four target macroinvertebrates and the three target fishes for each macroinvertebrate are given then based on these csi distributions the suitable feeding habitats are predicted finally the wua and wbfa are computed and compared with each other 3 1 composite suitability index for the target macroinvertebrates fig 8 shows the csi distributions for target macroinvertebrates under normal flow conditions where q 0 9 m3 s csi values lie between 0 and 1 indicating the worst and the most optimal habitat quality respectively the csi distribution for hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is given in fig 8 a it can be seen that the csi is higher in riffles due to its preference for fine gravel substrate high velocity and shallow flow depth fig 8 b shows the csi distribution of chironomidae revealing that the csi is higher in pools in contrast with fig 8 a this is because chironomidae prefers sand low velocity and deep flow depth fig 8 c and d shows the distributions of csi for baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata respectively the distributions appear to be very akin to fig 8 a because of their preferences in habitat variables are similar to those of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi fig 9 a shows the predicted csi values for the four macroinvertebrates at the four monitoring stations for comparison monitored populations of the four macroinvertebrates are given in fig 9 b the observed populations in the figure are normalized by the total number of populations sampled kil 2007 it can be seen that the phs effectively predicts the most dominant macroinvertebrate species for example at st 1 the predicted csi of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is larger than the csis of the other three species indicating hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is the most dominant species the observed data also indicate that the most dominant macroinvertebrate is hydropsyche kozhantschikovi at st 1 specifically the normalized population of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is 50 while chironomidae cheumatopsyche brevilineata and baetis fuscatus are 9 2 13 and 9 respectively 3 2 composite suitability index for the target fishes fig 10 shows the csi distributions of the target fishes under normal flow condition it can be seen that the csis for rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are high in riffles this is because both are lotic fishes which prefer shallow water high velocity and fine gravel the high csi area for rhinogobius brunneus is larger than for zacco platypus which indicates that the optimal habitat range is narrower for zacco platypus than rhinogobius brunneus as can be seen in fig 5 the csi distribution for pseudogobio esocinus is given in fig 10 c where the csi is high in pools this is because pseudogobio esocinus are lentic fish that prefers deep water low velocity and sand 3 3 suitable feeding habitat figs 11 13 show the distribution of suitable feeding habitats for the three target fishes that is for each target fish csisbf were individually calculated for the four macroinvertebrates and the area whose csibf is larger than 0 36 is denoted in the figure for each macroinvertebrate the suitable feeding habitats for rhinogobius brunneus are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that rhinogobius brunneus s suitable feeding habitats are mainly located in riffles this is because the three target macroinvertebrates primarily inhabit the riffle except for chironomidae the suitable feeding habitats for zacco platypus are shown in fig 12 since zacco platypus prefers ranges of the habitat variables similar to those preferred by rhinogobius brunneus their suitable feeding habitats are similar to those in fig 11 the results in figs 11 and 12 showed that the suitable feeding habitat for the target fishes was predicted appropriately by reflecting their feeding strategy that is rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are lotic fishes which inhabit in fast flow habitats they preferentially select the feeding strategy of catching the drifting macroinvertebrate in the riffles this strategy also has benefits that coarse substrate materials generate small wakes and dead water zones where drifting macroinvertebrates are trapped sone et al 2001 simulated results showed that the suitable feeding habitat was mainly formed in the riffles indicating that these species are mainly feeding on the drifting macroinvertebrates in the study area fig 13 shows the suitable feeding habitats for pseudogobio esocinus for the four macroinvertebrates it can be seen that macroinvertebrates such as hydropsyche kozhantschikovi baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata rarely provide suitable feeding habitats for this species this is because that pseudogobio esocinus prefers pools but these three macroinvertebrates inhabit riffles however chironomidae provide pseudogobio esocinus with suitable feeding habitats especially in pools as can be seen in fig 12 b the suitable feeding habitat in fig 13 showed also prey preference of the target fish simulation results indicated that pseudogobio esocinus has the suitable feeding habitat for chironomidae specially in the pools although hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is most abundant in the study area similarly katano et al 2004 observed that pseudogobio esconius has higher preference for chironomidae rather than for other macroinvertebrate species this phenomenon is highly related to the feeding strategy that pseudogobio esocinus swallows the sand with the food and puffs out the sand through the gills therefore suitable feeding habitat for pseudogobio esocinus can be formed in the fine sediment area as seen in the figure 3 4 weighted usable area and weighted epi benthic feeding area fig 14 shows comparisons between the wua and total wbfa for the three target fishes the total wbfa is the sum of the wbfas for the four invertebrates here the total wbfa is regarded as the quantity of available habitats for the target fish where the feeding conditions are suitable and the wua is the quantity of available habitats without taking feeding conditions into consideration in the figure the wua for pseudogobio ecocinus is the largest followed by rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus however the wbfa for rhinogobius brunneus is larger than the wbfa for zacco platypus which is larger than that of pseudogobio esocinus the distribution of wbfas is consistent with the distribution of the observed populations of fish species in fig 4 a it is interesting to note that the wua of pseudogobio esocinus is the largest but the wbfa is the smallest this because the food availability limited the abundance of the pseudogobio esocinus even if a larger physical habitat is provided this implies that feeding conditions can be a critical factor for estimating the abundance of target fishes using phs in summary the comparison demonstrates that phs without considering the feeding condition may fail to predict the fish abundance properly 4 conclusions this study presented the suitable feeding habitat for target fishes using phss a suitable feeding habitat was defined as a species appropriate physical habitat where the feeding conditions were also suitable a 0 9 km long reach located in the upstream part of the gongneung cheon stream in korea was chosen for the study area the selected target fishes were rhinogobius brunneus zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus in the study area four macroinvertebrate species were found to be dominant namely hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata these macroinvertebrates are main sources of food for the target fishes a two dimensional hydrodynamic model was used for flow computations for habitat simulations hscs were used for both fish and macroinvertebrates for the target fishes the hscs suggested by kim and choi 2017 and kang 2010 were used the hscs for macroinvertebrates were newly constructed using the monitoring data in the han gang river basin phss were carried out for the normal flow and the distributions of csi for macroinvertebrates were presented the csi distributions for hydropsyche kozhantschikovi baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata showed high suitability in the riffles while chironomidae showed high suitability in the pools the predicted csi distributions were compared with field monitoring data which showed similar trends then phss for the three target fishes were performed and the distributions of the suitable feeding habitat for each fish were presented the suitable feeding habitat is the habitat area where the csi for epi benthic feeding a product of the csi for the target fish and the csi for macroinvertebrates is larger than 0 36 the simulation results indicated that the suitable feeding habitats for rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are formed in the riffles and those for pseudogobio esocinus are located in pools this is because suitable feeding habitats are formed where the zone of suitable physical habitat is overlapped with the zone of prey abundance finally the wua and total wbfa for the target fishes were compared the total wbfa estimated the largest suitable feeding habitat for rhinogobius brunneus followed by zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus this result is consistent with monitored fish abundance in the study site however the wua predicted that pseudogobio esocinus would be the most dominant this means that the wbfa predicted the relative abundances of the target fishes better than the wua in the study site in other words the phss for fish that do not consider feeding conditions may fail to predict fish abundance correctly in the conventional phs physical habitat variables were regarded as unique factors limiting the habitat quality of fishes in this study the feeding condition of the target fishes was considered using the phs for macroinvertebrates the suitable feeding habitat was presented by combining the results of the phss for macroinvertebrates and fishes the distribution of suitable feeding habitat represented adequately the habitat area that satisfies feeding condition as well as physical habitat condition this study used hscs a knowledge based model for habitat simulations however recent trends indicate that knowledge based models are being replaced by data driven models based on the ai based techniques examples in the sustainable river management include chen and chau 2016 and nabavi pelesaraei et al 2017 if combined with such data driven methods for habitat simulations the concept of the suitable feeding habitat can be more robustly applied to the estimation of the environmental flow or river restoration acknowledgements

25213,this study presented the suitable feeding habitat for target fish species using physical habitat simulations for both fishes and macroinvertebrates the suitable feeding habitat is a novel concept for the fish habitat that guarantees a certain level of feeding condition as well as the suitability of the physical habitat the study site is a 0 9 km long reach of the gongneung cheon stream which is a tributary of the han gang river in korea three dominant fish species were selected as target fishes such as rhinogobius brunneus zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus in order to consider the feeding condition of these fishes hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata were selected as target macroinvertebrates physical habitat simulations were carried out for both fishes and macroinvertebrates and the distributions of the suitable feeding habitat for the target fishes were provided it was shown that the suitable feeding habitat properly represents the quality of the target fishes habitats then the weighted usable area wua and weighted epi benthic feeding area wbfa for target fishes were compared and the results indicated that wbfa predicts fish abundance better than wua keywords suitable feeding habitat physical habitat simulation feeding condition macroinvertebrate weighted epi benthic feeding area 1 introduction physical habitat simulation phs is a numerical tool that quantifies the quality of habitats for target fish species in a stream phs evaluates the suitability of physical habitat in terms of flow depth velocity and substrate at a particular rate of discharge bovee 1982 booker and dunbar 2004 the outputs of phs are the composite suitability index csi and the weighted usable area wua which indicate the quality of habitats for target fish species in the study area the phs was originally developed for estimating instream flows downstream of large dams in north america milhous 1999 and has been applied to various problems in river management examples include the estimation of environmental flows papadaki et al 2014 nikghalb et al 2016 and the investigation of the effects of river restoration schemes particularly the effects of removing weirs im et al 2011 and dams gillenwater et al 2006 tomsic et al 2007 phs has also been applied to identify the impact of constructing hydraulic installations such as dams valentin et al 1996 yi et al 2014 boavida et al 2015 large wood structures he et al 2009 and spur dykes chang et al 2013 although previous applications of phs seem to have been successful it has often been criticized because its assessment of habitat quality is only affected by the physical habitat variables roussel et al 1999 pointed out that the conventional phs does not reflect fishes feeding condition rosenfeld and ptolemy 2012 also argued that phs which focuses on changes in available habitat at different discharge rates normally neglects prey abundance macroinvertebrates serve as a major source of food to fishes in streams food availability is known to directly affect the growth distribution and population of fishes jones 1986 muotka 1993 rosenfeld and boss 2001 devlin et al 2004 graeb et al 2004 moreover imbalances between the fish and macroinvertebrate communities can incur the degradation of fishes habitats brusven et al 1974 therefore the quality of fish habitats is determined not only by the physical habitat variables but also by prey abundance previous studies have indicated that the abundance of macroinvertebrates is affected by hydraulic parameters such as the froude number shear velocity flow velocity and substrate statzner 1981 culp et al 1983 brooks et al 2005 duan et al 2008 based on this various phss for macroinvertebrates have been carried out just as they have for fishes gore et al 1998 performed phs for macroinvertebrates to investigate the effect of artificial riffles in a stream gore et al used physical habitat simulation system phabsim and habitat suitability curves hscs for macroinvertebrates the simulation results showed that the benthic community s diversity had improved after the construction of artificial riffles waddle and holmquist 2013 carried out phss for rarefied number of species ept ephemeroptera plecoptera tricoptera and plecoptera in the tuolumme river us multivariate suitability curves were used for habitat simulations they found that water abstraction can degrade macroinvertebrate populations as a result of reducing the available wetted area kelly et al 2015 performed phss for deleatidium spp and ept in braided rivers in new zealand they found that downstream diversion decreased the biomass of macroinvertebrates these previous studies provide a possibility of predicting the prey abundance for fishes using the phss for macroinvertebrates this study proposed a method to predict the suitable feeding habitat for target fishes in a stream here a suitable feeding habitat refers to a suitable physical habitat with the favorable feeding condition for fishes the main challenge is that the conventional phss predict the suitability of fish habitat based only on the physical habitat condition the suitable feeding habitat is expected to represent the habitat quality better than the habitat predicted by the conventional phss the study site was selected as the gongneung cheon stream which is a tributary of the han gang river korea for the same study area im et al 2011 investigated the change in the physical habitat after a weir removal using the phs for the dominant fish later kim and choi 2017 carried out phss with hscs generated in the same study reach and presented csi distributions for both fishes and macroinvertebrates in the present study the suitable feeding habitat a novel concept for habitat quality is presented the target fishes were rhinogobius brunneus zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus and the target macroinvertebrates were hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata hscs for the target macroinvertebrates were constructed based on monitoring data from the han gang river basin phss for target macroinvertebrates and fishes were carried out and the csi distributions for both were presented the product of the csi for the target fishes and the csi for the target macroinvertebrates called csi the for epi benthic feeding csibf was obtained and used as an indicator for the suitable feeding habitat the wua and weighted epi benthic feeding area wbfa for target fishes were compared and discussed fig 1 shows a procedure of computing the suitable feeding habitat for fishes in the stream first habitat variables such as the flow depth velocity and substrate are obtained for a particular discharge via the hydraulic simulation using the results from the hydraulic simulation the habitat simulations are performed for both macroinvertebrates and fishes at this stage the composite suitability indices for macroinvertebrates and fishes are evaluated over the study area then the composite suitability index for the epi benthic feeding which is the product of the csi for the macroinvertebrates and the csi for fishes is computed finally the suitable feeding habitat defined by the habitat whose csi for epi benthic feeding is sufficiently high is predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and monitoring data fig 2 shows the study site which is a reach about 0 9 km long reach located at the upstream portion of the gongneung cheon stream the gongneung cheon stream a tributary of the han gang river is located in the kyeonggi province in the north western part of korea the gongneung cheon stream is 45 0 km long and has a watershed area of 253 1 km2 the discharge rates for drought flow q355 low flow q275 normal flow q185 and averaged wet flow q95 are 0 28 0 51 0 91 and 1 73 m3 s respectively korea institute of construction and technology 2008 here qn denotes the average flow discharge that is exceeded on n days of the year as shown in fig 2 the study reach includes pool and riffle sequences whose bed elevation profiles are shown in the following figure in the longitudinal direction fig 3 shows the changes of the thalweg and the median size of the bed sediment with the longitudinal distance the thalweg and sediment size profiles show the presence of pool and riffle sequences more evidently that is riffles are located about 200 m and 400 m from the upstream end and pools are about 330 m and 650 m from the upstream end interestingly the bed materials are coarse and fine in the riffles and pools respectively the locations of the macroinvertebrate monitoring stations are also plotted in fig 2 as can be seen in the figure st 1 and st 3 are located in the riffles and st 2 in a pool st 4 is located in a run an intermediate zone with a wavy water surface between the pool and riffle and a pool is located downstream from st 4 the median sizes of the bed sediment at st 1 st 4 are 6 0 0 9 5 5 and 2 0 mm respectively fig 4 shows the distribution of dominant fishes and macroinvertebrates obtained by field monitorings in the study site the field monitoring for fishes was conducted for the entire study reach in august 2006 it was found that rhinogobius brunneus was the most dominant fish followed by zacco platypus and peudogobio esocinus as shown in fig 4 a korea institute of construction and technology 2008 in this study these three dominant fishes were selected as the target fishes fig 4 b shows the distribution of the dominant macroinvertebrates in the study site the field monitoring for macroinvertebrates was conducted at the four monitoring sites shown in fig 3 in june 2006 field monitoring revealed that four macroinvertebrates were dominant in the study reach namely hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata and they accounted for 80 of the total macroinvertebrate community previous studies have found that these four macroinvertebrates serve as the main food sources for the three target fishes in the study site sone et al 2001 inoue et al 2005 chang et al 2008 katano 2011 2 2 hydraulic simulation in the present study the river2d model developed by steffler and blackburn 2002 was used for the flow computation the 2d hydraulic models have been used widely in the phss because of their acceptable accuracy and resolution with reasonable computational costs leclerc et al 1995 ghanem et al 1996 the river2d model solves 2d shallow water equations using the finite element method the shallow water equations consist of the following continuity and x and y momentum equations respectively 1 h t q x x q y y 0 2 q x t u q x x v q x y g 2 h 2 x g h s o x s f x 1 ρ h τ x x x 1 ρ h τ x y y 3 q x t u q y x v q y y g 2 h 2 y g h s o y s f y 1 ρ h τ y x x 1 ρ h τ y y y where t is the time x and y are the streamwise and transverse directions respectively h is the flow depth u v are the depth averaged velocities in the x y directions respectively q x q y are the unit discharges in the x y directions respectively s o x s o y are the bed slopes in the x y directions respectively s f x s f y are the friction slopes in the x y directions respectively τ i j is the horizontal turbulent stress tensor ρ is the water density and g is the gravitational acceleration the x and y components of the friction slope are respectively estimated by 4a b s f x n 2 u u 2 v 2 h 4 3 s f y n 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient in the same study area im et al 2011 calibrated the roughness coefficient for the normal flow and proposed n 0 027 which was used in the present study the flow model was validated by comparing the computed flow with measured data specifically the lateral profile of the computed velocity was compared with velocity data measured by large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv and detailed comparisons can be found in im et al 2011 2 3 habitat simulation 2 3 1 habitat suitability curves for the habitat simulation both knowledge based models and data driven models can be used the hsc is a representative knowledge based model data driven models include statistical models and artificial intelligence ai based models multiple linear regression model vadas and orth 2001 and generalized linear model labonne et al 2003 are statistical models ai based models include fuzzy logic jorde et al 2001 kerle et al 2002 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis method jung and choi 2015 and gene expression programming gep model choi and choi 2015 in this study hscs constructed by the method of gosse 1982 were used in habitat simulations for both fishes and macroinvertebrates this method is known to be simple but its results are reliable im et al 2018 the method of gosse gives suitability index values of 1 0 0 5 0 1 and 0 05 to the range of variables that encompasses 50 75 90 and 95 of the observations respectively fig 5 shows the hscs for the target fishes used in the present phss the hscs for rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus were proposed by kim and choi 2017 and the hscs for pseudogobio esocinus by kang 2010 the hscs for the three target fishes were constructed using the field monitoring data from the han gang river basin this is important because the phss may predict available habitat inappropriately when they use hscs generated in the other watershed glozier et al 1997 moir et al 2005 it can be seen in the figure that the optimal ranges of rhinogobius brunneus are 0 20 0 30 m 0 40 0 90 m s and 4 fine gravel for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively the respective ranges that zacco platypus prefers are 0 20 0 30 m 0 38 0 73 m s and 4 fine gravel for the flow depth velocity and substrate pseudogobio esocinus s optimal ranges are 0 34 0 54 m 0 00 0 17 m s and 2 silt for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are lotic fishes and pseudogobio esocinus is the lentic fish these features of the target fishes can be observed in the hscs fig 5 that is lotic fishes prefer shallow water high velocity and coarse substrate and lentic fishes prefer deep water low velocity and fine substrate in order to construct hscs for the target macroinvertebrates monitoring data obtained from the han gang river basin were used moe nier 2011 the total number of monitoring data is 340 the data include the population of macroinvertebrates water temperature turbidity flow depth velocity and substrates for the sake of convenience the monitored populations of the macroinvertebrates were converted into population density population m2 which is the number of individual macroinvertebrate per unit bed area in the present study for the phs for macroinvertebrates the same physical habitat variables as those for the fishes were used namely flow depth velocity and substrate fig 6 presents bubble diagrams showing the habitat characteristics for each target macroinvertebrate in the figure the observed population densities of macroinvertebrates are plotted against flow depth velocity and substrate and the size of bubble indicates the population density the figure indicates that hydropsyche kozhantschikovi baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata prefer shallow water high velocity and coarse substrate this is consistent with kwon et al 2013 report that these three macroinvertebrate species inhabit riffles with coarse substrates contrastingly chironomidae prefer deep water low velocity and fine substrate this conforms with the fact that chironomidae can be found in a wide range of aquatic habitats including both lotic and lentic environments and dwell in fine substrates frouz et al 2003 kwon et al 2013 fig 7 shows the hscs for the four target macroinvertebrates the monitoring data in fig 5 were used in the construction of the hscs it can be seen that hydropsyche kozhantschikovi prefers the ranges of 0 19 0 26 m 0 50 0 78 m s and 4 fine gravel for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively the ranges for each habitat variable preferred by baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata appear to be similar to the optimal ranges of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi however the ranges preferred by chironomadae are different i e 0 15 0 30 m 0 38 0 69 m s and 3 sand for the flow depth velocity and substrate respectively that is this species prefers deep water low velocity and fine substrate compared to the other three macroinvertebrate species this is consistent with the distributions in fig 6 2 3 2 composite suitability index the csi for the target species both macroinvertebrates and fishes can be calculated by various methods examples include the multiplicative aggregation method the geometric mean method the minimum method and the weighted mean method in the present study the following weighted mean method was used to compute csi for target species 5 c s i i f h i h a f v i v b f s i s c where i m and f for macroinvertebrates and fishes respectively f h v i h v is the suitability value for each physical habitat variable h v here h v includes flow depth h velocity v and substrate s in eq 5 a b and c are weighting factors for h v and s respectively as can be seen from eq 5 the weighted mean method enables different weightings to each habitat variable easily which provides a clear advantage compared to the other methods because macroinvertebrates usually live on the stream bed the substrate is the most crucial factor among others quinn and hickey 1990 beisel et al 1998 buss et al 2004 brooks et al 2005 duan et al 2008 in the present study such values of weighting factors as a 0 260 b 0 327 and c 0 413 were used these weighting factors were proposed by li et al 2009 who used the analytic hierarchy process regarding fishes the same value was used for each weighting factor i e a b c 1 3 it was assumed that weighting factors rarely change across macroinvertebrate or fish species this can be supported by previous studies in the literature such as clark et al 2008 costa et al 2015 and armas vargas et al 2017 the csi computed by eq 5 indicates the quality of habitat for macroinvertebrate or fish species the individual csis can be combined to represent the quality of fish habitat considering the feeding condition holzapfel et al 2017 the idea is that fishes try to maximize their energy gains in relation to their energy costs when capturing prey gerking 1994 pyke et al 1977 holzapfel et al 2017 therefore adjacency or accessibility to prey is regarded as a critical factor of food availability fishes accessibility to macroinvertebrates can be expressed as the product of the csi for fishes and the csi for invertebrates given by csibf 6 c s i b f c s i f c s i m where csif and csim are the csis for fishes and macroinvertebrates respectively 2 3 3 suitable feeding habitat in order to define the suitable feeding habitat feeding habitat conditions should be categorized based on the csi for epi benthic feeding benjankar et al 2015 classified the quality of a habitat based on csi values namely no habitat poor habitat fair habitat good habitat and excellent habitat for csi values in the ranges of 0 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 6 0 8 and 0 8 1 0 respectively wei et al 2009 evaluated habitats as suitable when they had csi values in the range of 0 6 0 79 and highly suitable as having csi values in the range of 0 8 1 0 im et al 2018 defined highly suitable portion if the csi exceeds 0 6 in the present study feeding habitats were grouped based on the critical csi values determined by benjankar et al 2015 as shown in table 1 since the csi for epi benthic feeding is the product of the csi for fish and the csi for macroinvertebrate it is mostly lower than individual csi in the present study the suitable feeding habitat is defined as the suitable physical habitat c s i f 0 6 with suitable feeding conditions c s i m 0 6 thus the categories of good feeding habitat and excellent feeding habitat correspond to suitable feeding habitat 2 3 4 weighted usable area and weighted epi benthic feeding area in the conventional phs wua denotes the quantity of available habitat in the study area in the present study the quantity of available habitat that provides suitable feeding is represented by wbfa the wua and wbfa are respectively estimated by 7 w u a i 1 n c s i f i a i 8 w b f a i 1 n c s i b f i a i where n is the total number of cells and a i is the area of the i th cell the concept of the wbfa was first proposed by holzapfel et al 2017 to investigate the impact of hydropeaking flows on the feeding condition of fish species in this study the wua is compared with the total wbfa which is the summation of the wbfas for the four target macroinvertebrates 3 results and discussion in this section results from the phss for both macroinvertebrates and fishes are presented first the csi distributions of the four target macroinvertebrates and the three target fishes for each macroinvertebrate are given then based on these csi distributions the suitable feeding habitats are predicted finally the wua and wbfa are computed and compared with each other 3 1 composite suitability index for the target macroinvertebrates fig 8 shows the csi distributions for target macroinvertebrates under normal flow conditions where q 0 9 m3 s csi values lie between 0 and 1 indicating the worst and the most optimal habitat quality respectively the csi distribution for hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is given in fig 8 a it can be seen that the csi is higher in riffles due to its preference for fine gravel substrate high velocity and shallow flow depth fig 8 b shows the csi distribution of chironomidae revealing that the csi is higher in pools in contrast with fig 8 a this is because chironomidae prefers sand low velocity and deep flow depth fig 8 c and d shows the distributions of csi for baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata respectively the distributions appear to be very akin to fig 8 a because of their preferences in habitat variables are similar to those of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi fig 9 a shows the predicted csi values for the four macroinvertebrates at the four monitoring stations for comparison monitored populations of the four macroinvertebrates are given in fig 9 b the observed populations in the figure are normalized by the total number of populations sampled kil 2007 it can be seen that the phs effectively predicts the most dominant macroinvertebrate species for example at st 1 the predicted csi of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is larger than the csis of the other three species indicating hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is the most dominant species the observed data also indicate that the most dominant macroinvertebrate is hydropsyche kozhantschikovi at st 1 specifically the normalized population of hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is 50 while chironomidae cheumatopsyche brevilineata and baetis fuscatus are 9 2 13 and 9 respectively 3 2 composite suitability index for the target fishes fig 10 shows the csi distributions of the target fishes under normal flow condition it can be seen that the csis for rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are high in riffles this is because both are lotic fishes which prefer shallow water high velocity and fine gravel the high csi area for rhinogobius brunneus is larger than for zacco platypus which indicates that the optimal habitat range is narrower for zacco platypus than rhinogobius brunneus as can be seen in fig 5 the csi distribution for pseudogobio esocinus is given in fig 10 c where the csi is high in pools this is because pseudogobio esocinus are lentic fish that prefers deep water low velocity and sand 3 3 suitable feeding habitat figs 11 13 show the distribution of suitable feeding habitats for the three target fishes that is for each target fish csisbf were individually calculated for the four macroinvertebrates and the area whose csibf is larger than 0 36 is denoted in the figure for each macroinvertebrate the suitable feeding habitats for rhinogobius brunneus are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that rhinogobius brunneus s suitable feeding habitats are mainly located in riffles this is because the three target macroinvertebrates primarily inhabit the riffle except for chironomidae the suitable feeding habitats for zacco platypus are shown in fig 12 since zacco platypus prefers ranges of the habitat variables similar to those preferred by rhinogobius brunneus their suitable feeding habitats are similar to those in fig 11 the results in figs 11 and 12 showed that the suitable feeding habitat for the target fishes was predicted appropriately by reflecting their feeding strategy that is rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are lotic fishes which inhabit in fast flow habitats they preferentially select the feeding strategy of catching the drifting macroinvertebrate in the riffles this strategy also has benefits that coarse substrate materials generate small wakes and dead water zones where drifting macroinvertebrates are trapped sone et al 2001 simulated results showed that the suitable feeding habitat was mainly formed in the riffles indicating that these species are mainly feeding on the drifting macroinvertebrates in the study area fig 13 shows the suitable feeding habitats for pseudogobio esocinus for the four macroinvertebrates it can be seen that macroinvertebrates such as hydropsyche kozhantschikovi baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata rarely provide suitable feeding habitats for this species this is because that pseudogobio esocinus prefers pools but these three macroinvertebrates inhabit riffles however chironomidae provide pseudogobio esocinus with suitable feeding habitats especially in pools as can be seen in fig 12 b the suitable feeding habitat in fig 13 showed also prey preference of the target fish simulation results indicated that pseudogobio esocinus has the suitable feeding habitat for chironomidae specially in the pools although hydropsyche kozhantschikovi is most abundant in the study area similarly katano et al 2004 observed that pseudogobio esconius has higher preference for chironomidae rather than for other macroinvertebrate species this phenomenon is highly related to the feeding strategy that pseudogobio esocinus swallows the sand with the food and puffs out the sand through the gills therefore suitable feeding habitat for pseudogobio esocinus can be formed in the fine sediment area as seen in the figure 3 4 weighted usable area and weighted epi benthic feeding area fig 14 shows comparisons between the wua and total wbfa for the three target fishes the total wbfa is the sum of the wbfas for the four invertebrates here the total wbfa is regarded as the quantity of available habitats for the target fish where the feeding conditions are suitable and the wua is the quantity of available habitats without taking feeding conditions into consideration in the figure the wua for pseudogobio ecocinus is the largest followed by rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus however the wbfa for rhinogobius brunneus is larger than the wbfa for zacco platypus which is larger than that of pseudogobio esocinus the distribution of wbfas is consistent with the distribution of the observed populations of fish species in fig 4 a it is interesting to note that the wua of pseudogobio esocinus is the largest but the wbfa is the smallest this because the food availability limited the abundance of the pseudogobio esocinus even if a larger physical habitat is provided this implies that feeding conditions can be a critical factor for estimating the abundance of target fishes using phs in summary the comparison demonstrates that phs without considering the feeding condition may fail to predict the fish abundance properly 4 conclusions this study presented the suitable feeding habitat for target fishes using phss a suitable feeding habitat was defined as a species appropriate physical habitat where the feeding conditions were also suitable a 0 9 km long reach located in the upstream part of the gongneung cheon stream in korea was chosen for the study area the selected target fishes were rhinogobius brunneus zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus in the study area four macroinvertebrate species were found to be dominant namely hydropsyche kozhantschikovi chironomidae baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata these macroinvertebrates are main sources of food for the target fishes a two dimensional hydrodynamic model was used for flow computations for habitat simulations hscs were used for both fish and macroinvertebrates for the target fishes the hscs suggested by kim and choi 2017 and kang 2010 were used the hscs for macroinvertebrates were newly constructed using the monitoring data in the han gang river basin phss were carried out for the normal flow and the distributions of csi for macroinvertebrates were presented the csi distributions for hydropsyche kozhantschikovi baetis fuscatus and cheumatopsyche brevilineata showed high suitability in the riffles while chironomidae showed high suitability in the pools the predicted csi distributions were compared with field monitoring data which showed similar trends then phss for the three target fishes were performed and the distributions of the suitable feeding habitat for each fish were presented the suitable feeding habitat is the habitat area where the csi for epi benthic feeding a product of the csi for the target fish and the csi for macroinvertebrates is larger than 0 36 the simulation results indicated that the suitable feeding habitats for rhinogobius brunneus and zacco platypus are formed in the riffles and those for pseudogobio esocinus are located in pools this is because suitable feeding habitats are formed where the zone of suitable physical habitat is overlapped with the zone of prey abundance finally the wua and total wbfa for the target fishes were compared the total wbfa estimated the largest suitable feeding habitat for rhinogobius brunneus followed by zacco platypus and pseudogobio esocinus this result is consistent with monitored fish abundance in the study site however the wua predicted that pseudogobio esocinus would be the most dominant this means that the wbfa predicted the relative abundances of the target fishes better than the wua in the study site in other words the phss for fish that do not consider feeding conditions may fail to predict fish abundance correctly in the conventional phs physical habitat variables were regarded as unique factors limiting the habitat quality of fishes in this study the feeding condition of the target fishes was considered using the phs for macroinvertebrates the suitable feeding habitat was presented by combining the results of the phss for macroinvertebrates and fishes the distribution of suitable feeding habitat represented adequately the habitat area that satisfies feeding condition as well as physical habitat condition this study used hscs a knowledge based model for habitat simulations however recent trends indicate that knowledge based models are being replaced by data driven models based on the ai based techniques examples in the sustainable river management include chen and chau 2016 and nabavi pelesaraei et al 2017 if combined with such data driven methods for habitat simulations the concept of the suitable feeding habitat can be more robustly applied to the estimation of the environmental flow or river restoration acknowledgements

25214,many species undergo significant shifts in population distribution in response to changes in climate this response can introduce a species to new competition from invasive organisms or influence the dynamics of an otherwise balanced ecosystem how can a species ensure its own survival while dealing with both interspecific competition and the effects of climate change we examine a two species discrete time continuous space population model to determine conditions for coexistence and criteria for persistence in a changing climate our analysis suggests that the cost of keeping pace with climate change can weaken the ability of a species to compete with others and that climate change has the capacity to shift the stable state solution of the population model these effects are somewhat mitigated by niche differentiation with the potential for habitat considered inhospitable to one species to provide refuge for the other using this model we simulate a hypothetical population of native bull trout salvelinus confluentus experiencing competition from invasive brook trout s fontinalis as their river habitat warms due to climate change based on current climate projections we find that bull trout are likely to disappear from the study area by 2080 with brook trout expanding their range in the absence of competition keywords population persistence climate change competition integrodifference equation moving habitat model average dispersal success 1 introduction climate change is having substantial impacts on species around the globe and these impacts are expected to increase dramatically over the coming century thomas et al 2011 field et al 2014 the effects can be seen at virtually every scale from the individual and micro habitat broitman et al 2009 to the population level pearson and dawson 2003 dispersal is a common species adaptation to climate change dawson et al 2011 poleward shifts have been observed in many species distributions in response to warming temperatures parmesan et al 1999 hickling et al 2006 sorte and thompson 2007 and shifts to higher elevations have been observed in others wilson et al 2005 chen et al 2011 interspecific competition can curtail the movement and spread of populations however as shifting into new habitat often involves competing with species that are already established dunson and travis 1991 davis et al 1998 although the importance of accounting for biotic interactions when modeling the effects of climate change on species has been well documented araújo and luoto 2007 van der putten et al 2010 urban et al 2012 there is a notable deficit of modeling tools available to accomplish this in part due to a lack of theoretical foundation on which to build gilman et al 2010 recent advances in modeling techniques have begun to address the gap between the assumptions of species distribution models and community ecology theory pollock et al 2014 harris 2015 thorson et al 2015 but these methods all use statistical approaches that ignore how biological traits and processes such as dispersal ability growth rate and niche breadth contribute to population survival here we describe a spatially explicit mechanistic competition model that incorporates aspects of climate change while explicitly accounting for population growth dispersal ability and competition we derive approximations of persistence criteria for each species and demonstrate the accuracy of the approximations finally we illustrate the model with two species of competing trout using observed stream temperature data and future climate projections for the salmon river in central idaho 2 methods 2 1 modeling competition interspecific competition in a static environment has been well studied through deterministic models such as the continuous time continuous space lotka volterra competition model cosner and lazer 1984 kan on 1997 or its discrete time analogue the leslie gower model leslie and gower 1958 cushing et al 2004 and the dynamics of these systems have been thoroughly described the lotka volterra model has been used to study the effects of climate change on vegetation patterns jesse 1999 svirezhev 2000 the leslie gower model has been used to model a variety of competitive systems including flour beetles park 1948 plant assemblages levine and rees 2002 adler et al 2007 and fish alsharawi and rhouma 2009 but we are unaware of any examples in the literature that explicitly incorporate climate change into the modeling framework the leslie gower model quantifies the populations of two univoltine species m and n given by 1 m t 1 λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t 2 n t 1 λ n n t 1 α n n t β n m t with α m λ m 1 k m α n λ n 1 k n where k m and k n represent the carrying capacities of species m and n and β m β n correspond to the strengths of competition between m and n eqs 1 and 2 have four fixed points denoted as 3 l 0 0 0 4 l m λ m 1 α m 0 5 l n 0 λ n 1 α n 6 l b α n λ m 1 β m λ n 1 α m α n β m β n α m λ n 1 β n λ m 1 α m α n β m β n l b is asymptotically stable leslie and gower 1958 when 7 λ n 1 α n λ m 1 β m and 8 λ m 1 α m λ n 1 β n integrodifference equations ides by contrast offer a spatially explicit approach to population modeling describing a population density n t x as a function of the cumulative effects of growth and dispersal at the previous time step written as 9 n t 1 x ω k x y f n t y d y where n t x is the population density in generation t at location x ω is the spatial domain f is the recruitment or growth function and k x y is the dispersal kernel of the species that reflects the likelihood of moving from a location y to a location x when ω is finite the population that disperses outside the domain does not survive ides have recently been used to describe the effects of climate related habitat shifts zhou and kot 2011 kot and phillips 2015 bouhours and lewis 2016 using the leslie gower competition model to describe the growth phase of our two species yields a system of integrodifference equations given by 10 m t 1 x ω m k m x y λ m m t y 1 α m m t y β m n t y d y 11 n t 1 x ω n k n x y λ n n t y 1 α n n t y β n m t y d y where k m x y k n x y are the dispersal kernels of species m and n as in eq 9 the parameters λ m λ n α m α n β m β n are as in eqs 1 and 2 we define the domains ω i such that ω i l i 1 ct l i 2 ct is a one dimensional length of climatically suitable habitat for species i and c represents the speed at which the habitat is shifting due to climate change zhou and kot 2011 which we assume here is constant we further assume that dispersal probability depends only on the distance between locations x and y which allows us to write the dispersal kernels as difference kernels i e k i x y k i x y finally we will only consider cases in which ω m ω n so that interaction between the two populations is possible 2 2 habitat we outline two different representations of habitat in the first two competing species occupy the same shifting patch in the second each species has its own separate patch but the habitats partially overlap one another 2 2 1 model 1 a shifting patch of habitat representing the domain as a patch of length l moving at a constant speed c yields the system 12 m t 1 x c t l c t k m x y f m t y n t y d y 13 n t 1 x c t l c t k n x y g m t y n t y d y with f and g representing the leslie gower growth functions in 10 and 11 if we wish to discuss persistence of the populations in the patch it is useful to reparameterize our model to the reference frame of the moving patch rather than absolute location substituting x ˆ x ct y ˆ y ct into 12 and 13 and shifting by c gives us 14 m t 1 x ˆ 0 l k m x ˆ c y ˆ f m t y ˆ n t y ˆ d y ˆ 15 n t 1 x ˆ 0 l k n x ˆ c y ˆ g m t y ˆ n t y ˆ d y ˆ for the remainder of this paper we will drop the hats on x ˆ and y ˆ for notational convenience when referring to a shifting patch of habitat with the understanding that x and y refer to locations in the shifting domain if the populations are able to coexist over time then we might reasonably expect each population to eventually settle at a stable distribution indeed such behavior is readily observable in numerical simulations we will denote these limiting distributions of m and n as m x and n x respectively without specifying kernels k m and k n it is not possible to find an explicit solution for this system instead we will derive approximations of the average population densities m and n of m x and n x which we will in turn use to approximate persistence criteria van kirk and lewis 1997 defined the average dispersal success s of a population on a domain ω as 16 s 1 ω ω ω k x y d x d y where ω represents the length of ω this approximation averages across the spatial aspects of the kernel to give a number that reflects the proportion of propagules that stay inside the domain after a single dispersal event from the perspective of the patch however it is apparent that kernels k m k n become increasingly asymmetric with increasing c unfortunately s does not translate well to asymmetric kernels reimer et al 2015 rinnan 2018 generalized s for asymmetric kernels defining the quantity 17 g s 1 ω ω ω k x c y k y c x d x d y which reflects the proportion of individuals staying in the patch after several dispersal events rinnan 2018 demonstrated that an ide with kernel k x c y has many similar characteristics to an ide with the symmetric kernel k x c y k y c x in particular gs can be used in place of s to more accurately determine the persistence criteria of populations modeled with asymmetric dispersal it is worth noting that gs s when c 0 we will use 17 to simplify 14 and 15 reducing the spatial population densities to their means we begin by averaging the populations m t x n t x over the patch of habitat which we denote as 18 m t 1 l 0 l m t x d x 19 n t 1 l 0 l n t x d x applying this average to both sides of 14 and 15 yields 20 1 l 0 l m t 1 x d x 1 l 0 l 0 l k m x c y f m t y n t y d y d x 21 1 l 0 l n t 1 x d x 1 l 0 l 0 l k n x c y g m t y n t y d y d x if the respective differences between m t x n t x and their spatial averages m t n t are small then the first terms of the taylor expansions of f and g about m t n t suggest that 22 f m t y n t y f m t n t 23 g m t y n t y g m t n t substituting these into 20 and 21 yields 24 1 l 0 l m t 1 x dx f m t n t 1 l 0 l 0 l k m x c y dy dx 25 1 l 0 l n t 1 x dx g m t n t 1 l 0 l 0 l k n x c y dy dx which can be approximated as 26 m t 1 gs m f m t n t 27 n t 1 gs n g m t n t where gs m and gs n represents the generalized average dispersal success of species m and n respectively see rinnan 2018 for a more thorough treatment of this approximation for a single species model more explicitly we have 28 m t 1 gs m λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t 29 n t 1 gs n λ n n t 1 α n n t β n m t this system has four fixed points at 30 p 0 0 0 31 p m s m λ m 1 α m 0 32 p n 0 s n λ n 1 α n 33 p b m n α n gs m λ m 1 β m gs n λ n 1 α m α n β m β n α m gs n λ n 1 β n gs m λ m 1 α m α n β m β n p b is asymptotically stable when 34 gs n λ n 1 α n gs m λ m 1 β m and 35 s m λ m 1 α m s n λ n 1 β n which is similar in form to the conditions of stability for the nontrivial fixed point l b of the leslie gower model described in 7 and 8 but with the addition of the dispersal success parameters gs m and gs n a proof of the stability of p b is offered in a following leslie and gower 1958 we find it helpful to define some parameters to simplify our notation a bit first let p q be given by 36 p gs m λ m 1 α m 37 q gs n λ n 1 α n which can be thought of as penalized carrying capacities that account for population loss due to dispersal note that if gs m 1 for example indicating all individuals staying inside the patch after dispersal then p λ m 1 α m k m second we define u and v such that 38 u β m β n α m α n 39 v β m gs n λ n 1 α n gs m λ m 1 u is the ratio of interspecific competition parameters to intraspecific competition parameters and can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of interspecific competition v is a function of the speed of climate change c since gs m and gs n are themselves functions of c as shown in 17 using these new parameters we may now more succinctly write the fixed points as 40 p 0 0 0 41 p m p 0 42 p n 0 q 43 p b p 1 v 1 u q 1 u v 1 u 2 2 2 model 2 overlapping patches of shifting habitat in this scenario each species has its own specialized habitat niche with some degree of overlap allowing for interaction between the two populations we denote the patches of habitat by 44 ω m l m 1 ct l m 2 ct 45 ω n l n 1 ct l n 2 ct with ω m ω n we further assume that both habitats are shifting at the same rate c the locations where the habitats do not overlap can provide locations of possible refuge for the species i e patches without competition from the other species see fig 2 our growth functions f and g may now be written piecewise so that 46 f m t y n t y λ m m t y 1 α m m t y l m 1 y l n 1 λ m m t y 1 α m m t y β m n t y l n 1 y l m 2 47 g m t y n t y λ n n t y 1 α n n t y β n m t y l n 1 y l m 2 λ n n t y 1 α n n t y l m 2 y l n 2 our system may be rewritten as a disjoint sum of ides in the example illustrated in fig 2 this takes the form 48 m t 1 x l m 1 l n 1 k m x c y λ m m t y 1 α m m t y d y l n 1 l m 2 k m x c y λ m m t y 1 α m m t y β m n t y d y 49 n t 1 x l n 1 l m 2 k n x c y λ n n t y 1 α n n t y β n m t y d y l m 2 l n 2 k n x c y λ n n t y 1 α n n t

possible as 50 φ m l m 2 l n 1 l m 51 φ n l m 2 l n 1 l n it can be shown see appendix b that 52 m t 1 1 φ m gs m 1 λ m m t 1 α m m t φ m gs m 2 λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t 53 n t 1 φ n gs n 1 λ n n t 1

coexistence equilibrium of equations 52 and 53 is prohibitively arduous to compute and we cannot derive an explicit formula for m and n as we did with models 1 and 2 instead we will make a few qualitative observations about the nature of the fixed point of interest first we can see that 52 and 53 are bound above by the case of no interaction and bound below by the case of interaction across the entire domain model 2 specifically we have 58 gs m λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t m t 1 gs m λ m m t 1 α m m t 59 gs n λ n n t 1 α n n t β n m t n t 1 gs n λ n n t 1 α n n t at equilibrium 58 and 59 become 60 gs m λ m m 1 α m m β m n m gs m λ m m 1 α m m 61 gs n λ n n 1 α n n β n m n gs n λ n n 1 α n n rearranging 60 and 61 let us denote the upper and lower bounds of m and n by the equations 62 l m n gs m λ m α m m 1 β m 63 u m m gs m λ m 1 α m p 64 l n m gs n λ n α n n 1 β n 65 u n n gs n λ n 1 α n q plotting these bounds in m n space we may visualize the regions of space that satisfy 60 and 61 corresponding to values of m n that result in coexistence see fig 3 in particular we see that the two populations at equilibrium will never be larger than what each can obtain in the absence of interaction with the other second since φ m φ n 0 by assumption 52 and 53 at equilibrium can be arranged to get 66 h m n g s m λ m 1 α m m 1 α m m β m 1 α m m 1 φ m g s m 1 λ m 67 h n m g s n λ n 1 α

1 φ n g s n 2 λ n 1 α n 3 results 3 1 persistence criteria when ω m ω n model 1 there are four possible outcomes for our model mutual extirpation species m survives species n survives or mutual survival these outcomes are summarized in fig 4 3 1 1 outcome i mutual extirpation survival of species m and n depends first and foremost on their respective abilities to keep pace with the speed of climate change when gs i λ i 1 the growth rate of species i will not be large enough to compensate for the population loss through dispersal and the speed of climate change and species i will go extinct mutual extirpation will occur when gs m λ m 1 and gs n λ n 1 or equivalently when p 0 and q 0 with p q as defined in eqs 36 and 37 in this sense p and q reflect persistence ability in a moving habitat 3 1 2 outcome ii m outcompetes n when p 0 and q 0 species n is unable keep pace with the speed of climate change and will die out this will simplify to a one dimensional shifting habitat ide model in which species m will experience beverton holt population growth in the absence of species n assuming both species can keep pace with climate change i e p 0 and q 0 species m will outcompete species n when either u v and v 1 with u v as defined in eqs 38 and 39 depending on initial population densities m may also outcompete n when u v and v 1 3 1 3 outcome iii n outcompetes m similarly when p 0 and q 0 species m will be unable to pace with the shifting habitat but species n will persist if both p 0 and q 0 species n will outcompete species m either when u v v 1 or when u v and v 1 if initial conditions are favorable for n 3 1 4 outcome iv mutual survival mutual survival occurs when both p 0 and q 0 and when u v 1 in this situation both species can keep pace with the speed of climate change and there is a stable equilibrium for both populations at the fixed point in eq 43 3 2 effects of climate change on competition the speed of climate change c has the capacity to change the longterm outcome of the system by shifting the equilibrium through a bifurcation holding all other parameters constant as the value of c changes the fixed point of the system may move through different stability regions of p q space this result reflects the compounding effects of climate change and competition even if a species is able to keep pace with a changing climate its capacity to compete with other species may be weakened which may lead to qualitatively different outcomes compared to competing with the same species in a static climate fig 4 illustrates this phenomenon using the same dispersal behavior as used in fig 1 and with k m 80 k n 100 β m β n 0 005 λ m 1 5 and λ n 2 5 when c 0 species n will outcompete species m due in part to its higher reproductive rate n has comparatively limited dispersal ability however and m is better equipped to keep pace with habitat changes as such when c 0 5 n loses its competitive advantage and mutual survival will occur when c 0 75 n can no longer keep pace and will go extinct but m will continue to survive at a lower mean population density when c 1 neither species will be able to persist expressing the criteria u v 1 for mutual survival in terms of p and q we expect the interactive effects of climate change and competition to induce a bifurcation when there is some value of c such that 70 q α m β m p or 71 p α n β n q 3 3 effects of refuge habitat when a species has habitat in which they do not experience competition model 2 this habitat may act as a stable island for a source population which can replenish losses incurred from competition in sufficiently nearby populations if φ m φ n 1 representing interaction between m and n across the entire domain as in model 1 66 and 67 reduces to 72 m gs n λ n 1 α n n β n 73 n gs m λ m 1 α m m β m which can be solved to get the coexistence fixed point p b of model 1 as expected as the amount of refuge for species m increases i e as φ m decreases the value of the asymptote a m in 68 increases which in turn increases the average population density at equilibrium of m a similar pattern of behavior can be seen in n fig 3 a shows us that in conditions that lead to m outcompeting n in model 1 u v v 1 it is possible for m and n to coexist if there is sufficient refuge habitat for n fig 3 b similarly shows that conditions that lead to n outcompeting m in model 1 can result in coexistence in model 2 fig 3 d shows that the conditions that led to unstable coexistence in model 1 1 v u may yield stable coexistence in model 2 the amount of refuge habitat is sufficient for species persistence when the population inside the refuge habitat can persist by itself this is equivalent to 74 1 φ m gs m 1 λ m 1 for species m and 75 1 φ n gs n 2 λ n 1 for species n 3 4 numerical validation to quantify the accuracy of the persistence criteria described in section 3 1 we ran numerical simulations of model 1 and compared the outcomes with those predicted by p q u and v with an unknown predicted outcome either m or n surviving when v 1 and u v we generated 10 000 sets of random parameter values with each parameter randomly drawn from a distribution that we judged to reflect biologically feasible values see table 1 we assumed gaussian dispersal for both species numerical ides were then run for 100 time steps using the randomly generated parameter values if the mean densities of the resulting populations were at least one tenth the carrying capacity of the species then the population was recorded as persisting and extirpated otherwise the value of the threshold will inevitably affect model performance but we believe ten percent is a conservative choice we also tested the effects of refuge habitat by running 10 000 simulations with the same sets of parameter values as model 1 but with an amount of overlap between the two habitats determined by random draw we then compared the differences in observed outcomes between models 1 and 2 all numerical simulation and analysis was conducted in r core team 2015 and our code is provided as supplementary material the persistence criteria described in section 3 1 correctly predicted the outcome of model 1 in 95 2 of the simulations approximately 38 of the models ended with mutual extinction 29 with m surviving over n 29 with n surviving over m and 5 with mutual survival of the 593 unknown m or n or incorrectly predicted outcomes 111 had outcomes that matched the predictions of one species outcompeting the other dependent on initial conditions another 391 may have been attributable to the effects of transient population dynamics with one or both species going extinct before the populations were able to reach the predicted equilibrium model 2 had 341 more instances of mutual survival than model 1 due to the availability of refuge habitat table 2 a compares the predicted outcomes with the observed outcomes and provides basic summary statistics 4 application to populations of competing trout we provide an illustration of model 2 with two hypothetical populations of competing trout species in a river that is warming due to climate change we attempted to use realistic parameter values where possible but we caution the reader against overinterpreting the results this example is intended to illustrate the dynamics of competitive invasion and the effects of climate change but should not be construed as a model for real populations real and levin 1991 bull trout salvelinus confluentus is a salmonid that thrives in clear cold mountain streams in the pacific northwest bull trout tolerate a relatively small range of water temperatures preferring mean summer temperatures below 13 c us fish and wildlife service et al 2008 isaak et al 2015 they are currently recognized as threatened under the endangered species act due to loss and degradation of spawning habitat increasing numbers of barriers to migration such as dams and increasing competition from nonnative species nakano et al 1998 gunckel et al 2002 the invasive brook trout s fontinalis is one such species intentionally introduced as a recreational fishing species in the late 1800s dunham et al 2002 with habitat requirements similar to those of bull trout but more tolerant of warm water thriving in temperatures up to 22 c dunham et al 2002 the undammed salmon river in central idaho provides ideal salmonid habitat stretching 684 km through sparsely populated mountainous terrain and spanning the thermal tolerances of both species we used the norwest stream temperature database downscaled to a 200 m resolution to obtain a mean august stream temperature profile for 2011 and a projected future profile based on global climate model ensemble averages that represent the a1b warming trajectory for 2080s 2070 2099 isaak et al 2011 we used carrying capacities of 5 1 fish 200 m and 15 fish 200 m for bull and brook trout respectively which reflect mean population densities observed via snorkeling surveys conducted by the idaho department of fish and game levin et al 2002 high et al 2008 growth rates of λ m 1 09 and λ n 1 1 were similarly estimated adams 1999 high et al 2008 we modeled dispersal with laplace kernels with mean dispersal distances of 1 km for bull trout and 200 m for brook trout hutchings and gerber 2002 representing populations with relatively high site fidelity a number of studies have found success at modeling fish dispersal with mixture kernels a linear combination of two kernels that collectively represent the sedentary and mobile dispersal processes commonly observed in stream networks skalski and gilliam 2000 rodríguez 2009 there is evidence of long distance dispersal ability in both bull and brook trout dunham et al 2002 us fish and wildlife service et al 2008 but we opted not to use mixture kernels here as this would have introduced several new parameters to the model with no population data to support their estimation competition coefficients are notoriously hard to quantify from observational field studies pfister 1995 gunckel et al 2002 noted that bull trout appear to demonstrate a competitive advantage over the invasive brook trout when interacting directly but nakano et al 1998 found no significant difference between the two thus we explored model outcomes for a variety of scenarios using 1681 ordered pairs of β m and β n with values ranging between 0 and 1 we initialized the population density m 0 x of bull trout at carrying capacity at any 200 m segment of the salmon river that was below its thermal limit of 13 c and the initial population density n 0 x of brook trout at carrying capacity downstream of the primary section of bull trout habitat to simulate potential upstream invasion see fig 5 a we then allowed the populations to grow disperse and interact according to the dynamics specified in 48 and 49 for 70 years with speed of climate change c 0 0377 c yr reflecting the predicted mean annual increase in temperature between 2011 2080 isaak et al 2011 this resulted in population densities m t x and n t x for each year t see fig 5b and c in all cases bull trout were heavily impacted by warming river temperature displaced upstream by more than 30 km in cases where β n was approximately less than 1 3 β m bull trout displayed a significant initial competitive advantage over brook trout and brook trout were prevented from populating the river where bull trout were present despite this advantage brook trout were able to maintain a population due to the downstream warmer water refuge that the bull trout could not occupy as the river warmed and bull trout were displaced to higher elevations the brook trout slowly replaced them at a pace determined by their dispersal ability when β n was approximately greater than 1 3 β m brook trout were able to outcompete bull trout and the bull trout were displaced from the river by the end of the burn in period our model suggests that bull trout will likely be extirpated from the salmon river by the beginning of the 22nd century if temperature increases continue on a similar trajectory as the 2080 projections 5 discussion the speed of climate change plays a critical role in the long term stability of the two species system beginning with conditions otherwise amenable to mutual persistence different speeds of climate change can either support persistence or result in either species outcompeting the other in all but the simplest cases an analytic formula for the critical speed at which a species is no longer able to persist does not exist zhou and kot 2011 rinnan 2018 demonstrated how to approximate characteristics of a single species model using the generalized average dispersal success and we demonstrated that this same method can likewise be used to gain insight into multiple species systems although our model explicitly accounts for growth dispersal and competition we emphasize that this model provides a very simple representation of population habitat and climate and does not account for many ecological processes and biological traits that may in fact help bull trout to persist among other things a more detailed understanding of life history adaptive capacity and habitat heterogeneity would undoubtedly be needed to predict extirpation with any confidence in this respect a number of caveats to our results are worth mentioning at the continental scale population distributions are largely determined by climate processes pearson and dawson 2003 at the scale of the individual however habitat selection can be strongly influenced by other processes such as spatial heterogeneity resource availability and environmental stochasticity our model delineates suitable habitat by thermal tolerances alone but this is no doubt overly simplistic from the perspective of an individual organism kareiva 1982 found that habitat heterogeneity led to different rates and patterns of dispersal in flea beetles and there is good reason to believe that the same behavior could be found in trout species due to their preferential selection of areas with vegetative cover or deep pools similarly our model assumes thoroughly homogeneous populations in reality demographic stochasticity will create different tolerances and reactions to changes in climate selong et al 2001 indeed adaptation can be a very effective response to climate change and adaptive processes such as evolutionary rescue and phenotypic plasticity likely play an equally important role as dispersal bell and gonzalez 2009 accounting for adaptation in this context is difficult in large part due to its unpredictability species interactions are complex and varied and are often not simply a matter of competitive exclusion the impacts of brook trout on bull trout populations for example are not just limited to resource pressures hybridization between the two species has negatively impacted bull trout as well moreover interactions are often not limited to just two competing species bull and brook trout are both sympatric with cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii and there is considerable evidence that brook trout have caused significant declines in cutthroat trout populations nakano et al 1998 dunham et al 2002 the model can be generalized to accommodate hybridization or a greater number of species but this will likely become unwieldy for even the simplest of cases nor are interactions constant through time and space the consequences of climate change are sometimes described as an example of a collective risk social dilemma in which cooperation is vital for mutual survival chen et al 2012 in this context climate change may actually introduce incentive for cooperation thereby changing the nature of interaction between competing populations a more realistic model might describe competition as β m y and β n y with competition strength varying spatially as a function of habitat quality amount of climate change or other extrinsic factors finally climate change is represented in our model as a simple linear increase in temperature in reality there is considerable variation in climate patterns year to year and decade to decade in mountain streams the quality of habitat is influenced by drought snowpack and forest fires isaak et al 2010 some amount of temperature variability could be introduced to the model by drawing values of the speed of climate change c at each time step from a specified distribution although our analysis involved several approximations and simplifications our delineation of parameter space nonetheless provides relatively accurate predictions of the long term outcome of the underlying ide model it is important to recognize however that this approach only predicts model outcome and fails to capture many of the interesting spatial characteristics of the ide model there is undoubtedly a great deal more to study regarding the size and spatial distributions of the populations themselves as we glimpsed in our example of competing species of trout and such a study will require an approach that preserves these properties fortunately it is quite straightforward to simulate the ide competition model explicitly which provides useful reference and validation for any analysis our model demonstrates how simple growth dispersal and competition processes can give rise to a variety of outcomes commonly observed in the ecologies of competition and climate change the fundamental model structure described in section 2 2 1 and section 2 2 2 does not only apply to the case of competition but can be generalized to model different types of interactions such as mutualism or predator prey by the appropriate selection of growth functions f and g we believe our approach provides a useful framework for exploring complex ecological systems and processes and deserves further exploration acknowledgements the author would like to thank mark kot for providing helpful feedback

25214,many species undergo significant shifts in population distribution in response to changes in climate this response can introduce a species to new competition from invasive organisms or influence the dynamics of an otherwise balanced ecosystem how can a species ensure its own survival while dealing with both interspecific competition and the effects of climate change we examine a two species discrete time continuous space population model to determine conditions for coexistence and criteria for persistence in a changing climate our analysis suggests that the cost of keeping pace with climate change can weaken the ability of a species to compete with others and that climate change has the capacity to shift the stable state solution of the population model these effects are somewhat mitigated by niche differentiation with the potential for habitat considered inhospitable to one species to provide refuge for the other using this model we simulate a hypothetical population of native bull trout salvelinus confluentus experiencing competition from invasive brook trout s fontinalis as their river habitat warms due to climate change based on current climate projections we find that bull trout are likely to disappear from the study area by 2080 with brook trout expanding their range in the absence of competition keywords population persistence climate change competition integrodifference equation moving habitat model average dispersal success 1 introduction climate change is having substantial impacts on species around the globe and these impacts are expected to increase dramatically over the coming century thomas et al 2011 field et al 2014 the effects can be seen at virtually every scale from the individual and micro habitat broitman et al 2009 to the population level pearson and dawson 2003 dispersal is a common species adaptation to climate change dawson et al 2011 poleward shifts have been observed in many species distributions in response to warming temperatures parmesan et al 1999 hickling et al 2006 sorte and thompson 2007 and shifts to higher elevations have been observed in others wilson et al 2005 chen et al 2011 interspecific competition can curtail the movement and spread of populations however as shifting into new habitat often involves competing with species that are already established dunson and travis 1991 davis et al 1998 although the importance of accounting for biotic interactions when modeling the effects of climate change on species has been well documented araújo and luoto 2007 van der putten et al 2010 urban et al 2012 there is a notable deficit of modeling tools available to accomplish this in part due to a lack of theoretical foundation on which to build gilman et al 2010 recent advances in modeling techniques have begun to address the gap between the assumptions of species distribution models and community ecology theory pollock et al 2014 harris 2015 thorson et al 2015 but these methods all use statistical approaches that ignore how biological traits and processes such as dispersal ability growth rate and niche breadth contribute to population survival here we describe a spatially explicit mechanistic competition model that incorporates aspects of climate change while explicitly accounting for population growth dispersal ability and competition we derive approximations of persistence criteria for each species and demonstrate the accuracy of the approximations finally we illustrate the model with two species of competing trout using observed stream temperature data and future climate projections for the salmon river in central idaho 2 methods 2 1 modeling competition interspecific competition in a static environment has been well studied through deterministic models such as the continuous time continuous space lotka volterra competition model cosner and lazer 1984 kan on 1997 or its discrete time analogue the leslie gower model leslie and gower 1958 cushing et al 2004 and the dynamics of these systems have been thoroughly described the lotka volterra model has been used to study the effects of climate change on vegetation patterns jesse 1999 svirezhev 2000 the leslie gower model has been used to model a variety of competitive systems including flour beetles park 1948 plant assemblages levine and rees 2002 adler et al 2007 and fish alsharawi and rhouma 2009 but we are unaware of any examples in the literature that explicitly incorporate climate change into the modeling framework the leslie gower model quantifies the populations of two univoltine species m and n given by 1 m t 1 λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t 2 n t 1 λ n n t 1 α n n t β n m t with α m λ m 1 k m α n λ n 1 k n where k m and k n represent the carrying capacities of species m and n and β m β n correspond to the strengths of competition between m and n eqs 1 and 2 have four fixed points denoted as 3 l 0 0 0 4 l m λ m 1 α m 0 5 l n 0 λ n 1 α n 6 l b α

equations ides by contrast offer a spatially explicit approach to population modeling describing a population density n t x as a function of the cumulative effects of growth and dispersal at the previous time step written as 9 n t 1 x ω k x y f n t y d y where n t x is the population density in generation t at location x ω is the spatial domain f is the recruitment or growth function and k x y is the dispersal kernel of the species that reflects the likelihood of moving from a location y to a location x when ω is finite the population that disperses outside the domain does not survive ides have recently been used to describe the effects of climate related habitat shifts zhou and kot 2011 kot and phillips 2015 bouhours and lewis 2016 using the leslie gower competition model to describe the growth phase of our two species yields a system of integrodifference equations given by 10 m t 1 x ω m k m x y λ m m t y 1 α m m t y β m n t y d y 11 n t 1 x ω n k n x y λ n n t y 1 α n n t y β n m t y d y where k m x y k n x y are the dispersal kernels of species m and n as in eq 9 the parameters λ m λ n α m α n β m β n are as in eqs 1 and 2 we define the domains ω i such that ω i l i 1 ct l i 2 ct is a one dimensional length of climatically suitable habitat for species i and c represents the speed at which the habitat is shifting due to climate change zhou and kot 2011 which we assume here is constant we further assume that dispersal probability depends only on the distance between locations x and y which allows us to write the dispersal kernels as difference kernels i e k i x y k i x y finally we will only consider cases in which ω m ω n so that interaction between the two populations is possible 2 2 habitat we outline two different representations of habitat in the first two competing species occupy the same shifting patch in the second each species has its own separate patch but the habitats partially overlap one another 2 2 1 model 1 a shifting patch of habitat representing the domain as a patch of length l moving at a constant speed c yields the system 12 m t 1 x c t l c t k m x y f m t y n t y d y 13 n t 1 x c t l c t k n x y g m t y n t y d y with f and g representing the leslie gower growth functions in 10 and 11 if we wish to discuss persistence of the populations in the patch it is useful to reparameterize our model to the reference frame of the moving patch rather than absolute location substituting x ˆ x ct y ˆ y ct into 12 and 13 and shifting by c gives us 14 m t 1 x ˆ 0 l k m x ˆ c y ˆ f m t y ˆ n t y ˆ d y ˆ 15 n t 1 x ˆ 0 l k n x ˆ c y ˆ g m t y ˆ n t y ˆ d y ˆ for the remainder of this paper we will drop the hats on x ˆ and y ˆ for notational convenience when referring to a shifting patch of habitat with the understanding that x and y refer to locations in the shifting domain if the populations are able to coexist over time then we might reasonably expect each population to eventually settle at a stable distribution indeed such behavior is readily observable in numerical simulations we will denote these limiting distributions of m and n as m x and n x respectively without specifying kernels k m and k n it is not possible to find an explicit solution for this system instead we will derive approximations of the average population densities m and n of m x and n x which we will in turn use to approximate persistence criteria van kirk and lewis 1997 defined the average dispersal success s of a population on a domain ω as 16 s 1 ω ω ω k x y d x d y where ω represents the length of ω this approximation averages across the spatial aspects of the kernel to give a number that reflects the proportion of propagules that stay inside the domain after a single dispersal event from the perspective of the patch however it is apparent that kernels k m k n become increasingly asymmetric with increasing c unfortunately s does not translate well to asymmetric kernels reimer et al 2015 rinnan 2018 generalized s for asymmetric kernels defining the quantity 17 g s 1 ω ω ω k x c y k y c x d x d y which reflects the proportion of individuals staying in the patch after several dispersal events rinnan 2018 demonstrated that an ide with kernel k x c y has many similar characteristics to an ide with the symmetric kernel k x c y k y c x in particular gs can be used in place of s to more accurately determine the persistence criteria of populations modeled with asymmetric dispersal it is worth noting that gs s when c 0 we will use 17 to simplify 14 and 15 reducing the spatial population densities to their means we begin by averaging the populations m t x n t x over the patch of habitat which we denote as 18 m t 1 l 0 l m t x d x 19 n t 1 l 0 l n t x d x applying this average to both sides of 14 and 15 yields 20 1 l 0 l m t 1 x d x 1 l 0 l 0 l k m x c y f m t y n t y d y d x 21 1 l 0 l n t 1 x d x 1 l 0 l 0 l k n x c y g m t y n t y d y d x if the respective differences between m t x n t x and their spatial averages m t n t are small then the first terms of the taylor expansions of f and g about m t n t suggest that 22 f m t y n t y f m t n t 23 g m t y n t y g m t n t substituting these into 20 and 21 yields 24 1 l 0 l m t 1 x dx f m t n t 1 l 0 l 0 l k m x c y dy dx 25 1 l 0 l n t 1 x dx g m t n t 1 l 0 l 0 l k n x c y dy dx which can be approximated as 26 m t 1 gs m f m t n t 27 n t 1 gs n g m t n t where gs m and gs n represents the generalized average dispersal success of species m and n respectively see rinnan 2018 for a more thorough treatment of this approximation for a single species model more explicitly we have 28 m t 1 gs m λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t 29 n t 1 gs n λ n n t 1 α n n t β n m t this system has four fixed points at 30 p 0 0 0 31 p m s m λ m 1 α m 0 32 p n 0 s n λ n 1 α n 33 p b m n α n gs m λ m 1 β m gs n λ n 1 α m α n β m β n α m gs n λ n 1 β n gs m λ m 1 α m α n β m β n p b is asymptotically stable when 34 gs

but with the addition of the dispersal success parameters gs m and gs n a proof of the stability of p b is offered in a following leslie and gower 1958 we find it helpful to define some parameters to simplify our notation a bit first let p q be given by 36 p gs m λ m 1 α m 37 q gs n λ n 1 α n which can be thought of as penalized carrying capacities that account for population loss due to dispersal note that if gs m 1 for example indicating all individuals staying inside the patch after dispersal then p λ m 1 α m k m second we define u and v such that 38 u β m β n α m α n 39 v β m gs n λ n 1 α n gs m λ m 1 u is the ratio of interspecific competition parameters to intraspecific competition parameters and can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of interspecific competition v is a function of the speed of climate change c since gs m and gs n are themselves functions of c as shown in 17 using these new parameters we may now more succinctly write the fixed points as 40 p 0 0 0 41 p m p 0 42 p n 0 q 43 p b p 1 v 1 u q 1 u v 1 u 2 2 2 model 2 overlapping patches of shifting habitat in this scenario each species has its own specialized habitat niche with some degree of overlap allowing for interaction between the two populations we denote the patches of habitat by 44 ω m l m 1 ct l m 2 ct 45 ω n l n 1 ct l n 2 ct with ω m ω n we further assume that both habitats are shifting at the same rate c the locations where the habitats do not overlap can provide locations of possible refuge for the species i e patches without competition from the other species see fig 2 our growth functions f and g may now be written piecewise so that 46 f m t y n t y λ m m t y 1 α m m t y l m 1 y l n 1 λ m m t y 1 α m m t y β m n t y l n 1 y l m 2 47 g m t y n t y λ n n t y 1 α n n t y β n m t y l n 1 y l m 2 λ n n t y 1 α n n t y l m 2 y l n 2 our system may be rewritten as a disjoint sum of ides in the example illustrated in fig 2 this takes the form 48 m t 1 x l m 1 l n 1 k m

possible as 50 φ m l m 2 l n 1 l m 51 φ n l m 2 l n 1 l n it can be shown see appendix b that 52 m t 1 1 φ m gs m 1 λ m m t 1 α m m t φ m gs m 2 λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t 53 n t 1 φ n gs n 1 λ n n t 1 α n n t β n m t 1 φ n gs n 2 λ n n t 1 α n n t where 54 g s m 1 1 l n 1 l m 1 l m 1 l n 1 l m 1 l m 2 f m x y d x d y 55 g s m 2 1 l m 2 l n 1 l n 1 l m 2 l m 1 l m 2 f m x y d x d y 56 g s n 1 1 l m

coexistence equilibrium of equations 52 and 53 is prohibitively arduous to compute and we cannot derive an explicit formula for m and n as we did with models 1 and 2 instead we will make a few qualitative observations about the nature of the fixed point of interest first we can see that 52 and 53 are bound above by the case of no interaction and bound below by the case of interaction across the entire domain model 2 specifically we have 58 gs m λ m m t 1 α m m t β m n t m t 1 gs m λ m m t 1 α m m t 59 gs n λ n n t 1 α n n t β n m t n t 1 gs n λ n n t 1 α n n t at equilibrium 58 and 59 become 60 gs m λ m m 1 α m m β m n m gs m λ m m 1 α m m 61 gs n λ n n 1 α n n β n m n gs n λ n n 1 α n n rearranging 60 and 61 let us denote the upper and lower bounds of m and n by the equations 62 l

61 corresponding to values of m n that result in coexistence see fig 3 in particular we see that the two populations at equilibrium will never be larger than what each can obtain in the absence of interaction with the other second since φ m φ n 0 by assumption 52 and 53 at equilibrium can be arranged to get 66 h m n g s m λ m 1 α m m 1 α m m β m 1 α m m 1 φ m g s m 1 λ m 67 h n m g s n λ n 1 α

1 φ n g s n 2 λ n 1 α n 3 results 3 1 persistence criteria when ω m ω n model 1 there are four possible outcomes for our model mutual extirpation species m survives species n survives or mutual survival these outcomes are summarized in fig 4 3 1 1 outcome i mutual extirpation survival of species m and n depends first and foremost on their respective abilities to keep pace with the speed of climate change when gs i λ i 1 the growth rate of species i will not be large enough to compensate for the population loss through dispersal and the speed of climate change and species i will go extinct mutual extirpation will occur when gs m λ m 1 and gs n λ n 1 or equivalently when p 0 and q 0 with p q as defined in eqs 36 and 37 in this sense p and q reflect persistence ability in a moving habitat 3 1 2 outcome ii m outcompetes n when p 0 and q 0 species n is unable keep pace with the speed of climate change and will die out this will simplify to a one dimensional shifting habitat ide model in which species m will experience beverton holt population growth in the absence of species n assuming both species can keep pace with climate change i e p 0 and q 0 species m will outcompete species n when either u v and v 1 with u v as defined in eqs 38 and 39 depending on initial population densities m may also outcompete n when u v and v 1 3 1 3 outcome iii n outcompetes m similarly when p 0 and q 0 species m will be unable to pace with the shifting habitat but species n will persist if both p 0 and q 0 species n will outcompete species m either when u v v 1 or when u v and v 1 if initial conditions are favorable for n 3 1 4 outcome iv mutual survival mutual survival occurs when both p 0 and q 0 and when u v 1 in this situation both species can keep pace with the speed of climate change and there is a stable equilibrium for both populations at the fixed point in eq 43 3 2 effects of climate change on competition the speed of climate change c has the capacity to change the longterm outcome of the system by shifting the equilibrium through a bifurcation holding all other parameters constant as the value of c changes the fixed point of the system may move through different stability regions of p q space this result reflects the compounding effects of climate change and competition even if a species is able to keep pace with a changing climate its capacity to compete with other species may be weakened which may lead to qualitatively different outcomes compared to competing with the same species in a static climate fig 4 illustrates this phenomenon using the same dispersal behavior as used in fig 1 and with k m 80 k n 100 β m β n 0 005 λ m 1 5 and λ n 2 5 when c 0 species n will outcompete species m due in part to its higher reproductive rate n has comparatively limited dispersal ability however and m is better equipped to keep pace with habitat changes as such when c 0 5 n loses its competitive advantage and mutual survival will occur when c 0 75 n can no longer keep pace and will go extinct but m will continue to survive at a lower mean population density when c 1 neither species will be able to persist expressing the criteria u v 1 for mutual survival in terms of p and q we expect the interactive effects of climate change and competition to induce a bifurcation when there is some value of c such that 70 q α m β m p or 71 p α n β n q 3 3 effects of refuge habitat when a species has habitat in which they do not experience competition model 2 this habitat may act as a stable island for a source population which can replenish losses incurred from competition in sufficiently nearby populations if φ m φ n 1 representing interaction between m and n across the entire domain as in model 1 66 and 67 reduces to 72 m gs n λ n 1 α n n β n 73 n gs m λ m 1 α m m β m which can be solved to get the coexistence fixed point p b of model 1 as expected as the amount of refuge for species m increases i e as φ m decreases the value of the asymptote a m in 68 increases which in turn increases the average population density at equilibrium of m a similar pattern of behavior can be seen in n fig 3 a shows us that in conditions that lead to m outcompeting n in model 1 u v v 1 it is possible for m and n to coexist if there is sufficient refuge habitat for n fig 3 b similarly shows that conditions that lead to n outcompeting m in model 1 can result in coexistence in model 2 fig 3 d shows that the conditions that led to unstable coexistence in model 1 1 v u may yield stable coexistence in model 2 the amount of refuge habitat is sufficient for species persistence when the population inside the refuge habitat can persist by itself this is equivalent to 74 1 φ m gs m 1 λ m 1 for species m and 75 1 φ n gs n 2 λ n 1 for species n 3 4 numerical validation to quantify the accuracy of the persistence criteria described in section 3 1 we ran numerical simulations of model 1 and compared the outcomes with those predicted by p q u and v with an unknown predicted outcome either m or n surviving when v 1 and u v we generated 10 000 sets of random parameter values with each parameter randomly drawn from a distribution that we judged to reflect biologically feasible values see table 1 we assumed gaussian dispersal for both species numerical ides were then run for 100 time steps using the randomly generated parameter values if the mean densities of the resulting populations were at least one tenth the carrying capacity of the species then the population was recorded as persisting and extirpated otherwise the value of the threshold will inevitably affect model performance but we believe ten percent is a conservative choice we also tested the effects of refuge habitat by running 10 000 simulations with the same sets of parameter values as model 1 but with an amount of overlap between the two habitats determined by random draw we then compared the differences in observed outcomes between models 1 and 2 all numerical simulation and analysis was conducted in r core team 2015 and our code is provided as supplementary material the persistence criteria described in section 3 1 correctly predicted the outcome of model 1 in 95 2 of the simulations approximately 38 of the models ended with mutual extinction 29 with m surviving over n 29 with n surviving over m and 5 with mutual survival of the 593 unknown m or n or incorrectly predicted outcomes 111 had outcomes that matched the predictions of one species outcompeting the other dependent on initial conditions another 391 may have been attributable to the effects of transient population dynamics with one or both species going extinct before the populations were able to reach the predicted equilibrium model 2 had 341 more instances of mutual survival than model 1 due to the availability of refuge habitat table 2 a compares the predicted outcomes with the observed outcomes and provides basic summary statistics 4 application to populations of competing trout we provide an illustration of model 2 with two hypothetical populations of competing trout species in a river that is warming due to climate change we attempted to use realistic parameter values where possible but we caution the reader against overinterpreting the results this example is intended to illustrate the dynamics of competitive invasion and the effects of climate change but should not be construed as a model for real populations real and levin 1991 bull trout salvelinus confluentus is a salmonid that thrives in clear cold mountain streams in the pacific northwest bull trout tolerate a relatively small range of water temperatures preferring mean summer temperatures below 13 c us fish and wildlife service et al 2008 isaak et al 2015 they are currently recognized as threatened under

gunckel et al 2002 the invasive brook trout s fontinalis is one such species intentionally introduced as a recreational fishing species in the late 1800s dunham et al 2002 with habitat requirements similar to those of bull trout but more tolerant of warm water thriving in temperatures up to 22 c dunham et al 2002 the undammed salmon river in central idaho provides ideal salmonid habitat stretching 684 km through sparsely populated mountainous terrain and spanning the thermal tolerances of both species we used the norwest stream temperature database downscaled to a 200 m resolution to obtain a mean august stream temperature profile for 2011 and a projected future profile based on global climate model ensemble averages that represent the a1b warming trajectory for 2080s 2070 2099 isaak et al 2011 we used carrying capacities of 5 1 fish 200 m and 15 fish 200 m for bull and brook trout respectively which reflect mean population densities observed via snorkeling surveys conducted by the idaho department of fish and game levin et al 2002 high et al 2008 growth rates of λ m 1 09 and λ n 1 1 were similarly estimated adams 1999 high et al 2008 we modeled dispersal with laplace kernels with mean dispersal distances of 1 km for bull trout and 200 m for brook trout hutchings and gerber 2002 representing populations with relatively high site fidelity a number of studies have found success at modeling fish dispersal with mixture kernels a linear combination of two kernels that collectively represent the sedentary and mobile dispersal processes commonly observed in stream networks skalski and gilliam 2000 rodríguez 2009 there is evidence of long distance dispersal ability in both bull and brook trout dunham et al 2002 us fish and wildlife service et al 2008 but we opted not to use mixture kernels here as this would have introduced several new parameters to the model with no population data to support their estimation competition coefficients are notoriously hard to quantify from observational field studies pfister 1995 gunckel et al 2002 noted that bull trout appear to demonstrate a competitive advantage over the invasive brook trout when interacting directly but nakano et al 1998 found no significant difference between the two thus we explored model outcomes for a variety of scenarios using 1681 ordered pairs of β m and β n with values ranging between 0 and 1 we initialized the population density m 0 x of bull trout at carrying capacity at any 200 m segment of the salmon river that was below its thermal limit of 13 c and the initial population density n 0 x of brook trout at carrying capacity downstream of the primary section of bull trout habitat to simulate potential upstream invasion see fig 5 a we then allowed the populations to grow disperse and interact according to the dynamics specified in 48 and 49 for 70 years with speed of climate change c 0 0377 c yr reflecting the predicted mean annual increase in temperature between 2011 2080 isaak et al 2011 this resulted in population densities m t x and n t x for each year t see fig 5b and c in all cases bull trout were heavily impacted by warming river temperature displaced upstream by more than 30 km in cases where β n was approximately less than 1 3 β m bull trout displayed a significant initial competitive advantage over brook trout and brook trout were prevented from populating the river where bull trout were present despite this advantage brook trout were able to maintain a population due to the downstream warmer water refuge that the bull trout could not occupy as the river warmed and bull trout were displaced to higher elevations the brook trout slowly replaced them at a pace determined by their dispersal ability when β n was approximately greater than 1 3 β m brook trout were able to outcompete bull trout and the bull trout were displaced from the river by the end of the burn in period our model suggests that bull trout will likely be extirpated from the salmon river by the beginning of the 22nd century if temperature increases continue on a similar trajectory as the 2080 projections 5 discussion the speed of climate change plays a critical role in the long term stability of the two species system beginning with conditions otherwise amenable to mutual persistence different speeds of climate change can either support persistence or result in either species outcompeting the other in all but the simplest cases an analytic formula for the critical speed at which a species is no longer able to persist does not exist zhou and kot 2011 rinnan 2018 demonstrated how to approximate characteristics of a single species model using the generalized average dispersal success and we demonstrated that this same method can likewise be used to gain insight into multiple species systems although our model explicitly accounts for growth dispersal and competition we emphasize that this model provides a very simple representation of population habitat and climate and does not account for many ecological processes and biological traits that may in fact help bull trout to persist among other things a more detailed understanding of life history adaptive capacity and habitat heterogeneity would undoubtedly be needed to predict extirpation with any confidence in this respect a number of caveats to our results are worth mentioning at the continental scale population distributions are largely determined by climate processes pearson and dawson 2003 at the scale of the individual however habitat selection can be strongly influenced by other processes such as spatial heterogeneity resource availability and environmental stochasticity our model delineates suitable habitat by thermal tolerances alone but this is no doubt overly simplistic from the perspective of an individual organism kareiva 1982 found that habitat heterogeneity led to different rates and patterns of dispersal in flea beetles and there is good reason to believe that the same behavior could be found in trout species due to their preferential selection of areas with vegetative cover or deep pools similarly our model assumes thoroughly homogeneous populations in reality demographic stochasticity will create different tolerances and reactions to changes in climate selong et al 2001 indeed adaptation can be a very effective response to climate change and adaptive processes such as evolutionary rescue and phenotypic plasticity likely play an equally important role as dispersal bell and gonzalez 2009 accounting for adaptation in this context is difficult in large part due to its unpredictability species interactions are complex and varied and are often not simply a matter of competitive exclusion the impacts of brook trout on bull trout populations for example are not just limited to resource pressures hybridization between the two species has negatively impacted bull trout as well moreover interactions are often not limited to just two competing species bull and brook trout are both sympatric with cutthroat trout oncorhynchus clarkii and there is considerable evidence that brook trout have caused significant declines in cutthroat trout populations nakano et al 1998 dunham et al 2002 the model can be generalized to accommodate hybridization or a greater number of species but this will likely become unwieldy for even the simplest of cases nor are interactions constant through time and space the consequences of climate change are sometimes described as an example of a collective risk social dilemma in which cooperation is vital for mutual survival chen et al 2012 in this context climate change may actually introduce incentive for cooperation thereby changing the nature of interaction between competing populations a more realistic model might describe competition as β m y and β n y with competition strength varying spatially as a function of habitat quality amount of climate change or other extrinsic factors finally climate change is represented in our model as a simple linear increase in temperature in reality there is considerable variation in climate patterns year to year and decade to decade in mountain streams the quality of habitat is influenced by drought snowpack and forest fires isaak et al 2010 some amount of temperature variability could be introduced to the model by drawing values of the speed of climate change c at each time step from a specified distribution although our analysis involved several approximations and simplifications our delineation of parameter space nonetheless provides relatively accurate predictions of the long term outcome of the underlying ide model it is important to recognize however that this approach only predicts model outcome and fails to capture many of the interesting spatial characteristics of the ide model there is undoubtedly a great deal more to study regarding the size and spatial distributions of the populations themselves as we glimpsed in our example of competing species of trout and such a study will require an approach that preserves these properties fortunately it is quite straightforward to simulate the ide competition model explicitly which provides useful reference and validation for any analysis our model demonstrates how simple growth dispersal and competition processes can give rise to a variety of outcomes commonly observed in the ecologies of competition and climate change the fundamental model structure described in section 2 2 1 and section 2 2 2 does not only apply to the case of competition but can be generalized to model different types of interactions such as mutualism or predator prey by the appropriate selection of growth functions f and g we believe our approach provides a useful framework for exploring complex ecological systems and processes and deserves further exploration acknowledgements the author would like to thank mark kot for providing helpful feedback
