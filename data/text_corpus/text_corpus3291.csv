16455,natural source zone depletion nszd of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls may be a valid long term management option at petroleum impacted sites however its future long term reliability needs to be established nszd includes partitioning biotic and abiotic degradation of lnapl components plus multiphase fluid dynamics in the subsurface over time lnapl components are depleted and those partitioning to various phases change as do those available for biodegradation to accommodate these processes and predict trends and nszd over decades to centuries for the first time we incorporated a multi phase multi component multi microbe non isothermal approach to representatively simulate nszd at field scale to validate the approach we successfully mimic data from the lnapl release at the bemidji site we simulate the entire depth of saturated and unsaturated zones over the 27 years of post release measurements the study progresses the idea of creating a generic digital twin of nszd processes and future trends outcomes show the feasibility and affordability of such detailed computational approaches to improve decision making for site management and restoration strategies the study provided a basis to progress a computational digital twin for complex subsurface systems keywords nszd multi phase multi component multi microbe non isothermal digital twin 1 introduction anthropogenic releases of petroleum hydrocarbons some accidental and some not can be harmful to the environment fixed and storage facilities and pipelines make up the bulk of these releases etkin 2009a 2001 2009b sookhak lari et al 2021 for example contributing over 34 000 m3 per year to land and groundwater resources in the united states of america alone etkin 2009a 2009b accidental oil spills are still a global challenge and it is estimated that 74 occurs at refineries oil terminals or storage tanks with a proportionality of 47 in north america 29 asia 16 europe 4 africa and 4 south america chang and lin 2006 chilvers et al 2021 fingas 2012 khan and abbasi 1999 releases of such light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl petroleum products expose the environment to thousands of chemicals some with significant health risk profiles upon release at ground surface lnapl plumes travel downwards through a vadose zone leaving residual lnapl mass in the soil profile as it moves towards groundwater spreading of the lnapl plume over the capillary fringe augments interphase mass transfer the residual lnapl mass as well as the main body of the plume can remain as a source of contamination of subsurface gaseous davis et al 2021 and aqueous phases lekmine et al 2017 for decades garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2016a sookhak lari et al 2019a sookhak lari et al 2016b sookhak lari et al 2020 active remediation approaches target lnapl recovery in different phases or thermal biological and chemical destruction of the target chemicals however the performance of restoration technologies is a complex function of the release event the lnapl itself the subsurface stratigraphy and the configuration of the applied remedial technology sookhak lari et al 2018a sookhak lari et al 2018b sookhak lari et al 2020 several studies have shown that even after remediation and recovery approaches reach an endpoint of limited additional lnapl mass removal still a significant portion of the lnapl can continue to reside in the form of residual or entrapped mass lenhard et al 2018 sookhak lari et al 2020 beyond and concurrent with active remedial efforts lnapl mass depletion occurs via partitioning and biodegradation of lnapl components and recently this has been referred to as natural source zone depletion nszd nszd of lnapl includes biodegradation and partitioning of lnapl compounds in different phases and has received significant attention over the last decade garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019a nszd starts immediately after the release and consists of a dynamic sequence of complex biological processes in some circumstances biodegradation processes may shift to be dominated by methanogenesis garg et al 2017 along with transport of volatile organic gases through the vadose zone methanogenesis and subsequence methane and carbon dioxide formation mainly adjacent to the lnapl plume known as direct outgassing can play a primary role in lnapl mass loss garg et al 2017 the rate of nszd through methanogenesis can be considerable in comparison to the rate of lnapl recovery close to the endpoint of active lnapl recovery from wells e g 0 65 to 2 6 l m2 year equal to 700 to 2800 gallons acre year garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2018b sookhak lari et al 2020 regulatory decisions on whether the residual lnapl mass may be left in the subsurface is a function of the risk profile of the remaining lnapl and the rate of nszd bekins et al 2005 the rate of nszd may vary over time and is a complex function of the lnapl composition and saturation and the presence of electron acceptors and nutrients freitas et al 2011a b molson et al 2002a b nszd rates may be estimated via a range of measurements and approaches e g crc care 2018 including for example surface flux of carbon dioxide temperature increases and consumed and produced major gases davis et al 2013 karimi askarani and sale 2020 knight and davis 2013 kulkarni et al 2020 rayner et al 2020 smith et al 2021 verginelli and baciocchi 2021 however predicting future transitions in nszd rates and lnapl risks along with links to other remedial actions requires representative modeling encompassing all of the key features of lnapl dynamics and associated nszd mass removal processes a critical review paper on the state of the art modeling approaches and studies on nszd has recently been published sookhak lari et al 2019a we present here for the first time a simulation platform to progress towards a digital twin of all the relevant nszd partitioning and biodegradation processes linked to lnapl multiphase processes occurring in the subsurface we evaluate its performance and reliability against published data and outcomes associated with the well characterised bemidji site where crude oil was released into the subsurface over 40 years ago baedecker et al 2018 essaid et al 2011 we apply a multi phase multi component multi microbe and non isothermal modeling framework for the bemidji site the north pool and characterise nszd processes over the entire depth of the formation saturated and unsaturated our primary aim is to assess the feasibility of using such a complex computational modeling framework to study real cases and establish confidence in long term nszd sustainability 2 nszd digital twin modeling platform and approach a comprehensive review of possible modeling approaches was undertaken by sookhak lari et al 2019a to date the most applied models include one dimensional gaseous phase transport in the vadose zone baedecker et al 1993 sihota et al 2011 and two dimensional models focusing either on the saturated or unsaturated zone amos and mayer 2006 mayer et al 2002 molins et al 2010 ng et al 2015 ng et al 2014 the first includes two phase reactive transport of aqueous and gaseous phases in the vadose zone and the second includes reactive solutes transport in the groundwater following a recent review paper on modeling nszd sookhak lari et al 2019a and a more recent literature review the authors are still not aware of a multi phase napl soil gas and water multi component napl components soil gases and solutes multi microbe aerobic anaerobic and methanogenesis and non isothermal modeling platform being established or applied for a real contaminated site digital twin refers to a comprehensive physical and functional description of a system which includes all the most useful information over the lifecycle phases it is an emerging representation of cyber physical systems and has attracted increasing attention very recently through this concept a digital representation of the system under study is developed the level of the complexity applied in the digital twin is a function of the computational infrastructure and collected data nevertheless this concept opens the way to real time monitoring and synchronization of real world phenomena with virtual counterparts boschert and rosen 2016 grieves and vickers 2017 liu et al 2021 vanderhorn and mahadevan 2021 the concept is most widely applied in manufacturing or controlled engineering systems but despite this it has become a subject of interest in other fields such as environmental engineering conejos fuertes et al 2020 its application to study nszd is not yet reported liu et al 2021 recently more than 30 codes were compared with respect to their capabilities in addressing and mimicking major nszd processes sookhak lari et al 2019a among them tmvocbio showed the greatest potential for developing digital twins for lnapl contaminated sites undergoing nszd the most recent parallel processing version of the code has been released with tough3 jung et al 2017 major features of tmvocbio now released as a part of tough3 group of codes include combining the multi phase multi component non isothermal modeling capabilities in tmvoc with a general modified form of the monod kinetic rate equation to simulate biodegradation reactions the code can account for various limiting factors such as limitation by substrate electron acceptor or nutrients the biodegradation may be simulated as a multiple monod kinetic rate equation or a minimum monod model biomass growth inhibition toxicity effects and competitive and non competitive inhibition effects are included as limiting factors the temperature and moisture dependence of biodegradation processes are also considered battistelli 2004 jung and battistelli 2017 3 the model and governing equations tmvocbio is a finite volume numerical simulator based on tough3 for multi phase multi component multi microbe transport phenomena at a darcy scale the substrate utilisation rate rs and biomass growth decay in the code are governed by barry et al 2002 battistelli 2004 1 r s μ max x i s k s s e k e e 2 dx dt y r s bx where x e and s are the biomass electron acceptor and substrate concentrations respectively m l3 ks and ke are the half saturations of

biomass yield coefficient and b t 1 is the first order decay coefficient blanc et al 1996 multi phase flow models can simulate the simultaneous transport of aqueous gaseous and lnapl phases the mass

saturation and head h p ρ g is 5 s j ij s m 1 s m 1 α ij h n m i j g aq n i j where s j ij represents the effective wetting phase fluid saturation n is a constant m 1 n 1 and s m is the irreducible saturation of the wetting phase the three phase fluid flow requires the relative permeability to be a function of phase saturation we apply the van genuchten muallem equation in the model for the

equilibrium conditions raoult s and henry s law jung et al 2017 lekmine et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2015 sookhak lari et al 2017 here the phase mole fraction vapour pressure and solubility of the compounds drive their concentration in other phases information for the lnapl compounds may be found in the supplementary materials infile pruess and battistelli 2002 values for the biodegradation variables are reported in table a1 also the reader is referred to the attached model files mainly infile and the code manual jung and battistelli 2017 for complementary details geophysical properties are discussed in section 4 1 the multicomponent properties of the lnapl are discussed in section 4 2 details of the microbial processes are presented in section 4 3 the modeling domain and features are discussed first 4 features of the bemidji site a crude oil lnapl accidental release occurred in august 1979 near bemidji minnesota usa it was estimated that 1 7 106 l was released and that remediation removed about 1 2 106 l later in 2000s an additional 1 4 105 l were also recovered essaid et al 2011 the remaining mass formed three separate lnapl oil bodies as residual mass in the vadose zone and as plumes close to the capillary fringe the north pool of the lnapl has been comprehensively studied baedecker et al 1993 bekins et al 2001 bekins et al 2005 cozzarelli et al 2001 several studies on the site include modeling efforts to characterise the magnitude of nszd at the north pool one dimensional modeling on the effect of oil biodegradation are numerous baedecker et al 1993 sihota et al 2011 two dimensional two phase studies of the vadose zone mostly used min3p and min3p dusty to simulate reactive gas transport in the unsaturated zone amos and mayer 2006 mayer et al 2002 molins et al 2010 comprehensive studies on reactive transport in the saturated zone are also available ng et al 2015 ng et al 2014 however no multi phase multi component modeling framework across the entire depth interval of the vadose zone and groundwater has been applied 4 1 site stratigraphy and soil characteristics the lithology of the site is reported in numerous documents dillard et al 1997 essaid et al 2003 a more recent publication also provides further details of the site measurements studies over a 25 year period essaid et al 2011 studies suggest that the average horizontal intrinsic permeability at the north pool is 10 12 m2 with the vertical permeability one order of magnitude lower as schematically depicted in fig 1 there is also a low permeability lens with a permeability of 10 13 m2 essaid et al 2003 molins et al 2010 ng et al 2015 it is suggested that the gas bubble formation at the vicinity of the lnapl plume diminishes the permeability amos and mayer 2006 essaid et al 2003 mayer et al 2002 this phenomenon has also been observed during active remediation krol et al 2011 in contrast with modeling packages like utchem tmvocbio does not directly consider the effect of discrete gas bubbles on reducing the permeability sookhak lari et al 2019a following preliminary simulations and accounting for these effects the permeabilities here were taken to be one order of magnitude lower than more permeable portions of the formation the reported porosity is also 0 38 essaid et al 2003 ranges for the soil characteristic curve van genuchten parameters have been variably reported for the site we use the values reported in molins et al 2010 α 3 0 m 1 and n 2 0 the average hydraulic gradient of the water table is reported to be 0 0035 m m with the water table elevation of 424 m above the sea level on the left boundary essaid et al 2003 thermal heat conductivity of the site from the water table to the surface ranges from 0 4 to 2 0 w m 1 c 1 jones et al 2014 warren and bekins 2015 we consider a heat conductivity of 0 8 w m 1 c 1 to give more weight to the lnapl zone where the heat is generated we consider a background uniform temperature of 9 c warren and bekins 2015 4 2 multi phase lnapl compositions it is estimated that 40 of the initial lnapl released resided in the unsaturated zone ng et al 2015 data on the spatial distribution of the lnapl saturation in the vadose zone and the saturated zone baedecker et al 1993 molins et al 2010 ng et al 2015 ng et al 2014 were averaged to reproduce the initial lnapl plume as depicted in fig 2 following the approach in ng et al 2014 the crude oil was assumed to be composed of bex benzene ethylbenzene and xylene represented by c6h6 toluene c7h8 precursors of non volatile dissolved organic compounds prenvdoc c19h24o6 short chain c11h25 and long chain alkanes c15h32 and residual napl with a molar weight of 341 g mole the reported molar fractions of these are 0 35 1 0 40 7 4 10 0 and 40 0 respectively major mineral electron acceptors are fe3 and mn4 salts in order to embed such minerals reduction reactions into tmvocbio which is not directly possible we assume these are quasi lnapl compounds with a saturation less than 0 1 across the entire formation with a bioavailable mass of 0 0288 and 0 001 mol per litre volume of the aquifer respectively ng et al 2015 we also consider four major gases nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide and methane to be present or to be evolving in the subsurface 4 3 biodegradation processes and microbial dynamics monod based biodegradation processes and growth and decay of counterpart microbial colonies including non competitive inhibitors are considered including aerobic degradation fe iii and mn iv reduction and methanogenesis overall 20 processes were included as part of the tmvocbio simulation platform i aerobic degradation fe and mn reduction and methanogenesis of bex toluene and short chain alkanes ii aerobic degradation and fe reduction of long chain alkanes iii aerobic degradation of methane iv methanogenesis of long chain alkanes and v aerobic degradation fe reduction and methanogenesis of nvdocs we also consider a constant rate of prenvdoc to nvdoc conversion ng et al 2015 the description stoichiometry and reaction constants are summarised in the appendix tables a1 and a2 essaid et al 1995 molins et al 2010 the non competitive inhibitors include oxygen for fe iii and mn iv reduction and methanogenesis mn iv for fe iii reduction and toluene and short and long chain alkanes for the conversion of prenvdoc to nvdoc essaid et al 1995 ng et al 2015 the heat generation rate for aerobic degradation of methane is reported to be 865 kj mol warren and bekins 2015 total number of grid cells is 15 600 the simulation time is 27 years 10 000 days consistent with the majority of the studies for the bemidji site the boundary conditions are of dirichlet type tmvocbio was activated on the csiro pearcey cluster which is a 20 core node machine we used 15 nodes and the total wall time was around 300 h all the input and output files mesh incon infile save gener are provided as supplementary material 5 results and discussion 5 1 description and intercomparison results are presented for microbial population distributions fig 3 soil gas concentration changes fig 4 temperature and lnapl saturations fig 5 and dissolved concentration changes fig 6 largely predictions are shown at the end of the simulation after 27 years where field data are available for comparison fig 3 shows depth section profiles of aerobic and methanogenic microbial colonies after 7 and 27 years of nszd the aerobic microbes mostly reside in the upper part of the vadose zone shaped like a dome covering the lnapl saturation distribution this reflects the abundance of oxygen at shallower depths but also reflects the zone where microbes oxidise methane gas that migrates to shallower depths of the soil profile the methanogenic microbial colony increased its biomass over time it s distribution largely coincides with the lnapl saturation zone where methane is produced it is also where the soil permeability to the gas phase and abundance of oxygen is lower the methanogens grow first in the vicinity of the groundwater table and expands upwards through the vadose zone as time proceeds evolution of the microbial colonies over time is visualised in video clip 1 in the supplementary materials fig 4 shows the depth section profiles of oxygen methane carbon dioxide and bex in the gaseous phase oxygen concentrations are depleted in the vicinity of the lnapl the maximum lateral extent of the oxygen depletion near the depth of the water table is about x 70 m beyond this distance atmospheric oxygen penetrates nearly to the depth of the water table methane concentrations in the gas phase largely envelope the lnapl saturation distribution in and above the capillary fringe this also coincides with the maximum methanogenic microbial colony biomass and where oxygen is less abundant the pattern and magnitude of the oxygen and methane gas concentrations are consistent with reported measurements in jones et al 2014 fig 2 and molins et al 2010 fig 3 also see table 1 this also aligns with the methane production zone at the site jones et al 2014 fig 3 evolution of these gas phase profiles over time is visualised in video clip 2 in the supplementary materials the video clip also includes the simulated evolution of bex carbon dioxide methane toluene and short chain alkanes in the gaseous phase over time together figs 3 and 4 depict the balance of methane production and degradation and oxygen depletion fig 5 shows depth sections of the temperature and lnapl saturation after 27 years but additionally for temperature over even deeper depths below the water table the maximum temperature is observed around the lnapl plume in the vadose zone extending from approximately 40 to 35 m this is the active biodegradation zone for methane production but also overlaps with the zone of methane oxidation the temperature profile in the aqueous phase is consistent with the reported values in the literature for the bemidji site e g fig 6 in warren and bekins 2015 also see table 1 the lnapl saturation sn plume near the water table expands slightly downgradient compared to the initial distribution in fig 2 due to groundwater flow but the change is marginal this is also where the lnapl saturation is higher and hence the relative permeability of the lnapl phase is greater video clip 1 in the supplementary materials visualises the evolution of the temperature and lnapl profile over the 27 year period fig 6 shows methane and oxygen concentration depth section distributions in the aqueous phase for methane the aqueous phase concentration is observed in the soil moisture of the vadose zone due to equilibrium with the gas phase and the groundwater in the saturated zone the vertical and horizontal extent of the methane and oxygen profile in the saturated zone is consistent with the measurements reports for bemidji fig si2 measurements by ng et al 2015 note that the horizontal groundwater flow at the lnapl zone deviates towards the depth due to the preferential flow direction in higher relative permeability direction also the growth of methanogen microbial colonies at depth causes methane formation the lateral and vertical extent of the oxygen depletion region in the aqueous phase is generally consistent with the measurements in the literature the measurements and modeling results in ng et al 2014 fig 5 and ng et al 2015 figs 2 si2 and si3 show that the aqueous oxygen depleted and aqueous methane plume in year 27 reach 418 m and 80 m in z and x directions respectively however the results here show slightly smaller plumes in the aqueous phase although the overall plume architecture is replicated this is potentially due to the assumption we made on the intrinsic permeability in x direction which may be improved in a calibration trial in the vadose zone the oxygen depletion zone in the gaseous and aqueous phases are consistent video clip 3 in the supplementary materials visualises the evolution of methane and oxygen concentrations in the aqueous phase over time the video clip also shows aqueous phase concentration transitions for bex and short chain alkanes fig 7 shows the temporal variation of modeling results non filled markers vs the final measurements filled markers jones et al 2014 ng et al 2014 of methane and carbon dioxide both in the gaseous phase in moles carbon per metre width the percentage of the remaining lnapl and the carbon loss in kilomoles carbon per metre width overall despite a lack of model calibration and parameter adjustment an acceptable consistency is observed between the field measurements and the modeling results this is additional to good comparisons indicated earlier for depth section gas aqueous and other field measurements 5 2 brief discussion as shown by the agreement of model estimates and site measurements the underlying processes governing nszd at the bemidji site seem to be reasonably well represented by the digital twin computational modeling platform of course some elements of the model are difficult to validate such as microbial community populations biomass for each individual community often consortia of microbes are involved in biodegradation processes not just a few groups bruckberger et al 2021 regardless as indicated in several figures e g figs 5 7 predicted model estimates for temperature and gaseous concentrations as well as integrated properties remaining oil and cumulative carbon dioxide efflux are in close correspondence to the site measurements for such a case it could be argued that the underlying assumptions about microbial communities and the rates at which they operate are reasonable albeit bulked approximations within the model structure the success of the modeling strategy in developing a digital twin for a complex lnapl impacted subsurface system relies on the representativeness of the conceptual model and the governing equations this needs to link to adequately comprehensive data and information for subsurface systems such as the one here phenomena are studied at a darcy scale this enjoins that the fundamental governing equations such as the navier stokes equation for the flow field are upscaled xiong et al 2016 yan et al 2017 consequently parameters become averaged or are lumped a good example is the pore scale architecture translated through empirical constitutive relationships to bulk coefficients such as tortuosity and permeability tartakovsky et al 2013 such scaling seems to have been well enough represented via processes and parameter values used in the model simulations some of the assumptions resulting in darcy scale modeling of multi phase systems have been extensively studied for instance it is believed that the equilibrium partitioning assumption holds lekmine et al 2017 however subsurface modeling at a darcy scale still has some limitations with respect to the constitutive relationships for instance it is not very clear how changes in the lnapl composition would change the hysteresis and capillary effects over the time sookhak lari et al 2016a this has not been included in the simulations here but may be important in certain circumstances such as where water tables or soil moisture might be dynamic furthermore biochemical processes like chemotaxis changes of the geophysical properties due to e g changes in the biofilms thickness and the food chain are not yet thoroughly quantified at a darcy scale bahar et al 2016 essaid et al 2015 tartakovsky et al 2013 wang et al 2016 these parameters are still mostly lumped into e g yield and decay coefficients of the microbial colonies even for a comprehensively studied site like bemidji some discrepancies may be observed in the ranges of the biochemical parameters essaid et al 2011 a possible reason is that these lumped parameters are non linearly interconnected and from a mathematical point of view it is possible to have ranges for the parameters while the overall modeling output remains reasonable however a universal approach across sites either requires a modeling concept with the least number of lumped parameters or comprehensive site characterization to determine such parameters regardless as indicated earlier the implication for the bemidji site is that the key acceptable processes napl air water mobility partitioning biodegradation in soil and groundwater when linked together in the digital twin platform with parameter values in reasonable ranges have reproduced field measured components such as napl components oxygen and evolved gases with required reliability through the approach discussed here and the supplementary information supplied it is possible to simulate and predict nszd processes over long periods for example over decades it is technically possible to investigate the trade off between active multi phase remediation approaches and nszd to enhance the lnapl mass recovery and minimise costs energy consumption and the broader carbon footprint of management at petroleum impacted sites the digital twin platform for this and any similar site enables optimizing management plans sookhak lari et al 2019b for instance it may be that selective targeting of lnapl components through active remediation yields higher overall nszd mass removal over time the fully developed digital twin would be a reliable efficient and non invasive affordable approach for better assessment of such management options 6 conclusion the long term reliability of nszd as a management option is yet to be fully established predictive capability is needed that links all fundamental fluid dynamic aspects of lnapl air water relative mobility together with all aspects of partitioning and biodegradation of lnapl components in water air and soil phases of subsurface systems this has been shown to be possible utilising tmvocbio in creating a simulation platform and progressing a digital twin of nszd processes this has required accommodating all fundamental processes from the ground surface through the vadose zone and into deeper groundwater a scope not undertaken previously advances in computational infrastructure plus the recently released parallel processing version of the tmvocbio has allowed feasible and affordable simulation to progress the idea of developing a digital twin for such complex subsurface processes the capability is also applicable to addressing greenhouse gas emissions through anthropogenic sources of soil contamination which has been accounted for as a considerable driver of global warming king and durham 2017 we evaluated and in part verified the multi phase multi component multi microbe and non isothermal modeling framework by simulating the well characterised oil contaminated bemidji site with little calibration the digital twin simulation platform matched bemidji field data for soil gas and aqueous phase concentrations temperature and overall lnapl and carbon dioxide mass estimates the approach is computationally affordable applicable and feasible for nszd it provides a platform to estimate the longevity and changes to nszd rates over decades to centuries and a platform that offers the potential to co simulate nszd and other remedial option scenarios concurrently the latter promises to assist decision making regarding residual risk from lnapl and in deciding when to cease active remedial activities compared to ongoing management of lnapl mass and risk using an nszd approach future work is still needed to develop a solid basis for real digital twins for complex systems such as the one studied here this is mainly needed in two fields 1 advancing the underlying physics and governing equation to include processes such as chemotaxis food chain bubble formation and mutations in the microbial colonies and 2 more comprehensive constitutive relationships for multiphase systems sookhak lari et al 2019a furthermore the core model applied here does not have the capabilities to include biochemical kinetic reactions such as those in toughreact xu et al 2004 due to its complex and multi disciplinary nature advancing the digital tools to study subsurface system requires significant motivation and resourcing here it is noted that about one third of global methane released is by methanogenesis from soils bossio et al 2020 a considerable portion of this is anthropogenic such as lnapl release incidents a study on global distributed oil contaminated lands may provide momentum to accelerate and motivate advances in capability the study presented contributes to this declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16455,natural source zone depletion nszd of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls may be a valid long term management option at petroleum impacted sites however its future long term reliability needs to be established nszd includes partitioning biotic and abiotic degradation of lnapl components plus multiphase fluid dynamics in the subsurface over time lnapl components are depleted and those partitioning to various phases change as do those available for biodegradation to accommodate these processes and predict trends and nszd over decades to centuries for the first time we incorporated a multi phase multi component multi microbe non isothermal approach to representatively simulate nszd at field scale to validate the approach we successfully mimic data from the lnapl release at the bemidji site we simulate the entire depth of saturated and unsaturated zones over the 27 years of post release measurements the study progresses the idea of creating a generic digital twin of nszd

anthropogenic releases of petroleum hydrocarbons some accidental and some not can be harmful to the environment fixed and storage facilities and pipelines make up the bulk of these releases etkin

america chang and lin 2006 chilvers et al 2021 fingas 2012 khan and abbasi 1999 releases of such light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl petroleum products expose the environment to thousands of chemicals some with significant health risk profiles upon release at ground surface lnapl plumes travel downwards through a vadose zone leaving residual lnapl mass in the soil profile as it moves towards groundwater spreading of the lnapl plume over the capillary fringe augments interphase mass transfer the residual lnapl mass as well as the main body of the plume can remain as a source of contamination of subsurface gaseous davis et al 2021 and aqueous phases lekmine et al 2017 for decades garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2016a sookhak lari et al 2019a sookhak lari et al 2016b sookhak lari et al 2020 active remediation approaches target lnapl recovery in different phases or thermal biological and chemical destruction of the target chemicals however the performance of restoration technologies is a complex function of the release event the lnapl itself the subsurface stratigraphy and the configuration of the applied remedial technology sookhak lari et al 2018a sookhak lari et al 2018b sookhak lari et al 2020 several studies have shown that even after remediation and recovery approaches reach an endpoint of limited additional lnapl mass removal still a significant portion of the lnapl can continue to reside in the form of residual or entrapped mass lenhard et al 2018 sookhak lari et al 2020 beyond and concurrent with active remedial efforts lnapl mass depletion occurs via partitioning and biodegradation of lnapl components and recently this has been referred to as natural source zone depletion nszd nszd of lnapl includes biodegradation and partitioning of lnapl compounds in different phases and has received significant attention over the last decade garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2019a nszd starts immediately after the release and consists of a dynamic sequence of complex biological processes in some circumstances biodegradation processes may shift to be dominated by methanogenesis garg et al 2017 along with transport of volatile organic gases through the vadose zone methanogenesis and subsequence methane and carbon dioxide formation mainly adjacent to the lnapl plume known as direct outgassing can play a primary role in lnapl mass loss garg et al 2017 the rate of nszd through methanogenesis can be considerable in comparison to the rate of lnapl recovery close to the endpoint of active lnapl recovery from wells e g 0 65 to 2 6 l m2 year equal to 700 to 2800 gallons acre year garg et al 2017 sookhak lari et al 2018b sookhak lari et al 2020 regulatory decisions on whether the residual lnapl mass may be left in the subsurface is a function of the risk profile of the remaining lnapl and the rate of nszd bekins et al 2005 the rate of nszd may vary over time and is a complex function of the lnapl composition and saturation and the presence of electron acceptors and nutrients freitas et al 2011a b molson et al 2002a b nszd rates may be estimated via a range of measurements and approaches e g crc care 2018 including for example surface flux of carbon dioxide temperature increases and consumed and produced major gases davis et al 2013 karimi askarani and sale 2020 knight and davis 2013 kulkarni et al 2020 rayner et al 2020 smith et al 2021 verginelli and baciocchi 2021 however predicting future transitions in nszd rates and lnapl risks along with links to other remedial actions requires representative modeling encompassing all of the key features of lnapl dynamics and associated nszd mass removal processes a critical review paper on the state of the art modeling approaches and studies on nszd has recently been published sookhak lari et al 2019a we present here for the first time a simulation platform to progress towards a digital twin of all the relevant nszd partitioning and biodegradation processes linked to lnapl multiphase processes occurring in the subsurface we evaluate its performance and reliability against published data and outcomes associated with the well characterised bemidji site where crude oil was released into the subsurface over 40 years ago baedecker et al 2018 essaid et al 2011 we apply a multi phase multi component multi microbe and non isothermal modeling framework for the bemidji site the north pool and characterise nszd processes over the entire depth of the formation saturated and unsaturated our primary aim is to assess the feasibility of using such a complex computational modeling framework to study real cases and establish confidence in long term nszd sustainability 2 nszd digital twin modeling platform and approach a comprehensive review of possible modeling approaches was undertaken by sookhak lari et al 2019a to date the most applied models include one dimensional gaseous phase transport in the vadose zone baedecker et al 1993 sihota et al 2011 and two dimensional models focusing either on the saturated or unsaturated zone amos and mayer 2006 mayer et al 2002 molins et al 2010 ng et al 2015 ng et al 2014 the first includes two phase reactive transport of aqueous and gaseous phases in the vadose zone and the second includes reactive solutes transport in the groundwater following a recent review paper on modeling nszd sookhak lari et al 2019a and a more recent literature review the authors are still not aware of a multi phase napl soil gas and water multi component napl components soil gases and solutes multi microbe aerobic anaerobic and methanogenesis and non isothermal modeling platform being established or applied for a real contaminated site digital twin refers to a comprehensive physical and functional description of a system which includes all the most useful information over the lifecycle phases it is an emerging representation of cyber physical systems and has attracted increasing attention very recently through this concept a digital representation of the system under study is developed the level of the complexity applied in the digital twin is a function of the computational infrastructure and collected data nevertheless this concept opens the way to real time monitoring and synchronization of real world phenomena with virtual counterparts boschert and rosen 2016 grieves and vickers 2017 liu et al 2021 vanderhorn and mahadevan 2021 the concept is most widely applied in manufacturing or controlled engineering systems but despite this it has become a subject of interest in other fields such as environmental engineering conejos fuertes et al 2020 its application to study nszd is not yet reported liu et al 2021 recently more than 30 codes were compared with respect to their capabilities in addressing and mimicking major nszd processes sookhak lari et al 2019a among them tmvocbio showed the greatest potential for developing digital twins for lnapl contaminated sites undergoing nszd the most recent parallel processing version of the code has been released with tough3 jung et al 2017 major features of tmvocbio now released as a part of tough3 group of codes include combining the multi phase multi component non isothermal modeling capabilities in tmvoc with a general modified form of the monod kinetic rate equation to simulate biodegradation reactions the code can account for various limiting factors such as limitation by substrate electron acceptor or nutrients the biodegradation may be simulated as a multiple monod kinetic rate equation or a minimum monod model biomass growth inhibition toxicity effects and competitive and non competitive inhibition effects are included as limiting factors the temperature and moisture dependence of biodegradation processes are also considered battistelli 2004 jung and battistelli 2017 3 the model and governing equations tmvocbio is a finite volume numerical simulator based on tough3 for multi phase multi component multi microbe transport phenomena at a darcy scale the substrate utilisation rate rs and biomass growth decay in the code are governed by barry et al 2002

saturation of the wetting phase the three phase fluid flow requires the relative permeability to be a function of phase saturation we apply the van genuchten muallem equation in the model for the

compounds drive their concentration in other phases information for the lnapl compounds may be found in the supplementary materials infile pruess and battistelli 2002 values for the biodegradation variables are reported in table a1 also the reader is referred to the attached model files mainly infile and the code manual jung and battistelli 2017 for complementary details geophysical properties are discussed in section 4 1 the multicomponent properties of the lnapl are discussed in section 4 2 details of the microbial processes are presented in section 4 3 the modeling domain and features are discussed first 4 features of the bemidji site a crude oil lnapl accidental release occurred in august 1979 near bemidji minnesota usa it was estimated that 1 7 106 l was released and that remediation removed about 1 2 106 l later in 2000s an additional 1 4 105 l were also recovered essaid et al 2011 the remaining mass formed three separate lnapl oil bodies as residual mass in the vadose zone and as plumes close to the capillary fringe the north pool of the lnapl has been comprehensively studied baedecker et al 1993 bekins et al 2001 bekins et al 2005 cozzarelli et al 2001 several studies on the site include modeling efforts to characterise the magnitude of nszd at the north pool one dimensional modeling on the effect of oil biodegradation are numerous baedecker et al 1993 sihota et al 2011 two dimensional two phase studies of the vadose zone mostly used min3p and min3p dusty to simulate reactive gas transport in the unsaturated zone amos and mayer 2006 mayer et al 2002 molins et al 2010 comprehensive studies on reactive transport in the saturated zone are also available ng et al 2015 ng et al 2014 however no multi phase multi component modeling framework across the entire depth interval of the vadose zone and groundwater has been applied 4 1 site stratigraphy and soil characteristics the lithology of the site is reported in numerous documents dillard et al 1997 essaid et al 2003 a more recent publication also provides further details of the site measurements studies over a 25 year period essaid et al 2011 studies suggest that the average horizontal intrinsic permeability at the north pool is 10 12 m2 with the vertical permeability one order of magnitude lower as schematically depicted in fig 1 there is also a low permeability lens with a permeability of 10 13 m2 essaid et al 2003 molins et al 2010 ng et al 2015 it is suggested that the gas bubble formation at the vicinity of the lnapl plume diminishes the permeability amos and mayer 2006 essaid et al 2003 mayer et al 2002 this phenomenon has also been observed during active remediation krol et al 2011 in contrast with modeling packages like utchem tmvocbio does not directly consider the effect of discrete gas bubbles on reducing the permeability sookhak lari et al 2019a following preliminary simulations and accounting for these effects the permeabilities here were taken to be one order of magnitude lower than more permeable portions of the formation the reported porosity is also 0 38 essaid et al 2003 ranges for the soil characteristic curve van genuchten parameters have been variably reported for the site we use the values reported in molins et al 2010 α 3 0 m 1 and n 2 0 the average hydraulic gradient of the water table is reported to be 0 0035 m m with the water table elevation of 424 m above the sea level on the left boundary essaid et al 2003 thermal heat conductivity of the site from the water table to the surface ranges from 0 4 to 2 0 w m 1 c 1 jones et al 2014 warren and bekins 2015 we consider a heat conductivity of 0 8 w m 1 c 1 to give more weight to the lnapl zone where the heat is generated we consider a background uniform temperature of 9 c warren and bekins 2015 4 2 multi phase lnapl compositions it is estimated that 40 of the initial lnapl released resided in the unsaturated zone ng et al 2015 data on the spatial distribution of the lnapl saturation in the vadose zone and the saturated zone baedecker et al 1993 molins et al 2010 ng et al 2015 ng et al 2014 were averaged to reproduce the initial lnapl plume as depicted in fig 2 following the approach in ng et al 2014 the crude oil was assumed to be composed of bex benzene ethylbenzene and xylene represented by c6h6 toluene c7h8 precursors of non volatile dissolved organic compounds prenvdoc c19h24o6 short chain c11h25 and long chain alkanes c15h32 and residual napl with a molar weight of 341 g mole the reported molar fractions of these are 0 35 1 0 40 7 4 10 0 and 40 0 respectively major mineral electron acceptors are fe3 and mn4 salts in order to embed such minerals reduction reactions into tmvocbio which is not directly possible we assume these are quasi lnapl compounds with a saturation less than 0 1 across the entire formation with a bioavailable mass of 0 0288 and 0 001 mol per litre volume of the aquifer respectively ng et al 2015 we also consider four major gases nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide and methane to be present or to be evolving in the subsurface 4 3 biodegradation processes and microbial dynamics monod based biodegradation processes and growth and decay of counterpart microbial colonies including non competitive inhibitors are considered including aerobic degradation fe iii and mn iv reduction and methanogenesis overall 20 processes were included as part of the tmvocbio simulation platform i aerobic degradation fe and mn reduction and methanogenesis of bex toluene and short chain alkanes ii aerobic degradation and fe reduction of long chain alkanes iii aerobic degradation of methane iv methanogenesis of long chain alkanes and v aerobic degradation fe reduction and methanogenesis of nvdocs we also consider a constant rate of prenvdoc to nvdoc conversion ng et al 2015 the description stoichiometry and reaction constants are summarised in the appendix tables a1 and a2 essaid et al 1995 molins et al 2010 the non competitive inhibitors include oxygen for fe iii and mn iv reduction and methanogenesis mn iv for fe iii reduction and toluene and short and long chain alkanes for the conversion of prenvdoc to nvdoc essaid et al 1995 ng et al 2015 the heat generation rate for aerobic degradation of methane is reported to be 865 kj mol warren and bekins 2015 total number of grid cells is 15 600 the simulation time is 27 years 10 000 days consistent with the majority of the studies for the bemidji site the boundary conditions are of dirichlet type tmvocbio was activated on the csiro pearcey cluster which is a 20 core node machine we used 15 nodes and the total wall time was around 300 h all the input and output files mesh incon infile save gener are provided as supplementary material 5 results and discussion 5 1 description and intercomparison results are presented for microbial population distributions fig 3 soil gas concentration changes fig 4 temperature and lnapl saturations fig 5 and dissolved concentration changes fig 6 largely predictions are shown at the end of the simulation after 27 years where field data are available for comparison fig 3 shows depth section profiles of aerobic and methanogenic microbial colonies after 7 and 27 years of nszd the aerobic microbes mostly reside in the upper part of the vadose zone shaped like a dome covering the lnapl saturation distribution this reflects the abundance of oxygen at shallower depths but also reflects the zone where microbes oxidise methane gas that migrates to shallower depths of the soil profile the methanogenic microbial colony increased its biomass over time it s distribution largely coincides with the lnapl saturation zone where methane is produced it is also where the soil permeability to the gas phase and abundance of oxygen is lower the methanogens grow first in the vicinity of the groundwater table and expands upwards through the vadose zone as time proceeds evolution of the microbial colonies over time is visualised in video clip 1 in the supplementary materials fig 4 shows the depth section profiles of oxygen methane carbon dioxide and bex in the gaseous phase oxygen concentrations are depleted in the vicinity of the lnapl the maximum lateral extent of the oxygen depletion near the depth of the water table is about x 70 m beyond this distance atmospheric oxygen penetrates nearly to the depth of the water table methane concentrations in the gas phase largely envelope the lnapl saturation distribution in and above the capillary fringe this also coincides with the maximum methanogenic microbial colony biomass and where oxygen is less abundant the pattern and magnitude of the oxygen and methane gas concentrations are consistent with reported measurements in jones et al 2014 fig 2 and molins et al 2010 fig 3 also see table 1 this also aligns with the methane production zone at the site jones et al 2014 fig 3 evolution of these gas phase profiles over time is visualised in video clip 2 in the supplementary materials the video clip also includes the simulated evolution of bex carbon dioxide methane toluene and short chain alkanes in the gaseous phase over time together figs 3 and 4 depict the balance of methane production and degradation and oxygen depletion fig 5 shows depth sections of the temperature and lnapl saturation after 27 years but additionally for temperature over even deeper depths below the water table the maximum temperature is observed around the lnapl plume in the vadose zone extending from approximately 40 to 35 m this is the active biodegradation zone for methane production but also overlaps with the zone of methane oxidation the temperature profile in the aqueous phase is consistent with the reported values in the literature for the bemidji site e g fig 6 in warren and bekins 2015 also see table 1 the lnapl saturation sn plume near the water table expands slightly downgradient compared to the initial distribution in fig 2 due to groundwater flow but the change is marginal this is also where the lnapl saturation is higher and hence the relative permeability of the lnapl phase is greater video clip 1 in the supplementary materials visualises the evolution of the temperature and lnapl profile over the 27 year period fig 6 shows methane and oxygen concentration depth section distributions in the aqueous phase for methane the aqueous phase concentration is observed in the soil moisture of the vadose zone due to equilibrium with the gas phase and the groundwater in the saturated zone the vertical and horizontal extent of the methane and oxygen profile in the saturated zone is consistent with the measurements reports for bemidji fig si2 measurements by ng et al 2015 note that the horizontal groundwater flow at the lnapl zone deviates towards the depth due to the preferential flow direction in higher relative permeability direction also the growth of methanogen microbial colonies at depth causes methane formation the lateral and vertical extent of the oxygen depletion region in the aqueous phase is generally consistent with the measurements in the literature the measurements and modeling results in ng et al 2014 fig 5 and ng et al 2015 figs 2 si2 and si3 show that the aqueous oxygen depleted and aqueous methane plume in year 27 reach 418 m and 80 m in z and x directions respectively however the results here show slightly smaller plumes in the aqueous phase although the overall plume architecture is replicated this is potentially due to the assumption we made on the intrinsic permeability in x direction which may be improved in a calibration trial in the vadose zone the oxygen depletion zone in the gaseous and aqueous phases are consistent video clip 3 in the supplementary materials visualises the evolution of methane and oxygen concentrations in the aqueous phase over time the video clip also shows aqueous phase concentration transitions for bex and short chain alkanes fig 7 shows the temporal variation of modeling results non filled markers vs the final measurements filled markers jones et al 2014 ng et al 2014 of methane and carbon dioxide both in the gaseous phase in moles carbon per metre width the percentage of the remaining lnapl and the carbon loss in kilomoles carbon per metre width overall despite a lack of model calibration and parameter adjustment an acceptable consistency is observed between the field measurements and the modeling results this is additional to good comparisons indicated earlier for depth section gas aqueous and other field measurements 5 2 brief discussion as shown by the agreement of model estimates and site measurements the underlying processes governing nszd at the bemidji site seem to be reasonably well represented by the digital twin computational modeling platform of course some elements of the model are difficult to validate such as microbial community populations biomass for each individual community often consortia of microbes are involved in biodegradation processes not just a few groups bruckberger et al 2021 regardless as indicated in several figures e g figs 5 7 predicted model estimates for temperature and gaseous concentrations as well as integrated properties remaining oil and cumulative carbon dioxide efflux are in close correspondence to the site measurements for such a case it could be argued that the underlying assumptions about microbial communities and the rates at which they operate are reasonable albeit bulked approximations within the model structure the success of the modeling strategy in developing a digital twin for a complex lnapl impacted subsurface system relies on the representativeness of the conceptual model and the governing equations this needs to link to adequately comprehensive data and information for subsurface systems such as the one here phenomena are studied at a darcy scale this enjoins that the fundamental governing equations such as the navier stokes equation for the flow field are upscaled xiong et al 2016 yan et al 2017 consequently parameters become averaged or are lumped a good example is the pore scale architecture translated through empirical constitutive relationships to bulk coefficients such as tortuosity and permeability tartakovsky et al 2013 such scaling seems to have been well enough represented via processes and parameter values used in the model simulations some of the assumptions resulting in darcy scale modeling of multi phase systems have been extensively studied for instance it is believed that the equilibrium partitioning assumption holds lekmine et al 2017 however subsurface modeling at a darcy scale still has some limitations with respect to the constitutive relationships for instance it is not very clear how changes in the lnapl composition would change the hysteresis and capillary effects over the time sookhak lari et al 2016a this has not been included in the simulations here but may be important in certain circumstances such as where water tables or soil moisture might be dynamic furthermore biochemical processes like chemotaxis changes of the geophysical properties due to e g changes in the biofilms thickness and the food chain are not yet thoroughly quantified at a darcy scale bahar et al 2016 essaid et al 2015 tartakovsky et al 2013 wang et al 2016 these parameters are still mostly lumped into e g yield and decay coefficients of the microbial colonies even for a comprehensively studied site like bemidji some discrepancies may be observed in the ranges of the biochemical parameters essaid et al 2011 a possible reason is that these lumped parameters are non linearly interconnected and from a mathematical point of view it is possible to have ranges for the parameters while the overall modeling output remains reasonable however a universal approach across sites either requires a modeling concept with the least number of lumped parameters or comprehensive site characterization to determine such parameters regardless as indicated earlier the implication for the bemidji site is that the key acceptable processes napl air water mobility partitioning biodegradation in soil and groundwater when linked together in the digital twin platform with parameter values in reasonable ranges have reproduced field measured components such as napl components oxygen and evolved gases with required reliability through the approach discussed here and the supplementary information supplied it is possible to simulate and predict nszd processes over long periods for example over decades it is technically possible to investigate the trade off between active multi phase remediation approaches and nszd to enhance the lnapl mass recovery and minimise costs energy consumption and the broader carbon footprint of management at petroleum impacted sites the digital twin platform for this and any similar site enables optimizing management plans sookhak lari et al 2019b for instance it may be that selective targeting of lnapl components through active remediation yields higher overall nszd mass removal over time the fully developed digital twin would be a reliable efficient and non invasive affordable approach for better assessment of such management options 6 conclusion the long term reliability of nszd as a management option is yet to be fully established predictive capability is needed that links all fundamental fluid dynamic aspects of lnapl air water relative mobility together with all aspects of partitioning and biodegradation of lnapl components in water air and soil phases of subsurface systems this has been shown to be possible utilising tmvocbio in creating a simulation platform and progressing a digital twin of nszd processes this has required accommodating all fundamental processes from the ground surface through the vadose zone and into deeper groundwater a scope not undertaken previously advances in computational infrastructure plus the recently released parallel processing version of the tmvocbio has allowed feasible and affordable simulation to progress the idea of developing a digital twin for such complex subsurface processes the capability is also applicable to addressing greenhouse gas emissions through anthropogenic sources of soil contamination which has been accounted for as a considerable driver of global warming king and durham 2017 we evaluated and in part verified the multi phase multi component multi microbe and non isothermal modeling framework by simulating the well characterised oil contaminated bemidji site with little calibration the digital twin simulation platform matched bemidji field data for soil gas and aqueous phase concentrations temperature and overall lnapl and carbon dioxide mass estimates the approach is computationally affordable applicable and feasible for nszd it provides a platform to estimate the longevity and changes to nszd rates over decades to centuries and a platform that offers the potential to co simulate nszd and other remedial option scenarios concurrently the latter promises to assist decision making regarding residual risk from lnapl and in deciding when to cease active remedial activities compared to ongoing management of lnapl mass and risk using an nszd approach future work is still needed to develop a solid basis for real digital twins for complex systems such as the one studied here this is mainly needed in two fields 1 advancing the underlying physics and governing equation to include processes such as chemotaxis food chain bubble formation and mutations in the microbial colonies and 2 more comprehensive constitutive relationships for multiphase systems sookhak lari et al 2019a furthermore the core model applied here does not have the capabilities to include biochemical kinetic reactions such as those in toughreact xu et al 2004 due to its complex and multi disciplinary nature advancing the digital tools to study subsurface system requires significant motivation and resourcing here it is noted that about one third of global methane released is by methanogenesis from soils bossio et al 2020 a considerable portion of this is anthropogenic such as lnapl release incidents a study on global distributed oil contaminated lands may provide momentum to accelerate and motivate advances in capability the study presented contributes to this declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16456,the present study provides an overall view of the effect of the ultrasound treatment on waste activated sludge was rheological and dewatering properties as well as its impact on the economic balance of a theoretical wastewater treatment plant the results showed that ultrasonication at 27 000 kj kg ts increased the soluble protein concentration 100 bound water content 25 and capillary suction time 100 of was the molecular weight distribution of the extracellular polymeric substances eps revealed that the ultrasound treatment solubilised a portion of the peptides and low molecular weight proteins the thixotropic behaviour of the was was analysed by means of a rheological structural model that defines the time evolution of a structural parameter as a function of kinetic coefficients for the breakdown and build up processes the ultrasound treatment reduced the kinetic coefficients for the breakdown process and changed the fast speed of alignment of flocs because of the reduction of was structures similarly the creep tests revealed that the ultrasound treatment at 27 000 kj kg ts reduced the initial elasticity 80 and the zero shear rate viscosity 60 which means that the internal structure of the was loosened and disrupted finally a techno economic analysis showed that ultrasonication was not yet economically favourable since its implementation increased 14 the net cost for was treatment and disposal however a sensitivity analysis illustrated that increasing electricity revenue and reducing biosolids disposal costs through improvement in was

less organic contaminants and higher nutrients concentration than primary sludge radjenović et al 2009 weemaes and verstraete 1998 however was is difficult to dewater compared with primary sludge due to the existence of colloidal materials and extracellular polymeric substances epss houghton and stephenson 2002 the sludge floc matrix is represented by a dynamic double layered eps structure li and yang 2007 with tightly bound epss tb epss located in the inner layer and loosely bound epss lb epss located in the outer layer sheng et al 2010 accordingly lb epss may function as the primary surface for cell attachment and flocculation li and yang 2007 additionally was is primarily formed by microorganisms and therefore more difficult to digest under anaerobic conditions due to the presence of glycan strands in microbial cell walls appels et al 2008 several pre treatments have been proposed in the literature to improve the digestibility and dewaterability of was such as ultrasound lippert et al 2021 thermal ruiz hernando et al 2015b alkaline he et al 2021 and freezing combined with nitrite addition liu et al 2020 ultrasound which can partially disintegrate the was by disrupting flocs and solubilising the epss is one of the most researched techniques for was pre treatment bandelin et al 2020 feng et al 2009 the ultrasound disintegration mechanism is based on the cavitation phenomenon which is the formation growth and violent collapse of cavitation bubbles caused by alternate compression and rarefaction cycles of ultrasound waves travelling through the was gallipoli and braguglia 2012 this violent collapse generates powerful hydro mechanical shear forces in the bulk liquid surrounding the bubbles the ultrasound range is divided in three regions depending on the frequency i power ultrasound 20 100 khz ii high frequency ultrasound 100 khz 1 mhz and iii diagnostic ultrasound 1 500 mhz pilli et al 2011 according to carrère et al 2010 low frequencies 20 40 khz are the most efficient in sludge treatment rheology is a useful tool for the characterisation of sludge suspensions two major types of rheological measurements can be distinguished i those perform within the linear viscoelastic region and ii those perform within the non linear viscoelastic region ruiz hernando et al 2014b when performing rheological measurements within the linear viscoelastic region the analysed material flows with its original structure unchanged due to the low shear stresses applied the linear viscoelastic properties can be measured using the creep test in which a constant stress in the linear viscoelastic region is applied and the time related strain is measured farno et al 2020 conversely when rheological measurements are performed within the non linear viscoelastic region the material flows with the application of moderate or high shear stress under these conditions elasticity is notably reduced and viscosity governs the rheological behaviour of was being dependent on the applied shear rate labanda and llorens 2006 under steady state laminar flow was generally behaves as a non newtonian pseudoplastic fluid ratkovich et al 2013 according to the literature the ostwald de waele model is the most commonly used equation to represent the non newtonian behaviour of sludge because of its simplicity and good fitting seyssiecq et al 2008 was also exhibits thixotropic behavior eshtiaghi et al 2013 farno et al 2020 which means that the internal sludge structure is formed by a complex network based on the union of flocs and macroflocs that break down or build up slowly to adapt their structure to the applied shear a common method to evaluate thixotropy is the hysteresis loop test which consists of measuring the area enclosed between the up and down curve of shear stress vs shear rate over time the called hysteresis area when shear rate is linearly increased and decreased over time baudez 2006 tixier et al 2003 however the hysteresis area is a relative measurement of the thixotropy because it depends on the design parameters of the test and it is not a good parameter to compare the thixotropy of different samples with different viscosities baudez 2006 instead thixotropy can be determined more accurately by means of a rheological structural model that defines the time evolution of a structural parameter which is a numerical scalar measurement of the internal structure level as a function of the kinetic coefficients for the breakdown and build up processes moore 1959 accordingly the major asset of this type of models is that the thixotropic behaviour is determined based on the magnitude of both kinetic coefficients instead of a relative measurement the hysteresis area limited information is available in the literature concerning rheological models to predict the thixotropic behaviour of was after applying a disintegration treatment ruiz hernando et al 2015b successfully implemented a rheological structural model to examine the variations of the thixotropic behaviour of was after thermal treatment however to the best of the authors knowledge this model has not yet been used to predict the thixotropy behaviour of was after ultrasound treatment this is an important implication since the mechanism behind the disintegration of was flocs substantially differs between applying ultrasound or thermal treatment bougrier et al 2006 these differences between ultrasound and thermal treatment can lead to high variations concerning the epss solubilisation mechanism with a direct impact on the rheological properties of the treated was accordingly validating the rheological structural model for ultrasound treatment is crucial to understand its suitability to predict the variation of the thixotropic properties of ultrasonicated was the aim of the present study is to analyse the effect of the ultrasound treatment on the internal structure of the was and its underlying impact on epss solubilisation and dewatering properties the rheological properties of the was have been analysed through the implementation of a rheological structural model and conducting creep tests finally a techno economic study has been conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility of ultrasound implementation for was pre treatment before anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge samples the thickened was samples used in this study were collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the barcelona metropolitan area spain with a treatment capacity of 1 700 000 population equivalent the sludge samples were stored at 4 c until their utilisation detailed information of the main characteristics of the thickened was is provided in table s1 of the supplementary information 2 2 ultrasound treatment conditions the ultrasonic apparatus used was an hd2070 sonopuls ultrasonic homogenizer equipped with a ms 73 titanium microtip probe bandelin berlin germany 20 khz the ultrasonication power was fixed at 70 w and the exposure times were changed to provide a wide range of specific energies from 3000 to 33 000 kj kg ts which were calculated following eq 1 1 e s p t a v t s where es is the specific energy applied kj kg ts p is the ultrasonic power of the ultrasonic homogeniser kw ta is the application time s v is the sample volume l and ts is the concentration of total solids kg l ultrasonication increases was temperature due to the thermal effect caused by the cavitation phenomenon pilli et al 2011 since the present study intended to solely analyse the effect of ultrasound treatment it was necessary to nullify this thermal effect dewil et al 2006 accordingly the beaker containing the samples was submerged in an ice bath to guarantee that the sludge temperature did not exceed 20 c chu et al 2001 dewil et al 2006 2 3 rheological characterisation the rheometer used was a haake rs300 control stress rheometer equipped with a temperature control system thermostatic bath and connected to a computer that allows programming the rheological assays and recording the data in real time haake rheowin software 2 3 1 hysteresis loop test shear rate step test and rheological structural model theory the rheological behaviour under flow conditions was analysed by the hysteresis loop and shear rate step tests the sensor geometry used for both assays was a 4 cone and a flat stationary plate of 35 mm diameter the average gap of the cone plate geometry is 888 µm and the maximum centripetal acceleration at a shear rate of 300 s 1 maximum shear rate applied is 0 78 x g under such settings the particles trapped in the gap and the movement of particles towards the edges is minimal measurements were conducted at 22 0 1 c and at a constant ts content 56 2 0 4 g kg the hysteresis loop test was performed at two maximum shear rates 125 and 300 s 1 following the procedure described by ruiz hernando et al 2014b the shear rate step test consisted of pre shearing the sludge at a fixed shear rate of 5 s 1 for 15 min and suddenly changing the shear rate to 30 125 or 300 s 1 for 10 min to achieve steady states the step tests were conducted in triplicate the variations in the thixotropic behaviour of was before and after the ultrasound treatment was analysed by means of a rheological structural model the theory of the model has been extensively discussed in a previous study ruiz hernando et al 2015b and a summary of the equations used is provided in table 1 the model is based on the definition of the structural parameter s which quantifies the structural level of the internal structure at any time and shear rate thereby the value of s goes to zero when the internal structure is completely broken down resulting in the lowest viscosity while a complete build up structure corresponds to the highest value of s resulting in the highest viscosity the breakdown and build up of the internal network with shear time is demonstrated with a constitutive equation eq t1 and two kinetic equations eqs t2 1 and t2 2 which consider the time dependence of the viscosity at constant shear rate conditions on the other hand was commonly behaves as non newtonian pseudoplastic fluid under steady state conditions accordingly the steady state viscosity ηe was fitted to the ostwald de waele model eq t3 2 2 3 2 creep test the rheological behaviour within the linear viscoelastic region was analysed by the creep test following a similar procedure conducted in a previous study ruiz hernando et al 2014b before starting the creep test the sludge samples were kept at rest for 10 min to relax their structures the limiting stress in the linear viscoelastic region was determined by conducting a shear sweep test from 0 to 200 pa at a frequency of 1 hz the stresses that did not exceed 10 pa assured that no changes were produced in the was internal structure however following a conservative criterion the creep tests were conducted at 5 pa the compliance strain divided by shear stress j t eq 2 was monitored for 15 min 2 j t γ t τ a where γ t is the time related strain and τa is the applied shear stress pa the obtained compliance data were fitted to a burgers model kelvin voigt cell in series with a maxwell component using eq 3 3 j t j 0 j m 1 e x p t λ t η 0 where j0 is the instantaneous elastic compliance of the maxwell spring pa 1 jm is the viscoelastic compliance pa 1 associated to the mean relaxation time s of the kelvin voigt element and η0 is the zero shear rate viscosity of the maxwell dashpot pa s a serrated plate plate sensor geometry 35 mm in diameter was used to avoid slipping of the sample in contact with the sensor the sample was isolated from the environment to prevent evaporation of water from the sample during the test and measurements were conducted at 22 0 1 c 2 4 epss extraction protocol lb epss and tb epss were extracted following the procedure described by ruiz hernando et al 2015a briefly the was sample was dewatered by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 10 min the supernatant was collected for protein analysis and the bottom sediment was resuspended to the original volume using a buffered solution ph 7 a mild method based on centrifugation 5000 x g for 15 min was used for lb epss extraction sheng et al 2010 subsequently a harsh method based on ultrasonication followed by centrifugation 20 000 x g for 20 min was applied for the tb epss extraction 2 5 analytical methods the soluble protein concentration of the supernatant obtained after the first centrifugation of the epss extraction protocol was analysed following the lowry et al 1951 method bovine serum albumin bsa was used as the standard and the absorbance was read at 750 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 20 perkin elmer the molecular weight distributions mwd of the lb epss and tb epss fractions were analysed by gel permeation chromatography gpc using a waters alliance 2695 chromatograph coupled to waters 2996 photo diode array pda detector 190 650 nm the eps fingerprints were analysed at 280 nm because proteins readily absorb at this wavelength due to their conjugated nature ras et al 2011 two serially linked columns ultrahydrogel 500 10 µm 7 8 300 mm and ultrahydrogel 250 6 µm 7 8 300 mm were used to obtain a wide selective permeation range and the molecular weight mw calibration was performed using five protein like substances as standards with mw from 197 to 200 000 da the detailed specifications of the gpc analysis can be found in ruiz hernando et al 2015a all the samples were filtered through 0 45 µm low protein binding pvdf membranes the capillary suction time cst was measured using a type 304 m cst triton electronics ltd uk the bound water content was determined by calculating the difference between the total water content measured by drying the sample at 105 c and the free water measured by differential scanning calorimetry dsc this procedure assumes that bound water does not freeze at temperatures below the normal freezing point of water briefly a weighted amount of sludge was added to the thermal analyser mettler toledo dsc 30 with pure n2 as the carrying gas the temperature of the sludge sample was first decreased at a rate of 2 c min from 25 c to 40 c and then raised back to 40 c at the same rate the phase transition from water to ice was assumed to correspond to free water erdincler and vesilind 2003 finally the bound water content was expressed as kg bound water kg ts ts and volatile solid vs contents were measured in triplicate following the standard method 2540 g apha 2005 2 6 economic analysis a theoretical techno economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility to implement an ultrasound reactor in a wwtp fig s1 of the supplementary information illustrates the two scenarios considered for the economic analysis i baseline scenario where the ultrasound reactor was not implemented and ii scenario 1 where the ultrasound reactor was implemented for was pre treatment the was production for the different scenarios was calculated considering that a theoretical wwtp treated 100 000 m3 day of wastewater containing a chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen concentrations of 700 mg cod l and 56 mg n l respectively vinardell et al 2021a the wwtp implemented a primary settler and a modified ludzack ettinger configuration the thickened was composition was based on the average of seven different sludges reported in the literature astals et al 2013 the methane production solids removal and release of nutrients from thickened was anaerobic digestion were calculated considering steady state equations for a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr detailed information on the steady state equations used to model the anaerobic digester performance can be found in vinardell et al 2021a the biodegradability and hydrolysis constant for the anaerobic digestion of thickened was and ultrasonicated was were obtained from ruiz hernando et al 2014a the anaerobic digestion performance was modelled considering an organic loading rate of 1 kg vs m3 day the capital and operating costs influenced by the implementation of an ultrasound system were considered in this economic evaluation table s2 of the supplementary information shows detailed information of the parameters used for the cost calculations the capital cost of the ultrasound reactor was considered to be 7500 kw based on previous data for full scale ultrasound reactor configured as a double tube reactor lippert et al 2021 an specific energy input of 200 kj kg ts was considered for the ultrasound reactor since it has been reported in full scale ultrasound systems lippert et al 2021 ultrasound reactors usually need frequent replacement due to cavitation erosion pérez elvira et al 2006 the lifetime of the ultrasound reactor was considered to be 3 years which is comprised between the 1 6 years lifetime range evaluated by lippert et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that the specific energy input used in the present study 27 000 kj kg ts was not considered in the economic analysis since this would not be a feasible option for full scale ultrasound implementation lippert et al 2021 electricity was generated from the biogas by using a combined heat and power chp unit the electrical efficiency of the chp unit was 33 riley et al 2020 the heat recovered in the chp unit was used to keep the digester at 35 c an average electricity price of 0 1149 kwh was considered eurostat 2019 the upgrading of the chp system was necessary to adapt the existing chp system to the increased biogas production after ultrasound implementation scenario 1 a unit cost of 712 kwel was considered for the chp system upgrading riley et al 2020 an operating cost for the chp system of 0 0119 kwhel was used in the economic evaluation riley et al 2020 the digestate after anaerobic digestion was dewatered by centrifugation polyelectrolyte was dosed at 9 kg t ts at a unit cost of 2 35 kg pretel et al 2014 vinardell et al 2021a an energy consumption of 0 045 kwh kg tss was considered for dewatering pretel et al 2014 the biosolids solid fraction of the centrifuge were used in agriculture at a cost of 147 t ts vinardell et al 2021a the nutrients backload of the centrate liquid fraction of the centrifuge were treated in the mainstream of the wwtp an energy consumption of 2 38 kwh kg n was considered for nitrogen removal horstmeyer et al 2018 ferric chloride consumption for phosphorus precipitation was estimated from taboada santos et al 2020 the capital expenditure capex operating expenditure opex and electricity revenue were calculated for the two scenarios eq 4 was used to calculate the net cost as the difference between the gross cost annualised capex opex and electricity revenue vinardell et al 2021b 4 net cost y i 1 i t 1 i t 1 c a p e x o p e x e r where capex is the capital expenditure opex is the operating expenditure year er is the electricity revenue year t is the project lifetime years and i is the discount rate 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the ultrasound treatment on the internal structure of the was table 2 shows the bound water content cst and soluble protein content of the treated and untreated was samples for each ultrasound es evaluated it is worth mentioning that bound water is considered a gross estimate of several states of water including vicinal water physically bound to solid particles surface by adsorption and adhesion water of hydration chemically bound to the solid particles and a fraction of interstitial water trapped within the floc structure or within a bacterial cell erdincler and vesilind 2003 the results show that all the parameters increase as the ultrasound es increases which indicates that the physicochemical characteristics in the internal structure of the was changed the ultrasound treatment increased the soluble protein content over 100 for all the es analysed in comparison with the untreated sludge this suggests that a large quantity of epss were released into the liquid phase since the soluble protein content which is the major constituent of the epss provides a reliable approximation of the degree of floc disruption and solubilisation guo et al 2020 li and yang 2007 ruiz hernando et al 2015a from these results it is conceivable to state that the epss released after sludge floc disruption increased the available surface for the physical binding of vicinal water thus increasing the bound water content and hindering sludge dewatering this is consistent with the results obtained for the cst test which shows an increase up to 6236 s for an es of 27 000 kj kg ts in the literature it is widely accepted that high ultrasound es deteriorates sludge dewatering because it sharply increases the cst feng et al 2009 nevertheless in a previous study it was found that a high ultrasound es 27 000 kj kg ts improved was dewatering by centrifugation although the cst increased this was attributed to the release of the interstitial water trapped within sludge flocs and part of the vicinal water ruiz hernando et al 2014b accordingly it is conceivable that vicinal water was transferred to the supernatant together with colloidal and hydrophilic organic material fig 1 shows the mwd of lb epss and tb epss fractions for untreated and ultrasonicated was at 27 000 kj kg ts in the present study molecular weights equal or above the size of insulin 5800 da were considered proteins whereas those below 5800 da were considered protein building blocks lin et al 1998 for the untreated was most of the protein like substances were found in the tb eps fraction the innermost layer and a very small amount was found in the lb eps fraction the outermost layer the ultrasound treatment solubilised a portion of the peptides and low molecular weight proteins as evidenced by the increase in the lb eps fraction accordingly it is conceivable that the ultrasound treatment caused structural changes in the was that can be attributed to two mechanisms i disruption of the sludge flocs which caused a reduction in size of sludge particles and increased the specific surface area for water attachment bougrier et al 2006 ruiz hernando et al 2014b and ii solubilisation of the low molecular weight epss which changed the physicochemical characteristics of the was such as turbidity viscosity and surface charge among others li et al 2018 3 2 rheological structural model to quantify the thixotropic behaviour of was the rheological characterisation within the non linear viscoelastic region was analysed by means of a rheological structural model fig 2 illustrates the steady state viscosity as a function of shear rates between 5 and 300 s 1 the results show that the untreated and ultrasonicated was from 3000 to 33 000 kj kg ts exhibited pseudoplastic behaviour which means that the steady state viscosity decreased with the shear rate following a power law equation eq t3 2 the ostwald de waele model reproduced properly the pseudoplastic response of both the untreated and ultrasonicated was samples the steady state viscosity was substantially reduced with the increase of the ultrasonic es applied specifically for a shear rate of 300 s 1 the steady state viscosity of the was treated at an es of 33 000 kj kg ts was reduced about 60 this is mainly because the ultrasound treatment changed the internal structure of was which affected its thixotropic behaviour the thixotropic kinetic coefficients for the breakdown process kdown were obtained from the step tests following eq t4 1 fig 3 a shows the kdown data as a function of the es applied for the three tested shear rates 30 125 and 300 s 1 the results show that k down decreased when both the ultrasound es and shear rate increased which means that the internal structure took more time to reach the steady state value the reduction of kdown with ultrasound es was mainly observed at low shear rates 30 s 1 whereas at high shear rates 125 and 300 s 1 the k down values remained relatively constant regardless of the es applied this is because kdown depends on the shear rate in accordance with a potential equation eq t5 1 from which the kinetic parameters for the breakdown process α down and β down can be obtained table 3 shows the α down and β down values with regression coefficient higher than 0 98 the negative value of β down parameter means that the time to reach the equilibrium was higher at high shear rates the shear rate dependency observed by the values of β down 0 was slightly minimised as the ultrasound es was increased the alignment and deformation of sludge flocs to the applied shear rate quantified by means of the m parameter and the kinetic parameters for the build up process α up and β up were obtained from the loop data i e these parameters were varied to match the theoretical and experimental data using the steady state a and n obtained from the equilibrium data and kinetic breakdown α down and β down obtained from the step data parameters in this context the mathematical coupling effect among the adjusted parameters was reduced the experimental data of the two loop tests maximum shear rates of 125 and 300 s 1 were fitted simultaneously by minimising the average relative error are between the experimental and calculated loop data fig 4 shows the hysteresis loops for the untreated and ultrasonicated was table 3 shows the m parameter and the kinetic parameters of the build up process α up and β up that better adjusted the experimental loop data are 0 24 the results show that the m parameter slightly decreased as the es increased table 3 this means that the effect of the alignment or shape of aggregates elastic deformation at the new shear rate was more noticeable for less disrupted was structures large structures because of the lower es applied the thixotropic kinetic coefficients for the build up process kup were calculated using eq t5 2 and considering the α up and β up parameters obtained from the loop data as can be observed kup values fig 3b were always lower than kdown fig 3a which means that building up structures is a slower process than the breaking down all the sludges displayed positive thixotropic behaviour which means that the shear stresses during the up curves are higher than those at the same shear rate during the down curves the hysteresis area noticeably decreased when increasing ultrasound es fig 4 this may seem to disagree with the theoretical results obtained with the model since a large value of the hysteresis area might suggest a higher thixotropy and vice versa however the hysteresis area is not a good parameter to compare the thixotropy of sludges with different viscosities as in the case of ultrasonicated was samples baudez 2006 ruiz hernando et al 2015b 3 3 comparison of the viscoelastic behaviour between untreated ultrasonicated and dewatered was the creep test was conducted for the untreated ultrasonicated at 27 000 kj kg ts and dewatered was the dewatered was was obtained by centrifugation of the ultrasonicated sludge 27 000 kj kg ts followed by the removal of the bulk water by decantation the reason for choosing 27 000 kj kg ts was because this es allowed a reduction in shear stress and therefore the viscosity similar to the maximum ultrasound es applied 33 000 kj kg ts fig 4a fig 5 a shows the creep compliance data corresponding to the untreated ultrasonicated and dewatered sludge samples and their respective best fits to the burgers model eq 3 the good fit of the experimental data demonstrated the capability of the burgers model to reproduce the viscoelastic response of the sludges the compliance data for the three sludges exhibited the typical evolution of a viscoelastic material which implies three different behaviours in time i an initial sudden increase of the compliance which corresponds to a pure elastic behaviour ii an increase at a variable rate which corresponds to a viscoelastic behaviour and iii an increase at a constant rate which corresponds to a pure viscous behaviour the ultrasonicated sludge exhibited the highest values of compliance followed by the dewatered and untreated sludges accordingly ultrasonicated sludge was more easily deformed by a given stress the pure elastic behaviour can be quantified with the parameter g 0 which measures the initial elasticity of the sample and corresponds to the inverse of j 0 on the other hand the pure viscous behaviour can be quantified with the parameter η 0 which corresponds to the zero shear rate viscosity moreira et al 2010 both parameters g 0 and η 0 were obtained with the model described in eq 3 and are shown in fig 5b the untreated sludge exhibited the highest values of i g 0 which indicates that it is formed by mechanically strong and rigid structures and ii η 0 which indicates that these structures are large conversely the sludge treated at 27 000 kj kg ts exhibited the lowest g 0 and η 0 values which means that the ultrasound treatment loosened and disrupted the internal structure of the was fig 5b also shows the ts content of the untreated and dewatered sludges specifically dewatered sludge resulted in an increase of approximately 21 of the ts content in comparison with the untreated sludge nevertheless despite being more concentrated the dewatered sludge exhibited a reduction in the zero shear rate viscosity thus being easier to handle than the untreated sludge finally the viscoelastic behaviour can be quantified with the parameters of the kelvin voigt element i e i the relaxation time of a structure λ which is closely related to the size of the structure and ii the elasticity modulus g m 1 j m which is related to the number of these structures llorens et al 2003 specifically the g m values were 705 pa for the untreated sludge 162 pa for the ultrasonicated sludge at 27 000 kj kg ts and 238 pa for the dewatered sludge which means that the ultrasound treatment decreased the number of structures in the relaxation time analysed 3 4 economic analysis 3 4 1 economic feasibility to implement an ultrasound reactor in a wwtp fig 6 shows the economic results to implement an ultrasound reactor to pre treat was in a theoretical wwtp the results show that the implementation of an ultrasound reactor is not yet economically favourable since the baseline scenario featured a net cost lower than scenario 1 in scenario 1 ultrasound implementation led to an increase in electricity revenue and a reduction in the amount of solids to be managed as a result of the higher solids degradation in the anaerobic digester however these economic incomes did not offset the higher capital and operating costs of the ultrasound reactor which is the main reason why scenario 1 featured a net cost 764 485 year 14 higher than the baseline scenario 668 081 year besides economic considerations the implementation of an ultrasound reactor can facilitate was management due to its reduced viscosity lippert et al 2021 3 4 2 sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows the sensitivity analysis of the baseline scenario and scenario 1 the sensitivity analysis was performed by changing 30 the base case value considered for the economic analysis the sensitivity analysis is a useful tool to evaluate the key economic drivers affecting the economics of the process li et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that costs that did not experience variation because they solely depended on ultrasound implementation have not been illustrated for the baseline scenario the results show that biosolids disposal cost had the highest impact on the net cost of both scenarios in the baseline scenario the net cost variation caused by biosolids disposal cost was higher than in scenario 1 since scenario 1 produced a lower amount of biosolids due to its higher solids reduction in the anaerobic digester electricity price also had a high impact on net cost because an increase or reduction of this parameter impacted the revenue achieved from electricity production unlike biosolids disposal cost the net cost variation caused by electricity price was higher in scenario 1 than in the baseline scenario since scenario 1 produced a higher amount of electricity after the implementation of an ultrasound system these results suggest that further improvements in was biodegradability through ultrasonication are important to improve the competitiveness of ultrasound systems this idea was reinforced observing the results of the sensitivity analysis which show that increasing the vs removal efficiency from ultrasonicated was anaerobic digestion could make scenario 1 more competitive than the baseline scenario fig 7 specifically scenario 1 should achieve a methane production increase of 30 only including was in the mass balance from ultrasonicated was anaerobic digestion to outcompete the baseline scenario this means that a total methane production increase of 12 including was and primary sludge ps in the mass balance would be necessary for an anaerobic digester initially treating mixed ps and was 50 ps and 50 was on vs basis these results show that ultrasound implementation could be economically competitive since increments in total methane production above 15 have been reported in full scale anaerobic digesters treating ps and ultrasonicated was hogan et al 2004 xie et al 2007 however it is worth mentioning that the costs of the ultrasound equipment have been calculated considering a novel double tube ultrasound reactor operated at a relatively low energy input of 200 kj kg ts lippert et al 2021 in their study lippert et al 2021 observed that this reactor configuration reduced clogging risk in comparison to more typical ultrasound reactors such as sonotrode or radial horn with a direct impact on the ultrasound reactor lifetime however the authors only reported a slight increase in methane production of 6 2 statistically not significant for this configuration that was primarily attributed to the low ultrasonic density in comparison to full scale sonotrode and radial horn reactors as well as to the low efficiency of the double tube reactor when treating high solid content streams such as was from the results reported by lippert et al 2021 it does not appear possible to reach total methane production increases of 12 considering the current development of the double tube reactor configuration therefore the results obtained in the present study should be further expanded considering other reactor configurations importantly these studies should also include the impact of reactor configuration on ultrasound system integrity since it could play a key role in the total operating costs overall the economic and technical competitiveness of an ultrasound system for was pre treatment depends on its capacity to increase the biodegradability of was while keeping the system at a moderate risk of clogging and erosion 4 conclusions this study evaluated the impact of ultrasound treatment on was rheology dewatering properties and process economics a rheological structural model was implemented to better understand the change of the was internal structure after ultrasound treatment ultrasound treatment disrupted the was flocs and solubilised a portion of the epss with a direct impact on the rheological and dewatering properties of was however the implementation of ultrasonication in a wwtp is not yet economically feasible the main conclusions of this study are summarised as follows ultrasound treatment disrupted was flocs since the soluble protein content increased from 416 to 3740 mg l as the ultrasound es increased from 0 to 27 000 kj kg ts as a result the bound water and the cst increased because the proteins increased the available surface for water attachment the rheological structural model demonstrated that increasing ultrasound es reduced the kinetic coefficient for the breakdown process and changed the fast speed of alignment of flocs because of the reduction of was structures the creep measurements performed within the linear viscoelastic region showed that the ultrasound treatment at an es of 27 000 kj kg ts reduced the initial elasticity and the zero shear rate viscosity by approximately 80 and 60 respectively which means that the internal structure of the was loosened and disrupted the ultrasonicated and dewatered sludge exhibited more complex networks due to the higher soluble protein content but exhibited a weak connection between internal structures since both the viscosity and the initial elasticity at rest decreased the techno economic analysis showed that ultrasound implementation was not yet economically attractive since its implementation featured a net cost about 14 higher than the scenario that did not implement ultrasonication however achieving an increase of 12 in methane production in an anaerobic digester initially treating was and ps could make ultrasound implementation economically attractive declaration of competing interest

16456,the present study provides an overall view of the effect of the ultrasound treatment on waste activated sludge was rheological and dewatering properties as well as its impact on the economic balance of a theoretical wastewater treatment plant the results showed that ultrasonication at 27 000 kj kg ts increased the soluble protein concentration 100 bound water content 25 and capillary suction time 100 of was the molecular weight distribution of the extracellular polymeric substances eps revealed that the ultrasound treatment solubilised a portion of the peptides and low molecular weight proteins the thixotropic behaviour of the was was analysed by means of a rheological structural model that defines the time evolution of a structural parameter as a function of kinetic coefficients for the breakdown and build up processes the ultrasound treatment reduced the kinetic coefficients for the breakdown process and changed the fast speed of alignment of flocs because of the reduction of was structures similarly the creep tests revealed that the ultrasound treatment at 27 000 kj kg ts reduced the initial elasticity 80 and the zero shear rate viscosity 60 which means that the internal structure of the was loosened and disrupted finally a techno economic analysis showed that ultrasonication was not yet economically favourable since its implementation increased 14 the net cost for was treatment and disposal however a sensitivity analysis illustrated that increasing electricity revenue and reducing biosolids disposal costs through improvement in was

less organic contaminants and higher nutrients concentration than primary sludge radjenović et al 2009 weemaes and verstraete 1998 however was is difficult to dewater compared with primary sludge due to the existence of colloidal materials and extracellular polymeric substances epss houghton and stephenson 2002 the sludge floc matrix is represented by a dynamic double layered eps structure li and yang 2007 with tightly bound epss tb epss located in the inner layer and loosely bound epss lb epss located in the outer layer sheng et al 2010 accordingly lb epss may function as the primary surface for cell attachment and flocculation li and yang 2007 additionally was is primarily formed by microorganisms and therefore more difficult to digest under anaerobic conditions due to the presence of glycan strands in microbial cell walls appels et al 2008 several pre treatments have been proposed in the literature to improve the digestibility and dewaterability of was such as ultrasound lippert et al 2021 thermal ruiz hernando et al 2015b alkaline he et al 2021 and freezing combined with nitrite addition liu et al 2020 ultrasound which can partially disintegrate the was by disrupting flocs and solubilising the epss is one of the most researched techniques for was pre treatment bandelin et al 2020 feng et al 2009 the ultrasound disintegration mechanism is based on the cavitation phenomenon which is the formation growth and violent collapse of cavitation bubbles caused by alternate compression and rarefaction cycles of ultrasound waves travelling through the was gallipoli and braguglia 2012 this violent collapse generates powerful hydro mechanical shear forces in the bulk liquid surrounding the bubbles the ultrasound range is divided in three regions depending on the frequency i power ultrasound 20 100 khz ii high frequency ultrasound 100 khz 1 mhz and iii diagnostic ultrasound 1 500 mhz pilli et al 2011 according to carrère et al 2010 low frequencies 20 40 khz are the most efficient in sludge treatment rheology is a useful tool for the characterisation of sludge suspensions two major types of rheological measurements can be distinguished i those perform within the linear viscoelastic region and ii those perform within the non linear viscoelastic region ruiz hernando et al 2014b when performing rheological measurements within the linear viscoelastic region the analysed material flows with its original structure unchanged due to the low shear stresses applied the linear viscoelastic properties can be measured using the creep test in which a constant stress in the linear viscoelastic region is applied and the time related strain is measured farno et al 2020 conversely when rheological measurements are performed within the non linear viscoelastic region the material flows with the application of moderate or high shear stress under these conditions elasticity is notably reduced and viscosity governs the rheological behaviour of was being dependent on the applied shear rate labanda and llorens 2006 under steady state laminar flow was generally behaves as a non newtonian pseudoplastic fluid ratkovich et al 2013 according to the literature the ostwald de waele model is the most commonly used equation to represent the non newtonian behaviour of sludge because of its simplicity and good fitting seyssiecq et al 2008 was also exhibits thixotropic behavior eshtiaghi et al 2013 farno et al 2020 which means that the internal sludge structure is formed by a complex network based on the union of flocs and macroflocs that break down or build up slowly to adapt their structure to the applied shear a common method to evaluate thixotropy is the hysteresis loop test which consists of measuring the area enclosed between the up and down curve of shear stress vs shear rate over time the called hysteresis area when shear rate is linearly increased and decreased over time baudez 2006 tixier et al 2003 however the hysteresis area is a relative measurement of the thixotropy because it depends on the design parameters of the test and it is not a good parameter to compare the thixotropy of different samples with different viscosities baudez 2006 instead thixotropy can be determined more accurately by means of a rheological structural model that defines the time evolution of a structural parameter which is a numerical scalar measurement of the internal structure level as a function of the kinetic coefficients for the breakdown and build up processes moore 1959 accordingly the major asset of this type of models is that the thixotropic behaviour is determined based on the magnitude of both kinetic coefficients instead of a relative measurement the hysteresis area limited information is available in the literature concerning rheological models to predict the thixotropic behaviour of was after applying a disintegration treatment ruiz hernando et al 2015b successfully implemented a rheological structural model to examine the variations of the thixotropic behaviour of was after thermal treatment however to the best of the authors knowledge this model has not yet been used to predict the thixotropy behaviour of was after ultrasound treatment this is an important implication since the mechanism behind the disintegration of was flocs substantially differs between applying ultrasound or thermal treatment bougrier et al 2006 these differences between ultrasound and thermal treatment can lead to high variations concerning the epss solubilisation mechanism with a direct impact on the rheological properties of the treated was accordingly validating the rheological structural model for ultrasound treatment is crucial to understand its suitability to predict the variation of the thixotropic properties of ultrasonicated was the aim of the present study is to analyse the effect of the ultrasound treatment on the internal structure of the was and its underlying impact on epss solubilisation and dewatering properties the rheological properties of the was have been analysed through the implementation of a rheological structural model and conducting creep tests finally a techno economic study has been conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility of ultrasound implementation for was pre treatment before anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge samples the thickened was samples used in this study were collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the barcelona metropolitan area spain with a treatment capacity of 1 700 000 population equivalent the sludge samples were stored at 4 c until their utilisation detailed information of the main characteristics of the thickened was is provided in table s1 of the supplementary information 2 2 ultrasound treatment conditions the ultrasonic apparatus used was an hd2070 sonopuls ultrasonic homogenizer equipped with a ms 73 titanium microtip probe bandelin berlin germany 20 khz the ultrasonication power was fixed at 70 w and the exposure times were changed to provide a wide range of specific energies from 3000 to 33 000 kj kg ts which were calculated following eq 1 1 e s p t a v t s where es is the specific energy applied kj kg ts p is the ultrasonic power of the ultrasonic homogeniser kw ta is the application time s v is the sample volume l and ts is the concentration of total solids kg l ultrasonication increases was temperature due to the thermal effect caused by the cavitation phenomenon pilli et al 2011 since the present study intended to solely analyse the effect of ultrasound treatment it was necessary to nullify this thermal effect dewil et al 2006 accordingly the beaker containing the samples was submerged in an ice bath to guarantee that the sludge temperature did not exceed 20 c chu et al 2001 dewil et al 2006 2 3 rheological characterisation the rheometer used was a haake rs300 control stress rheometer equipped with a temperature control system thermostatic bath and connected to a computer that allows programming the rheological assays and recording the data in real time haake rheowin software 2 3 1 hysteresis loop test shear rate step test and rheological structural model theory the rheological behaviour under flow conditions was analysed by the hysteresis loop and shear rate step tests the sensor geometry used for both assays was a 4 cone and a flat stationary plate of 35 mm diameter the average gap of the cone plate geometry is 888 µm and the maximum centripetal acceleration at a shear rate of 300 s 1 maximum shear rate applied is 0 78 x g under such settings the particles trapped in the gap and the movement of particles towards the edges is minimal measurements were conducted at 22 0 1 c and at a constant ts content 56 2 0 4 g kg the hysteresis loop test was performed at two maximum shear rates 125 and 300 s 1 following the procedure described by ruiz hernando et al 2014b the shear rate step test consisted of pre shearing the sludge at a fixed shear rate of 5 s 1 for 15 min and suddenly changing the shear rate to 30 125 or 300 s 1 for 10 min to achieve steady states the step tests were conducted in triplicate the variations in the thixotropic behaviour of was before and after the ultrasound treatment was analysed by means of a rheological structural model the theory of the model has been extensively discussed in a previous study ruiz hernando et al 2015b and a summary of the equations used is provided in table 1 the model is based on the definition of the structural parameter s which quantifies the structural level of the internal structure at any time and shear rate thereby the value of s goes to zero when the internal structure is completely broken down resulting in the lowest viscosity while a complete build up structure corresponds to the highest value of s resulting in the highest viscosity the breakdown and build up of the internal network with shear time is demonstrated with a constitutive equation eq t1 and two kinetic equations eqs t2 1 and t2 2 which consider the time dependence of the viscosity at constant shear rate conditions on the other hand was commonly behaves as non newtonian pseudoplastic fluid under steady state conditions accordingly the steady state viscosity ηe was fitted to the ostwald de waele model eq t3 2 2 3 2 creep test the rheological behaviour within the linear viscoelastic region was analysed by the creep test following a similar procedure conducted in a previous study ruiz hernando et al 2014b before starting the creep test the sludge samples were kept at rest for 10 min to relax their structures the limiting stress in the linear viscoelastic region was determined by conducting a shear sweep test from 0 to 200 pa at a frequency of 1 hz the stresses that did not exceed 10 pa assured that no changes were produced in the was internal structure however following a conservative criterion the creep tests were conducted at 5 pa the compliance strain divided by shear stress j t eq 2 was monitored for 15 min 2 j t γ t τ a where γ t is the time related strain and τa is the applied shear stress pa the obtained compliance data were fitted to a burgers model kelvin voigt cell in series with a maxwell component using eq 3 3 j t j 0 j m 1 e x p t λ t η 0 where j0 is the instantaneous elastic compliance of the maxwell spring pa 1 jm is the viscoelastic compliance pa 1 associated to the mean relaxation time s of the kelvin voigt element and η0 is the zero shear rate viscosity of the maxwell dashpot pa s a serrated plate plate sensor geometry 35 mm in diameter was used to avoid slipping of the sample in contact with the sensor the sample was isolated from the environment to prevent evaporation of water from the sample during the test and measurements were conducted at 22 0 1 c 2 4 epss extraction protocol lb epss and tb epss were extracted following the procedure described by ruiz hernando et al 2015a briefly the was sample was dewatered by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 10 min the supernatant was collected for protein analysis and the bottom sediment was resuspended to the original volume using a buffered solution ph 7 a mild method based on centrifugation 5000 x g for 15 min was used for lb epss extraction sheng et al 2010 subsequently a harsh method based on ultrasonication followed by centrifugation 20 000 x g for 20 min was applied for the tb epss extraction 2 5 analytical methods the soluble protein concentration of the supernatant obtained after the first centrifugation of the epss extraction protocol was analysed following the lowry et al 1951 method bovine serum albumin bsa was used as the standard and the absorbance was read at 750 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 20 perkin elmer the molecular weight distributions mwd of the lb epss and tb epss fractions were analysed by gel permeation chromatography gpc using a waters alliance 2695 chromatograph coupled to waters 2996 photo diode array pda detector 190 650 nm the eps fingerprints were analysed at 280 nm because proteins readily absorb at this wavelength due to their conjugated nature ras et al 2011 two serially linked columns ultrahydrogel 500 10 µm 7 8 300 mm and ultrahydrogel 250 6 µm 7 8 300 mm were used to obtain a wide selective permeation range and the molecular weight mw calibration was performed using five protein like substances as standards with mw from 197 to 200 000 da the detailed specifications of the gpc analysis can be found in ruiz hernando et al 2015a all the samples were filtered through 0 45 µm low protein binding pvdf membranes the capillary suction time cst was measured using a type 304 m cst triton electronics ltd uk the bound water content was determined by calculating the difference between the total water content measured by drying the sample at 105 c and the free water measured by differential scanning calorimetry dsc this procedure assumes that bound water does not freeze at temperatures below the normal freezing point of water briefly a weighted amount of sludge was added to the thermal analyser mettler toledo dsc 30 with pure n2 as the carrying gas the temperature of the sludge sample was first decreased at a rate of 2 c min from 25 c to 40 c and then raised back to 40 c at the same rate the phase transition from water to ice was assumed to correspond to free water erdincler and vesilind 2003 finally the bound water content was expressed as kg bound water kg ts ts and volatile solid vs contents were measured in triplicate following the standard method 2540 g apha 2005 2 6 economic analysis a theoretical techno economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility to implement an ultrasound reactor in a wwtp fig s1 of the supplementary information illustrates the two scenarios considered for the economic analysis i baseline scenario where the ultrasound reactor was not implemented and ii scenario 1 where the ultrasound reactor was implemented for was pre treatment the was production for the different scenarios was calculated considering that a theoretical wwtp treated 100 000 m3 day of wastewater containing a chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen concentrations of 700 mg cod l and 56 mg n l respectively vinardell et al 2021a the wwtp implemented a primary settler and a modified ludzack ettinger configuration the thickened was composition was based on the average of seven different sludges reported in the literature astals et al 2013 the methane production solids removal and release of nutrients from thickened was anaerobic digestion were calculated considering steady state equations for a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr detailed information on the steady state equations used to model the anaerobic digester performance can be found in vinardell et al 2021a the biodegradability and hydrolysis constant for the anaerobic digestion of thickened was and ultrasonicated was were obtained from ruiz hernando et al 2014a the anaerobic digestion performance was modelled considering an organic loading rate of 1 kg vs m3 day the capital and operating costs influenced by the implementation of an ultrasound system were considered in this economic evaluation table s2 of the supplementary information shows detailed information of the parameters used for the cost calculations the capital cost of the ultrasound reactor was considered to be 7500 kw based on previous data for full scale ultrasound reactor configured as a double tube reactor lippert et al 2021 an specific energy input of 200 kj kg ts was considered for the ultrasound reactor since it has been reported in full scale ultrasound systems lippert et al 2021 ultrasound reactors usually need frequent replacement due to cavitation erosion pérez elvira et al 2006 the lifetime of the ultrasound reactor was considered to be 3 years which is comprised between the 1 6 years lifetime range evaluated by lippert et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that the specific energy input used in the present study 27 000 kj kg ts was not considered in the economic analysis since this would not be a feasible option for full scale ultrasound implementation lippert et al 2021 electricity was generated from the biogas by using a combined heat and power chp unit the electrical efficiency of the chp unit was 33 riley et al 2020 the heat recovered in the chp unit was used to keep the digester at 35 c an average electricity price of 0 1149 kwh was considered eurostat 2019 the upgrading of the chp system was necessary to adapt the existing chp system to the increased biogas production after ultrasound implementation scenario 1 a unit cost of 712 kwel was considered for the chp system upgrading riley et al 2020 an operating cost for the chp system of 0 0119 kwhel was used in the economic evaluation riley et al 2020 the digestate after anaerobic digestion was dewatered by centrifugation polyelectrolyte was dosed at 9 kg t ts at a unit cost of 2 35 kg pretel et al 2014 vinardell et al 2021a an energy consumption of 0 045 kwh kg tss was considered for dewatering pretel et al 2014 the biosolids solid fraction of the centrifuge were used in agriculture at a cost of 147 t ts vinardell et al 2021a the nutrients backload of the centrate liquid fraction of the centrifuge were treated in the mainstream of the wwtp an energy consumption of 2 38 kwh kg n was considered for nitrogen removal horstmeyer et al 2018 ferric chloride consumption for phosphorus precipitation was estimated from taboada santos et al 2020 the capital expenditure capex operating expenditure opex and electricity revenue were calculated for the two scenarios eq 4 was used to calculate the net cost as the difference between the gross cost annualised capex opex and electricity revenue vinardell et al 2021b 4 net cost y i 1 i t 1 i t 1 c a p e x o p e x e r where capex is the capital expenditure opex is the operating expenditure year er is the electricity revenue year t is the project lifetime years and i is the discount rate 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the ultrasound treatment on the internal structure of the was table 2 shows the bound water content cst and soluble protein content of the treated and untreated was samples for each ultrasound es evaluated it is worth mentioning that bound water is considered a gross estimate of several states of water including vicinal water physically bound to solid particles surface by adsorption and adhesion water of hydration chemically bound to the solid particles and a fraction of interstitial water trapped within the floc structure or within a bacterial cell erdincler and vesilind 2003 the results show that all the parameters increase as the ultrasound es increases which indicates that the physicochemical characteristics in the internal structure of the was changed the ultrasound treatment increased the soluble protein content over 100 for all the es analysed in comparison with the untreated sludge this suggests that a large quantity of epss were released into the liquid phase since the soluble protein content which is the major constituent of the epss provides a reliable approximation of the degree of floc disruption and solubilisation guo et al 2020 li and yang 2007 ruiz hernando et al 2015a from these results it is conceivable to state that the epss released after sludge floc disruption increased the available surface for the physical binding of vicinal water thus increasing the bound water content and hindering sludge dewatering this is consistent with the results obtained for the cst test which shows an increase up to 6236 s for an es of 27 000 kj kg ts in the literature it is widely accepted that high ultrasound es deteriorates sludge dewatering because it sharply increases the cst feng et al 2009 nevertheless in a previous study it was found that a high ultrasound es 27 000 kj kg ts improved was dewatering by centrifugation although the cst increased this was attributed to the release of the interstitial water trapped within sludge flocs and part of the vicinal water ruiz hernando et al 2014b accordingly it is conceivable that vicinal water was transferred to the supernatant together with colloidal and hydrophilic organic material fig 1 shows the mwd of lb epss and tb epss fractions for untreated and ultrasonicated was at 27 000 kj kg ts in the present study molecular weights equal or above the size of insulin 5800 da were considered proteins whereas those below 5800 da were considered protein building blocks lin et al 1998 for the untreated was most of the protein like substances were found in the tb eps fraction the innermost layer and a very small amount was found in the lb eps fraction the outermost layer the ultrasound treatment solubilised a portion of the peptides and low molecular weight proteins as evidenced by the increase in the lb eps fraction accordingly it is conceivable that the ultrasound treatment caused structural changes in the was that can be attributed to two mechanisms i disruption of the sludge flocs which caused a reduction in size of sludge particles and increased the specific surface area for water attachment bougrier et al 2006 ruiz hernando et al 2014b and ii solubilisation of the low molecular weight epss which changed the physicochemical characteristics of the was such as turbidity viscosity and surface charge among others li et al 2018 3 2 rheological structural model to quantify the thixotropic behaviour of was the rheological characterisation within the non linear viscoelastic region was analysed by means of a rheological structural model fig 2 illustrates the steady state viscosity as a function of shear rates between 5 and 300 s 1 the results show that the untreated and ultrasonicated was from 3000 to 33 000 kj kg ts exhibited pseudoplastic behaviour which means that the steady state viscosity decreased with the shear rate following a power law equation eq t3 2 the ostwald de waele model reproduced properly the pseudoplastic response of both the untreated and ultrasonicated was samples the steady state viscosity was substantially reduced with the increase of the ultrasonic es applied specifically for a shear rate of 300 s 1 the steady state viscosity of the was treated at an es of 33 000 kj kg ts was reduced about 60 this is mainly because the ultrasound treatment changed the internal structure of was which affected its thixotropic behaviour the thixotropic kinetic coefficients for the breakdown process kdown were obtained from the step tests following eq t4 1 fig 3 a shows the kdown data as a function of the es applied for the three tested shear rates 30 125 and 300 s 1 the results show that k down decreased when both the ultrasound es and shear rate increased which means that the internal structure took more time to reach the steady state value the reduction of kdown with ultrasound es was mainly observed at low shear rates 30 s 1 whereas at high shear rates 125 and 300 s 1 the k down values remained relatively constant regardless of the es applied this is because kdown depends on the shear rate in accordance with a potential equation eq t5 1 from which the kinetic parameters for the breakdown process α down and β down can be obtained table 3 shows the α down and β down values with regression coefficient higher than 0 98 the negative value of β down parameter means that the time to reach the equilibrium was higher at high shear rates the shear rate dependency observed by the values of β down 0 was slightly minimised as the ultrasound es was increased the alignment and deformation of sludge flocs to the applied shear rate quantified by means of the m parameter and the kinetic parameters for the build up process α up and β up were obtained from the loop data i e these parameters were varied to match the theoretical and experimental data using the steady state a and n obtained from the equilibrium data and kinetic breakdown α down and β down obtained from the step data parameters in this context the mathematical coupling effect among the adjusted parameters was reduced the experimental data of the two loop tests maximum shear rates of 125 and 300 s 1 were fitted simultaneously by minimising the average relative error are between the experimental and calculated loop data fig 4 shows the hysteresis loops for the untreated and ultrasonicated was table 3 shows the m parameter and the kinetic parameters of the build up process α up and β up that better adjusted the experimental loop data are 0 24 the results show that the m parameter slightly decreased as the es increased table 3 this means that the effect of the alignment or shape of aggregates elastic deformation at the new shear rate was more noticeable for less disrupted was structures large structures because of the lower es applied the thixotropic kinetic coefficients for the build up process kup were calculated using eq t5 2 and considering the α up and β up parameters obtained from the loop data as can be observed kup values fig 3b were always lower than kdown fig 3a which means that building up structures is a slower process than the breaking down all the sludges displayed positive thixotropic behaviour which means that the shear stresses during the up curves are higher than those at the same shear rate during the down curves the hysteresis area noticeably decreased when increasing ultrasound es fig 4 this may seem to disagree with the theoretical results obtained with the model since a large value of the hysteresis area might suggest a higher thixotropy and vice versa however the hysteresis area is not a good parameter to compare the thixotropy of sludges with different viscosities as in the case of ultrasonicated was samples baudez 2006 ruiz hernando et al 2015b 3 3 comparison of the viscoelastic behaviour between untreated ultrasonicated and dewatered was the creep test was conducted for the untreated ultrasonicated at 27 000 kj kg ts and dewatered was the dewatered was was obtained by centrifugation of the ultrasonicated sludge 27 000 kj kg ts followed by the removal of the bulk water by decantation the reason for choosing 27 000 kj kg ts was because this es allowed a reduction in shear stress and therefore the viscosity similar to the maximum ultrasound es applied 33 000 kj kg ts fig 4a fig 5 a shows the creep compliance data corresponding to the untreated ultrasonicated and dewatered sludge samples and their respective best fits to the burgers model eq 3 the good fit of the experimental data demonstrated the capability of the burgers model to reproduce the viscoelastic response of the sludges the compliance data for the three sludges exhibited the typical evolution of a viscoelastic material which implies three different behaviours in time i an initial sudden increase of the compliance which corresponds to a pure elastic behaviour ii an increase at a variable rate which corresponds to a viscoelastic behaviour and iii an increase at a constant rate which corresponds to a pure viscous behaviour the ultrasonicated sludge exhibited the highest values of compliance followed by the dewatered and untreated sludges accordingly ultrasonicated sludge was more easily deformed by a given stress the pure elastic behaviour can be quantified with the parameter g 0 which measures the initial elasticity of the sample and corresponds to the inverse of j 0 on the other hand the pure viscous behaviour can be quantified with the parameter η 0 which corresponds to the zero shear rate viscosity moreira et al 2010 both parameters g 0 and η 0 were obtained with the model described in eq 3 and are shown in fig 5b the untreated sludge exhibited the highest values of i g 0 which indicates that it is formed by mechanically strong and rigid structures and ii η 0 which indicates that these structures are large conversely the sludge treated at 27 000 kj kg ts exhibited the lowest g 0 and η 0 values which means that the ultrasound treatment loosened and disrupted the internal structure of the was fig 5b also shows the ts content of the untreated and dewatered sludges specifically dewatered sludge resulted in an increase of approximately 21 of the ts content in comparison with the untreated sludge nevertheless despite being more concentrated the dewatered sludge exhibited a reduction in the zero shear rate viscosity thus being easier to handle than the untreated sludge finally the viscoelastic behaviour can be quantified with the parameters of the kelvin voigt element i e i the relaxation time of a structure λ which is closely related to the size of the structure and ii the elasticity modulus g m 1 j m which is related to the number of these structures llorens et al 2003 specifically the g m values were 705 pa for the untreated sludge 162 pa for the ultrasonicated sludge at 27 000 kj kg ts and 238 pa for the dewatered sludge which means that the ultrasound treatment decreased the number of structures in the relaxation time analysed 3 4 economic analysis 3 4 1 economic feasibility to implement an ultrasound reactor in a wwtp fig 6 shows the economic results to implement an ultrasound reactor to pre treat was in a theoretical wwtp the results show that the implementation of an ultrasound reactor is not yet economically favourable since the baseline scenario featured a net cost lower than scenario 1 in scenario 1 ultrasound implementation led to an increase in electricity revenue and a reduction in the amount of solids to be managed as a result of the higher solids degradation in the anaerobic digester however these economic incomes did not offset the higher capital and operating costs of the ultrasound reactor which is the main reason why scenario 1 featured a net cost 764 485 year 14 higher than the baseline scenario 668 081 year besides economic considerations the implementation of an ultrasound reactor can facilitate was management due to its reduced viscosity lippert et al 2021 3 4 2 sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows the sensitivity analysis of the baseline scenario and scenario 1 the sensitivity analysis was performed by changing 30 the base case value considered for the economic analysis the sensitivity analysis is a useful tool to evaluate the key economic drivers affecting the economics of the process li et al 2020 it is worth mentioning that costs that did not experience variation because they solely depended on ultrasound implementation have not been illustrated for the baseline scenario the results show that biosolids disposal cost had the highest impact on the net cost of both scenarios in the baseline scenario the net cost variation caused by biosolids disposal cost was higher than in scenario 1 since scenario 1 produced a lower amount of biosolids due to its higher solids reduction in the anaerobic digester electricity price also had a high impact on net cost because an increase or reduction of this parameter impacted the revenue achieved from electricity production unlike biosolids disposal cost the net cost variation caused by electricity price was higher in scenario 1 than in the baseline scenario since scenario 1 produced a higher amount of electricity after the implementation of an ultrasound system these results suggest that further improvements in was biodegradability through ultrasonication are important to improve the competitiveness of ultrasound systems this idea was reinforced observing the results of the sensitivity analysis which show that increasing the vs removal efficiency from ultrasonicated was anaerobic digestion could make scenario 1 more competitive than the baseline scenario fig 7 specifically scenario 1 should achieve a methane production increase of 30 only including was in the mass balance from ultrasonicated was anaerobic digestion to outcompete the baseline scenario this means that a total methane production increase of 12 including was and primary sludge ps in the mass balance would be necessary for an anaerobic digester initially treating mixed ps and was 50 ps and 50 was on vs basis these results show that ultrasound implementation could be economically competitive since increments in total methane production above 15 have been reported in full scale anaerobic digesters treating ps and ultrasonicated was hogan et al 2004 xie et al 2007 however it is worth mentioning that the costs of the ultrasound equipment have been calculated considering a novel double tube ultrasound reactor operated at a relatively low energy input of 200 kj kg ts lippert et al 2021 in their study lippert et al 2021 observed that this reactor configuration reduced clogging risk in comparison to more typical ultrasound reactors such as sonotrode or radial horn with a direct impact on the ultrasound reactor lifetime however the authors only reported a slight increase in methane production of 6 2 statistically not significant for this configuration that was primarily attributed to the low ultrasonic density in comparison to full scale sonotrode and radial horn reactors as well as to the low efficiency of the double tube reactor when treating high solid content streams such as was from the results reported by lippert et al 2021 it does not appear possible to reach total methane production increases of 12 considering the current development of the double tube reactor configuration therefore the results obtained in the present study should be further expanded considering other reactor configurations importantly these studies should also include the impact of reactor configuration on ultrasound system integrity since it could play a key role in the total operating costs overall the economic and technical competitiveness of an ultrasound system for was pre treatment depends on its capacity to increase the biodegradability of was while keeping the system at a moderate risk of clogging and erosion 4 conclusions this study evaluated the impact of ultrasound treatment on was rheology dewatering properties and process economics a rheological structural model was implemented to better understand the change of the was internal structure after ultrasound treatment ultrasound treatment disrupted the was flocs and solubilised a portion of the epss with a direct impact on the rheological and dewatering properties of was however the implementation of ultrasonication in a wwtp is not yet economically feasible the main conclusions of this study are summarised as follows ultrasound treatment disrupted was flocs since the soluble protein content increased from 416 to 3740 mg l as the ultrasound es increased from 0 to 27 000 kj kg ts as a result the bound water and the cst increased because the proteins increased the available surface for water attachment the rheological structural model demonstrated that increasing ultrasound es reduced the kinetic coefficient for the breakdown process and changed the fast speed of alignment of flocs because of the reduction of was structures the creep measurements performed within the linear viscoelastic region showed that the ultrasound treatment at an es of 27 000 kj kg ts reduced the initial elasticity and the zero shear rate viscosity by approximately 80 and 60 respectively which means that the internal structure of the was loosened and disrupted the ultrasonicated and dewatered sludge exhibited more complex networks due to the higher soluble protein content but exhibited a weak connection between internal structures since both the viscosity and the initial elasticity at rest decreased the techno economic analysis showed that ultrasound implementation was not yet economically attractive since its implementation featured a net cost about 14 higher than the scenario that did not implement ultrasonication however achieving an increase of 12 in methane production in an anaerobic digester initially treating was and ps could make ultrasound implementation economically attractive declaration of competing interest

hydrology 25 3 human activities 24 water nutrients 10 5 and ensoi 1 9 our results highlight a strongly causal connection between human activities as well as global climate change and phytoplankton and the benefits of considering multiple environmental drivers in determining the temporal dynamics of lake biotic communities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords el niño southern oscillation eutrophication water nutrients hydrology meteorology 1 introduction phytoplankton is one of the major primary producers in freshwater lake ecosystem and is affected by a variety of drivers from local to global scales arhonditsis et al 2004 carpenter et al 1996 winder and sommer 2012 fu et al 2020 such as water nutrients hydrology metrology fertilizer application urbanization precipitation and climate changes gerten and adrian 2002 goldman et al 1989 monchamp et al 2018 straile 2000 zhang et al 2018 a rapid increase in phytoplankton abundance i e algal blooms occurs when lakes receives excessive inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p which results in significant lake degradation huisman et al 2018 consequently a number of mitigation measures are taken to improve the water qualities of lakes and thus control phytoplankton blooms by reducing nutrient inputs paerl and otten 2013 however phytoplankton responses to the reduction of external nutrients differs among lakes influenced also by other environmental changes induced by human activities e g dams agriculture urbanization and climate changes anneville et al 2019 2005 arhonditsis et al 2004 elser et al 2007 jeppesen et al 2002 2007 2005 human activities have markedly accelerated runoff of n and p across watersheds through increased fertilizer application for agricultural intensification and increasing urbanization due to a growing population and the resulting excessive nutrient input is discharged as sewage into lake ecosystems bowles et al 2018 jeppesen et al 2009 2011 withers et al 2014 yang et al 2020a additionally the amount of sewages input and thus water nutrients to lakes are influenced by the hydrological conditions e g water discharge suspended sediment discharge water level and flow velocity andersen et al 2006 especially in river connected floodplain lakes geng et al 2021b tian et al 2017a moreover the hydrological regimes of lakes may be greatly altered by hydroelectric upstream dams creating changes in water transparency water residence time and flow velocity geng et al 2021a ou et al 2012 tian et al 2017b overall the variations in both sewage discharge and hydrological regimes induced by human activities eventually affect the water nutrients and thus phytoplankton dynamics in lakes at the same time climate change may increase the diffuse nutrient loads from the catchment by increasing water temperature intensifying storms and affecting rainfall patterns which may have cascading effects on phytoplankton dynamics jeppesen et al 2010 moss et al 2011 global warming has been widely recognized as an important catalyst for phytoplankton blooms paerl and huisman 2008 2009 a higher water temperature as well as longer duration of warming can directly promote the growth of cyanobacteria through outcompeting other algae leading to harmful algal blooms gobler 2020 in addition warmer water enhances the vertical stratification of lakes decreases the viscosity of water and lower summer wind speed that restricts water mixing which indirectly benefits the formation of phytoplankton blooms deng et al 2018 jeppesen et al 2010 likewise temporal changes in precipitation patterns not only cause modifications in agricultural land use and management but also affect the magnitude of nutrient transportation in the runoff within the same watershed into lakes jeppesen et al 2009 sinha and michalak 2016 increased regional precipitation will potentially enhance nutrient loading and thus promote phytoplankton growth sinha et al 2017 however increased precipitation may also lead to an increase in water level and strengthens the dilution effect of water on nutrients it may also bring in suspended particles thereby reducing water transparency and thus the growth potential of phytoplankton richardson et al 2019 weyhenmeyer et al 2004 therefore global climate change may influence the phytoplankton via multiple pathways altering the water temperature rainfall patterns and hydrology in the lake catchment lake dongting is the second largest freshwater lake in china and has a drainage area of 2 572 105 km2 mainly consisting of agricultural land yang et al 2020b due to a rapid increase of anthropogenic activities e g intensive agriculture excessive fertilizer application in the catchment the environmental state of the lake has deteriorated and nutrient concentrations have risen to high levels leading to increased phytoplankton abundance geng et al 2021a 2021b tian et al 2017b yu et al 2018 in addition the lake is connected to yangtze river through three inlets songzi hudu and ouchi rivers and is fed by four tributaries xiang zi yuan and li rivers yang et al 2020b therefore the phytoplankton community is not only affected by the combined influence of hydrological controls of yangtze river outer basin and the upper reaches of local lake basin but also by the human activities and meteorology around the lake geng et al 2021b tian et al 2017b most studies of lake dongting have focused on the effects of the three george dam tgd on the hydrological regime and thus water nutrient contents for example lake dongting have experienced sharply reduced water and sediment discharges from yangtze river after the operation of tgd 2013 which has important consequences for the phytoplankton tian et al 2017a 2017b zhou et al 2016 the lake is located at the middle reach of yangtze river in eastern china where the climate is strongly influenced by the el niño southern oscillation event enso ronghui and yifang 1989 tong et al 2006 previous studies have indicated that warmer summer and stronger autumn precipitation in the catchment will occur during el niño events and vice versa during la nina events wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 these meteorological changes induced by global climate oscillation i e enso might also have compounding effects on the phytoplankton arhonditsis et al 2004 gerten and adrian 2002 radenac et al 2012 xiao et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 in this regard the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are influenced by multiple drivers and how to map the casual connections between phytoplankton and human activities as well as global climate oscillation warrants further exploration in this study we used a long term dataset on lake dongting to evaluate the annual trends 1988 2018 in phytoplankton abundance and relate it to five groups of variables characterizing human activities global climate oscillation water nutrients concentrations hydrology and meteorology we were also interested in assessing the differences of these variables between the distinct periods of enso and the operation of tgd pre tgd 1988 2003 post tgd 2004 2018 using a generalized multi level path model a main technique used in the current study for detecting direct indirect positive and negative effects among multiple variables we focused on revealing direct and indirect effects of human activities and global climate oscillation on the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton abundance and estimating the relative importance of different groups of variables in controlling the phytoplankton in lake dongting 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection to conduct our analysis we assembled four groups of data including variables of phytoplankton nutrients hydrology and meteorology in lake dongting 28 42 29 32 n 112 06 113 09 e fig a 1 one group representing human activities around the lake and one characterizing the global climate oscillation the raw data 1988 2018 were mainly compiled from published literature and governmental publications annual means of lake average phytoplankton abundance group 1 across 17 sampling sites see fig 1 in tian et al 2017b was extracted from literature by digitizing graphs using the get data graph digitizer version 2 24 russian federation tian et al 2017b wang et al 2020 as the data of chlorophyll a concentration was limited and no data for phytoplankton biomass was available behrenfeld and boss 2006 we used phytoplankton abundance as proxy of phytoplankton biomass this was justified by a significantly positive relationship between phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a concentration for more than 20 sampling years fig a 2 water nutrient variables group 2 included annual means of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn gathered from the china national environmental monitoring center http www cnemc cn and the hydrology and water resources survey bureau of hunan province http www hnwr gov cn hydrological variables group 3 included annual water discharge wd and annual suspended sediment discharge sd of the four tributaries ft and three inlets ti and net sediment deposition nsd within lake and were collected from the yangtze river sediment bulletin and hydrological bureau of the yangtze river conservancy commission we summed wd and sd for ft and ti respectively nsd was calculated as the total sediment discharge from ft and ti into the lake subtracted by the sediment discharge from chenglingji station outlet into the yangze river the meteorological variables group 4 including air temperature and precipitation were daily data from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn we used two proxy indices to reflect the intra annual changes in air temperature 1 number of summer days su being the annual count of days when daily maximum temperature is higher than 25 c 2 warm speed duration index wsdi being the annual count of days with at least 6 consecutive days where the daily maximum temperature is higher than the 90th percentile i e the calendar day 90th percentile centered on a 5 day window for the base period 1961 1990 in addition we chose three proxy indices to reflect changes in precipitation http etccdi pacificclimate org list 27 indices 1 annual precipitation 2 number of rainstorm days r50 mm being the annual count of days when daily precipitation is higher than 50 mm and the 3 simple precipitation intensity index sdii calculated as s d i i j w 1 w r r w j w where rrwjis the daily precipitation amount on wet days w rr 1 mm in period j and wrepresents the number of wet days in period j the variables referring human activities group 5 around the lake were obtained from the hunan statistical yearbook 1989 2019 as the major part of the drainage area of lake dongting is located in hunan province china we used two proxy indices to reflect human activities 1 urbanization upop calculated as the ratio of urban population to total population for each year in hunan province 2 annual fertilizer application fa in hunan province in the study we used yearly anomalies of el niño southern oscillation events ensoi group 6 as a proxy of the global climatic oscillation ensoi for the same time period 1988 2018 was obtained from the website of national weather service https www weather gov ensoi was calculated using the following procedure first data on sea surface temperature anomalies in the niño 3 4 region 5 n 5 s 120 170 w of the eastern and central equatorial pacific ocean were collected based on the 1981 2010 base period followed by averaging over the 5 month period from october to february for each year 2 2 statistical analysis before analysis fig a 3 all data were tested for homogeneity of variance by levene s tests and for normality by the shapiro wilk test with log or square root transformations if necessary firstly we assessed the significance of annual trends for the each tested variable by regressing the annual mean values versus year using generalized least square gls models with temporal autoregressive error structures i e corarma function secondly we tested whether the six group variables differed between the distinct periods of enso and the operation of three gorges dam tgd occurred we partitioned the studied period 1988 2018 into two periods according to the operation of tgd pre tgd 1988 2003 post tgd 2004 2018 and in three periods relative to the yearly anomalies of enso event el niño ei ensoi 0 5 la niña la ensoi 0 5 and normal no neither el niño nor la niña event occurred then we used generalized least square gls models with temporal autoregressive error structures i e corarma function to estimate the effects of ensoi and tgd on the six groups of tested variables to evaluate if enso events as well as the other tested variables are directly associated with phytoplankton abundance we applied cross correlation function ccf analyses chatfeild and xing 2019 considering ensoi as the time series of influence and the time series of tested variables as the affected time series probst et al 2012 ccfs were performed for each pair of variables with two periods of the operation of tgd pre tgd 1988 2003 post tgd 2004 2018 to evaluate the possible influence of tgd on the above tested associations for each ccf we assume that the variables of enso event nutrients hydrology meteorology and human activity leads phytoplankton dynamics as the opposite was ecologically impossible therefore only the left side of the ccfs graphical results was interpreted which represents positive time lags of the affected time series relative to the influence time series the higher peak value r in the left side of ccf indicates higher correlation that can be interpreted as higher sensitivity e g phytoplankton abundance is more sensitivity in pre tgd than in post tgd while the lag of this ccf peak indicates responsiveness lastly we applied generalized multilevel path models gmpm to test multivariate relationships among the six groups of variables involving phytoplankton nutrients hydrology meteorology human activity and global climate oscillation shipley 2009 gmpms were fitted according to a d sep approach as proposed by shipley 2009 which is based on an acyclic graph that describes the hypothetical multi variate relationships and independence claims between variables this approach was preferred to standard sem with latent variables because it is capable of including non normal data and temporal and spatial dependence error structures between variables as well as small sample sizes which occur widely in ecological datasets shipley 2009 besides allowing us to consider random effects another benefit of generalized multilevel path models is that they offer a flexible way to take into account nonlinear relationships among variables shipley 2009 we tested the validity of a generalized multilevel causal path model according to the following steps shipley 2009 1 finding the basis set bu of independence claims as indicated by a directed acyclic causal graph i e a box and arrow causal diagram that involves no feedback loops and bu expresses the full set of dependence and independence claims implied by the causal graph 2 obtaining the probability pi associated with each of the k independence claims in bu using appropriate statistical tests i e generalized linear models with temporal autoregressive error structures in our case 3 combining the pi using c 2 i 1 k ln p i and 4 comparing the c statistic to a chi square χ2 distribution with 2k degrees of freedom shipley 2009 we performed the gmpms and generated the causal network with all component models using the piecewisesem package in r lefcheck 2016 our models included several key paths 1 ensoi influencing variables of hydrology and meteorology 2 urbanization affecting fertilizer application and water nutrients concentrations i e tn and tp 3 meteorological variables impacting hydrology water nutrients concentrations and phytoplankton 4 hydrological variables influencing water nutrients concentrations and phytoplankton and 5 water nutrients concentrations affecting phytoplankton all variables were linearly de trended before the gmpms to avoid spurious correlations originating from the presence of temporal trends for each component model of the gmpms we applied gls models with temporal autoregressive error structures i e corarma function to examine separately each hypothesized path further the variance inflation factors vif of all tested variables were 5 1 indicating that there was no problem of collinearity among the predictor variables as the directions of the tp and tn paths were not hypothesized we included an additional correlation between tp and tn in the gmpms and a significant correlation was in fact observed between tp and tn we used shipley s test of directional separation to estimate the goodness of fit for each path model shipley 2009 a chi squared test of fisher s c statistic to test the significance p 0 05 of the path models shipley 2013 and the aicc procedure to select the best model shipley 2013 notably the interaction terms were excluded according to the aicc procedure we determined the coefficient of determination r 2 for each model component to assess the variance explained across the set of models in the gmpms we used standardized path coefficients to present the direct indirect and total effects of the predictors grace and bollen 2005 the strength of direct effects was defined as the standardized path coefficient which is a unitless measure of association and thus can be compared for the same relationship in different models and for different relationships within and among models standardized coefficients are also useful for computing indirect effects the strength of indirect effects can be calculated by multiplying the standardized path coefficients along the path for example we computed the indirect pathway from ensoi to annual precipitation to tp to phytoplankton abundance by multiplying the path coefficients the strength of total effects was calculated as the sum of direct and indirect effects all statistical tests were performed using r version 3 51 software team r c r development core team 2013 3 results for the annual trends as the mann kendall test had similar results with the generalized least square models with temporal autoregressive error structures table a 1 we only showed the latter one we found a significant increase in phytoplankton abundance urbanization total nitrogen fertilizer application number of summer days and the warm speed duration index and a significant decrease in the water discharge of three inlets and the sediment discharge of three inlets and four tributaries and the net sediment deposition fig a 4 table 1 however no significant annual trends were observed for the other tested variables fig a 4 table 1 we found significant effects of the operation of tgd on seven tested variables with higher number of summer days and lower water and sediment discharge of three inlets sediment discharge of four tributaries and net sediment deposition in pre tgd than in post tgd fig a 5 table 2 in addition the operation of tgd also had a marginal effect on warm speed duration index which showed higher value during post tgd fig a 5 table 2 the sediment discharge of four tributaries was significant higher during el niño events than during la niña events and normal periods fig a 5 table 2 the ccf analyses suggest that the correlation of phytoplankton abundance and the five groups of variables was much difference between the two periods of the operation of tgd figs a 6 s7 and s8 table 3 a significantly positive and higher correlation value between phytoplankton abundance and ensoi was found during post tgd similar patterns were also observed for annual precipitation the simple precipitation intensity index r50mm and the water discharge of four tributaries while a significantly higher and negative association with phytoplankton abundance was observed for the net sediment deposition the correlation values between phytoplankton abundance and total phosphorus total nitrogen fertilizer application urbanization and the sediment discharge of four tributaries were significant and higher during pre tgd and became lower and even non significant during post tgd the ccf between phytoplankton abundance and the tested variables usually showed the modest correlation value when compared with complete time series the number of summer days the warm speed duration index the water and sediment discharge of three inlets did not present marked associations with phytoplankton abundance across the study period linking the phytoplankton abundance to five group variables of water nutrients concentrations hydrology meteorology human activity and global climatic oscillation the stepwise aicc model selection processes

discharge of three inlets and net sediment deposition fig 1 table 4 the water discharge of four tributaries had indirect effects on phytoplankton abundance via changes in total nitrogen fig 1 table 4 the water discharge of three inlets also had indirect effects on phytoplankton abundance via changes in the sediment discharge of four tributaries and the net sediment deposition fig 1 table 4

and ensoi 1 9 overall total phosphorus total nitrogen the water discharge of four tributaries fertilizer application urbanization the number of summer days r50mm the simple precipitation intensity index and the warm speed duration index promoted phytoplankton abundance fig 3 table 4 while the water and sediment discharge of three inlets the net sediment deposition and ensoi reduced phytoplankton abundance figs 2 and 3 table 4 4 discussion human activities and global climate changes are two major challenges for lake managers worldwide excessive nutrient inputs induced by anthropogenic activities cause continued eutrophication which is exacerbated by meteorological extremes e g warming rainfall correlated with global climate oscillations with subsequent combined effects on phytoplankton dynamics using a long term monitoring dataset on lake dongting a multivariate casual chain among phytoplankton human activities global climate change via alterations of hydrology meteorology and water nutrients was mapped and discussed within an integrative framework here we found that water nutrients concentrations hydrology and meteorology play an important role in modifying the cascading effects of human activities and the global climate oscillation on phytoplankton abundance the lake dongting basin is characterized by agricultural land use and has accounted for a large proportion of china s agricultural production since the 1960s tian et al 2017b during the past three decades the amount of chemical fertilizer applied on agricultural land increased by 193 with a correspondingly increasing gdp of agriculture of 3096 fig s4 additionally the total population around the lake increased by 1 24 times during the last three decades while the ratio of urban population has increased by 1 95 times since 1988 suggesting a significant urbanization fig s4 our results demonstrated that the tn and tp effects on phytoplankton became more positive with increased fertilizer application which was further found to be strongly and positively associated with population urbanization previous studies have indicated that the use efficiency of chemical fertilizer decreased gradually over a number of years resulting in significant accumulation of chemical fertilizer in the soil tian et al 2017b notably the application of n fertilizer markedly exceeds that of p and k fertilizer and the leaching loss of n fertilizer from the agricultural soil to the lake was as high as 68 in 2014 gu et al 2017 tian et al 2017b this might explain the negative association between tp and tn as the lake ecosystem would become more p limited with increasingly high n p fertilizer application forming part of the external nutrient load furthermore the rapid development of municipal wastewater collection and treatment has led to a remarkable increase in the construction of wastewater treatment plants e g 5 in 1980s and 172 in 2017 tong et al 2020 however the higher removal efficiency of tp compared with tn has led to continuously increasing tn tp mass ratios in the total municipal wastewater discharge in the most populated region of china including lake dongting basin tong et al 2020 therefore the tn mediated effects on phytoplankton might be counterbalanced by the tp mediated effects likely contributing to a low variation of phytoplankton explained by elevated nutrient concentrations in the lake water in addition to the pathways via altering water nutrients population urbanization can also affect phytoplankton abundance through a reduction of the net sediment deposition in the lake in the lake dongting basin continued afforestation as well as increased dam construction at upstream are responsible for the reduced sediment discharge of the tributaries while anthropogenic activities e g aquaculture fishing irrigation have greatly disrupted the connection between the three river networks thus potentially decreasing the sediment discharge from the three inlets and four tributaries into the lake geng et al 2021b yuan et al 2015 furthermore population urbanization combined with other variables explains only 60 of the net sediment deposition 50 of the sediment and water discharge of three inlets while the remaining variations can largely be attributed to the operation of the tgd in the yangtze river since 2003 geng et al 2021a the sharply reduced sediment discharge of the three inlets and thus net sediment deposition has increased the water transparency and combined with the reduction in discharge and thus lower flow velocity have promoted the phytoplankton growth especially during summer on the other hand increasing sediment discharge and net sediment deposition could to a large extent trap the particular p and store in the lake sediments thereby reducing tp levels in the water actually the sediment discharges of three inlets showed similar decreasing trends as those of four tributaries especially after the operation of tgd also revealing a strong negative association with tp according to the ccf analysis the mitigating effects of net sediment deposition on phytoplankton abundance were more pronounced during post tgd this is largely due to the fact that the net sediment deposition decreased greatly after the operation of tgd and changed from positive deposition to negative i e net scour on the lake sediment which might transfer nutrients from sediment to water and thus stimulate the phytoplankton growth likely the observed stronger effect of the water discharge of four tributaries on phytoplankton abundance during post tgd could be attributed to the increased proportions of water discharge and thus water nutrients from the upriver into the lake as the water discharge of the three inlets decreased greatly after the operation of tgd moreover the enhanced effects on phytoplankton during post tgd were also found for enso events rainfall patterns annual precipitation simple precipitation intensity index and r50mm while the operation of tgd had strongly weakened temporal association ccf s r between water nutrients tn and tn human activities fertilizer application and urbanization and phytoplankton abundance this suggests that the operation of tgd not only alter the hydrological regime of the lake but also the association of phytoplankton with water nutrients hydrology meteorology human activities and global climate oscillation our study also found significantly higher fertilizer application and number of summer days as well as a marginally higher warm speed duration index during post tgd than during pre tgd this suggests that human activities as well as meteorology in the catchment had clear temporal trends which could be independent of the tgd although the operation of the tgd might have potentially cascading influences on phytoplankton through changes in hydrology and nutrients our results highlight the key role of human activities and global climate oscillation we found a cascade triggered by urbanization together with fertilizer application increased the nutrient levels and mitigate the water and sediment discharge that ultimately promoted the higher phytoplankton abundance interestingly while no significant annual trends were found for ensoi significant connection between ensoi and phytoplankton was detected although this relationship is rather complicated and weak direct negative effects of ensoi on the annual trends of phytoplankton abundance were probably due to the distinct periodicity between the time series while a positive relationship and synchronization are reported between phytoplankton and climate oscillation i e pdo nao etc for relatively short time periods 5 8 months bands gerten and adrian 2002 xiao et al 2019 our study suggests that phytoplankton abundance as well as tp tended to be higher when ensoi was lower e g during la niña events with negative values with a potential periodic variation with global climate oscillation besides ensoi had an indirect cascading effect on phytoplankton abundance through either positive or negative multiple pathways increased ensoi led to elevated rainfall extremes r50 mm and long duration of warmth warm speed duration index the latter resulting in a marginally higher number of summer days and precipitation intensity this supports the idea that enso had an important influence on meteorological variables including temperature and rainfall patterns in the subtropical regions both ensoi and rainfall extremes increased the water discharge of the four tributaries xiang zi yuan and li together with excessive fertilizer application increasing the nutrient runoff from the catchment and ultimately promoting phytoplankton abundance this is supported by previous studies of lake dongting indicating that nutrient levels were strongly controlled by the four tributaries especially yuanjiang rather than by the three inlets from yangtze river tian et al 2017a 2017b in contrast to ensoi and rainfall extremes we found a significant increase in the number of summer days 25 c as well as in warm duration both of which in turn contributed to enhanced water tp higher temperatures may stimulate the summer stratification and thereby increase the duration of stratification of the lake resulting in oxygen depletion below the thermocline and thus internal p release from the sediment ballard et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2009 2010 on the other hand rainfall extremes may accelerate external p and n leaching from the agricultural land bowles et al 2018 sinha and michalak 2016 however the number of summer days had a significant negative association with water tn probably reflecting that a warmer climate enhances denitrification and the coupled nitrification denitrification and thus n emissions from the water veraart et al 2011 therefore the overall effects of enso on phytoplankton are highly complex with both direct and indirect pathways involving meteorology hydrology and nutrients two potential caveats should be addressed 1 the presented casual map did not include the lake trophic networks such as the effect of zooplankton and herbivorous fishes top down on the dynamics of the phytoplankton as we did not have assessed to such data numerous studies have highlighted the top down control of phytoplankton e g benndorf 1987 1995 jeppesen et al 1997 carpenter et al 1996 liu et al 2018 deng et al 2016 however in lake dongting the fish stock increased from 1990 to 1996 followed by a sharp decline with no obvious effect on phytoplankton abundance fig a 9 it is also well known that zooplankton grazing is relatively low in eutrophic sub tropical lakes due to overall high fish predation pressure on zooplankton jeppesen et al 2020 moreover due to the high flushing rates large amount of sediment discharges from three inlets and four tributaries as well as human activities of sand extraction in lake dongting might further reduce the zooplankton grazing efficiency on phytoplankton reynolds 1994 jeppesen et al 1997 liu et al 2019 finally our final accepted model explained a high proportion 91 of variation on phytoplankton dynamics even if it lacks the effects of trophic networks indicating that the key factors are included directly or indirectly with the selected variables 2 we used yearly scale rather than seasonal scale as seasonal data of the variables included especially for phytoplankton abundance were limited as the mechanisms driving seasonal dynamic of phytoplankton might be very different than when the analysis is based on yearly data benndorf et al 2002 further studies should discern the cascading effects of human activities and global climatic oscillation on phytoplankton at different temporal scales overall our results were robust in predicting phytoplankton abundance at annual scale 5 conclusion our results provide strong evidence of a strong connection between human activities the global climate oscillation enso and phytoplankton which is mediated by meteorology hydrology and nutrient levels furthermore we identified a robust casual chain and mapped how the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are driven by multiple factors although the mitigation measures to reduce the nutrient input and enhance the use efficiency of chemical fertilizers around the lake have been taken since 2003s ma et al 2020 the climate warming and rainfall extremes associated with the global climate oscillation might in part offset this reduction in nutrient levels thus promoting phytoplankton abundance our findings indicate that policies aimed at managing phytoplankton blooms must be employed to reduce the impact of human activities and climate changes on nutrient loading

16457,human activities and climate change are two major stressors affecting lake ecosystems as well as phytoplankton communities worldwide however how the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are

hydrology 25 3 human activities 24 water nutrients 10 5 and ensoi 1 9 our results highlight a strongly causal connection between human activities as well as global climate change and phytoplankton and the benefits of considering multiple environmental drivers in determining the temporal dynamics of lake biotic communities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords el niño southern oscillation eutrophication water nutrients hydrology meteorology 1 introduction phytoplankton is one of the major primary producers in freshwater lake ecosystem and is affected by a variety of drivers from local to global scales arhonditsis et al 2004 carpenter et al 1996 winder and sommer 2012 fu et al 2020 such as water nutrients hydrology metrology fertilizer application urbanization precipitation and climate changes gerten and adrian 2002 goldman et al 1989 monchamp et al 2018 straile 2000 zhang et al 2018 a rapid increase in phytoplankton abundance i e algal blooms occurs when lakes receives excessive inputs of nitrogen n and phosphorus p which results in significant lake degradation huisman et al 2018 consequently a number of mitigation measures are taken to improve the water qualities of lakes and thus control phytoplankton blooms by reducing nutrient inputs paerl and otten 2013 however phytoplankton responses to the reduction of external nutrients differs among lakes influenced also by other environmental changes induced by human activities e g dams agriculture urbanization and climate changes anneville et al 2019 2005 arhonditsis et al 2004 elser et al 2007 jeppesen et al 2002 2007 2005 human activities have markedly accelerated runoff of n and p across watersheds through increased fertilizer application for agricultural intensification and increasing urbanization due to a growing population and the resulting excessive nutrient input is discharged as sewage into lake ecosystems bowles et al 2018 jeppesen et al 2009 2011 withers et al 2014 yang et al 2020a additionally the amount of sewages input and thus water nutrients to lakes are influenced by the hydrological conditions e g water discharge suspended sediment discharge water level and flow velocity andersen et al 2006 especially in river connected floodplain lakes geng et al 2021b tian et al 2017a moreover the hydrological regimes of lakes may be greatly altered by hydroelectric upstream dams creating changes in water transparency water residence time and flow velocity geng et al 2021a ou et al 2012 tian et al 2017b overall the variations in both sewage discharge and hydrological regimes induced by human activities eventually affect the water nutrients and thus phytoplankton dynamics in lakes at the same time climate change may increase the diffuse nutrient loads from the catchment by increasing water temperature intensifying storms and affecting rainfall patterns which may have cascading effects on phytoplankton dynamics jeppesen et al 2010 moss et al 2011 global warming has been widely recognized as an important catalyst for phytoplankton blooms paerl and huisman 2008 2009 a higher water temperature as well as longer duration of warming can directly promote the growth of cyanobacteria through outcompeting other algae leading to harmful algal blooms gobler 2020 in addition warmer water enhances the vertical stratification of lakes decreases the viscosity of water and lower summer wind speed that restricts water mixing which indirectly benefits the formation of phytoplankton blooms deng et al 2018 jeppesen et al 2010 likewise temporal changes in precipitation patterns not only cause modifications in agricultural land use and management but also affect the magnitude of nutrient transportation in the runoff within the same watershed into lakes jeppesen et al 2009 sinha and michalak 2016 increased regional precipitation will potentially enhance nutrient loading and thus promote phytoplankton growth sinha et al 2017 however increased precipitation may also lead to an increase in water level and strengthens the dilution effect of water on nutrients it may also bring in suspended particles thereby reducing water transparency and thus the growth potential of phytoplankton richardson et al 2019 weyhenmeyer et al 2004 therefore global climate change may influence the phytoplankton via multiple pathways altering the water temperature rainfall patterns and hydrology in the lake catchment lake dongting is the second largest freshwater lake in china and has a drainage area of 2 572 105 km2 mainly consisting of agricultural land yang et al 2020b due to a rapid increase of anthropogenic activities e g intensive agriculture excessive fertilizer application in the catchment the environmental state of the lake has deteriorated and nutrient concentrations have risen to high levels leading to increased phytoplankton abundance geng et al 2021a 2021b tian et al 2017b yu et al 2018 in addition the lake is connected to yangtze river through three inlets songzi hudu and ouchi rivers and is fed by four tributaries xiang zi yuan and li rivers yang et al 2020b therefore the phytoplankton community is not only affected by the combined influence of hydrological controls of yangtze river outer basin and the upper reaches of local lake basin but also by the human activities and meteorology around the lake geng et al 2021b tian et al 2017b most studies of lake dongting have focused on the effects of the three george dam tgd on the hydrological regime and thus water nutrient contents for example lake dongting have experienced sharply reduced water and sediment discharges from yangtze river after the operation of tgd 2013 which has important consequences for the phytoplankton tian et al 2017a 2017b zhou et al 2016 the lake is located at the middle reach of yangtze river in eastern china where the climate is strongly influenced by the el niño southern oscillation event enso ronghui and yifang 1989 tong et al 2006 previous studies have indicated that warmer summer and stronger autumn precipitation in the catchment will occur during el niño events and vice versa during la nina events wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2007 these meteorological changes induced by global climate oscillation i e enso might also have compounding effects on the phytoplankton arhonditsis et al 2004 gerten and adrian 2002 radenac et al 2012 xiao et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 in this regard the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are influenced by multiple drivers and how to map the casual connections between phytoplankton and human activities as well as global climate oscillation warrants further exploration in this study we used a long term dataset on lake dongting to evaluate the annual trends 1988 2018 in phytoplankton abundance and relate it to five groups of variables characterizing human activities global climate oscillation water nutrients concentrations hydrology and meteorology we were also interested in assessing the differences of these variables between the distinct periods of enso and the operation of tgd pre tgd 1988 2003 post tgd 2004 2018 using a generalized multi level path model a main technique used in the current study for detecting direct indirect positive and negative effects among multiple variables we focused on revealing direct and indirect effects of human activities and global climate oscillation on the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton abundance and estimating the relative importance of different groups of variables in controlling the phytoplankton in lake dongting 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection to conduct our analysis we assembled four groups of data including variables of phytoplankton nutrients hydrology and meteorology in lake dongting 28 42 29 32 n 112 06 113 09 e fig a 1 one group representing human activities around the lake and one characterizing the global climate oscillation the raw data 1988 2018 were mainly compiled from published literature and governmental publications annual means of lake average phytoplankton abundance group 1 across 17 sampling sites see fig 1 in tian et al 2017b was extracted from literature by digitizing graphs using the get data graph digitizer version 2 24 russian federation tian et al 2017b wang et al 2020 as the data of chlorophyll a concentration was limited and no data for phytoplankton biomass was available behrenfeld and boss 2006 we used phytoplankton abundance as proxy of phytoplankton biomass this was justified by a significantly positive relationship between phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a concentration for more than 20 sampling years fig a 2 water nutrient variables group 2 included annual means of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn gathered from the china national environmental monitoring center http www cnemc cn and the hydrology and water resources survey bureau of hunan province http www hnwr gov cn hydrological variables group 3 included annual water discharge wd and annual suspended sediment discharge sd of the four tributaries ft and three inlets ti and net sediment deposition nsd within lake and were collected from the yangtze river sediment bulletin and hydrological bureau of the yangtze river conservancy commission we summed wd and sd for ft and ti respectively nsd was calculated as the total sediment discharge from ft and ti into the lake subtracted by the sediment discharge from chenglingji station outlet into the yangze river the meteorological variables group 4 including air temperature and precipitation were daily data from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn we used two proxy indices to reflect the intra annual changes in air temperature 1 number of summer days su being the annual count of days when daily maximum temperature is higher than 25 c 2 warm speed duration index wsdi being the annual count of days with at least 6 consecutive days where the daily maximum temperature is higher than the 90th percentile i e the calendar day 90th percentile centered on a 5 day window for the base period 1961 1990 in addition we chose three proxy indices to reflect changes in precipitation http etccdi pacificclimate org list 27 indices 1 annual precipitation 2 number of rainstorm days r50 mm being the annual count of days when daily precipitation is higher than 50 mm and the 3 simple precipitation intensity index sdii calculated as s d i i j w 1 w r r w j w where rrwjis the daily precipitation amount on wet days w rr 1 mm in period j and wrepresents the number of wet days in period j the variables referring human activities group 5 around the lake were obtained from the hunan statistical yearbook 1989 2019 as the major part of the drainage area of lake dongting is located in hunan province china we used two proxy indices to reflect human activities 1 urbanization upop calculated as the ratio of urban population to total population for each year in hunan province 2 annual fertilizer application fa in hunan province in the study we used yearly anomalies of el niño southern oscillation events ensoi group 6 as a proxy of the global climatic oscillation ensoi for the same time period 1988 2018 was obtained from the website of national weather service https www weather gov ensoi was calculated using the following procedure first data on sea surface temperature anomalies in the niño 3 4 region 5 n 5 s 120 170 w of the eastern and central equatorial pacific ocean were collected based on the 1981 2010 base period followed by averaging over the 5 month period from october to february for each year 2 2 statistical analysis before analysis fig a 3 all data were tested for homogeneity of variance by levene s tests and for normality by the shapiro wilk test with log or square root transformations if necessary firstly we assessed the significance of annual trends for the each tested variable by regressing the annual mean values versus year using generalized least square gls models with temporal autoregressive error structures i e corarma function secondly we tested whether the six group variables differed between the distinct periods of enso and the operation of three gorges dam tgd occurred we partitioned the studied period 1988 2018 into two periods according to the operation of tgd pre tgd 1988 2003 post tgd 2004 2018 and in three periods relative to the yearly anomalies of enso event el niño ei ensoi 0 5 la niña la ensoi 0 5 and normal no neither el niño nor la niña event occurred then we used generalized least square gls models with temporal autoregressive error structures i e corarma function to estimate the effects of ensoi and tgd on the six groups of tested variables to evaluate if enso events as well as the other tested variables are directly associated with phytoplankton abundance we applied cross correlation function ccf analyses chatfeild and xing 2019 considering ensoi as the time series of influence and the time series of tested variables as the affected time series probst et al 2012 ccfs were performed for each pair of variables with two periods of the operation of tgd pre tgd 1988 2003 post tgd 2004 2018 to evaluate the possible influence of tgd on the above tested associations for each ccf we assume that the variables of enso event nutrients hydrology meteorology and human activity leads phytoplankton dynamics as the opposite was ecologically impossible therefore only the left side of the ccfs graphical results was interpreted which represents positive time lags of the affected time series relative to the influence time series the higher peak value r in the left side of ccf indicates higher correlation that can be interpreted as higher sensitivity e g phytoplankton abundance is more sensitivity in pre tgd than in post tgd while the lag of this ccf peak indicates responsiveness lastly we applied generalized multilevel path models gmpm to test multivariate relationships among the six groups of variables involving phytoplankton nutrients hydrology meteorology human activity and global climate oscillation shipley 2009 gmpms were fitted according to a d sep approach as proposed by shipley 2009 which is based on an acyclic graph that describes the hypothetical multi variate relationships and independence claims between variables this approach was preferred to standard sem with latent variables because it is capable of including non normal data and temporal and spatial dependence error structures between variables as well as small sample sizes which occur widely in ecological datasets shipley 2009 besides allowing us to consider random effects another benefit of generalized multilevel path models is that they offer a flexible way to take into account nonlinear relationships among variables shipley 2009 we tested the validity of a generalized multilevel causal path model according to the following steps shipley 2009 1 finding the basis set bu of independence claims as indicated by a directed acyclic causal graph i e a box and arrow causal diagram that involves no feedback loops and bu expresses the full set of dependence and independence claims implied by the causal graph 2 obtaining the probability pi associated with each of the k independence claims in bu using appropriate statistical tests i e generalized linear models with temporal autoregressive error structures in our case 3 combining the pi using c 2 i 1 k ln p i and 4 comparing the c statistic to a chi square χ2 distribution with 2k degrees of freedom shipley 2009 we performed the gmpms and generated the causal network with all component models using the piecewisesem package in r lefcheck 2016 our models included several key paths 1 ensoi influencing variables of hydrology and meteorology 2 urbanization affecting fertilizer application and water nutrients concentrations i e tn and tp 3 meteorological variables impacting hydrology water nutrients concentrations and phytoplankton 4 hydrological variables influencing water nutrients concentrations and phytoplankton and 5 water nutrients concentrations affecting phytoplankton all variables were linearly de trended before the gmpms to avoid spurious correlations originating from the presence of temporal trends for each component model of the gmpms we applied gls models with temporal autoregressive error structures i e corarma function to examine separately each hypothesized path further the variance inflation factors vif of all tested variables were 5 1 indicating that there was no problem of collinearity among the predictor variables as the directions of the tp and tn paths were not hypothesized we included an additional correlation between tp and tn in the gmpms and a significant correlation was in fact observed between tp and tn we used shipley s test of directional separation to estimate the goodness of fit for each path model shipley 2009 a chi squared test of fisher s c statistic to test the significance p 0 05 of the path models shipley 2013 and the aicc procedure to select the best model shipley 2013 notably the interaction terms were excluded according to the aicc procedure we determined the coefficient of determination r 2 for each model component to assess the variance explained across the set of models in the gmpms we used standardized path coefficients to present the direct indirect and total effects of the predictors grace and bollen 2005 the strength of direct effects was defined as the standardized path coefficient which is a unitless measure of association and thus can be compared for the same relationship in different models and for different relationships within and among models standardized coefficients are also useful for computing indirect effects the strength of indirect effects can be calculated by multiplying the standardized path coefficients along the path for example we computed the indirect pathway from ensoi to annual precipitation to tp to phytoplankton abundance by multiplying the path coefficients the strength of total effects was calculated as the sum of direct and indirect effects all statistical tests were performed using r version 3 51 software team r c r development core team 2013 3 results for the annual trends as the mann kendall test had similar results with the generalized least square models with temporal autoregressive error structures table a 1 we only showed the latter one we found a significant increase in phytoplankton abundance urbanization total nitrogen fertilizer application number of summer days and the warm speed duration index and a significant decrease in the water discharge of three inlets and the sediment discharge of three inlets and four tributaries and the net sediment deposition fig a 4 table 1 however no significant annual trends were observed for the other tested variables fig a 4 table 1 we found significant effects of the operation of tgd on seven tested variables with higher number of summer days and lower water and sediment discharge of three inlets sediment discharge of four tributaries and net sediment deposition in pre tgd than in post tgd fig a 5 table 2 in addition the operation of tgd also had a marginal effect on warm speed duration index which showed higher value during post tgd fig a 5 table 2 the sediment discharge of four tributaries was significant higher during el niño events than during la niña events and normal periods fig a 5 table 2 the ccf analyses suggest that the correlation of phytoplankton abundance and the five groups of variables was much difference between the two periods of the operation of tgd figs a 6 s7 and s8 table 3 a significantly positive and higher correlation value between phytoplankton abundance and ensoi was found during post tgd similar patterns were also observed for annual precipitation the simple precipitation intensity index r50mm and the water discharge of four tributaries while a significantly higher and negative association with phytoplankton abundance was observed for the net sediment deposition the correlation values between phytoplankton abundance and total phosphorus total nitrogen fertilizer application urbanization and the sediment discharge of four tributaries were significant and higher during pre tgd and became lower and even non significant during post tgd the ccf between phytoplankton abundance and the tested variables usually showed the modest correlation value when compared with complete time series the number of summer days the warm speed duration index the water and sediment discharge of three inlets did not present marked associations with phytoplankton abundance across the study period linking the phytoplankton abundance to five group variables of water nutrients concentrations hydrology meteorology human activity and global climatic oscillation the stepwise aicc model selection processes yielded a final path model well supported by the data fig 1 χ2 113 16 d f 148 p 0 96 the accepted model explained 91 of the variation in phytoplankton abundance total phosphorus total nitrogen fertilizer application r50mm as well as the warm speed duration index had a direct and positive effect on phytoplankton abundance while a direct and negative effect was found for enso i the sediment discharge of three inlets and net sediment deposition fig 1 table 4 the water discharge of four tributaries had indirect effects on phytoplankton abundance via changes in total nitrogen fig 1 table 4 the water discharge of three inlets also had indirect effects on phytoplankton abundance via changes in the sediment discharge of four tributaries and the net sediment deposition fig 1 table 4

phytoplankton abundance indirectly via four pathways through changes in fertilizer application total nitrogen and the net sediment deposition fig 1 table 4 the simple precipitation intensity index controlled phytoplankton abundance indirectly through changes in total phosphorus and the net sediment deposition and r50mm also affected phytoplankton abundance indirectly through changes in total

it also had twelve indirect pathways via changes in hydrology and meteorology fig 1 table 4 among the five groups of variables table 4 meteorology i e the warm speed duration index the number of

index and the warm speed duration index promoted phytoplankton abundance fig 3 table 4 while the water and sediment discharge of three inlets the net sediment deposition and ensoi reduced phytoplankton abundance figs 2 and 3 table 4 4 discussion human activities and global climate changes are two major challenges for lake managers worldwide excessive nutrient inputs induced by anthropogenic activities cause continued eutrophication which is exacerbated by meteorological extremes e g warming rainfall correlated with global climate oscillations with subsequent combined effects on phytoplankton dynamics using a long term monitoring dataset on lake dongting a multivariate casual chain among phytoplankton human activities global climate change via alterations of hydrology meteorology and water nutrients was mapped and discussed within an integrative framework here we found that water nutrients concentrations hydrology and meteorology play an important role in modifying the cascading effects of human activities and the global climate oscillation on phytoplankton abundance the lake dongting basin is characterized by agricultural land use and has accounted for a large proportion of china s agricultural production since the 1960s tian et al 2017b during the past three decades the amount of chemical fertilizer applied on agricultural land increased by 193 with a correspondingly increasing gdp of agriculture of 3096 fig s4 additionally the total population around the lake increased by 1 24 times during the last three decades while the ratio of urban population has increased by 1 95 times since 1988 suggesting a significant urbanization fig s4 our results demonstrated that the tn and tp effects on phytoplankton became more positive with increased fertilizer application which was further found to be strongly and positively associated with population urbanization previous studies have indicated that the use efficiency of chemical fertilizer decreased gradually over a number of years resulting in significant accumulation of chemical fertilizer in the soil tian et al 2017b notably the application of n fertilizer markedly exceeds that of p and k fertilizer and the leaching loss of n fertilizer from the agricultural soil to the lake was as high as 68 in 2014 gu et al 2017 tian et al 2017b this might explain the negative association between tp and tn as the lake ecosystem would become more p limited with increasingly high n p fertilizer application forming part of the external nutrient load furthermore the rapid development of municipal wastewater collection and treatment has led to a remarkable increase in the construction of wastewater treatment plants e g 5 in 1980s and 172 in 2017 tong et al 2020 however the higher removal efficiency of tp compared with tn has led to continuously increasing tn tp mass ratios in the total municipal wastewater discharge in the most populated region of china including lake dongting basin tong et al 2020 therefore the tn mediated effects on phytoplankton might be counterbalanced by the tp mediated effects likely contributing to a low variation of phytoplankton explained by elevated nutrient concentrations in the lake water in addition to the pathways via altering water nutrients population urbanization can also affect phytoplankton abundance through a reduction of the net sediment deposition in the lake in the lake dongting basin continued afforestation as well as increased dam construction at upstream are responsible for the reduced sediment discharge of the tributaries while anthropogenic activities e g aquaculture fishing irrigation have greatly disrupted the connection between the three river networks thus potentially decreasing the sediment discharge from the three inlets and four tributaries into the lake geng et al 2021b yuan et al 2015 furthermore population urbanization combined with other variables explains only 60 of the net sediment deposition 50 of the sediment and water discharge of three inlets while the remaining variations can largely be attributed to the operation of the tgd in the yangtze river since 2003 geng et al 2021a the sharply reduced sediment discharge of the three inlets and thus net sediment deposition has increased the water transparency and combined with the reduction in discharge and thus lower flow velocity have promoted the phytoplankton growth especially during summer on the other hand increasing sediment discharge and net sediment deposition could to a large extent trap the particular p and store in the lake sediments thereby reducing tp levels in the water actually the sediment discharges of three inlets showed similar decreasing trends as those of four tributaries especially after the operation of tgd also revealing a strong negative association with tp according to the ccf analysis the mitigating effects of net sediment deposition on phytoplankton abundance were more pronounced during post tgd this is largely due to the fact that the net sediment deposition decreased greatly after the operation of tgd and changed from positive deposition to negative i e net scour on the lake sediment which might transfer nutrients from sediment to water and thus stimulate the phytoplankton growth likely the observed stronger effect of the water discharge of four tributaries on phytoplankton abundance during post tgd could be attributed to the increased proportions of water discharge and thus water nutrients from the upriver into the lake as the water discharge of the three inlets decreased greatly after the operation of tgd moreover the enhanced effects on phytoplankton during post tgd were also found for enso events rainfall patterns annual precipitation simple precipitation intensity index and r50mm while the operation of tgd had strongly weakened temporal association ccf s r between water nutrients tn and tn human activities fertilizer application and urbanization and phytoplankton abundance this suggests that the operation of tgd not only alter the hydrological regime of the lake but also the association of phytoplankton with water nutrients hydrology meteorology human activities and global climate oscillation our study also found significantly higher fertilizer application and number of summer days as well as a marginally higher warm speed duration index during post tgd than during pre tgd this suggests that human activities as well as meteorology in the catchment had clear temporal trends which could be independent of the tgd although the operation of the tgd might have potentially cascading influences on phytoplankton through changes in hydrology and nutrients our results highlight the key role of human activities and global climate oscillation we found a cascade triggered by urbanization together with fertilizer application increased the nutrient levels and mitigate the water and sediment discharge that ultimately promoted the higher phytoplankton abundance interestingly while no significant annual trends were found for ensoi significant connection between ensoi and phytoplankton was detected although this relationship is rather complicated and weak direct negative effects of ensoi on the annual trends of phytoplankton abundance were probably due to the distinct periodicity between the time series while a positive relationship and synchronization are reported between phytoplankton and climate oscillation i e pdo nao etc for relatively short time periods 5 8 months bands gerten and adrian 2002 xiao et al 2019 our study suggests that phytoplankton abundance as well as tp tended to be higher when ensoi was lower e g during la niña events with negative values with a potential periodic variation with global climate oscillation besides ensoi had an indirect cascading effect on phytoplankton abundance through either positive or negative multiple pathways increased ensoi led to elevated rainfall extremes r50 mm and long duration of warmth warm speed duration index the latter resulting in a marginally higher number of summer days and precipitation intensity this supports the idea that enso had an important influence on meteorological variables including temperature and rainfall patterns in the subtropical regions both ensoi and rainfall extremes increased the water discharge of the four tributaries xiang zi yuan and li together with excessive fertilizer application increasing the nutrient runoff from the catchment and ultimately promoting phytoplankton abundance this is supported by previous studies of lake dongting indicating that nutrient levels were strongly controlled by the four tributaries especially yuanjiang rather than by the three inlets from yangtze river tian et al 2017a 2017b in contrast to ensoi and rainfall extremes we found a significant increase in the number of summer days 25 c as well as in warm duration both of which in turn contributed to enhanced water tp higher temperatures may stimulate the summer stratification and thereby increase the duration of stratification of the lake resulting in oxygen depletion below the thermocline and thus internal p release from the sediment ballard et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2009 2010 on the other hand rainfall extremes may accelerate external p and n leaching from the agricultural land bowles et al 2018 sinha and michalak 2016 however the number of summer days had a significant negative association with water tn probably reflecting that a warmer climate enhances denitrification and the coupled nitrification denitrification and thus n emissions from the water veraart et al 2011 therefore the overall effects of enso on phytoplankton are highly complex with both direct and indirect pathways involving meteorology hydrology and nutrients two potential caveats should be addressed 1 the presented casual map did not include the lake trophic networks such as the effect of zooplankton and herbivorous fishes top down on the dynamics of the phytoplankton as we did not have assessed to such data numerous studies have highlighted the top down control of phytoplankton e g benndorf 1987 1995 jeppesen et al 1997 carpenter et al 1996 liu et al 2018 deng et al 2016 however in lake dongting the fish stock increased from 1990 to 1996 followed by a sharp decline with no obvious effect on phytoplankton abundance fig a 9 it is also well known that zooplankton grazing is relatively low in eutrophic sub tropical lakes due to overall high fish predation pressure on zooplankton jeppesen et al 2020 moreover due to the high flushing rates large amount of sediment discharges from three inlets and four tributaries as well as human activities of sand extraction in lake dongting might further reduce the zooplankton grazing efficiency on phytoplankton reynolds 1994 jeppesen et al 1997 liu et al 2019 finally our final accepted model explained a high proportion 91 of variation on phytoplankton dynamics even if it lacks the effects of trophic networks indicating that the key factors are included directly or indirectly with the selected variables 2 we used yearly scale rather than seasonal scale as seasonal data of the variables included especially for phytoplankton abundance were limited as the mechanisms driving seasonal dynamic of phytoplankton might be very different than when the analysis is based on yearly data benndorf et al 2002 further studies should discern the cascading effects of human activities and global climatic oscillation on phytoplankton at different temporal scales overall our results were robust in predicting phytoplankton abundance at annual scale 5 conclusion our results provide strong evidence of a strong connection between human activities the global climate oscillation enso and phytoplankton which is mediated by meteorology hydrology and nutrient levels furthermore we identified a robust casual chain and mapped how the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are driven by multiple factors although the mitigation measures to reduce the nutrient input and enhance the use efficiency of chemical fertilizers around the lake have been taken since 2003s ma et al 2020 the climate warming and rainfall extremes associated with the global climate oscillation might in part offset this reduction in nutrient levels thus promoting phytoplankton abundance our findings indicate that policies aimed at managing phytoplankton blooms must be employed to reduce the impact of human activities and climate changes on nutrient loading

16458,while membrane based oil water separation has been widely explored using conventional membranes to treat oily wastewaters remains practically challenging especially when such wastewaters contain more stable nano sized oil droplets and are of high oil content and harsh chemical conditions herein we report a novel protocol of efficiently separating both synthetic and real oil nano emulsions via specially designed robust zirconia membranes the best performing zirconia membrane fabricated at low sintering temperature has relatively uniform sub 100 nm pores and is underwater superoleophobic such zirconia membranes possess not only outstanding separation performance under long term operation but robust structural stability at harsh conditions at different cross flow velocities a combined model of intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration dominated membrane fouling behavior specifically at high ph value especially ph iep membrane fouling was effectively mitigated due to a dominant role of electrostatic repulsion interaction at membrane oil interface compared with conventional and commercial ceramic membranes our zirconia membrane is the first reported in literature that can effectively reject nano sized oil droplets 18 nm with over 99 rejection moreover the zirconia membrane has also been challenged with real degreasing wastewater with very high oil content 4284 mg l 1 and ph 12 4 and delivered consistently high separation performance over many operation cycles graphical abstract image graphical abstract keyword oily wastewater nano emulsion membrane separation ceramic membrane membrane fouling 1 introduction oily wastewaters are generated from various industries such as petrochemical biomedical and mechanical processing zhu et al 2018 these wastewaters need to be treated properly before being discharged to the environment gupta et al 2017 kalla 2021 tanudjaja et al 2019 wang et al 2015 compared with conventional methods such as air flotation and coagulation membrane based separation has received increasing attention especially for treating highly emulsified oily wastewater because of its unique advantages such as high separation efficiency low energy chemicals consumption small footprint and continuous operation abadikhah et al 2018 qing et al 2020 tanudjaja et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in the majority of studies employing membranes for oil water separation the membranes were tested using synthetic oil in water emulsions under moderate conditions dong et al 2019a ou et al 2016 however it is more challenging to treat real emulsified wastewaters from certain industries as they exhibit harsh chemical conditions e g highly alkaline zhu et al 2019 for such separation applications robust ceramic membranes with longer life span are

wetting property of zirconia ceramic membranes were characterized fig 1 which are crucial to the performance of separating oil emulsions chen and liu 2020 hao et al 2013 qing et al 2020 vasanth et al 2011 hereafter three kinds of zirconia membranes denoted as m1 m2 and m3 were prepared from commercial zirconia powders average particle size 0 2 μm p1 powder 0 8 μm p2 powder and 2 3 μm p3 powder figs s3 s5 to achieve a high water permeance for the zirconia membranes a highly asymmetric sandwich structure was fine tuned by controlling several parameters in the dry wetting spinning process yuan et al 2020 these parameters include solid state loading fig s6 air gap distance fig s7 bore fluid flow rate fig s8 nitrogen pressure figs s9 and s10 sintering temperature figs s11 s14 tables s2 and s3 and particle size of zirconia powder figs s15 and s16 all three membranes have a finger sponge finger structure consisting of long finger like micro voids and thin sponge like layer fig 1a and b the finger like micro voids originated from the internal and the external surface of the membrane fig 1d while the sponge like layer in the middle which provides the majority of membrane strength a yttrium oxide stabilized tetragonal zirconia phase formed in three types of zirconia membranes m1 membrane 78 nm m2 membrane 154 nm and m3 membrane 432 nm after sintering fig s17 after ball milling agglomerated p1 zirconia powder 200 nm fig s4 was broken into smaller sized powder 50 nm fig s5 finally forming sub 100 nm membrane pores 78 nm compared with the fabrication of commercial ceramic membrane 1500 1700 c zirconia membrane can form at a substantially lower sintering temperature 1100 c which potentially reduces production cost besides membrane structure packing density is also an important parameter for achieving a high treatment capacity with a membrane module of given size zirconia membranes m1 fabricated in this work have a high packing density of 4340 m2 m 3 which is 5 86 times higher than commercial ceramic membranes fig 1c the lower sintering temperature and the higher packing density both benefit the economical manufacturing the reported zirconia membrane lastly all three membranes m1 m2 m3 are in air hydrophilic fig 1e and underwater superoleophobic fig 1f due to the abundance of hydroxyl groups on the membrane surface figs 1g i and s18 which is critical to their strong oil fouling resistance 3 2 separation performance and fouling behavior with synthetic oil emulsions the separation performance of nano sized oil emulsions oil droplet size 18 nm was examined with underwater superoleophobic zirconia membranes m1 m2 and m3 fig 2 a c and e due to its large pore size 432 nm the m3 membrane showed no oil rejection even though it exhibited the highest and stable flux in spite of its high oil rejection 99 4 99 7 m2 membrane pore size 154 nm showed significant initial flux decline and achieved a relatively low stable water flux 20 l m 2 h 1 fig 2c compared with the m2 membrane the m1 membrane pore size 78 nm exhibited substantially less flux decline and was able to reach a much higher stable water flux 130 l m 2 h 1 higher than m2 while attaining the highest oil rejection 99 7 this phenomenon could be attributed to two factors 1 lower fouling propensity i e weaker oil membrane interaction of m1 membrane with lower surface roughness ra 27 3 nm than m2 membrane ra 125 5 nm fig 19 2 the presence of standard pore blocking in m2 membrane see fig 3 e resulted in lower stable water flux fig 2a and c interestingly the exceptional oil rejection was achieved even the pore size of the m1 membrane was substantially larger than oil droplet size 18 nm during the initial stage of cross flow membrane filtration process nano sized oil droplets were first deposited and then coalesced into a dynamically stable oil layer on the membrane surface which can be confirmed by a slight decrease in permeate flux fig 2a and c as well as oil fouled membrane surface fig s21 such a dynamically stable oil layer could contribute to the exceptional rejection for nano sized oil droplets even using larger pore zirconia membrane this phenomenon has been also well confirmed in other reports using macroporous cellulose microfiltration membrane 312 nm enabling high rejection 98 of nano sized oil emulsions 6 60 nm hu et al 2019 considering its outstanding performance in treating synthetic oil emulsion the m1 membrane was used in the rest of the study cross flow velocity cfv is one of key operating parameters affecting separation performance flux and rejection and fouling behavior enhancing cfv from 0 53 to 1 58 m s 1 improved water flux due to the promoted turbulence and mass transfer chen et al 2020 fig 2b and d even though the fouling propensity quantified by the normalized flux decline remained similar fig 2f a rapid water flux decline was observed during the first 20 min of operation at all three cfvs due to the rapid formation of a fouling layer on the membrane surface followed by a relatively slow gradual decline associated with a dynamically stable oil layer fig 2b at higher cfvs concentration polarization was mitigated with thinner accumulated oil fouling layer consequently resulting in higher water flux hermia models hermia 1982 were used to understand the oil fouling behavior of the m1 membrane at different cfvs fig 3 and table s5 independent on cfvs the fouling of m1 membranes was dominated by combined mechanisms of intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration this phenomenon can be effectively supported by the fitting parameters of four typical filtration models such as correlation coefficients r2 and blocking constant k table s5 at different cfvs the r2 values are the highest for cake filtration and intermediate pore blocking models indicating that these two models represent the dominant fouling mechanism the intermediate pore blocking model was dominant in the early stage resulting in a rapid flux decline at different cfvs when filtration reached steady state the cake filtration dominated fouling due to the formation of a dynamically stable oil layer the flow was in the laminar regime throughout the range of the tested cfvs with the reynolds numbers re consistently lower than 2000 re 601 1248 and 1793 at 0 53 1 10 and 1 53 m s 1 respectively chen et al 2020 with a larger cfv and thus a higher re the increased shear stress hindered the accumulation of the oil on the membrane surface and thereby enhanced the permeate flux fig 2b d and f chen et al 2020 corbatón báguena et al 2015 kumar et al 2015 in comparison for m2 membrane a combined model of intermediate and standard pore blocking dominated membrane fouling in the early stage fig 3e and f which also contributed to the lower stable water flux 3 3 mitigated fouling and excellent long term stability since real oily wastewaters are always strongly alkaline or acidic it is important to understand the role of emulsion chemistry especially ph on the separation performance and fouling behavior with increasing ph value both the initial and stable fluxes were enhanced with exceptional oil rejection maintained fig 4 a a higher ph also resulted in less flux decline in terms of the normalized flux fig 4b specifically a stable normalized flux always above 0 8 was obtained when ph was 10 34 fig 4b indicating minimal membrane fouling behavior increasing ph did not result in any dramatical change of the in air water contact angle underwater oil contact angle or the droplet size fig 4c and d inset moreover to verify the stability of the as prepared nano sized oil emulsions we have done additional experiments about their oil droplet size distribution after standing for different time 1 day and 7 day fig s22 the result shows the good stability of the nano sized oil emulsion in fact the zirconia membrane became slightly more hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic under alkaline conditions at acidic conditions ph lower than ph iep 5 12 zirconia membranes were positively charged while oil droplets were negatively charged fig 4d in this case electrostatic attraction resulted in severe membrane fouling as the membrane wetting property fig 4c and the oil droplet size fig 4d inset did not vary substantially with increasing ph the improved fouling resistance observed under alkaline solutions is likely attributable to the stronger electrical double layer interactions between the zirconia membrane and the oil droplets as both are strongly negatively charged at high ph fig 4d israelachvili 2011 a prolonged experiment with ten cycles of filtration 180 min per cycle with cleaning between cycles with synthetic oily wastewater showed that sustainable treatment performance can be attained with the m1 zirconia membranes fig 5 a more importantly the flux decline per cycle became insignificant after the first four cycles from the fifth cycle onward the filtration performance achieved a dynamic steady state with both consistently small per cycle flux decline and nearly full recovery of the declined flux throughout the ten cycle experiments the oil rejection was consistently above 99 8 and the oil content in the permeate was always below 20 mg l 1 in addition to stable long term filtration performance the excellent stability of the zirconia membrane is also reflected by the unchanged surface morphology fig 5b surface porosity from 27 1 0 8 to 26 8 1 0 figs 5c and s20 pore size and membrane mass fig 5c before and after prolonged operation under alkaline conditions in spite of their promising performance existing state of the art ceramic membranes are largely used for separation of micron sized oil emulsions with droplet size larger than 1 μm ranging from 1 to 10 μm in contrast for treatment of more challenging nano sized oil emulsion 17 8 nm in our work zirconia membrane exhibited sufficient flux which is still higher than those of most ceramic membranes only except for spinel and al2o3 membranes for micron sized oil emulsions separation fig 5d and table 1 3 4 effective purification of real industrial wastewater with nano sized oil droplets unlike synthetic oil in water emulsion real oily wastewaters are more challenging to treat due to their complex composition in this work real degreasing wastewater emulsion droplet size 404 nm with high oil concentration turbidity and ph 12 4 table 2 fig 6 a and b was used to challenge the zirconia m1 membrane a ten cycle filtration experiment with such a real degreasing wastewater showed stable separation performance with a high steady state flux 65 80 l m 2 h 1 that remained consistent throughout the experiment fig 6a fouling was largely reversible as evidenced by both the near perfect flux recovery 96 fig 6a and a foulant free membrane surface figs 5b left and 6c after each cleaning stage throughout the long term multi cycle experiments compared with synthetic oil emulsions the lower stale flux in treating real degreasing wastewater can be attributed to the unfavorable influence of existing inorganic salt 23 91 ms cm 1 affecting the oil membrane interactions tanudjaja et al 2017 we tested both the zirconia m1 membrane and a commercial ceramic membrane using the real degreasing water oil content 4284 mg l 1 the m1 membrane achieved a higher rejection 98 8 than the commercial membrane 95 2 resulting in a permeate with an oil content 51 mg l 1 that is only a quarter of that obtained using a commercial membrane 206 mg l 1 with the m1 membrane high quality water permeate meeting the integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 china state environmental protection administration could be attained with only two pass filtration table 2 fig 6d g which was not feasible with the tested commercial membrane the exceptional separation performance and operational stability demonstrated with real degreasing wastewater show the great promise of zirconia membrane for practical application in treating of real oily wastewater with harsh chemical conditions 4 conclusions while membrane separation has been widely and successfully employed in various applications the practical application of membranes remains challenging for treating oil nano emulsion wastewater with high oil content and harsh chemical conditions results from our work suggest that specially wettable robust and high performance ceramic membranes based on zirconia have a strong application potential to deliver highly effective oil water separation with exceptionally stable multi cycle performance and robust structure at harsh conditions a combined model of intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration dominated oil droplet fouling behavior in particular membrane fouling was effectively mitigated due to a key role of electrostatic repulsion at high ph value ph iep these zirconia membranes which are underwater superoleophobic and have nano scale pores have been shown to achieve the effective oil water separation with the smallest oil droplets reported so far for all ceramic membranes the high separation performance outstanding chemical stability and fouling resistance render the filtration based on zirconia membrane a promising solution to treating challenging industrial wastewaters although zirconia membranes can efficiently separate oil droplets from real oil nano emulsion wastewater removal of smaller sized substances e g inorganic salts or hydrocarbons are also needed to assure a risk free discharge via subsequent techniques such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration since they are frequently present in real oily wastewaters besides nano emulsions our new protocol of designing specially wettable robust membranes is broadly applicable and can be extended toward more harsh water treatment applications such as at strong acidic or alkaline conditions where special robust membrane interface is highly needed with mitigated fouling supplementary information

16458,while membrane based oil water separation has been widely explored using conventional membranes to treat oily wastewaters remains practically challenging especially when such wastewaters contain more stable nano sized oil droplets and are of high oil content and harsh chemical conditions herein we report a novel protocol of efficiently separating both synthetic and real oil nano emulsions via specially designed robust zirconia membranes the best performing zirconia membrane fabricated at low sintering temperature has relatively uniform sub 100 nm pores and is underwater superoleophobic such zirconia membranes possess not only outstanding separation performance under long term operation but robust structural stability at harsh conditions at different cross flow velocities a combined model of intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration dominated membrane fouling behavior specifically at high ph value especially ph iep membrane fouling was effectively mitigated due to a dominant role of electrostatic repulsion interaction at membrane oil interface compared with conventional and commercial ceramic membranes our zirconia membrane is the first reported in literature that can effectively reject nano sized oil droplets 18 nm with over 99 rejection moreover the zirconia membrane has also been challenged with real degreasing wastewater with very high oil content 4284 mg l 1

and particle size of zirconia powder figs s15 and s16 all three membranes have a finger sponge finger structure consisting of long finger like micro voids and thin sponge like layer fig 1a and b the finger like micro voids originated from the internal and the external surface of the membrane fig 1d while the sponge like layer in the middle which provides the majority of membrane strength a yttrium oxide stabilized tetragonal zirconia phase formed in three types of zirconia membranes m1 membrane 78 nm m2 membrane 154 nm and m3 membrane 432 nm after sintering fig s17 after ball milling agglomerated p1 zirconia powder 200 nm fig s4 was broken into smaller sized powder 50 nm fig s5 finally forming sub 100 nm membrane pores 78 nm compared with the fabrication of commercial ceramic membrane 1500 1700 c zirconia membrane can form at a substantially lower sintering temperature 1100 c which potentially reduces production cost besides membrane structure packing density is also an important parameter for achieving a high treatment capacity with a membrane module of given size zirconia membranes m1 fabricated in this work have a high packing density of 4340 m2 m 3 which is 5 86 times higher than commercial ceramic membranes fig 1c the lower sintering temperature and the higher packing density both benefit the economical manufacturing the reported zirconia membrane lastly all three membranes m1 m2 m3 are in air hydrophilic fig 1e and underwater superoleophobic fig 1f due to the abundance of hydroxyl groups on the membrane surface figs 1g i and s18 which is critical to their strong oil fouling resistance 3 2 separation performance and fouling behavior with synthetic oil emulsions the separation performance of nano sized oil emulsions oil droplet size 18 nm was examined with underwater superoleophobic zirconia membranes m1 m2 and m3 fig 2 a c and e due to its large pore size 432 nm the m3 membrane showed no oil rejection even though it exhibited the highest and stable flux in spite of its high oil rejection 99 4 99 7 m2 membrane pore size 154 nm showed significant initial flux decline and achieved a relatively low stable water flux 20 l m 2 h 1 fig 2c compared with the m2 membrane the m1 membrane pore size 78 nm exhibited substantially less flux decline and was able to reach a much higher stable water flux 130 l m 2 h 1 higher than m2 while attaining the highest oil rejection 99 7 this phenomenon could be attributed to two factors 1 lower fouling propensity i e weaker oil membrane interaction of m1 membrane with lower surface roughness ra 27 3 nm than m2 membrane ra 125 5 nm fig 19 2 the presence of standard pore blocking in m2 membrane see fig 3 e resulted in lower stable water flux fig 2a and c interestingly the exceptional oil rejection was achieved even the pore size of the m1 membrane was substantially larger than oil droplet size 18 nm during the initial stage of cross flow membrane filtration process nano sized oil droplets were first deposited and then coalesced into a dynamically stable oil layer on the membrane surface which can be confirmed by a slight decrease in permeate flux fig 2a and c as well as oil fouled membrane surface fig s21 such a dynamically stable oil layer could contribute to the exceptional rejection for nano sized oil droplets even using larger pore zirconia membrane this phenomenon has been also well confirmed in other reports using macroporous cellulose microfiltration membrane 312 nm enabling high rejection 98 of nano sized oil emulsions 6 60 nm hu et al 2019 considering its outstanding performance in treating synthetic oil emulsion the m1 membrane was used in the rest of the study cross flow velocity cfv is one of key operating parameters affecting separation performance flux and rejection and fouling behavior enhancing cfv from 0 53 to 1 58 m s 1 improved water flux due to the promoted turbulence and mass transfer chen et al 2020 fig 2b and d even though the fouling propensity quantified by the normalized flux decline remained similar fig 2f a rapid water flux decline was observed during the first 20 min of operation at all three cfvs due to the rapid formation of a fouling layer on the membrane surface followed by a relatively slow gradual decline associated with a dynamically stable oil layer fig 2b at higher cfvs concentration polarization was mitigated with thinner accumulated oil fouling layer consequently resulting in higher water flux hermia models hermia 1982 were used to understand the oil fouling behavior of the m1 membrane at different cfvs fig 3 and table s5 independent on cfvs the fouling of m1 membranes was dominated by combined mechanisms of intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration this phenomenon can be effectively supported by the fitting parameters of four typical filtration models such as correlation coefficients r2 and blocking constant k table s5 at different cfvs the r2 values are the highest for cake filtration and intermediate pore blocking models indicating that these two models represent the dominant fouling mechanism the intermediate pore blocking model was dominant in the early stage resulting in a rapid flux decline at different cfvs when filtration reached steady state the cake filtration dominated fouling due to the formation of a dynamically stable oil layer the flow was in the laminar regime throughout the range of the tested cfvs with the reynolds numbers re consistently lower than 2000 re 601 1248 and 1793 at 0 53 1 10 and 1 53 m s 1 respectively chen et al 2020 with a larger cfv and thus a higher re the increased shear stress hindered the accumulation of the oil on the membrane surface and thereby enhanced the permeate flux fig 2b d and f chen et al 2020 corbatón báguena et al 2015 kumar et al 2015 in comparison for m2 membrane a combined model of intermediate and standard pore blocking dominated membrane fouling in the early stage fig 3e and f which also contributed to the lower stable water flux 3 3 mitigated fouling and excellent long term stability since real oily wastewaters are always strongly alkaline or acidic it is important to understand the role of emulsion chemistry especially ph on the separation performance and fouling behavior with increasing ph value both the initial and stable fluxes were enhanced with exceptional oil rejection maintained fig 4 a a higher ph also resulted in less flux decline in terms of the normalized flux fig 4b specifically a stable normalized flux always above 0 8 was obtained when ph was 10 34 fig 4b indicating minimal membrane fouling behavior increasing ph did not result in any dramatical change of the in air water contact angle underwater oil contact angle or the droplet size fig 4c and d inset moreover to verify the stability of the as prepared nano sized oil emulsions we have done additional experiments about their oil droplet size distribution after standing for different time 1 day and 7 day fig s22 the result shows the good stability of the nano sized oil emulsion in fact the zirconia membrane became slightly more hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic under alkaline conditions at acidic conditions ph lower than ph iep 5 12 zirconia membranes were positively charged while oil droplets were negatively charged fig 4d in this case electrostatic attraction resulted in severe membrane fouling as the membrane wetting property fig 4c and the oil droplet size fig 4d inset did not vary substantially with increasing ph the improved fouling resistance observed under alkaline solutions is likely attributable to the stronger electrical double layer interactions between the zirconia membrane and the oil droplets as both are strongly negatively charged at high ph fig 4d israelachvili 2011 a prolonged experiment with ten cycles of filtration 180 min per cycle with cleaning between cycles with synthetic oily wastewater showed that sustainable treatment performance can be attained with the m1 zirconia membranes fig 5 a more importantly the flux decline per cycle became insignificant after the first four cycles from the fifth cycle onward the filtration performance achieved a dynamic steady state with both consistently small per cycle flux decline and nearly full recovery of the declined flux throughout the ten cycle experiments the oil rejection was consistently above 99 8 and the oil content in the permeate was always below 20 mg l 1 in addition to stable long term filtration performance the excellent stability of the zirconia membrane is also reflected by the unchanged surface morphology fig 5b surface porosity from 27 1 0 8 to 26 8 1 0 figs 5c and s20 pore size and membrane mass fig 5c before and after prolonged operation under alkaline conditions in spite of their promising performance existing state of the art ceramic membranes are largely used for separation of micron sized oil emulsions with droplet size larger than 1 μm ranging from 1 to 10 μm in contrast for treatment of more challenging nano sized oil emulsion 17 8 nm in our work zirconia membrane exhibited sufficient flux which is still higher than those of most ceramic membranes only except for spinel and al2o3 membranes for micron sized oil emulsions separation fig 5d and table 1 3 4 effective purification of real industrial wastewater with nano sized oil droplets unlike synthetic oil in water emulsion real oily wastewaters are more challenging to treat due to their complex composition in this work real degreasing wastewater emulsion droplet size 404 nm with high oil concentration turbidity and ph 12 4 table 2 fig 6 a and b was used to challenge the zirconia m1 membrane a ten cycle filtration experiment with such a real degreasing wastewater showed stable separation performance with a high steady state flux 65 80 l m 2 h 1 that remained consistent throughout the experiment fig 6a fouling was largely reversible as evidenced by both the near perfect flux recovery 96 fig 6a and a foulant free membrane surface figs 5b left and 6c after each cleaning stage throughout the long term multi cycle experiments compared with synthetic oil emulsions the lower stale flux in treating real degreasing wastewater can be attributed to the unfavorable influence of existing inorganic salt 23 91 ms cm 1 affecting the oil membrane interactions tanudjaja et al 2017 we tested both the zirconia m1 membrane and a commercial ceramic membrane using the real degreasing water oil content 4284 mg l 1 the m1 membrane achieved a higher rejection 98 8 than the commercial membrane 95 2 resulting in a permeate with an oil content 51 mg l 1 that is only a quarter of that obtained using a commercial membrane 206 mg l 1 with the m1 membrane high quality water permeate meeting the integrated wastewater discharge standard gb 8978 1996 china state environmental protection administration could be attained with only two pass filtration table 2 fig 6d g which was not feasible with the tested commercial membrane the exceptional separation performance and operational stability demonstrated with real degreasing wastewater show the great promise of zirconia membrane for practical application in treating of real oily wastewater with harsh chemical conditions 4 conclusions while membrane separation has been widely and successfully employed in various applications the practical application of membranes remains challenging for treating oil nano emulsion wastewater with high oil content and harsh chemical conditions results from our work suggest that specially wettable robust and high performance ceramic membranes based on zirconia have a strong application potential to deliver highly effective oil water separation with exceptionally stable multi cycle performance and robust structure at harsh conditions a combined model of intermediate pore blocking and cake filtration dominated oil droplet fouling behavior in particular membrane fouling was effectively mitigated due to a key role of electrostatic repulsion at high ph value ph iep these zirconia membranes which are underwater superoleophobic and have nano scale pores have been shown to achieve the effective oil water separation with the smallest oil droplets reported so far for all ceramic membranes the high separation performance outstanding chemical stability and fouling resistance render the filtration based on zirconia membrane a promising solution to treating challenging industrial wastewaters although zirconia membranes can efficiently separate oil droplets from real oil nano emulsion wastewater removal of smaller sized substances e g inorganic salts or hydrocarbons are also needed to assure a risk free discharge via subsequent techniques such as reverse osmosis or nanofiltration since they are frequently present in real oily wastewaters besides nano emulsions our new protocol of designing specially wettable robust membranes is broadly applicable and can be extended toward more harsh water treatment applications such as at strong acidic or alkaline conditions where special robust membrane interface is highly needed with mitigated fouling supplementary information

16459,as a promising wastewater treatment technology little is known about whether the greenhouse gas co2 can be applied for microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs process this article applied co2 for improving mbgs process it was found that the physical structure of mbgs with no co2 addition appeared to have a trend to be loose and disintegrated with a sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 of over 150 ml g and an average pore size of 35 nm in 60 d operation however co2 could maintain the compact and integrated structure of mbgs with a svi5 lower than 50 ml g and an average pore size ranging from 10 to 13 nm co2 could enhance the production of extracellular polysaccharides and aromatic protein thus favoring the granular stability of mbgs co2 could change the aqueous environment e g lowering the ph values which resulted in different microbial communities as well as metabolic potentials of mbgs as for the reactor performance co2 could significantly improve the removals of organics and phosphorus evidenced by the enhancement of genes encoding acetate coa ligase and atpase respectively although the mass ratio of algae to bacteria was elevated by co2 addition the ammonia removal related enzymes of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase could be negatively and positively impacted by co2 respectively mass balance analysis of carbon indicated that co2 could provide additional carbon source as well as enhance the buffering capacity for the mbgs system further estimations suggested that the mbgs process could achieve a carbon negative objective for municipal wastewater treatment by supplying co2 as additional carbon source hence co2 supply for mbgs process in municipal wastewater treatment can be deemed as a two birds one stone strategy i e maintaining the granular stability and eliminating the carbon emission this article can advance our basic knowledge on mbgs process towards environment sustainable wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgal bacterial granular sludge carbon dioxide wastewater treatment carbon negative metagenomics inorganic carbon 1 introduction microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs process has been gaining attention on account of its better performance than aerobic granular sludge process liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 recently it has been noticed that mbgs process can simply and solely rely on light to treat domestic wastewater with the synergy between microalgae and bacteria without external aeration abouhend et al 2020 ji et al 2020b in this process about 207 million tons co2e yr reduction of greenhouse gases emissions is estimated to be achieved globally compared to the conventional activated sludge process zhang et al 2021 in addition the easily settled biomass of mbgs can be potentially used as raw materials for the production of bio fertilizer bio oil and high value added products liu et al 2018a quijano et al 2017 wang et al 2021a therefore as a potential alternative for future wastewater treatment the mbgs process has been expected to be simultaneously achieve the multiple goals of pollutant removal energy reduction carbon elimination and resource recovery on the road to the engineering application of mbgs for environmentally sustainable domestic wastewater treatment and reclamation some pioneer work has been presenting evidence that mbgs process indeed gained some features to be a promising alternative ji 2021 safitri et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 mbgs can be simply cultivated from activated sludge abouhend et al 2018 gikonyo et al 2021 while aerobic granular sludge or mbgs can be used as the seed sludge as well ji et al 2020b zhang et al 2020 pilot operation of mbgs process has been preliminary shown to verify its potential feasibility for domestic wastewater treatment mcnairpilot 2017 the shape and size of mbgs can be regulated accordingly abouhend et al 2020 ouazaite et al 2021 it has been addressed that microbial assimilation can be the main mechanism of pollutants removal ji et al 2020b mbgs can well adapt to varied climate since it can be operated under natural day night cycles ji et al 2021a shi et al 2021 at temperatures of 13 to 37 c and light intensities of 70 to 2000 μ mol m2 s ji 2021 in addition the effect of emerging pollutants on mbgs has also been investigated such as tetracycline wang et al 2020b and cadmium wang et al 2021b although the non aerated mbgs was extensively reported tiron et al 2015 brockmann et al 2021 ji 2021 the granular structure as well as its pollutants removal performance under a relatively long period could be unstable for example bulking sludge could occur with a less dense structure over a long period operation mbgs mcnairpilot 2017 currently carbon emissions have become one of the key issues for global environmentally sustainable development hao et al 2015 recently the concentration of atmospheric co2 has exceeded 420 ppm which was the highest in the recent 800 thousand years and which was 1 5 times higher than the preindustrial co2 levels of around 278 ppm cappucci 2021 the flue gas usually derived from power plants has been considered as one of the carbon sources momeni et al 2021 theoretically under light conditions the waste gases e g flue gas containing co2 can be added into the mbgs system to further reduce the carbon emission the co construction of thermal power plants and wastewater treatment plants wwtps has become a trend of future urban development lu et al 2018 in fact co2 aeration might be potentially applied for microalgal bacterial process in wastewater treatment trebuch et al 2020 however little is known about the effect of co2 on the characteristic and performance of mbgs which indeed restraints the further application of mbgs towards carbon negative wastewater treatment this study was to systematically look into the effect of co2 on the characteristics and performances of mbgs in municipal wastewater treatment different volume concentrations of co2 i e 15 30 45 and 60 were added to facilitate the mbgs process in municipal wastewater treatment the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of mbgs under different concentrations of co2 were explored organics ammonia and phosphate removals by mbgs process were studied in addition the mechanisms of how co2 impacted on the characteristics and performances of mbgs were elucidated while the greenhouse gases emissions by mbgs process for municipal wastewater treatment with co2 supply were estimated this study was expected to advance our knowledge on the mbgs process for domestic wastewater treatment towards a carbon negative objective 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic municipal wastewater the synthetic municipal

2 2 experimental setup the seed mbgs was cultivated from aerobic granules as described before ji et al 2020b with an average size of about 1 1 mm and a sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 of 40 4 4 2 9 ml g standard deviation the sealed cylindrical glass reactor was 8 7 cm high with 3 5 cm diameter and a bottleneck of 1 6 cm in diameter resulting in 63 ml of total volume i e a headspace of 33 ml and an effective working volume of 30 ml the initial volatile suspended solids vss concentration was about 5 0 g l the reactors were fixed at a shaker hk 4 ronghua instrument manufacturing company china with a distance at about 4 cm from each other at about 150 rpm under a full spectrum led light at a light intensity of about 170 μ mol m2 s on the surface of the reactor prior to each cycle the influent was added then 5 ml 10 ml 15 ml and 20 ml co2 was inlet into the reactor with a 20 ml syringe achieving respective co2 concentrations v v of 15 30 45 and 60 these reactors along with the reactors without co2 were operated in duplicate at 6 h hydraulic retention time hrt under 12 h 12 h light dark cycles the liquid solution of the first light cycle was collected with a 20 ml syringe and then passed through a 0 45 μm filter and stored at 4 for further analysis while the biomass were obtained as solid samples for further analyzes or discharged to maintain the vss at about 5 0 g l corresponding to the sludge retention time srt of around 15 d the biomass samples were stored at 80 for microbial community and functional genes analyzes the experiments were conducted in an air conditioning room at about 23 2 3 microbial community and functional genes analysis the total genome dna was extracted by using an e z n a soil dna kit omega biotek inc norcross ga usa and fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa for miseq sequencing and metagenomics sequencing respectively the primer sets 338f 806r and 528f 706r were applied for the amplification of gene fragments for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively ji et al 2021b the miseq sequencing and sequence analyzes were conducted as described before ji et al 2020a to study the microbial community succession of the mbgs the microbial community was also visualized by using an optical microscope rx50 soptop china and a scanning electron microscope zeiss evo18 germany for taxonomy annotation and functional genes analysis metagenomics sequencing was conducted as described elsewhere huang et al 2020 the microbial community of metagenomics was determined with the non redundant gene catalog according to national center for biotechnology information ncbi non redundant protein sequence database while the metabolic pathways analyzes were based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database the

ohaus usa respectively the granular size was determined via a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 usa extracellular polymeric substances eps of mbgs were extracted by a heat extraction method zhang et al 2016 and analyzed with the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem with a fluorescence spectroscopy f 7100 hitachi high technology corp japan in situ images of the mbgs were non destructively performed using an optical coherence tomography oct gan210c1 thorlab usa the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of mbgs and the pore size distributions were determined with an automatic micromeritics analyzer asap2460 micromeritics usa the carbon and nitrogen contents of the mbgs were measured with an elemental analysis elemantar vario el cube germany and the phosphorus content was determined as described ji et al 2020b 2 5 mass balance calculations the stable operation data from phase iii were selected for the mass balance calculations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the overall mass balance on carbon can be written as follows 1 influent orga nic carb on m oc inf g d infl uent inor ganic carb on m ic inf g d gase ous carb on befo re reac

empirical formulas of mbgs and microalgae was described as c100h158o38n17p ji et al 2020b and c100h178o36n12p boelee et al 2014 respectively for mbgs with no co2 addition the following main reactions were considered 2 50 c h 3 c o o 17 n h 4 h 2 p o 4 34 h c 100 h 158 o 38 n 17 p 9 o 2 48 h 2 o 3 100 h c o 3 17 n h 4 h 2 p o 4 84 h c 100 h 158 o 38 n 17 p 109 o 2 48 h 2 o 4 hco 3 h c o 3 2 where eq 2 is the overall mbgs assimilation reaction with acetate ammonia and dihydrogen phosphate eq 3 is the mbgs assimilation with inorganic carbon of bicarbonate and eq 4 describes the hydrolysis of bicarbonate for mbgs with co2 addition eq 2 also was one of the main reactions while the following main reactions were also taken into account 5 100 c o 2 12 n h 4 h 2 p o 4 69 5 h 2 o 118 75 o 2 11 h c 100 h 178 o 36 n 12 p 6 co 2 h 2 o h h c o 3 it can be seen that the carbon for the biomass growth could be derived from eq 2 for mbgs and eq 5 for microalgae with co2 addition the mass growth of which could be estimated based on the mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen of the biomass revealed by the results of elemental analysis the ph values could be calculated as follows 7 ph l o g h the mass balance on nitrogen and phosphorus was also established similarly whereas the gaseous nitrogen and phosphorus were negligible and not considered 2 6 statistical analysis the results herein presented as mean standard deviations spss software ibm spss statistics 26 was used to compare performance results through one way analysis of variance anova and bivariate correlation analysis where statistically significant difference was assumed at p 0 05 and highly difference was assumed at p 0 01 in addition the regression linear fitting method was used to analyze the data 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 favors optimal granular structure the settling ability of the mbgs with no co2 addition could drop gradually during the two month operation fig 1 a and b the svi5 of the mbgs with no co2 addition could grow gradually in the first 40 d and turn swiftly nearly three fold increase at the end of the experiment fig 2 a this indicated that the structure of mbgs with no co2 addition could gradually turn loose implying the necessity of co2 addition for a long term stable operation of mbgs process the loose structure of mbgs without co2 addition could be ascribed to that the granular surface had a large quantity of filamentous algae and few spherical algae as indicated by fig 1b moreover the oct images apparently indicated that the area of the outer porous layer had exceeded the area of the inner compact part of the mbgs without co2 addition at the end of the experiment it has been generally acknowledged that the filamentous microorganisms can have an adverse effect on the granular settling ability liu and liu 2006 although the filamentous algae can play a significant role in the development of mbgs tiron et al 2017 milferstedt et al 2017 the overgrowth of which may cause the bulking of mbgs furthermore the bet results also confirmed the porous structure of mbgs without co2 stimulation evidenced by the lowest average pore size of 35 nm and the highest specific surface area of 0 64 m2 g table s1 as such it can be concluded that the physical structure of mbgs with no co2 addition could have a trend to be loose and disintegrated under long period operations fig 1b suggested that 15 co2 could well maintain the dense structure of mbgs evidenced by the lowest svi5 of 36 5 ml g at the end of the experiment fig 2a and table s1 specifically the spherical algae could well grow with the filamentous algae on the outer surface of mbgs to form a mat like structure with an excellent granular stability milferstedt et al 2017 the significant reduced chl a chl b ratio shown in fig 2b further suggested that a considerable proportion of spherical green algae could grow with co2 addition considering that the filamentous prokaryotic algae contained only chl a and the spherical eukaryotic algae contained both chl a and chl b in addition co2 addition could promote the production of extracellular polysaccharides significantly fig s1 favoring the granular stability seviour et al 2019 concurrently extracellular aromatic protein production was also enhanced with co2 supply as reflected by the fluorescence spectrum analysis fig s2 which also contributed to the granular stability wang et al 2022 zhu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 figs 1 and s3 also indicate that the mbgs could gradually adapt to different concentrations of co2 the mbgs with no co2 addition exhibited no suspended algae growth throughout the whole experiment period of two months the phase i witnessed that 15 co2 contributed most to the growth of suspended algae however the amount of suspended biomass gradually diminished after then indicating that the mbgs could adapt to 15 co2 in about 20 d likewise the mbgs could adapt to 60 co2 in about 40 d during the phase iii the average concentrations of suspended algae in all reactors were less than 15 mg l fig s3 accounting for 0 3 of the total biomass concentration of 5 0 g l specifically 15 and 30 co2 resulted in the low concentration of suspended algae of around 5 0 mg l fig s3 implying its favorable function in maintaining the granular integrity it was observed that the average ph values in the mbgs system with no co2 addition could increase from 7 33 to 9 54 fig 3 a due to the acid consumption indicated by eq 2 although the bicarbonate could offer the aqueous buffering capacity as revealed by eq 4 an alkalinity of bicarbonate of around 60 mg l as caco3 seemed to be not enough to prevent considerable ph fluctuations in this study on the contrary co2 addition could adjust the aqueous ph values hu et al 2017 of mbgs systems as revealed by eqs 5 and 6 i e altering from an alkaline aqueous environment to a neutral aqueous environment fig 3a which was generally more suitable for the living of microbes the average do concentrations at the end of each cycle in all reactors during phase iii were over 3 0 mg l fig 3b suggesting an aerobic atmosphere in mbgs systems could be generated under 0 to 60 co2 concentrations over 6 h it appeared that higher co2 concentrations i e mix trophic cultivation of mbgs could lead to relatively lower do concentrations at the end of each cycle fig 3b although co2 could promote the microalgal photosynthesis the respiration process could be suppressed by high levels of co2 hu et al 2001 thus the co2 in the biological system was not fully utilized within 6 h in this study 3 2 how did co2 affect the performance of mbgs process 3 2 1 co2 enhanced cod removal by mbgs figs 4 and s4 indicated that co2 introduction could slightly impair the cod removal in phase i however when the mbgs gradually adapted to the environment with extra co2 addition the cod removal could be enhanced in phases ii and iii during the steady state of phase iii the average cod removals were 81 2 4 8 88 7 3 7 91 3 3 1 91 4 3 4 and 91 7 3 3 mean standard deviations for 0 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition with the average cod removal rates displayed in table 1 it indicated that the addition of co2 could indeed improve the cod removal with an average cod removal of over 90 during the steady state of phase iii this could be ascribed to that co2 could maintain the dense structure of mbgs moreover mbgs might accumulate additional carbon stored as cellular glycogen or lipid ji et al 2020c liu et al 2018a there was no significant difference of cod removal efficiency among reactors with 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition p 0 05 suggesting that 15 co2 was sufficient as for cod removal improvement by mbgs process 3 2 2 ammonia removal rate was not impacted by co2 addition fig 4 indicated that 15 and 30 co2 had no significant impact on ammonia removal in phases i and ii p 0 05 during the steady state of phase iii the average ammonia n removals were 85 9 4 7 69 8 3 9 77 3 4 7 74 0 2 9 and 68 8 3 9 mean standard deviations for 0 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition respectively however the average ammonia n removal rates were close to each other as depicted in table 1 since nitrate or nitrite were undetectable throughout the experiment it is reasonable to consider that the ammonia was removed through microalgal bacterial assimilation by mbgs which was in accordance with our previous reports ji et al 2021a 2021b apart from algal competition with bacteria for ammonia huang et al 2015 co2 could inhibit microbial enzymes related to denitrification wan et al 2016 which further confirmed that the ammonia removal was relied on assimilation rather than dissimilation by mbgs a higher mass ratio of microalgae to bacteria could be achieved with co2 introduction this can be explained by that co2 caused the increase of eukaryotic algae due to the promotion of photosynthesis while some bacteria could be eliminated with co2 addition due to the inhabitation of respiration hu et al 2001 3 2 3 co2 enhanced phosphate removal by mbgs overall co2 could enhance phosphate removal during the steady state of phase iii the average phosphate removals were 50 1 10 3 54 4 8 2 67 3 5 8 70 2 6 7 and 72 3 6 7 mean standard deviations for 0 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition respectively with the average phosphate p removal rates depicted in table 1 the addition of co2 could significantly reduce the aqueous ph values from slightly alkaline to nearly neutral fig 3a although a higher ph value favored chemical phosphorus removal by forming calcium phosphate peng et al 2018 the accompanied carbonate could compete with phosphate for calcium at ph 9 2 cao and harris 2008 in addition the nearly neutral aqueous environment could favor the biological phosphorus removal it was proposed that the optimal initial ph values for biological phosphate removal should be controlled between 6 4 and 7 2 liu et al 2007 when ph was higher than 8 2 the biological phosphorus uptake rate significantly decreased serralta et al 2006 it was also reported that ph controlled at neutral level was the prerequisite for algal phosphorus removal from wastewater lavrinovičs et al 2020 in fact the phosphorus accumulating organisms pao can be enriched with co2 addition in this study as explained later this gave a plausible explanation for the enhanced phosphorus removal with the supply of co2 to the mbgs system 3 3 microbial community succession overall co2 could promote the growth of chlorella as indicated by figs 1b 5 and 6 in contrast some genera of bacteria were gradually eliminated with co2 addition azotobacter an aerobic nitrogen fixing heterotrophic bacterium was gradually disappeared with elevated co2 concentrations fig 5 although aquimonas was reported to be able to grow at ph 6 11 saha et al 2005 its abundance could be gradually diminished with co2 addition some bacteria could well be kept in the mbgs during the two month operation for example photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter could well grow with algae in mbgs however some bacteria gradually turned predominant species acidovorax was enriched with co2 addition due to its acidification while delftia was also enriched these results indicated that co2 indeed altered the microbial community of mbgs via altering the aqueous ph values 3 4 mechanisms involved for the co2 effect on pollutants removal of mbgs metagenomic results indicated that co2 addition promoted the growth of spherical green algae i e chlorellaceae which was in agreement with the microscopic results as describe above in fig 1 the predominant chlorellaceae could contribute to organics removal which gave a plausible explanation of the improvement of cod removal by the introduction of co2 due to the increased fraction of the eukaryotic algae the algae to bacteria ratio increased with co2 addition fig 6a and b since algae generally has a relatively lower mass content of nitrogen than bacteria as reflected by their respective empirical formulas of c100h178o36n12p and c100h140o40n20p1 7 boelee et al 2014 the mbgs would exhibit slightly lower ammonia assimilation potential with co2 addition as for the phosphorus removal the main contributor was closely associated with pao which contained phosphorus accumulating bacteria and phosphorus accumulating algae such as comamonadaceae qin et al 2018 and leptolyngbyaceae ji et al 2020c respectively obviously the abundance of pao was in proportion to the co2 concentration fig 6c and d which favored the biological phosphate removal by mbgs hence co2 addition could promote the organics and phosphorus assimilation by mbgs evidenced by the higher carbon and phosphorus contents of mbgs with co2 addition than those with no co2 addition table 2 the initial key metabolic pathways in regard with the biological transformation of organics ammonia and phosphate were displayed in fig 7 it indicated that the abundance of acetate coa ligase increased with co2 addition which implied that the organics assimilation might be enhanced by co2 by mbgs the relative amount of genes encoding glutamate dehydrogenase was apparently dropped with the elevation of co2 concentrations while the abundance of genes encoding glutamine synthetase was raised by 15 co2 addition for mbgs moreover co2 addition could increase the relative abundance of genes encoding atpase which might facilitate the mbgs to better utilize phosphorus for energy production to further understand the co2 effect on pollutants removal of mbgs the mass balances of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were determined over the stable phase iii of mbgs process fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8a about one third of inorganic carbon i e bicarbonate could be assimilated by mbgs with no co2 supply eq 3 during this process the alkalinity brought by bicarbonate of about 60 mg l as caco3 could provide certain buffering capacity of the media by generating h eq 4 to make up the h exhaustion by the acetate uptake for algal bacterial growth eq 2 by the introduction of co2 the co2 dissolved in water could produce h eq 6 while the generated bicarbonate acting as a carbon pool zhu et al 2020 vadlamani et al 2019 could promote the microalgal growth considering that wastewater with more bicarbonate than organics favored only microalgal growth in a microalgal bacterial system mohamed et al 2021 concurrently co2 addition could add bicarbonate and enhance the liquid buffering capacity to maintain the ph values of the mbgs system in addition figs 8b and 2a also indicated that 15 co2 addition was enough for the mbgs since there was surplus co2 gas after reaction in all reactors with 15 to 60 co2 introduction the specific carbon removal rate of co2 by mbgs was around 2 0 mg c g vss h with 15 to 60 co2 addition as revealed by fig 8b which could serve as the guidance for future application of mbgs for wastewater treatment with co2 addition similar to the disposal of organics the nitrogen and phosphorus appeared to be more stably removed from the liquid with the present of co2 fig 8c and d to sum up co2 addition could add the additional carbon source as well as enhance the buffering capacity for the mbgs system while altering the microbial community and function to guarantee the dense property with an excellent bioactivity of mbgs for efficient pollutants removal 4 towards carbon negative municipal wastewater treatment currently wwtps have been realized to be one of the emitters of greenhouse gases with conventional activated sludge as the core process liu et al 2019 co2 can be simply derived from the flue gas with a co2 content of up to 15 lage et al 2021 while the continuous co2 addtion during daytime should be adopted for the large scale application of mbgs process based on the varied environmental conditions as well as the wastewater compositions to further address the potential prospect of the mbgs process towards an objective of carbon negative wastewater treatment china was selected as an example for the estimations of greenhouse gases emissions since china had the world s largest wastewater sector qu et al 2019 the annual municipal wastewater in china was around 57 109 m3 mohurd 2020 xu et al 2020 with average influent cod and nitrogen concentrations of about 220 g m3 and 30 g m3 guo et al 2018 sun et al 2016 respectively as such the average mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen of wastewater was estimated to be 220 30 12 32 2 75 theoretically the mbgs could assimilate the organics and nitrogen as a mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen of about 5 as reflected by table 2 as well as the empirical formula of mbgs of c100h158o38n17p ji et al 2020b thus additional carbon from co2 should be supplied to the mbgs system which was about 30 g m3 5 2 75 67 5 g m3 carbon equivalent to 247 5 g m3 co2 in addition the n2o and ch4 emissions in the non aerated mbgs process could be negligible ji et al 2020b wang et al 2020a safitri et al 2021 while the harvested mbgs biomass could be simply used as biofertilizer and raw materials for bio oil production hence the mbgs process was expected to achieve negative greenhouse gases emissions of about 57 109 m3 yr 247 5 g m3 co2 14 1 106 tones co2 yr for china this suggested that the mbgs process was likely to achieve a carbon negative goal in treating municipal wastewater given the results of the lab scale experiments on mbgs process future work should dedicated to explore the co2 aeration strategy while using the waste flue gases for real domestic wastewater treatment under outdoor conditions 5 conclusions mbgs could gradually adapt to 0 to 60 co2 concentrations co2 addition could be applied to maintain the stable and dense granular structure and to enhance the overall reactor performances of mbgs the microbial communities and metabolisms pathways of mbgs were altered with co2 introduction algae to bacteria ratio and pao abundance could be significantly increased with co2 addition the functions of mbgs related to pollutants removal was overall enhanced as revealed by the increase of abundance of functional genes encoding acetate coa ligase glutamine synthetase and atpase etc the specific carbon removal rate of co2 by mbgs was revealed to be around 2 0 mg c g vss h further analyzes suggested that co2 could be applied for mbgs to treat domestic wastewater towards a carbon negative objective credit authorship contribution statement bin ji conceptualization funding acquisition supervision validation writing original draft

16459,as a promising wastewater treatment technology little is known about whether the greenhouse gas co2 can be applied for microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs process this article applied co2 for improving mbgs process it was found that the physical structure of mbgs with no co2 addition appeared to have a trend to be loose and disintegrated with a sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 of over 150 ml g and an average pore size of 35 nm in 60 d operation however co2 could maintain the compact and integrated structure of mbgs with a svi5 lower than 50 ml g and an average pore size ranging from 10 to 13 nm co2 could enhance the production of extracellular polysaccharides and aromatic protein thus favoring the granular stability of mbgs co2 could change the aqueous environment e g lowering the ph values which resulted in different microbial communities as well as metabolic potentials of mbgs as for the reactor performance co2 could significantly improve the removals of organics and phosphorus evidenced by the enhancement of genes encoding acetate coa ligase and atpase respectively although the mass ratio of algae to bacteria was elevated by co2 addition the ammonia removal related enzymes of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase could be negatively and positively impacted by co2 respectively mass balance analysis of carbon indicated that co2 could provide additional carbon source as well as enhance the buffering capacity for the mbgs system further estimations suggested that the mbgs process could achieve a carbon negative objective for municipal wastewater treatment by supplying co2 as additional carbon source hence co2 supply for mbgs process in municipal wastewater treatment can be deemed as a two birds one stone strategy i e maintaining the granular stability and eliminating the carbon emission this article can advance our basic knowledge on mbgs process towards environment sustainable wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microalgal bacterial granular sludge carbon dioxide wastewater treatment carbon negative metagenomics inorganic carbon 1 introduction microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs process has been gaining attention on account of its better performance than aerobic granular sludge process liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 recently it has been noticed that mbgs process can simply and solely rely on light to treat domestic wastewater with the synergy between microalgae and bacteria without external aeration abouhend et al 2020 ji et al 2020b in this process about 207 million tons co2e yr reduction of greenhouse gases emissions is estimated to be achieved globally compared to the conventional activated sludge process zhang et al 2021 in addition the easily settled biomass of mbgs can be potentially used as raw materials for the production of bio fertilizer bio oil and high value added products liu et al 2018a quijano et al 2017 wang et al 2021a therefore as a potential alternative for future wastewater treatment the mbgs process has been expected to be simultaneously achieve the multiple goals of pollutant removal energy reduction carbon elimination and resource recovery on the road to the engineering application of mbgs for environmentally sustainable domestic wastewater treatment and reclamation some pioneer work has been presenting evidence that mbgs process indeed gained some features to be a promising alternative ji 2021 safitri et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 mbgs can be simply cultivated from activated sludge abouhend et al 2018 gikonyo et al 2021 while aerobic granular sludge or mbgs can be used as the seed sludge as well ji et al 2020b zhang et al 2020 pilot operation of mbgs process has been preliminary shown to verify its potential feasibility for domestic wastewater treatment mcnairpilot 2017 the shape and size of mbgs can be regulated accordingly abouhend et al 2020 ouazaite et al 2021 it has been addressed that microbial assimilation can be the main mechanism of pollutants removal ji et al 2020b mbgs can well adapt to varied climate since it can be operated under natural day night cycles ji et al 2021a shi et al 2021 at temperatures of 13 to 37 c and light intensities of 70 to 2000 μ mol m2 s ji 2021 in addition the effect of emerging pollutants on mbgs has also been investigated such as tetracycline wang et al 2020b and cadmium wang et al 2021b although the non aerated mbgs was extensively reported tiron et al 2015 brockmann et al 2021 ji 2021 the granular structure as well as its pollutants removal performance under a relatively long period could be unstable for example bulking sludge could occur with a less dense structure over a long period operation mbgs mcnairpilot 2017 currently carbon emissions have become one of the key issues for global environmentally sustainable development hao et al 2015 recently the concentration of atmospheric co2 has exceeded 420 ppm which was the highest in the recent 800 thousand years and which was 1 5 times higher than the preindustrial co2 levels of around 278 ppm cappucci 2021 the flue gas usually derived from power plants has been considered as one of the carbon sources momeni et al 2021 theoretically under light conditions the waste gases e g flue gas containing co2 can be added into the mbgs system to further reduce the carbon emission the co construction of thermal power plants and wastewater treatment plants wwtps has become a trend of future urban development lu et al 2018 in fact co2 aeration might be potentially applied for microalgal bacterial process in wastewater treatment trebuch et al 2020 however little is known about the effect of co2 on the characteristic and performance of mbgs which indeed restraints the further application of mbgs towards carbon negative wastewater treatment this study was to systematically look into the effect of co2 on the characteristics and performances of mbgs in municipal wastewater treatment different volume concentrations of co2 i e 15 30 45 and 60 were added to facilitate the mbgs process in municipal wastewater treatment the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of mbgs under different concentrations of co2 were explored organics ammonia and phosphate removals by mbgs process were studied in addition the mechanisms of how co2 impacted on the characteristics and performances of mbgs were elucidated while the greenhouse gases emissions by mbgs process for municipal wastewater treatment with co2 supply were estimated this study was expected to advance our knowledge on the mbgs process for domestic wastewater treatment towards a carbon negative objective 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic municipal wastewater the synthetic municipal wastewater was mainly composed of about 527 mg l naac 115 mg l nh4cl 22 mg l kh2po4 50 mg l mgso4 7h2o 20 mg l cacl2 10 mg l feso4 7h2o 100 mg l nahco3 and 1 ml l trace element solution containing 10

cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p were about 400 30 and 5 mg l respectively with a carbon to nitrogen ratio of around 3 the ph value of the influent was controlled at about 7 2 2 experimental setup the seed mbgs was cultivated from aerobic granules as described before ji et al 2020b with an average size of about 1 1 mm and a sludge volume index at 5 min svi5 of 40 4 4 2 9 ml g standard deviation the sealed cylindrical glass reactor was 8 7 cm high with 3 5 cm diameter and a bottleneck of 1 6 cm in diameter resulting in 63 ml of total volume i e a headspace of 33 ml and an effective working volume of 30 ml the initial volatile suspended solids vss concentration was about 5 0 g l the reactors were fixed at a shaker hk 4 ronghua instrument manufacturing company china with a distance at about 4 cm from each other at about 150 rpm under a full spectrum led light at a light intensity of about 170 μ mol m2 s on the surface of the reactor prior to each cycle the influent was added then 5 ml 10 ml 15 ml and 20 ml co2 was inlet into the reactor with a 20 ml syringe achieving respective co2 concentrations v v of 15 30 45 and 60 these reactors along with the reactors without co2 were operated in duplicate at 6 h hydraulic retention time hrt under 12 h 12 h light dark cycles the liquid solution of the first light cycle was collected with a 20 ml syringe and then passed through a 0 45 μm filter and stored at 4 for further analysis while the biomass were obtained as solid samples for further analyzes or discharged to maintain the vss at about 5 0 g l corresponding to the sludge retention time srt of around 15 d the biomass samples were stored at 80 for microbial community and functional genes analyzes the experiments were conducted in an air conditioning room at about 23 2 3 microbial community and functional genes analysis the total genome dna was extracted by using an e z n a soil dna kit omega biotek inc norcross ga usa and fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa for miseq sequencing and metagenomics sequencing respectively the primer sets 338f 806r and 528f 706r were applied for the amplification of gene fragments for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively ji et al 2021b the miseq sequencing and sequence analyzes were conducted as described before ji et al 2020a to study the microbial community succession of the mbgs the microbial community was also visualized by using an optical microscope rx50 soptop china and a scanning electron microscope zeiss evo18 germany for taxonomy annotation and functional genes analysis metagenomics sequencing was conducted as described elsewhere huang et al 2020 the microbial community of metagenomics was determined with the non redundant gene catalog according to national center for biotechnology information ncbi non redundant protein sequence database while the metabolic pathways analyzes were based on the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database the original sequence data were available in ncbi with the accession no prjna740141 2 4 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen

method lee et al 2015 the aqueous dissolved oxygen do concentrations and ph values were analyzed with a jpb 607a do meter shanghai inesa scientific instrument co ltd china and ph meter starter3100 ohaus usa respectively the granular size was determined via a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 usa extracellular polymeric substances eps of mbgs were extracted by a heat extraction method zhang et al 2016 and analyzed with the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem with a fluorescence spectroscopy f 7100 hitachi high technology corp japan in situ images of the mbgs were non destructively performed using an optical coherence tomography oct gan210c1 thorlab usa the brunauer emmett teller bet specific surface area of mbgs and the pore size distributions were determined with an automatic micromeritics analyzer asap2460 micromeritics usa the carbon and nitrogen contents of the mbgs were measured with an elemental analysis elemantar vario el cube germany and the phosphorus content was determined as described ji et al 2020b 2 5 mass balance calculations the stable operation data from phase iii were selected for the mass balance calculations of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the overall mass balance on carbon can be written as follows 1 influent orga nic carb on m oc inf g d infl uent inor ganic carb on m ic inf g d gase ous carb on befo re reac tion m gc br g d effl uent orga nic carb on m oc eff g d effl uent inor ganic carb on m ic eff g d gase ous carb on after reac tion m gc ar g d carb on conv erted to solid biom ass m sc g d the empirical formulas of mbgs and microalgae was described as c100h158o38n17p ji et al 2020b and c100h178o36n12p boelee et al 2014 respectively for mbgs with no co2 addition the following main reactions were considered 2 50 c h 3 c o o 17 n h 4 h 2 p o 4 34 h c 100 h 158 o 38 n 17 p 9 o 2 48 h 2 o 3 100 h c o 3 17 n h 4 h 2 p o 4 84 h c 100 h 158 o 38 n 17 p 109 o 2 48 h 2 o 4 hco 3 h c o 3 2 where eq 2 is the overall mbgs assimilation reaction with acetate ammonia and dihydrogen phosphate eq 3 is the mbgs assimilation with inorganic carbon of bicarbonate and eq 4 describes the hydrolysis of bicarbonate for mbgs with co2 addition eq 2 also was one of the main reactions while the following main reactions were also taken into account 5 100 c o 2 12 n h 4 h 2 p o 4 69 5 h 2 o 118 75 o 2 11 h c 100 h 178 o 36 n 12 p 6 co 2 h 2 o h h c o 3 it can be seen that the carbon for the biomass growth could be derived from eq 2 for mbgs and eq 5 for microalgae with co2 addition the mass growth of which could be estimated based on the mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen of the biomass revealed by the results of elemental analysis the ph values could be calculated as follows 7 ph l o g h the mass balance on nitrogen and phosphorus was also established similarly whereas the gaseous nitrogen and phosphorus were negligible and not considered 2 6 statistical analysis the results herein presented as mean standard deviations spss software ibm spss statistics 26 was used to compare performance results through one way analysis of variance anova and bivariate correlation analysis where statistically significant difference was assumed at p 0 05 and highly difference was assumed at p 0 01 in addition the regression linear fitting method was used to analyze the data 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 favors optimal granular structure the settling ability of the mbgs with no co2 addition could drop gradually during the two month operation fig 1 a and b the svi5 of the mbgs with no co2 addition could grow gradually in the first 40 d and turn swiftly nearly three fold increase at the end of the experiment fig 2 a this indicated that the structure of mbgs with no co2 addition could gradually turn loose implying the necessity of co2 addition for a long term stable operation of mbgs process the loose structure of mbgs without co2 addition could be ascribed to that the granular surface had a large quantity of filamentous algae and few spherical algae as indicated by fig 1b moreover the oct images apparently indicated that the area of the outer porous layer had exceeded the area of the inner compact part of the mbgs without co2 addition at the end of the experiment it has been generally acknowledged that the filamentous microorganisms can have an adverse effect on the granular settling ability liu and liu 2006 although the filamentous algae can play a significant role in the development of mbgs tiron et al 2017 milferstedt et al 2017 the overgrowth of which may cause the bulking of mbgs furthermore the bet results also confirmed the porous structure of mbgs without co2 stimulation evidenced by the lowest average pore size of 35 nm and the highest specific surface area of 0 64 m2 g table s1 as such it can be concluded that the physical structure of mbgs with no co2 addition could have a trend to be loose and disintegrated under long period operations fig 1b suggested that 15 co2 could well maintain the dense structure of mbgs evidenced by the lowest svi5 of 36 5 ml g at the end of the experiment fig 2a and table s1 specifically the spherical algae could well grow with the filamentous algae on the outer surface of mbgs to form a mat like structure with an excellent granular stability milferstedt et al 2017 the significant reduced chl a chl b ratio shown in fig 2b further suggested that a considerable proportion of spherical green algae could grow with co2 addition considering that the filamentous prokaryotic algae contained only chl a and the spherical eukaryotic algae contained both chl a and chl b in addition co2 addition could promote the production of extracellular polysaccharides significantly fig s1 favoring the granular stability seviour et al 2019 concurrently extracellular aromatic protein production was also enhanced with co2 supply as reflected by the fluorescence spectrum analysis fig s2 which also contributed to the granular stability wang et al 2022 zhu et al 2012 zhang et al 2018 figs 1 and s3 also indicate that the mbgs could gradually adapt to different concentrations of co2 the mbgs with no co2 addition exhibited no suspended algae growth throughout the whole experiment period of two months the phase i witnessed that 15 co2 contributed most to the growth of suspended algae however the amount of suspended biomass gradually diminished after then indicating that the mbgs could adapt to 15 co2 in about 20 d likewise the mbgs could adapt to 60 co2 in about 40 d during the phase iii the average concentrations of suspended algae in all reactors were less than 15 mg l fig s3 accounting for 0 3 of the total biomass concentration of 5 0 g l specifically 15 and 30 co2 resulted in the low concentration of suspended algae of around 5 0 mg l fig s3 implying its favorable function in maintaining the granular integrity it was observed that the average ph values in the mbgs system with no co2 addition could increase from 7 33 to 9 54 fig 3 a due to the acid consumption indicated by eq 2 although the bicarbonate could offer the aqueous buffering capacity as revealed by eq 4 an alkalinity of bicarbonate of around 60 mg l as caco3 seemed to be not enough to prevent considerable ph fluctuations in this study on the contrary co2 addition could adjust the aqueous ph values hu et al 2017 of mbgs systems as revealed by eqs 5 and 6 i e altering from an alkaline aqueous environment to a neutral aqueous environment fig 3a which was generally more suitable for the living of microbes the average do concentrations at the end of each cycle in all reactors during phase iii were over 3 0 mg l fig 3b suggesting an aerobic atmosphere in mbgs systems could be generated under 0 to 60 co2 concentrations over 6 h it appeared that higher co2 concentrations i e mix trophic cultivation of mbgs could lead to relatively lower do concentrations at the end of each cycle fig 3b although co2 could promote the microalgal photosynthesis the respiration process could be suppressed by high levels of co2 hu et al 2001 thus the co2 in the biological system was not fully utilized within 6 h in this study 3 2 how did co2 affect the performance of mbgs process 3 2 1 co2 enhanced cod removal by mbgs figs 4 and s4 indicated that co2 introduction could slightly impair the cod removal in phase i however when the mbgs gradually adapted to the environment with extra co2 addition the cod removal could be enhanced in phases ii and iii during the steady state of phase iii the average cod removals were 81 2 4 8 88 7 3 7 91 3 3 1 91 4 3 4 and 91 7 3 3 mean standard deviations for 0 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition with the average cod removal rates displayed in table 1 it indicated that the addition of co2 could indeed improve the cod removal with an average cod removal of over 90 during the steady state of phase iii this could be ascribed to that co2 could maintain the dense structure of mbgs moreover mbgs might accumulate additional carbon stored as cellular glycogen or lipid ji et al 2020c liu et al 2018a there was no significant difference of cod removal efficiency among reactors with 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition p 0 05 suggesting that 15 co2 was sufficient as for cod removal improvement by mbgs process 3 2 2 ammonia removal rate was not impacted by co2 addition fig 4 indicated that 15 and 30 co2 had no significant impact on ammonia removal in phases i and ii p 0 05 during the steady state of phase iii the average ammonia n removals were 85 9 4 7 69 8 3 9 77 3 4 7 74 0 2 9 and 68 8 3 9 mean standard deviations for 0 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition respectively however the average ammonia n removal rates were close to each other as depicted in table 1 since nitrate or nitrite were undetectable throughout the experiment it is reasonable to consider that the ammonia was removed through microalgal bacterial assimilation by mbgs which was in accordance with our previous reports ji et al 2021a 2021b apart from algal competition with bacteria for ammonia huang et al 2015 co2 could inhibit microbial enzymes related to denitrification wan et al 2016 which further confirmed that the ammonia removal was relied on assimilation rather than dissimilation by mbgs a higher mass ratio of microalgae to bacteria could be achieved with co2 introduction this can be explained by that co2 caused the increase of eukaryotic algae due to the promotion of photosynthesis while some bacteria could be eliminated with co2 addition due to the inhabitation of respiration hu et al 2001 3 2 3 co2 enhanced phosphate removal by mbgs overall co2 could enhance phosphate removal during the steady state of phase iii the average phosphate removals were 50 1 10 3 54 4 8 2 67 3 5 8 70 2 6 7 and 72 3 6 7 mean standard deviations for 0 15 30 45 and 60 co2 addition respectively with the average phosphate p removal rates depicted in table 1 the addition of co2 could significantly reduce the aqueous ph values from slightly alkaline to nearly neutral fig 3a although a higher ph value favored chemical phosphorus removal by forming calcium phosphate peng et al 2018 the accompanied carbonate could compete with phosphate for calcium at ph 9 2 cao and harris 2008 in addition the nearly neutral aqueous environment could favor the biological phosphorus removal it was proposed that the optimal initial ph values for biological phosphate removal should be controlled between 6 4 and 7 2 liu et al 2007 when ph was higher than 8 2 the biological phosphorus uptake rate significantly decreased serralta et al 2006 it was also reported that ph controlled at neutral level was the prerequisite for algal phosphorus removal from wastewater lavrinovičs et al 2020 in fact the phosphorus accumulating organisms pao can be enriched with co2 addition in this study as explained later this gave a plausible explanation for the enhanced phosphorus removal with the supply of co2 to the mbgs system 3 3 microbial community succession overall co2 could promote the growth of chlorella as indicated by figs 1b 5 and 6 in contrast some genera of bacteria were gradually eliminated with co2 addition azotobacter an aerobic nitrogen fixing heterotrophic bacterium was gradually disappeared with elevated co2 concentrations fig 5 although aquimonas was reported to be able to grow at ph 6 11 saha et al 2005 its abundance could be gradually diminished with co2 addition some bacteria could well be kept in the mbgs during the two month operation for example photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter could well grow with algae in mbgs however some bacteria gradually turned predominant species acidovorax was enriched with co2 addition due to its acidification while delftia was also enriched these results indicated that co2 indeed altered the microbial community of mbgs via altering the aqueous ph values 3 4 mechanisms involved for the co2 effect on pollutants removal of mbgs metagenomic results indicated that co2 addition promoted the growth of spherical green algae i e chlorellaceae which was in agreement with the microscopic results as describe above in fig 1 the predominant chlorellaceae could contribute to organics removal which gave a plausible explanation of the improvement of cod removal by the introduction of co2 due to the increased fraction of the eukaryotic algae the algae to bacteria ratio increased with co2 addition fig 6a and b since algae generally has a relatively lower mass content of nitrogen than bacteria as reflected by their respective empirical formulas of c100h178o36n12p and c100h140o40n20p1 7 boelee et al 2014 the mbgs would exhibit slightly lower ammonia assimilation potential with co2 addition as for the phosphorus removal the main contributor was closely associated with pao which contained phosphorus accumulating bacteria and phosphorus accumulating algae such as comamonadaceae qin et al 2018 and leptolyngbyaceae ji et al 2020c respectively obviously the abundance of pao was in proportion to the co2 concentration fig 6c and d which favored the biological phosphate removal by mbgs hence co2 addition could promote the organics and phosphorus assimilation by mbgs evidenced by the higher carbon and phosphorus contents of mbgs with co2 addition than those with no co2 addition table 2 the initial key metabolic pathways in regard with the biological transformation of organics ammonia and phosphate were displayed in fig 7 it indicated that the abundance of acetate coa ligase increased with co2 addition which implied that the organics assimilation might be enhanced by co2 by mbgs the relative amount of genes encoding glutamate dehydrogenase was apparently dropped with the elevation of co2 concentrations while the abundance of genes encoding glutamine synthetase was raised by 15 co2 addition for mbgs moreover co2 addition could increase the relative abundance of genes encoding atpase which might facilitate the mbgs to better utilize phosphorus for energy production to further understand the co2 effect on pollutants removal of mbgs the mass balances of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were determined over the stable phase iii of mbgs process fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8a about one third of inorganic carbon i e bicarbonate could be assimilated by mbgs with no co2 supply eq 3 during this process the alkalinity brought by bicarbonate of about 60 mg l as caco3 could provide certain buffering capacity of the media by generating h eq 4 to make up the h exhaustion by the acetate uptake for algal bacterial growth eq 2 by the introduction of co2 the co2 dissolved in water could produce h eq 6 while the generated bicarbonate acting as a carbon pool zhu et al 2020 vadlamani et al 2019 could promote the microalgal growth considering that wastewater with more bicarbonate than organics favored only microalgal growth in a microalgal bacterial system mohamed et al 2021 concurrently co2 addition could add bicarbonate and enhance the liquid buffering capacity to maintain the ph values of the mbgs system in addition figs 8b and 2a also indicated that 15 co2 addition was enough for the mbgs since there was surplus co2 gas after reaction in all reactors with 15 to 60 co2 introduction the specific carbon removal rate of co2 by mbgs was around 2 0 mg c g vss h with 15 to 60 co2 addition as revealed by fig 8b which could serve as the guidance for future application of mbgs for wastewater treatment with co2 addition similar to the disposal of organics the nitrogen and phosphorus appeared to be more stably removed from the liquid with the present of co2 fig 8c and d to sum up co2 addition could add the additional carbon source as well as enhance the buffering capacity for the mbgs system while altering the microbial community and function to guarantee the dense property with an excellent bioactivity of mbgs for efficient pollutants removal 4 towards carbon negative municipal wastewater treatment currently wwtps have been realized to be one of the emitters of greenhouse gases with conventional activated sludge as the core process liu et al 2019 co2 can be simply derived from the flue gas with a co2 content of up to 15 lage et al 2021 while the continuous co2 addtion during daytime should be adopted for the large scale application of mbgs process based on the varied environmental conditions as well as the wastewater compositions to further address the potential prospect of the mbgs process towards an objective of carbon negative wastewater treatment china was selected as an example for the estimations of greenhouse gases emissions since china had the world s largest wastewater sector qu et al 2019 the annual municipal wastewater in china was around 57 109 m3 mohurd 2020 xu et al 2020 with average influent cod and nitrogen concentrations of about 220 g m3 and 30 g m3 guo et al 2018 sun et al 2016 respectively as such the average mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen of wastewater was estimated to be 220 30 12 32 2 75 theoretically the mbgs could assimilate the organics and nitrogen as a mass ratio of carbon to nitrogen of about 5 as reflected by table 2 as well as the empirical formula of mbgs of c100h158o38n17p ji et al 2020b thus additional carbon from co2 should be supplied to the mbgs system which was about 30 g m3 5 2 75 67 5 g m3 carbon equivalent to 247 5 g m3 co2 in addition the n2o and ch4 emissions in the non aerated mbgs process could be negligible ji et al 2020b wang et al 2020a safitri et al 2021 while the harvested mbgs biomass could be simply used as biofertilizer and raw materials for bio oil production hence the mbgs process was expected to achieve negative greenhouse gases emissions of about 57 109 m3 yr 247 5 g m3 co2 14 1 106 tones co2 yr for china this suggested that the mbgs process was likely to achieve a carbon negative goal in treating municipal wastewater given the results of the lab scale experiments on mbgs process future work should dedicated to explore the co2 aeration strategy while using the waste flue gases for real domestic wastewater treatment under outdoor conditions 5 conclusions mbgs could gradually adapt to 0 to 60 co2 concentrations co2 addition could be applied to maintain the stable and dense granular structure and to enhance the overall reactor performances of mbgs the microbial communities and metabolisms pathways of mbgs were altered with co2 introduction algae to bacteria ratio and pao abundance could be significantly increased with co2 addition the functions of mbgs related to pollutants removal was overall enhanced as revealed by the increase of abundance of functional genes encoding acetate coa ligase glutamine synthetase and atpase etc the specific carbon removal rate of co2 by mbgs was revealed to be around 2 0 mg c g vss h further analyzes suggested that co2 could be applied for mbgs to treat domestic wastewater towards a carbon negative objective credit authorship contribution statement bin ji conceptualization funding acquisition supervision validation writing original draft
