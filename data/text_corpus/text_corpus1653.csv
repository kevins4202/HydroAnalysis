8265,the frequency and severity of floods in ghanaian cities have been increasing typically increased floods have been attributed to climate change with limited evidence although this may be true in some cases it minimizes the role of landscape change as a result of urban growth given the complexity of cities this study characterizes urban morphology types and incorporate them with physiographic data to estimate the peak surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality of ghana the urban morphology was categorized into high moderate and low dense human settlements and further characterized based on the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains the results identify vulnerable areas with information on surface runoff thus facilitating the spatial targeting of intervention efforts we found that room for flood waters is inadequate in terms of the capacity of storm water drains and the land area left after human development for storm water drains the size is inadequate their sanitary condition needs improvement and their number need increasing based on catchment area informal and unstructured human settlements reduce the available room and artificially extend the flow path of runoff which promotes flow accumulation thereby increasing the volume and destructive impact of flood waters the study recommends intervention efforts to spatially target the creation of adequate room for flood waters to flow keywords urban flood urban morphology surface runoff flood control 1 introduction flood incidences are now frequently and widely reported worldwide where between 2008 and 2010 alone 168 out of 196 countries have reported flood incidences and 137 cities experienced major floods three or more times per year sanderson and sharma 2016 floods cause a lot of damage to the natural and the human environment with associated economic costs human costs relating to fatalities physical injuries and diseases and ecosystem costs these costs have been widely reported in the literature including healthcare costs neal 2014 vlachos 2010 economic costs ansah et al 2020 fox 2004 social costs ahadzie et al 2016 asumadu sarkodie et al 2015 karley 2009 and ecosystem costs talbot et al 2018 newman et al 2005 hickey and salas 1995 the severity and costs of flood impact are particularly heightened and augmented in cities or urban areas because of the agglomeration of socioeconomic activities infrastructure and people flooding in cities has been widely attributed to urbanization in flood plain areas nkwunonwo et al 2020 al zahrani 2018 rafiq et al 2016 urbanization increases population and building densities which directly increase surface sealing and impervious areas leading to rapid amplification in the volume and velocity of surface runoff urban growth has been shown to disrupt mass and energy flows in ecosystems and has been the key driver in creating artificial floods su et al 2014 alexakis et al 2013 suriya and mudgal 2012 endreny 2006 walsh et al 2012 according to the united nation s population division of the department of economic and social affairs urbanization together with the overall global population growth could add 2 5 billion people to urban areas by 2050 with about 90 percent of this increase projected to take place in asia and africa a recent urban typology of world cities by oke et al 2019 has labelled most african cities as congested emerging that is cities characterized by high growth lower but increasing population and are developing in ghana more than half of the population already live in towns and cities ghana statistical service 2014 urban growth in ghana is often associated with unplanned poorly planned and informal human settlements which are overcrowded obstruct flood prone areas and lack essential flood control infrastructure thereby intensifying flood incidence and aggravating their societal impacts it has been widely reported that intensive and unplanned human settlements in flood prone areas are the key drivers of increasing flood risk in africa mensah and ahadzie 2020a aram et al 2019 baldassarre et al 2010 this has been confirmed in the local context where the majority of urban floods in ghana are primarily caused and aggravated by poor spatial planning rapid population growth and poor sanitation mensah and ahadzie 2020a ansah et al 2020 abeka et al 2020 abass et al 2019 twum and abubakari 2019 amoako 2018 slums and informal settlements characterized by overcrowding often lack essential flood control infrastructure and services such as storm water drains and sanitation cobbinah and erdiaw kwasie 2016 grant and nijman 2002 additionally these cities often lack ground hydro meteorological stations needed for monitoring hydro climatic variables and for the verification of remotely sensed data and modeling investigations consequently the costs of flood impact have been increasing in frequency and in intensity particularly in the greater kumasi area ansah et al 2020 mensah and ahadzie 2020b amoateng et al 2018 campion and venzke 2013 according to ghana s national and disaster management organization nadmo records in greater kumasi 12 flood cases together with 391 affected people were reported in 2012 whereas in 2017 there were 38 cases together with 3236 affected people given the impact of urban growth on flood incidence several studies have investigated the relationship between flooding and different land cover types and land uses suriya and mudgal 2012 recommended an integrated approach through explicit incorporation of land use change into hydrological models al zahrani 2018 quantified the impact on urbanization and rainfall intensity on peak discharge and runoff volume showing that 80 percent level of urbanization results in a 213 increase in peak flow and 112 increase in runoff volume in hafr al batin city saudi arabia the impact of urbanization has been found to be higher for small rainfall events compared to larger events indicating a high sensitivity of peak flow to urbanization for rainfall with short return periods al zahrani 2018 that is urbanization directly leads to increased flood incidence even when there are no changes in the temporal variability of rainfall increased frequency of runoff has been correlated with increased area of impervious surfaces where runoff frequency has been estimated to increase by a factor of ten or more geoscience australia 2019b walsh et al 2012 these findings are widely supported in the literature erena and worku 2019 ohana levi et al 2018 suriya and mudgal 2012 to explicitly account for urbanization there is the need to include urban morphology in flood modeling and prediction urban morphology include the spatial analysis of urban structures land use street patterns buildings open space the nature of human settlement and the process of their formation and transformation kropf 2017 ravari and mazloomi 2015 inclusion of urban morphology into flood estimation is needed since urban growth can occur through geographical expansion from the urban core into the outskirts or by infilling of existing open land areas leading to intensification of buildings these two examples of urban growth will affect flood incidence in different ways and each need to be properly characterized and integrated into flood estimation past studies have reported unplanned human settlements as drivers of urban flood but there are limited work which actually quantify the geographical space left for flood waters to flow in the event of flood also the attribution of urban flood in ghana mostly to climate change is rarely backed by data and is often misguided this attribution unfairly associates the problem of urban flood to climate change only and minimizes the role of landscape change brought about by human settlements this is partly because the majority of flood impacts in ghana are descriptive or narrative in terms of the number of cases and fatalities but information about flood volume velocity of flood waters and flood height are rarely quantified the issue is compounded by limited monitoring and modeling evidence in terms of how floods occur in urban areas thus modeling and field investigations are needed for flood estimation flood frequency flow direction and accumulation in order to provide crucial information for flood risk management mensah and ahadzie 2020a accordingly this paper characterizes urban morphology types and incorporated them with soil properties topography and rainfall data to estimate surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality of greater kumasi in ghana the study characterizes urban morphology in the context of hydrology by identifying three urban morphology types high dense moderate dense and low dense human settlements this characterization was further augmented by mapping the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains in each of the three urban morphology types storm water drains are crucial in urban areas because of the increased volume and velocity of surface runoff the horizontal spacing between buildings is particularly important for informal settlements due to their dis jointed arrangements which scarcely leaves open land area for flood waters to flow this is because most informal settlements have limited storm water drains such that the open spaces between buildings are often the only room left for flood waters to flow the study demonstrates the quantification of surface runoff for different urban morphology types with the capability to spatially target intervention efforts and better inform flood control planning and decision making the spatial targeting of flood control based on urban morphology is further calibrated using information on horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains therefore the study provides a framework for flood control measures that are spatially targeted towards specific urban morphology types in each community and not using a one size fits all approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the study was conducted in oforikrom municipality in the ashanti region of ghana shown in fig 1 the oforikrom municipality covers a total land area of about 50 km2 and is bounded in the north by asokore mampong in the east by ejisu in the south west by asokwa municipal assembly and in the west by kumasi metropolitan assembly according to the 2010 population and housing census the oforikrom municipality has a population of 303 016 comprising about 47 males and 53 females ghana statistical service 2014 the greater portion about 55 percent of the oforikrom municipality is made up of urban development with the remaining covered predominately by natural vegetation and cropland there is rapid urbanization in oforikrom municipality which has accelerated the conversion of fragile natural environments leading to increased incidence of flooding in hotspot areas like aboabo anloga and oforikrom the oforikrom municipality lies in the wet sub equatorial climate region with an average minimum temperature of about 21 5 degrees celsius and an average maximum temperature of 30 7 degrees celsius humidity is about 84 percent in the morning 9am and about 60 percent in the afternoon 3 pm there are two rainy seasons in the oforikrom municipality with the first peak in june and the second peak in october and an average annual rainfall amount of about 1450 mm also oforikrom municipality lies within the moist semi deciduous south east ecological zone the soil forest ochrosols is rich in plant nutrients and supports agriculture in the periphery towns such as appiadu and kokoben a speckle of vegetation reserve within the municipality is located in the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology knust botanical gardens and aprade and bebre the geology in the area is predominantly middle precambrian rocks residing on the plateau of the south west physical region which ranges from 250 to 300 m above sea level the topography is relatively undulating and is traversed by water bodies including the subin wiwi susan and aboabo 2 2 data sources the topography of the oforikrom municipality was generated from digital elevation model dem which was obtained from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster the aster dem has a spatial resolution of about 30 m the soil properties data set was obtained from the global soil grids hengl et al 2017 with a spatial resolution of 250 m the land cover data was obtained from the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci the esa cci land cover data set has a spatial resolution of 300 m and a temporal coverage from 1992 to 2015 a high resolution satellite imagery was obtained from openstreetmap osm which is a collaborative worldwide mapping project providing spatial data globally jokar arsanjani et al 2015 maron 2015 haklay 2010 additional high resolution satellite imagery was obtained from the openmaptiles satellite https openmaptiles com satellite these high resolution satellite imageries were used to generate the different urban morphological types in the oforikrom municipality due to the wide disparities between different land cover products high resolution satellite imageries have been widely recognized to provide a clear and distinct identification of features on the land surface long term rainfall data set was obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc version 7 the long term rainfall data set has a spatial resolution of 5 km with a 116 year temporal coverage from 1901 to 2016 also daily rainfall data at ground station level was obtained from the ghana meteorological services gmet covering a time period of 37 years from 1980 to 2016 population density data set was obtained from the humanitarian data exchange https data humdata org at about 100 m spatial resolution and a temporal coverage from 2000 to 2020 2 3 methods and data analysis the overall methodology of the study is presented in fig 2 highlighting the key components to be incorporated to investigate the linkages between urban morphology types and flooding in the oforikrom municipality a detailed description of the various components are provided in the sections following note that detailed presentation of the outputs and their discussion are provided in the results and discussion section 2 4 temporal analysis of rainfall data a time series analysis of the rainfall data was undertaken to ascertain whether the historical pattern of rainfall has changed in the oforikrom municipality the assembled rainfall data set was examined at three time steps annual seasonal or monthly and daily levels the evaluation at an annual time period examined the long term pattern of rainfall variability whereas the monthly analysis was to determine whether the seasonality of rainfall has changed in the oforikrom municipality also some flood incidences such as flash floods are caused by large amounts of rainfall within short time periods to account for this the rainfall record was analyzed at daily time period to find out whether rainfall incidents at the daily time scale has changed over the years sub daily rainfall data set is the ideal for this analysis but is not available in the study area the long term 106 year rainfall record was used for the analysis at the annual time period whereas the 37 year station daily rainfall data set was used for the analysis at the monthly and daily time periods the long term gridded rainfall record was compared against the 37 year station rainfall data using correlation coefficient which was found to be 0 545 given the geographic disparity between the two rainfall records 5 km and point the correlation coefficient of 0 545 was deemed reasonable in addition wavelet power spectrum wps was used to analyze the rainfall data in temporal and spectral domains wavelets are efficient for analysis of harmonic time series in both temporal and spectral domains where they can decompose sampled time series into different resolutions scales base functions that vary with respect to time and frequency thereby allowing detection of localized changes torrence compo 1998 this is especially useful for non stationary data like rainfall time series this study employed the continuous wavelet transform cwt to compute the wave power spectrum wps in order to quantify the distribution of variances in the monthly rainfall from 1980 to 2016 mathematically cwt is expressed in eq 1 1 c a b 1 a s t ψ t b a d t where c is the wavelet coefficient a and b are the scale and position functions respectively s t is the signal and ψ is the wavelet function the morlet wavelet was used as the mother wavelet since it is well suited for feature extraction from oscillatory samples such as rainfall jänicke et al 2009 2 5 derivation of urban morphology types it is widely recognized that land use and land cover products vary across different global data providers a comparison by gis geography 2016 showed significant differences in land cover characterization based on several products including global land survey climate change initiative cci land cover version 2 osm land use data modis based global land cover climatology usgs global land cover characterization globeland30 un fao global land cover network and terra populus terrapop the openstreetmap land use data which uses high resolution satellite imagery was found to provide the most accurate land cover characterization based on its finer scale and its detailed depiction of human activities on land gis geography 2016 hence the high resolution satellite imageries from openstreetmap and openmaptiles satellite were used to generate the urban morphology types in the oforikrom municipality the high resolution satellite imageries were georeferenced by matching the coordinates of locations in the imagery to those on the ground the ground coordinates were obtained by using standard handheld global positioning system gps with an accuracy range from 1 to 2 meters the georeferencing procedure ensures that the geometry and the position of features on the satellite imagery actually match those on the ground the georeferenced imagery was then used in on screen digitization to delineate the outline of the different urban morphological types the digitized morphological types included grassland tree cover wooded grassland bare ground water bodies high dense settlements moderate dense settlements and low dense settlements a graphical outline of the urban morphological types is shown in fig 3 the morphology types were digitized primarily based on density and compactness of settlements and presence and density of vegetation a brief description of the various urban morphology types is provided in the following high dense settlement primarily consist of buildings that have limited spacing with virtually no or little vegetation cover the level of socio economic activity is considered to be very high moderate dense settlement mainly consist of buildings that are moderately spaced with some spots of vegetation cover the level of socio economic activity is considered to be somewhat high low dense settlement consist of few and widely spaced buildings with much vegetation cover the level of socio economic activity is considered to be low tree cover an area with dominant tree cover and virtually no buildings wooded grassland a mix of trees and grass or shrub where trees cover less than 50 percent of the area grassland an area with dominant grass cover it has very few trees and virtually no buildings farmland an area with dominant crop cover including fallow and tillage areas it has very few trees and virtually no buildings vegetated park urban area parks with vegetation cover urban parks with no vegetation are classified under bare ground bare ground a land with exposed soil or patched land with virtually no vegetation or buildings farmlands left to fallow or tillage lands are excluded 2 5 1 measurement of horizontal spacing between buildings the high level of informal settlements in the oforikrom municipality means that there are limited land space available for overland flow to move unimpeded the quantification of the available horizontal space left after urban development is one of the indicators of compactness i e the level of closeness of buildings relevant for the flow of urban flood in the absence of storm water drains the horizontal space between buildings is the only space for surface runoff which make them very critical in terms of flow accumulation limited horizontal space between buildings means surface runoff will quickly accumulate and vice versa accordingly to get a better understanding of the urban morphology that is of relevance to flooding measurement of the horizontal spacing or distance between buildings was undertaken at sampled locations in select towns the select towns were chosen such that there are representations from the low dense moderate dense and high dense settlements given the high level of socio economic activity in urban areas the horizontal distance between buildings was determined using a foot stepping approach the number of footsteps were calibrated against different known distances under different walking conditions such as walking on a paved and unpaved surfaces sloping and rugged surfaces and vegetated and non vegetated surfaces based on the calibration procedure a single footstep was determined to correspond to a standard value of 0 762 m the number of footsteps covered between buildings pairs were then used to estimate the corresponding distance in meters it is noted that the majority of the side by side horizontal spacing between buildings in high dense and moderate dense settlements are almost zero so the measured distances for these areas are any available space between buildings for low dense settlements the side by side horizontal spacing between buildings is often characteristic of any available horizontal space between buildings for each settlement category three 3 different communities were sampled to determine the horizontal spacing between buildings in sum nine 9 communities were sampled where aboabo anloga and oforikrom represent high dense settlements ayeduase kotei and deduako typify moderate dense settlements and knust apemso and appiadu stand for low dense settlements 2 5 2 mapping of storm water drains gutters as part of getting an understanding of the urban morphology that is of relevance to flooding mapping of the storm water drains or gutters was undertaken at sampled locations in select towns the selected communities include aboabo anloga oforikrom ayeduase kotei deduako knust apemso and appiadu as noted earlier the select towns were chosen such that there are representations from the low dense moderate dense and high dense settlements the locations of the sampled gutters were obtained by using handheld gps the gutters were characterized based on two criteria size width and depth which make up the cross sectional area and sanitary condition the onsite measurement of gutter size or carrying capacity was determined using a tape measure whereas the sanitary condition of the gutters were described as choked moderately choked or not choked a gutter is considered choked when more than half of its depth is filled with dirt or garbage and moderately choked when about half or less than half of its depth is filled with dirt or garbage a gutter is considered not choked or clean when its bottom can be seen from above and there are no dirt or garbage in it 2 5 3 determination of flow paths and estimation of surface runoff to determine the natural flow paths based on topography the dem was used to derive the sub catchments and the flow channel network in the oforikrom municipality the analysis was performed using an open source geographic information system qgis which also facilitated all analysis of spatial data used in this study the derived flow channel network identifies the areas for flow accumulation and flow paths to be followed by surface runoff in the event of flooding while the identification of the flow paths is relevant it is also important to estimate the amount of surface runoff that can be generated at different spatial locations in the oforikrom municipality the surface runoff estimated is specifically the peak discharge which is the highest concentration of runoff from the catchment from a specific rainfall event to estimate the peak surface runoff the rational method of rainfall runoff modeling was used which is inexpensive appropriate for small catchments and most suitable for urban areas the rational method assumes a proportionality between peak discharge and rainfall intensity based on eq 2 2 q p k u r a d i c r a p f where qpk is the peak flow rate in m3 s ur is a uni conversion factor 0 278 ad is the drainage area in sq km i is the rainfall intensity in mm hr cr is the runoff coefficient which is dependent on the land cover and use and apf is the antecedent precipitation factor the runoff coefficient cr is the ratio of peak streamflow per unit area to rainfall intensity thus it estimates the quantity of runoff generated relative to the amount of precipitation received based on land use information the cr is dimensionless and has values ranging between 0 05 for gently sloping lawns and 0 95 for highly urbanized areas of roofs and pavements the estimated peak surface runoff based on the rational method is highly sensitive to the value chosen for the cr it is acknowledged that the rational method is limited because of its high dependence on the cr value which has been widely reported to vary for different storms and differing antecedent moisture conditions erena and worku 2019 al zahrani 2018 mahmoud and alazba 2015 however the method is suitable for urban areas particularly in informal settlements where there are often insufficient rainfall runoff observations coombes et al 2015 geoscience australia 2019a the cr accounts for the type of soil and the slope and the land use land cover of an area the soil information was obtained from the collected global soil grids the slope values were derived from the dem using qgis whereas the derived urban morphology types were used in place of the land use information these information were used to look up the appropriate values for cr and combined with the rainfall intensity to estimate the peak surface runoff the rainfall intensity i was estimated from intensity duration frequency idf curve which relates the rainfall intensity with its duration and frequency of occurrence idf curve for kumasi which was developed by sulemana et al 2017 was used to lookup the rainfall intensity given the duration for the rational method the duration must correspond to the time of concentration which is the time required for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point in the catchment to the outlet the time of concentration tc was approximated using the overland flow nomagraph based on the seelye chart the seelye chart requires the length of overland flow the coefficient of imperviousness and the slope of the channel in percentage given that the model was run on a raster grid of 30 m resolution the length of the overland flow was taken to be 42 4 m about 139 2 ft the surface condition of the channel mostly include poor grass bare soil and paved surface these surfaces were used to determine the coefficient of imperviousness the average slope of the catchment is about 10 percent based on these values the overall tc was estimated to be about 10 5 min which correspond to a rainfall intensity of about 100 mm hr for 1 year flood 130 mm hr for 2 year flood 160 mm hr for 5 year flood 185 mm hr for 10 year flood 205 mm hr for 20 year flood 220 mm hr for 30 year flood and 235 mm hr for 50 year flood the rainfall intensity of 160 mm hr for 5 year flood was used as indicative of a short medium term event to determine the antecedent precipitation factor a simple approach was adopted to find the difference between the annual precipitation and the annual evapotranspiration the annual rainfall used for the oforikrom municipality was estimated as the overall average from the 116 year long term rainfall record to be 1383 mm the annual evapotranspiration was estimated to be about 937 mm for the oforikrom municipality from the famine early warning systems network fews net at the url https earlywarning usgs gov fews the annual antecedent precipitation is about 446 mm which averagely works out to be 1 2 mm day it is noteworthy that the rational method was used in this study to estimate the peak flow with no flow routing performed on the grids and that the approach has been widely recognized to be unsuitable for volume estimates coombes et al 2015 geoscience australia 2019b simpson 2014 the estimated peak surface runoff specifically relates a rainfall event 3 results 3 1 temporal pattern of rainfall in oforikrom municipality as noted the increasing incidence of flood in greater kumasi has been widely reported in literature ansah et al 2020 mensah and ahadzie 2020b amoateng et al 2018 campion and venzke 2013 to examine the role of climate impact on flooding we undertook rainfall analysis at the annual monthly and daily time periods it is acknowledged that climatic impacts are not only limited to rainfall but in terms of flooding rainfall is a key variable we examine the long term pattern of rainfall to demonstrate that the increasing flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality is highly unlikely to be due to increased rainfall caused by climate change the result in fig 4 plot a is a presentation of the long term annual rainfall and the 37 year monthly rainfall together with the monthly number of rain days in the oforikrom municipality the long term rainfall trend shows that annual rainfall amount in comparison with the overall average has been declining since 1969 that is the annual rainfall records from 1969 to 2016 has been consistently lower compared to the trend from 1901 to 1968 uniquely all the annual rainfall record from 2010 to 2016 are all consistently below the long term average that is the oforikrom municipality is getting drier based on the year to year rainfall amounts on an annual basis rainfall amounts are not increasing to directly result in increased flood incidences it is acknowledged that annual rainfall amounts is not the only variable to be used to explain the incidence of floods high amounts of rainfall within short time periods such as seasonal time steps in the case of torrential rainfall can cause flash floods accordingly the rainfall trend is examined for seasonal variability using select peak rainfall months may june september and october all shown in fig 4 plot b the seasonal variability based on the 37 year rainfall shows that the pattern of monthly variation is similar at least monthly rainfall amounts have not increased for recent years 2000s the overall average values of the monthly rainfall are 163 mm for may 222 mm for june 177 mm for september and 158 mm for october the overall average values of the monthly rainfall was compared against the 37 year monthly rainfall trend for the months may and october there are no considerable departures from their overall average values the month of june has some consistent increases in the 2000s for example 2000 2009 2012 and 2015 the month september has one significant increase in 2007 while the remaining years show consistent departures from the overall average value on a monthly basis only june showed slight increases in monthly rainfall with no upward increases for may september and october in addition the number of rain days for the select peak rainfall months may june september and october are presented in fig 4 plot c the overall average values of the monthly rain days are 13 0 for may 15 1 for june 15 5 for september and 15 8 for october the month of may shows a consistent trend across the various years with no significant departures from the overall average value for june 1997 and 2000 are the two years which show significant upward departure from the rest of the years the trend for september shows a cyclical pattern as the other months with only 2007 having an upward departure from the average value the high number of rain days in september 2007 directly corresponds to its high rainfall amount for october there is a slight increase in the number of rain days for 2006 and 2010 when the monthly rainfall amounts were correlated to the number of monthly rain days the correlation coefficients were 0 542 for may 0 560 for june 0 560 for september and 0 470 for october that is the majority of the high rainfall amounts positively correlate to the high number of rain days overall the pattern of the number of rain days for the various months remained almost unchanged across the 37 year rainfall record further the result in fig 5 is a presentation of the 37 year daily rainfall for two of the peak rainfall months of june and september in the oforikrom municipality the months of june and september are used here for illustration purposes june has the largest rainfall amount among the four peak rainfall months while september has the highest rainfall amount in 2007 the daily variability for june and september shows that daily rainfall amounts have not increased in the oforikrom municipality from the 2000s the highest daily rainfall amount was recorded on 13 june 1986 for june and 13 september 1992 for september in addition fig 6 which is based on wavelet analysis of the daily rainfall presents the results of the wavelet analysis of the monthly rainfall series from 1980 to 2016 the annual cycle 1 year period is observed to be the most significant as shown in the wavelet spectrum in fig 6 b and c the averaged power of the series at the annual cycle is shown in fig 6 d the averaged power and spectrum in fig 6 d and b indicate peaks around 1985 and 1989 1996 and 2002 whereas a maximum peak was observed in 2007 on the other hand troughs are evident in 1983 1990 2005 and 2013 the former and latter periods are coincident with wet and dry spells over west africa in general from the 1980s to the 2000s andam akorful et al 2017 from the averaged power spectrum lower amplitudes in maximum rainfall are observable from 2010 to 2016 relative to previous periods that is 1985 2007 this indicates lower monthly rainfall intensities from 2010 these results have established that the temporal pattern of rainfall at the annual seasonal and daily time periods have not increased to induce more floods in the oforikrom municipality this finding is consistent with those from abass et al 2019 thus the increased incidence of flood in the oforikrom municipality is not directly linked to rainfall amounts and variability but perhaps due to changes in the landscape the landscape changes in the oforikrom municipality are examined in the following sections 3 2 landscape changes in the oforikrom municipality based on the land cover data obtained from the esa cci land cover we present the cover categories found in the oforikrom municipality the results in fig 7 show the land cover categories for 1995 2005 and 2015 in the oforikrom municipality for each land cover category the area coverages in percentage for 1995 2005 and 2015 are presented in table 1 the results show increased expansion of urban settlements into vegetated areas the geographical coverage of urban areas doubled between 1995 and 2005 while it increased by about 13 percent from 2005 to 2015 the natural vegetation category declined by about 33 percent between 1995 and 2005 with no change observed between 2005 and 2015 areas covered by shrub declined by 25 percent between 1995 and 2005 and by 60 percent between 2005 and 2015 the replacement of vegetated areas by urban development increases the surface sealing which has the potential to intensify surface runoff it is noted that the land cover information presents only changes in terms of expansion reduction or no change but intensification in terms of infilling of existing urban areas is a crucial measure of urban landscape change this is indirectly measured using the population density results for 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 presented in fig 8 the results show that the population in oforikrom municipality is quite spread out and of low density for 2000 from 2005 through to 2020 the population expanded eastward from the west side with high intensification observed at the middle of the western portion the land cover and the population density information in the oforikrom municipality show significant changes in the landscape in terms of expansion and intensification of human settlements the associated change caused by urban development such as soil surface sealing and the creation of impervious surfaces can lead to irreversible landscape processes including flooding the impact of human development on flood incidence is widely acknowledged in the literature but the specific quantification of urban morphological types is important to mitigating the problem 3 3 urban morphological types in the oforikrom municipality the urban morphological types found in the oforikrom municipality are presented in fig 9 the urban morphology in oforikrom municipality is broadly categorized into human settlements and vegetation together with bare ground the human settlement category was further grouped into high dense moderate dense and low dense categories bare ground is simply land cover with no vegetation and not agricultural land left to fallow the vegetation category was further grouped into tree cover wooded grassland grassland vegetated park and farmland it is acknowledged that the categorization of the urban morphological types derived for oforikrom municipality is primarily for hydrological analysis the majority of the categories are consistent with global standards such as those used by the esa cci and the food and agriculture organization fao the proportion of the land area covered by the individual morphological types are shown in fig 10 presented in an increasing order for visualization purposes human settlement covered about 55 percent of the total area with low dense moderate dense and high dense areas covering 9 11 6 and 34 2 percent respectively a key challenge about human settlements in the oforikrom municipality is the high level of informality of buildings where land parcels are hardly structured systematically so urban development is not only structured in terms of density or compactness level but there is an overall level of dis jointed arrangement this has impact on the flow path of flood waters as contorted pathways can increase the severity of damage caused by flood waters to further quantify the morphological types for human settlement the average horizontal spacing between buildings in high dense moderate dense and low dense areas are shown in fig 11 there is a high consistency i e low variation in the building spacing for high dense and moderate dense areas whereas the low dense area shows high variability the low variation of building spacing in the high dense and moderate dense areas indicates the high level of competition for any open space for potential infilling the low value of horizontal spacing between buildings means that room or space available for flood waters to move is very small the low value of building spacing will increase the accumulation of flood waters where surface runoff can quickly buildup even for small amounts of rainfall on the basis of building spacing alone with no consideration of flood control structures flood incidence is more likely in high dense settlement areas 3 4 surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality the estimated peak surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality is presented in fig 12 showing the overlapping stream network the geographical distribution of the estimated peak surface runoff identifies areas with different levels of runoff areas such as aboabo anloga and ayigya which have been associated with recurrent floods have been rightly identified with high levels of surface runoff vegetated areas are mostly associated with low levels of surface runoff a close spatial comparison of the estimated surface runoff and the stream network shows that high surface runoffs are not necessarily associated with stream networks the majority of floods in oforikrom are not caused by the inundation of streams in the area but rather the rapid generation and accumulation of surface runoff on the ground which do not have enough room to flow to streams and rivers areas associated with high dense human settlement such as aboabo anloga ayigya are highly associated with recurrent flooding in the oforikrom municipality evidently the majority of the locations with recurrent floods are not necessarily close to a major stream network the results show that the estimated peak surface runoff can be as high as 1200 cm3 s for the 5 year flood this high amount of surface runoff requires enough land space in terms of flood control structures to quickly move flood waters from urban areas into streams and rivers critically for the oforikrom municipality the needed room or land space to move flood waters is severely limited because of highly concentrated urban development and limited flood control structures the required flood control structures such as storm drains are not adequate and wherever they are available they are not in good condition to perform at an optimal level the sampled gutters i e storm drains in the oforikrom municipality are presented in fig 13 underlain by the estimated peak surface runoff the results show the gutters in terms of their carrying capacity or size quantified by the cross sectional area and the state of their sanitary condition a quick network property to observe from the spatial configuration of the gutters is the lack of connectivity and continuity which are critically needed to operationalize flow in relation to the carrying capacity of the gutters the majority of the gutters lie in the range 418 and 5650 cm2 considering the size of the catchment area for each gutter and the high surface runoff of 1200 cm3 s the resulting flood waters are certain to overflow the current capacity of the gutters using these values a surface runoff at 1200 cm3 s will take only 37 minutes to drain an area of 30 m by 30 m equivalent to the model grid to match the maximum cross sectional area of 44 516 cm2 gutter capacity a few hundreds of the 30 m by 30 m model grid will quickly overflow the maximum gutter capacity this illustration shows how severely inadequate the carrying capacity is for the gutters in the oforikrom municipality the size of the gutters is not the only challenge the carrying capacity of gutters is critically impacted by their sanitary condition our field observation and mapping showed that about 32 percent of the gutters surveyed are choked in the oforikrom municipality the typical materials which choke the storm drains are solid waste items such as plastic metal wood and food waste aside from blocking the flow of flood waters the presence of these items in storm drains increases the volume of flood waters thereby the augmenting their severity as illustrated in the results the majority of the choked gutters are located in areas with very high surface runoff further we estimate for each urban morphological type the total amount of peak surface runoff in the area a plot of the area coverage for the various urban morphological types and their corresponding peak surface runoff per unit area is shown in fig 14 the highest peak surface runoff per unit is found in the high dense settlements the top four largest surface runoffs are associated with urban development which are high dense bare ground moderate dense and low dense settlements in descending order evidently these are the areas with the most surface sealing and with the least capacity for water infiltration into the soil as illustrated the gutters which are to facilitate rapid flow of flood waters into streams and rivers have limited capacity and are usually not in good sanitary conditions to operate at optimal levels in other words the areas in the oforikrom municipality with the largest surface runoff mostly high dense and moderate dense areas do not have the capacity and the adequate infrastructure to accommodate and control flood waters this pattern of surface runoff points to the impact of urban development and insufficient flood control infrastructure on the severity of floods the lowest peak surface runoff per unit area is found in vegetated parks followed by tree cover in terms of area coverage by urban morphological types moderate dense settlement covered the largest land area of about 32 percent while vegetated park covered 1 percent the area coverage by moderate dense settlement is considerable given that the second highest area coverage is about 19 percent given the rate of urbanization in the oforikrom municipality the moderate dense will transition into high dense settlement in about 5 10 years conversion of the significant portion 32 of moderate dense to high dense settlement will directly increase the severity of flood impact under this current condition the moderate surface runoffs associated grassland and tree cover categories pose no immediate flooding challenges as these areas are mostly connected to streams and are not impacted by surface sealing to reduce water infiltration into the soil however low dense human settlements are areas of concern because of its small area coverage and associated moderate surface runoff the majority of the low dense areas are located on environmentally sensitive land with high slopes and high proximity to streams the rate of surface runoff in these low dense settlements is considered very high because of their small area coverage and environmentally sensitive land these illustrations allow for spatial targeting of flood control intervention efforts to better inform planning and decision making the spatial targeting is possible because for any location in the oforikrom municipality there are information on the estimated peak surface runoff its catchment area and the urban morphology types the spatial targeting of flood control can be further calibrated using the information on horizontal spacing between buildings and gutter size and sanitary condition this will provide flood control measures that are well targeted towards specific morphology types in each community and not using a one size fits all approach as illustrated one key priority area of intervention is the storm water drains gutters in terms of their sanitary condition and carrying capacity 4 conclusions this study has critically investigated and quantified the amount of urban flood in relation to urban morphology types in the oforikrom municipality in ghana temporal analysis of rainfall was undertaken to show that the increased incidence of flood in the oforikrom municipality is not attributable to increased amount or high intensity of rainfall that is the flood incidence in oforikrom municipality is not caused by increased rainfall or its variability at annual monthly and daily time periods the study argues that the association of only climate change to increased flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality is inaccurate and that excessive surface sealing brought about by human development and its informality are the key drivers of urban flood specifically the extent and detail of landscape change caused by urban development informal settlements in flood prone areas together with the lack of flood control structures are among the key drivers of urban flood in oforikrom municipality in comparison to the changes in rainfall variability caused by climate change it is acknowledged that this study only examined rainfall records and that other climatic variables were not investigated the findings show that rainfall amounts and its variability at annual monthly and daily time periods can be excluded as the cause of increased flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality a key contribution of this study is the explicit quantification of urban morphology types in terms of not only the extent of urban spread but also intensity or compactness accordingly three major urban morphology types were identified including high dense moderate dense and low dense human settlements this categorization was further characterized using field measurements of the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains the horizontal spacing between buildings was used as an indicator of compactness whereas the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains indicate their carrying capacity the rational method which is suitable for the estimation of peak surface runoff in urban areas was used accounting for specific urban morphology types soil properties and topography the estimated peak surface runoff is spatially distributed and corresponding amounts of peak runoff for urban morphology types were quantified which are critical information for flood control planning and intervention efforts accordingly vulnerable flood areas were identified with information about the estimated amount of the peak surface runoff to expect these results facilitate spatial targeting of intervention efforts which has been shown can be further fine tuned using the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains the results show that room for surface runoff is inadequate and is the key driver of urban flood in the oforikrom municipality by room we refer to the available space for surface runoff to flow in storm water drains land space left after human development or the informal dis oriented arrangements of human settlements we found that for storm water drains the size is inadequate their sanitary condition needs improvement and their number need to be increased based on the size of catchment also we found that informal and unstructured arrangement of human settlements reduce the available room and artificially extend the flow path of surface runoff which promotes flow accumulation thereby increasing the volume of flood waters therefore it is suggested that for informal settlements like the oforikrom municipality intervention efforts should spatially target creating adequate room for flood waters to flow there are several important research questions that need further investigation due to the lack of field monitoring of flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality a high resolution satellite imagery should be used to estimate the extent and depth of flood waters this data set can facilitate the validation of the estimated surface runoff and to further refine our understanding of urban flood incidence and prevalence urban morphology in terms of the orientation of buildings in relation to topography is another control on the level of room available for flood waters to flow accordingly this should be investigated in the future together with their impact on modifying the flow path of surface runoff this study identified some urban morphology types in the context of surface runoff other quantifiable urban morphology types should be identified and incorporated in the spatial targeting of flood control and management intervention efforts additional future study should analyze different aspects of the local hydrology to design both structural and nonstructural measures for flood control this will facilitate flood zoning to protect the population

8265,the frequency and severity of floods in ghanaian cities have been increasing typically increased floods have been attributed to climate change with limited evidence although this may be true in some cases it minimizes the role of landscape change as a result of urban growth given the complexity of cities this study characterizes urban morphology types and incorporate them with physiographic data to estimate the peak surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality of ghana the urban morphology was categorized into high moderate and low dense human settlements and further characterized based on the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains the results identify vulnerable areas with information on surface runoff thus facilitating the spatial targeting of intervention efforts we found that room for flood waters is inadequate in terms of the capacity of storm water drains and the land area left after human development for storm water drains the size is inadequate their sanitary condition needs improvement and their number need increasing based on catchment area informal and unstructured human settlements reduce the available room and artificially extend the flow path of runoff which promotes flow accumulation thereby increasing the volume and destructive impact of flood waters the study recommends intervention efforts to spatially target the creation of adequate room for flood waters to flow keywords urban flood urban morphology surface runoff flood control 1 introduction flood incidences are now frequently and widely reported worldwide where between 2008 and 2010 alone 168 out of 196 countries have reported flood incidences and 137 cities experienced major floods three or more times per year sanderson and sharma 2016 floods cause a lot of damage to the natural and the human environment with associated economic costs human costs relating to fatalities physical injuries and diseases and ecosystem costs these costs have been widely reported in the literature including healthcare costs neal 2014 vlachos 2010 economic costs ansah et al 2020 fox 2004 social costs ahadzie et al 2016 asumadu sarkodie et al 2015 karley 2009 and ecosystem costs talbot et al 2018 newman et al 2005 hickey and salas 1995 the severity and costs of flood impact are particularly heightened and augmented in cities or urban areas because of the agglomeration of socioeconomic activities infrastructure and people flooding in cities has been widely attributed to urbanization in flood plain areas nkwunonwo et al 2020 al zahrani 2018 rafiq et al 2016 urbanization increases population and building densities which directly increase surface sealing and impervious areas leading to rapid amplification in the volume and velocity of surface runoff urban growth has been shown to disrupt mass and energy flows in ecosystems and has been the key driver in creating artificial floods su et al 2014 alexakis et al 2013 suriya and mudgal 2012 endreny 2006 walsh et al 2012 according to the united nation s population division of the department of economic and social affairs urbanization together with the overall global population growth could add 2 5 billion people to urban areas by 2050 with about 90 percent of this increase projected to take place in asia and africa a recent urban typology of world cities by oke et al 2019 has labelled most african cities as congested emerging that is cities characterized by high growth lower but increasing population and are developing in ghana more than half of the population already live in towns and cities ghana statistical service 2014 urban growth in ghana is often associated with unplanned poorly planned and informal human settlements which are overcrowded obstruct flood prone areas and lack essential flood control infrastructure thereby intensifying flood incidence and aggravating their societal impacts it has been widely reported that intensive and unplanned human settlements in flood prone areas are the key drivers of increasing flood risk in africa mensah and ahadzie 2020a aram et al 2019 baldassarre et al 2010 this has been confirmed in the local context where the majority of urban floods in ghana are primarily caused and aggravated by poor spatial planning rapid population growth and poor sanitation mensah and ahadzie 2020a ansah et al 2020 abeka et al 2020 abass et al 2019 twum and abubakari 2019 amoako 2018 slums and informal settlements characterized by overcrowding often lack essential flood control infrastructure and services such as storm water drains and sanitation cobbinah and erdiaw kwasie 2016 grant and nijman 2002 additionally these cities often lack ground hydro meteorological stations needed for monitoring hydro climatic variables and for the verification of remotely sensed data and modeling investigations consequently the costs of flood impact have been increasing in frequency and in intensity particularly in the greater kumasi area ansah et al 2020 mensah and ahadzie 2020b amoateng et al 2018 campion and venzke 2013 according to ghana s national and disaster management organization nadmo records in greater kumasi 12 flood cases together with 391 affected people were reported in 2012 whereas in 2017 there were 38 cases together with 3236 affected people given the impact of urban growth on flood incidence several studies have investigated the relationship between flooding and different land cover types and land uses suriya and mudgal 2012 recommended an integrated approach through explicit incorporation of land use change into hydrological models al zahrani 2018 quantified the impact on urbanization and rainfall intensity on peak discharge and runoff volume showing that 80 percent level of urbanization results in a 213 increase in peak flow and 112 increase in runoff volume in hafr al batin city saudi arabia the impact of urbanization has been found to be higher for small rainfall events compared to larger events indicating a high sensitivity of peak flow to urbanization for rainfall with short return periods al zahrani 2018 that is urbanization directly leads to increased flood incidence even when there are no changes in the temporal variability of rainfall increased frequency of runoff has been correlated with increased area of impervious surfaces where runoff frequency has been estimated to increase by a factor of ten or more geoscience australia 2019b walsh et al 2012 these findings are widely supported in the literature erena and worku 2019 ohana levi et al 2018 suriya and mudgal 2012 to explicitly account for urbanization there is the need to include urban morphology in flood modeling and prediction urban morphology include the spatial analysis of urban structures land use street patterns buildings open space the nature of human settlement and the process of their formation and transformation kropf 2017 ravari and mazloomi 2015 inclusion of urban morphology into flood estimation is needed since urban growth can occur through geographical expansion from the urban core into the outskirts or by infilling of existing open land areas leading to intensification of buildings these two examples of urban growth will affect flood incidence in different ways and each need to be properly characterized and integrated into flood estimation past studies have reported unplanned human settlements as drivers of urban flood but there are limited work which actually quantify the geographical space left for flood waters to flow in the event of flood also the attribution of urban flood in ghana mostly to climate change is rarely backed by data and is often misguided this attribution unfairly associates the problem of urban flood to climate change only and minimizes the role of landscape change brought about by human settlements this is partly because the majority of flood impacts in ghana are descriptive or narrative in terms of the number of cases and fatalities but information about flood volume velocity of flood waters and flood height are rarely quantified the issue is compounded by limited monitoring and modeling evidence in terms of how floods occur in urban areas thus modeling and field investigations are needed for flood estimation flood frequency flow direction and accumulation in order to provide crucial information for flood risk management mensah and ahadzie 2020a accordingly this paper characterizes urban morphology types and incorporated them with soil properties topography and rainfall data to estimate surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality of greater kumasi in ghana the study characterizes urban morphology in the context of hydrology by identifying three urban morphology types high dense moderate dense and low dense human settlements this characterization was further augmented by mapping the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains in each of the three urban morphology types storm water drains are crucial in urban areas because of the increased volume and velocity of surface runoff the horizontal spacing between buildings is particularly important for informal settlements due to their dis jointed arrangements which scarcely leaves open land area for flood waters to flow this is because most informal settlements have limited storm water drains such that the open spaces between buildings are often the only room left for flood waters to flow the study demonstrates the quantification of surface runoff for different urban morphology types with the capability to spatially target intervention efforts and better inform flood control planning and decision making the spatial targeting of flood control based on urban morphology is further calibrated using information on horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains therefore the study provides a framework for flood control measures that are spatially targeted towards specific urban morphology types in each community and not using a one size fits all approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the study was conducted in oforikrom municipality in the ashanti region of ghana shown in fig 1 the oforikrom municipality covers a total land area of about 50 km2 and is bounded in the north by asokore mampong in the east by ejisu in the south west by asokwa municipal assembly and in the west by kumasi metropolitan assembly according to the 2010 population and housing census the oforikrom municipality has a population of 303 016 comprising about 47 males and 53 females ghana statistical service 2014 the greater portion about 55 percent of the oforikrom municipality is made up of urban development with the remaining covered predominately by natural vegetation and cropland there is rapid urbanization in oforikrom municipality which has accelerated the conversion of fragile natural environments leading to increased incidence of flooding in hotspot areas like aboabo anloga and oforikrom the oforikrom municipality lies in the wet sub equatorial climate region with an average minimum temperature of about 21 5 degrees celsius and an average maximum temperature of 30 7 degrees celsius humidity is about 84 percent in the morning 9am and about 60 percent in the afternoon 3 pm there are two rainy seasons in the oforikrom municipality with the first peak in june and the second peak in october and an average annual rainfall amount of about 1450 mm also oforikrom municipality lies within the moist semi deciduous south east ecological zone the soil forest ochrosols is rich in plant nutrients and supports agriculture in the periphery towns such as appiadu and kokoben a speckle of vegetation reserve within the municipality is located in the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology knust botanical gardens and aprade and bebre the geology in the area is predominantly middle precambrian rocks residing on the plateau of the south west physical region which ranges from 250 to 300 m above sea level the topography is relatively undulating and is traversed by water bodies including the subin wiwi susan and aboabo 2 2 data sources the topography of the oforikrom municipality was generated from digital elevation model dem which was obtained from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster the aster dem has a spatial resolution of about 30 m the soil properties data set was obtained from the global soil grids hengl et al 2017 with a spatial resolution of 250 m the land cover data was obtained from the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci the esa cci land cover data set has a spatial resolution of 300 m and a temporal coverage from 1992 to 2015 a high resolution satellite imagery was obtained from openstreetmap osm which is a collaborative worldwide mapping project providing spatial data globally jokar arsanjani et al 2015 maron 2015 haklay 2010 additional high resolution satellite imagery was obtained from the openmaptiles satellite https openmaptiles com satellite these high resolution satellite imageries were used to generate the different urban morphological types in the oforikrom municipality due to the wide disparities between different land cover products high resolution satellite imageries have been widely recognized to provide a clear and distinct identification of features on the land surface long term rainfall data set was obtained from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc version 7 the long term rainfall data set has a spatial resolution of 5 km with a 116 year temporal coverage from 1901 to 2016 also daily rainfall data at ground station level was obtained from the ghana meteorological services gmet covering a time period of 37 years from 1980 to 2016 population density data set was obtained from the humanitarian data exchange https data humdata org at about 100 m spatial resolution and a temporal coverage from 2000 to 2020 2 3 methods and data analysis the overall methodology of the study is presented in fig 2 highlighting the key components to be incorporated to investigate the linkages between urban morphology types and flooding in the oforikrom municipality a detailed description of the various components are provided in the sections following note that detailed presentation of the outputs and their discussion are provided in the results and discussion section 2 4 temporal analysis of rainfall data a time series analysis of the rainfall data was undertaken to ascertain whether the historical pattern of rainfall has changed in the oforikrom municipality the assembled rainfall data set was examined at three time steps annual seasonal or monthly and daily levels the evaluation at an annual time period examined the long term pattern of rainfall variability whereas the monthly analysis was to determine whether the seasonality of rainfall has changed in the oforikrom municipality also some flood incidences such as flash floods are caused by large amounts of rainfall within short time periods to account for this the rainfall record was analyzed at daily time period to find out whether rainfall incidents at the daily time scale has changed over the years sub daily rainfall data set is the ideal for this analysis but is not available in the study area the long term 106 year rainfall record was used for the analysis at the annual time period whereas the 37 year station daily rainfall data set was used for the analysis at the monthly and daily time periods the long term gridded rainfall record was compared against the 37 year station rainfall data using correlation coefficient which was found to be 0 545 given the geographic disparity between the two rainfall records 5 km and point the correlation coefficient of 0 545 was deemed reasonable in addition wavelet power spectrum wps was used to analyze the rainfall data in temporal and spectral domains wavelets are efficient for analysis of harmonic time series in both temporal and spectral domains where they can decompose sampled time series into different resolutions scales base functions that vary with respect to time and frequency thereby allowing detection of localized changes torrence compo 1998 this is especially useful for non stationary data like rainfall time series this study employed the continuous wavelet transform cwt to compute the wave power spectrum wps in order to quantify the distribution of variances in the monthly rainfall from 1980 to 2016 mathematically cwt is expressed in eq 1 1 c a b 1 a s t ψ t b a d t where c is the wavelet coefficient a and b are the scale and position functions respectively s t is the signal and ψ is the wavelet function the morlet wavelet was used as the mother wavelet since it is well suited for feature extraction from oscillatory samples such as rainfall jänicke et al 2009 2 5 derivation of urban morphology types it is widely recognized that land use and land cover products vary across different global data providers a comparison by gis geography 2016 showed significant differences in land cover characterization based on several products including global land survey climate change initiative cci land cover version 2 osm land use data modis based global land cover climatology usgs global land cover characterization globeland30 un fao global land cover network and terra populus terrapop the openstreetmap land use data which uses high resolution satellite imagery was found to provide the most accurate land cover characterization based on its finer scale and its detailed depiction of human activities on land gis geography 2016 hence the high resolution satellite imageries from openstreetmap and openmaptiles satellite were used to generate the urban morphology types in the oforikrom municipality the high resolution satellite imageries were georeferenced by matching the coordinates of locations in the imagery to those on the ground the ground coordinates were obtained by using standard handheld global positioning system gps with an accuracy range from 1 to 2 meters the georeferencing procedure ensures that the geometry and the position of features on the satellite imagery actually match those on the ground the georeferenced imagery was then used in on screen digitization to delineate the outline of the different urban morphological types the digitized morphological types included grassland tree cover wooded grassland bare ground water bodies high dense settlements moderate dense settlements and low dense settlements a graphical outline of the urban morphological types is shown in fig 3 the morphology types were digitized primarily based on density and compactness of settlements and presence and density of vegetation a brief description of the various urban morphology types is provided in the following high dense settlement primarily consist of buildings that have limited spacing with virtually no or little vegetation cover the level of socio economic activity is considered to be very high moderate dense settlement mainly consist of buildings that are moderately spaced with some spots of vegetation cover the level of socio economic activity is considered to be somewhat high low dense settlement consist of few and widely spaced buildings with much vegetation cover the level of socio economic activity is considered to be low tree cover an area with dominant tree cover and virtually no buildings wooded grassland a mix of trees and grass or shrub where trees cover less than 50 percent of the area grassland an area with dominant grass cover it has very few trees and virtually no buildings farmland an area with dominant crop cover including fallow and tillage areas it has very few trees and virtually no buildings vegetated park urban area parks with vegetation cover urban parks with no vegetation are classified under bare ground bare ground a land with exposed soil or patched land with virtually no vegetation or buildings farmlands left to fallow or tillage lands are excluded 2 5 1 measurement of horizontal spacing between buildings the high level of informal settlements in the oforikrom municipality means that there are limited land space available for overland flow to move unimpeded the quantification of the available horizontal space left after urban development is one of the indicators of compactness i e the level of closeness of buildings relevant for the flow of urban flood in the absence of storm water drains the horizontal space between buildings is the only space for surface runoff which make them very critical in terms of flow accumulation limited horizontal space between buildings means surface runoff will quickly accumulate and vice versa accordingly to get a better understanding of the urban morphology that is of relevance to flooding measurement of the horizontal spacing or distance between buildings was undertaken at sampled locations in select towns the select towns were chosen such that there are representations from the low dense moderate dense and high dense settlements given the high level of socio economic activity in urban areas the horizontal distance between buildings was determined using a foot stepping approach the number of footsteps were calibrated against different known distances under different walking conditions such as walking on a paved and unpaved surfaces sloping and rugged surfaces and vegetated and non vegetated surfaces based on the calibration procedure a single footstep was determined to correspond to a standard value of 0 762 m the number of footsteps covered between buildings pairs were then used to estimate the corresponding distance in meters it is noted that the majority of the side by side horizontal spacing between buildings in high dense and moderate dense settlements are almost zero so the measured distances for these areas are any available space between buildings for low dense settlements the side by side horizontal spacing between buildings is often characteristic of any available horizontal space between buildings for each settlement category three 3 different communities were sampled to determine the horizontal spacing between buildings in sum nine 9 communities were sampled where aboabo anloga and oforikrom represent high dense settlements ayeduase kotei and deduako typify moderate dense settlements and knust apemso and appiadu stand for low dense settlements 2 5 2 mapping of storm water drains gutters as part of getting an understanding of the urban morphology that is of relevance to flooding mapping of the storm water drains or gutters was undertaken at sampled locations in select towns the selected communities include aboabo anloga oforikrom ayeduase kotei deduako knust apemso and appiadu as noted earlier the select towns were chosen such that there are representations from the low dense moderate dense and high dense settlements the locations of the sampled gutters were obtained by using handheld gps the gutters were characterized based on two criteria size width and depth which make up the cross sectional area and sanitary condition the onsite measurement of gutter size or carrying capacity was determined using a tape measure whereas the sanitary condition of the gutters were described as choked moderately choked or not choked a gutter is considered choked when more than half of its depth is filled with dirt or garbage and moderately choked when about half or less than half of its depth is filled with dirt or garbage a gutter is considered not choked or clean when its bottom can be seen from above and there are no dirt or garbage in it 2 5 3 determination of flow paths and estimation of surface runoff to determine the natural flow paths based on topography the dem was used to derive the sub catchments and the flow channel network in the oforikrom municipality the analysis was performed using an open source geographic information system qgis which also facilitated all analysis of spatial data used in this study the derived flow channel network identifies the areas for flow accumulation and flow paths to be followed by surface runoff in the event of flooding while the identification of the flow paths is relevant it is also important to estimate the amount of surface runoff that can be generated at different spatial locations in the oforikrom municipality the surface runoff estimated is specifically the peak discharge which is the highest concentration of runoff from the catchment from a specific rainfall event to estimate the peak surface runoff the rational method of rainfall runoff modeling was used which is inexpensive appropriate for small catchments and most suitable for urban areas the rational method assumes a proportionality between peak discharge and rainfall intensity based on eq 2 2 q p k u r a d i c r a p f where qpk is the peak flow rate in m3 s ur is a uni conversion factor 0 278 ad is the drainage area in sq km i is the rainfall intensity in mm hr cr is the runoff coefficient which is dependent on the land cover and use and apf is the antecedent precipitation factor the runoff coefficient cr is the ratio of peak streamflow per unit area to rainfall intensity thus it estimates the quantity of runoff generated relative to the amount of precipitation received based on land use information the cr is dimensionless and has values ranging between 0 05 for gently sloping lawns and 0 95 for highly urbanized areas of roofs and pavements the estimated peak surface runoff based on the rational method is highly sensitive to the value chosen for the cr it is acknowledged that the rational method is limited because of its high dependence on the cr value which has been widely reported to vary for different storms and differing antecedent moisture conditions erena and worku 2019 al zahrani 2018 mahmoud and alazba 2015 however the method is suitable for urban areas particularly in informal settlements where there are often insufficient rainfall runoff observations coombes et al 2015 geoscience australia 2019a the cr accounts for the type of soil and the slope and the land use land cover of an area the soil information was obtained from the collected global soil grids the slope values were derived from the dem using qgis whereas the derived urban morphology types were used in place of the land use information these information were used to look up the appropriate values for cr and combined with the rainfall intensity to estimate the peak surface runoff the rainfall intensity i was estimated from intensity duration frequency idf curve which relates the rainfall intensity with its duration and frequency of occurrence idf curve for kumasi which was developed by sulemana et al 2017 was used to lookup the rainfall intensity given the duration for the rational method the duration must correspond to the time of concentration which is the time required for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point in the catchment to the outlet the time of concentration tc was approximated using the overland flow nomagraph based on the seelye chart the seelye chart requires the length of overland flow the coefficient of imperviousness and the slope of the channel in percentage given that the model was run on a raster grid of 30 m resolution the length of the overland flow was taken to be 42 4 m about 139 2 ft the surface condition of the channel mostly include poor grass bare soil and paved surface these surfaces were used to determine the coefficient of imperviousness the average slope of the catchment is about 10 percent based on these values the overall tc was estimated to be about 10 5 min which correspond to a rainfall intensity of about 100 mm hr for 1 year flood 130 mm hr for 2 year flood 160 mm hr for 5 year flood 185 mm hr for 10 year flood 205 mm hr for 20 year flood 220 mm hr for 30 year flood and 235 mm hr for 50 year flood the rainfall intensity of 160 mm hr for 5 year flood was used as indicative of a short medium term event to determine the antecedent precipitation factor a simple approach was adopted to find the difference between the annual precipitation and the annual evapotranspiration the annual rainfall used for the oforikrom municipality was estimated as the overall average from the 116 year long term rainfall record to be 1383 mm the annual evapotranspiration was estimated to be about 937 mm for the oforikrom municipality from the famine early warning systems network fews net at the url https earlywarning usgs gov fews the annual antecedent precipitation is about 446 mm which averagely works out to be 1 2 mm day it is noteworthy that the rational method was used in this study to estimate the peak flow with no flow routing performed on the grids and that the approach has been widely recognized to be unsuitable for volume estimates coombes et al 2015 geoscience australia 2019b simpson 2014 the estimated peak surface runoff specifically relates a rainfall event 3 results 3 1 temporal pattern of rainfall in oforikrom municipality as noted the increasing incidence of flood in greater kumasi has been widely reported in literature ansah et al 2020 mensah and ahadzie 2020b amoateng et al 2018 campion and venzke 2013 to examine the role of climate impact on flooding we undertook rainfall analysis at the annual monthly and daily time periods it is acknowledged that climatic impacts are not only limited to rainfall but in terms of flooding rainfall is a key variable we examine the long term pattern of rainfall to demonstrate that the increasing flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality is highly unlikely to be due to increased rainfall caused by climate change the result in fig 4 plot a is a presentation of the long term annual rainfall and the 37 year monthly rainfall together with the monthly number of rain days in the oforikrom municipality the long term rainfall trend shows that annual rainfall amount in comparison with the overall average has been declining since 1969 that is the annual rainfall records from 1969 to 2016 has been consistently lower compared to the trend from 1901 to 1968 uniquely all the annual rainfall record from 2010 to 2016 are all consistently below the long term average that is the oforikrom municipality is getting drier based on the year to year rainfall amounts on an annual basis rainfall amounts are not increasing to directly result in increased flood incidences it is acknowledged that annual rainfall amounts is not the only variable to be used to explain the incidence of floods high amounts of rainfall within short time periods such as seasonal time steps in the case of torrential rainfall can cause flash floods accordingly the rainfall trend is examined for seasonal variability using select peak rainfall months may june september and october all shown in fig 4 plot b the seasonal variability based on the 37 year rainfall shows that the pattern of monthly variation is similar at least monthly rainfall amounts have not increased for recent years 2000s the overall average values of the monthly rainfall are 163 mm for may 222 mm for june 177 mm for september and 158 mm for october the overall average values of the monthly rainfall was compared against the 37 year monthly rainfall trend for the months may and october there are no considerable departures from their overall average values the month of june has some consistent increases in the 2000s for example 2000 2009 2012 and 2015 the month september has one significant increase in 2007 while the remaining years show consistent departures from the overall average value on a monthly basis only june showed slight increases in monthly rainfall with no upward increases for may september and october in addition the number of rain days for the select peak rainfall months may june september and october are presented in fig 4 plot c the overall average values of the monthly rain days are 13 0 for may 15 1 for june 15 5 for september and 15 8 for october the month of may shows a consistent trend across the various years with no significant departures from the overall average value for june 1997 and 2000 are the two years which show significant upward departure from the rest of the years the trend for september shows a cyclical pattern as the other months with only 2007 having an upward departure from the average value the high number of rain days in september 2007 directly corresponds to its high rainfall amount for october there is a slight increase in the number of rain days for 2006 and 2010 when the monthly rainfall amounts were correlated to the number of monthly rain days the correlation coefficients were 0 542 for may 0 560 for june 0 560 for september and 0 470 for october that is the majority of the high rainfall amounts positively correlate to the high number of rain days overall the pattern of the number of rain days for the various months remained almost unchanged across the 37 year rainfall record further the result in fig 5 is a presentation of the 37 year daily rainfall for two of the peak rainfall months of june and september in the oforikrom municipality the months of june and september are used here for illustration purposes june has the largest rainfall amount among the four peak rainfall months while september has the highest rainfall amount in 2007 the daily variability for june and september shows that daily rainfall amounts have not increased in the oforikrom municipality from the 2000s the highest daily rainfall amount was recorded on 13 june 1986 for june and 13 september 1992 for september in addition fig 6 which is based on wavelet analysis of the daily rainfall presents the results of the wavelet analysis of the monthly rainfall series from 1980 to 2016 the annual cycle 1 year period is observed to be the most significant as shown in the wavelet spectrum in fig 6 b and c the averaged power of the series at the annual cycle is shown in fig 6 d the averaged power and spectrum in fig 6 d and b indicate peaks around 1985 and 1989 1996 and 2002 whereas a maximum peak was observed in 2007 on the other hand troughs are evident in 1983 1990 2005 and 2013 the former and latter periods are coincident with wet and dry spells over west africa in general from the 1980s to the 2000s andam akorful et al 2017 from the averaged power spectrum lower amplitudes in maximum rainfall are observable from 2010 to 2016 relative to previous periods that is 1985 2007 this indicates lower monthly rainfall intensities from 2010 these results have established that the temporal pattern of rainfall at the annual seasonal and daily time periods have not increased to induce more floods in the oforikrom municipality this finding is consistent with those from abass et al 2019 thus the increased incidence of flood in the oforikrom municipality is not directly linked to rainfall amounts and variability but perhaps due to changes in the landscape the landscape changes in the oforikrom municipality are examined in the following sections 3 2 landscape changes in the oforikrom municipality based on the land cover data obtained from the esa cci land cover we present the cover categories found in the oforikrom municipality the results in fig 7 show the land cover categories for 1995 2005 and 2015 in the oforikrom municipality for each land cover category the area coverages in percentage for 1995 2005 and 2015 are presented in table 1 the results show increased expansion of urban settlements into vegetated areas the geographical coverage of urban areas doubled between 1995 and 2005 while it increased by about 13 percent from 2005 to 2015 the natural vegetation category declined by about 33 percent between 1995 and 2005 with no change observed between 2005 and 2015 areas covered by shrub declined by 25 percent between 1995 and 2005 and by 60 percent between 2005 and 2015 the replacement of vegetated areas by urban development increases the surface sealing which has the potential to intensify surface runoff it is noted that the land cover information presents only changes in terms of expansion reduction or no change but intensification in terms of infilling of existing urban areas is a crucial measure of urban landscape change this is indirectly measured using the population density results for 2000 2005 2010 2015 and 2020 presented in fig 8 the results show that the population in oforikrom municipality is quite spread out and of low density for 2000 from 2005 through to 2020 the population expanded eastward from the west side with high intensification observed at the middle of the western portion the land cover and the population density information in the oforikrom municipality show significant changes in the landscape in terms of expansion and intensification of human settlements the associated change caused by urban development such as soil surface sealing and the creation of impervious surfaces can lead to irreversible landscape processes including flooding the impact of human development on flood incidence is widely acknowledged in the literature but the specific quantification of urban morphological types is important to mitigating the problem 3 3 urban morphological types in the oforikrom municipality the urban morphological types found in the oforikrom municipality are presented in fig 9 the urban morphology in oforikrom municipality is broadly categorized into human settlements and vegetation together with bare ground the human settlement category was further grouped into high dense moderate dense and low dense categories bare ground is simply land cover with no vegetation and not agricultural land left to fallow the vegetation category was further grouped into tree cover wooded grassland grassland vegetated park and farmland it is acknowledged that the categorization of the urban morphological types derived for oforikrom municipality is primarily for hydrological analysis the majority of the categories are consistent with global standards such as those used by the esa cci and the food and agriculture organization fao the proportion of the land area covered by the individual morphological types are shown in fig 10 presented in an increasing order for visualization purposes human settlement covered about 55 percent of the total area with low dense moderate dense and high dense areas covering 9 11 6 and 34 2 percent respectively a key challenge about human settlements in the oforikrom municipality is the high level of informality of buildings where land parcels are hardly structured systematically so urban development is not only structured in terms of density or compactness level but there is an overall level of dis jointed arrangement this has impact on the flow path of flood waters as contorted pathways can increase the severity of damage caused by flood waters to further quantify the morphological types for human settlement the average horizontal spacing between buildings in high dense moderate dense and low dense areas are shown in fig 11 there is a high consistency i e low variation in the building spacing for high dense and moderate dense areas whereas the low dense area shows high variability the low variation of building spacing in the high dense and moderate dense areas indicates the high level of competition for any open space for potential infilling the low value of horizontal spacing between buildings means that room or space available for flood waters to move is very small the low value of building spacing will increase the accumulation of flood waters where surface runoff can quickly buildup even for small amounts of rainfall on the basis of building spacing alone with no consideration of flood control structures flood incidence is more likely in high dense settlement areas 3 4 surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality the estimated peak surface runoff in the oforikrom municipality is presented in fig 12 showing the overlapping stream network the geographical distribution of the estimated peak surface runoff identifies areas with different levels of runoff areas such as aboabo anloga and ayigya which have been associated with recurrent floods have been rightly identified with high levels of surface runoff vegetated areas are mostly associated with low levels of surface runoff a close spatial comparison of the estimated surface runoff and the stream network shows that high surface runoffs are not necessarily associated with stream networks the majority of floods in oforikrom are not caused by the inundation of streams in the area but rather the rapid generation and accumulation of surface runoff on the ground which do not have enough room to flow to streams and rivers areas associated with high dense human settlement such as aboabo anloga ayigya are highly associated with recurrent flooding in the oforikrom municipality evidently the majority of the locations with recurrent floods are not necessarily close to a major stream network the results show that the estimated peak surface runoff can be as high as 1200 cm3 s for the 5 year flood this high amount of surface runoff requires enough land space in terms of flood control structures to quickly move flood waters from urban areas into streams and rivers critically for the oforikrom municipality the needed room or land space to move flood waters is severely limited because of highly concentrated urban development and limited flood control structures the required flood control structures such as storm drains are not adequate and wherever they are available they are not in good condition to perform at an optimal level the sampled gutters i e storm drains in the oforikrom municipality are presented in fig 13 underlain by the estimated peak surface runoff the results show the gutters in terms of their carrying capacity or size quantified by the cross sectional area and the state of their sanitary condition a quick network property to observe from the spatial configuration of the gutters is the lack of connectivity and continuity which are critically needed to operationalize flow in relation to the carrying capacity of the gutters the majority of the gutters lie in the range 418 and 5650 cm2 considering the size of the catchment area for each gutter and the high surface runoff of 1200 cm3 s the resulting flood waters are certain to overflow the current capacity of the gutters using these values a surface runoff at 1200 cm3 s will take only 37 minutes to drain an area of 30 m by 30 m equivalent to the model grid to match the maximum cross sectional area of 44 516 cm2 gutter capacity a few hundreds of the 30 m by 30 m model grid will quickly overflow the maximum gutter capacity this illustration shows how severely inadequate the carrying capacity is for the gutters in the oforikrom municipality the size of the gutters is not the only challenge the carrying capacity of gutters is critically impacted by their sanitary condition our field observation and mapping showed that about 32 percent of the gutters surveyed are choked in the oforikrom municipality the typical materials which choke the storm drains are solid waste items such as plastic metal wood and food waste aside from blocking the flow of flood waters the presence of these items in storm drains increases the volume of flood waters thereby the augmenting their severity as illustrated in the results the majority of the choked gutters are located in areas with very high surface runoff further we estimate for each urban morphological type the total amount of peak surface runoff in the area a plot of the area coverage for the various urban morphological types and their corresponding peak surface runoff per unit area is shown in fig 14 the highest peak surface runoff per unit is found in the high dense settlements the top four largest surface runoffs are associated with urban development which are high dense bare ground moderate dense and low dense settlements in descending order evidently these are the areas with the most surface sealing and with the least capacity for water infiltration into the soil as illustrated the gutters which are to facilitate rapid flow of flood waters into streams and rivers have limited capacity and are usually not in good sanitary conditions to operate at optimal levels in other words the areas in the oforikrom municipality with the largest surface runoff mostly high dense and moderate dense areas do not have the capacity and the adequate infrastructure to accommodate and control flood waters this pattern of surface runoff points to the impact of urban development and insufficient flood control infrastructure on the severity of floods the lowest peak surface runoff per unit area is found in vegetated parks followed by tree cover in terms of area coverage by urban morphological types moderate dense settlement covered the largest land area of about 32 percent while vegetated park covered 1 percent the area coverage by moderate dense settlement is considerable given that the second highest area coverage is about 19 percent given the rate of urbanization in the oforikrom municipality the moderate dense will transition into high dense settlement in about 5 10 years conversion of the significant portion 32 of moderate dense to high dense settlement will directly increase the severity of flood impact under this current condition the moderate surface runoffs associated grassland and tree cover categories pose no immediate flooding challenges as these areas are mostly connected to streams and are not impacted by surface sealing to reduce water infiltration into the soil however low dense human settlements are areas of concern because of its small area coverage and associated moderate surface runoff the majority of the low dense areas are located on environmentally sensitive land with high slopes and high proximity to streams the rate of surface runoff in these low dense settlements is considered very high because of their small area coverage and environmentally sensitive land these illustrations allow for spatial targeting of flood control intervention efforts to better inform planning and decision making the spatial targeting is possible because for any location in the oforikrom municipality there are information on the estimated peak surface runoff its catchment area and the urban morphology types the spatial targeting of flood control can be further calibrated using the information on horizontal spacing between buildings and gutter size and sanitary condition this will provide flood control measures that are well targeted towards specific morphology types in each community and not using a one size fits all approach as illustrated one key priority area of intervention is the storm water drains gutters in terms of their sanitary condition and carrying capacity 4 conclusions this study has critically investigated and quantified the amount of urban flood in relation to urban morphology types in the oforikrom municipality in ghana temporal analysis of rainfall was undertaken to show that the increased incidence of flood in the oforikrom municipality is not attributable to increased amount or high intensity of rainfall that is the flood incidence in oforikrom municipality is not caused by increased rainfall or its variability at annual monthly and daily time periods the study argues that the association of only climate change to increased flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality is inaccurate and that excessive surface sealing brought about by human development and its informality are the key drivers of urban flood specifically the extent and detail of landscape change caused by urban development informal settlements in flood prone areas together with the lack of flood control structures are among the key drivers of urban flood in oforikrom municipality in comparison to the changes in rainfall variability caused by climate change it is acknowledged that this study only examined rainfall records and that other climatic variables were not investigated the findings show that rainfall amounts and its variability at annual monthly and daily time periods can be excluded as the cause of increased flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality a key contribution of this study is the explicit quantification of urban morphology types in terms of not only the extent of urban spread but also intensity or compactness accordingly three major urban morphology types were identified including high dense moderate dense and low dense human settlements this categorization was further characterized using field measurements of the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains the horizontal spacing between buildings was used as an indicator of compactness whereas the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains indicate their carrying capacity the rational method which is suitable for the estimation of peak surface runoff in urban areas was used accounting for specific urban morphology types soil properties and topography the estimated peak surface runoff is spatially distributed and corresponding amounts of peak runoff for urban morphology types were quantified which are critical information for flood control planning and intervention efforts accordingly vulnerable flood areas were identified with information about the estimated amount of the peak surface runoff to expect these results facilitate spatial targeting of intervention efforts which has been shown can be further fine tuned using the horizontal spacing between buildings and the size and sanitary condition of storm water drains the results show that room for surface runoff is inadequate and is the key driver of urban flood in the oforikrom municipality by room we refer to the available space for surface runoff to flow in storm water drains land space left after human development or the informal dis oriented arrangements of human settlements we found that for storm water drains the size is inadequate their sanitary condition needs improvement and their number need to be increased based on the size of catchment also we found that informal and unstructured arrangement of human settlements reduce the available room and artificially extend the flow path of surface runoff which promotes flow accumulation thereby increasing the volume of flood waters therefore it is suggested that for informal settlements like the oforikrom municipality intervention efforts should spatially target creating adequate room for flood waters to flow there are several important research questions that need further investigation due to the lack of field monitoring of flood incidence in the oforikrom municipality a high resolution satellite imagery should be used to estimate the extent and depth of flood waters this data set can facilitate the validation of the estimated surface runoff and to further refine our understanding of urban flood incidence and prevalence urban morphology in terms of the orientation of buildings in relation to topography is another control on the level of room available for flood waters to flow accordingly this should be investigated in the future together with their impact on modifying the flow path of surface runoff this study identified some urban morphology types in the context of surface runoff other quantifiable urban morphology types should be identified and incorporated in the spatial targeting of flood control and management intervention efforts additional future study should analyze different aspects of the local hydrology to design both structural and nonstructural measures for flood control this will facilitate flood zoning to protect the population

8266,study region allain catchment a sub basin of beas basin western himalaya study focus this study aims to assess future glacio hydrological changes in a small basin and their impacts on the operation of two small hydropower projects shp with contrasting hydrological requirements the water evaluation and planning weap model is used to integrate cryosphere hydrology and hydropower production modelling in the 21st century using climate changes projected by the ensembles of five global climate models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 new hydrological insights for the region the total streamflow in the future is projected to have widespread uncertainty in the magnitude but shows noticeable changes in the seasonality of the two shps the one utilizing high flows with low hydraulic head shows a power generation behaviour similar to streamflow projections its annual hydropower production is projected to change by 2 to 21 rcp4 5 and 5 to 40 rcp8 5 by the end of the century the other plant that uses lesser flows but high head maintains its designed power production consistently throughout the century the study indicates that the design of hydropower plants strongly influences their sensitivity to future climate and thus provides important insights into the climate adaptive designs and planning of future hydropower projects in himalaya keywords glaciers indus snowmelt climate change modelling weap 1 introduction the hindukush karakoram himalayan hkh region is often referred to as water towers of asia due to its large concentration of glaciers and seasonal snow that sustains yearlong water supply of major rivers such as indus ganga and brahmaputra about 800 million people living in the mountains and downstream region rely on the water originating in the hkh region for agriculture hydropower generation industrial and domestic usage immerzeel et al 2020 pritchard 2019 these rivers are sustained by snow and glacier melt rainfall and groundwater although the contribution of individual components varies spatially between the sub basins and temporally between the seasons giving this region a complex hydrological nature lutz et al 2014 owing to the steep topographical gradient and the perennial water supply the hkh region has a large hydropower generation potential the gross hydropower potential of the indian hkh region is around 117 gigawatt gw most of which is potentially suitable for large hydropower projects i e with a capacity greater than 25 megawatt mw cea 2020 however large hydropower plants usually require storage structures which are difficult and expensive to realize due to the rugged terrain and incompatible with existing water sharing treaties in the region hussain et al 2019 in contrast shps with 2 25 mw capacity of the run of river type have lower costs related to the necessary built infrastructure and have fewer adverse effects on the environment and local communities kumar and katoch 2014 at present out of the cumulative feasible shp potential of 8 5 gw in the indian hkh region only 1 6 gw have been installed some under the united nations clean development mechanism cdm nep 2018 therefore a major part of the shp potential in india is yet to be tapped consequently the ministry of new renewable energy of india is extensively promoting the development of shp with a target to expand the installed capacity to 5 gw by 2022 nep 2018 both government and private sectors are actively investing in the increasing small hydropower facilities in the himalayas thus information about the changing future water availability and its interaction with plant design e g discharge and head requirements is critical to ensure the long term suitability of infrastructure and investments the hydrology of the hkh rivers is influenced by the precipitation regime snow and glacier melt in the summer and the characteristics of glaciers however the recent changes in the climatic conditions have had critical impacts on the state of cryospheric resources in most regions of the himalayas glaciers are retreating thinning and losing mass azam et al 2018 bolch et al 2012 glacier mass balance observations suggest an increase in mass wastage in the last decade maurer et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2018 tawde et al 2017 with small and low altitude glaciers losing mass at a higher rate than large glaciers prasad et al 2019 tawde et al 2017 also monitoring of winter precipitation in the western himalaya suggests an increase in total precipitation but a decrease in snowfall from 1991 to 2015 negi et al 2018 these changes in the cryosphere will alter the spatial pattern and timing of glacier and snow melt immerzeel et al 2012 lutz et al 2014 which may have a profound impact on the amount and seasonality of water available for hydropower generation most of the river runoff modelling studies in himalaya focus on large basins covering areas larger than 5000 km2 momblanch et al 2019a however the decision making regarding the small hydropower sector occurs at small watersheds several studies have explored the hydrological regimes of small himalayan watersheds using a range of modelling approaches from detailed glacio hydrological models immerzeel et al 2012 ragettli et al 2015 to simple empirical relationships between temperature and melt azam et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2002 rathore et al 2011 the former methods require large amounts of data at a high spatio temporal resolution which are often not available in high elevation catchments whereas the simplicity of the later methods inhibits them from taking the complex water demand structures into account consequently conceptual models which integrate the main hydrological processes with water uses and infrastructures and simulate energy production in multiple hydropower plants over time in a single run offer an appropriate alternative momblanch et al 2019b the present study aims to assess the future changes in hydropower generation of two shp with contrasting discharge head designs and discuss the implications for future shp design in the hkh we have used a water resource systems model that integrates cryospheric resources hydrological processes water infrastructures and water demands we conduct a robust evaluation of the historical model performance using glacier mass balance mb modis snow cover area sca and measured discharge then future changes in runoff and hydropower generation are estimated until the end of the century considering the projections of two ensembles of five global climate models gcm representing different types of future climates under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 2 study area and data the two selected run of river power projects viz 3 mw aleo manali and 4 8 mw aleo 2 hydropower projects henceforth called as aleo 1 and aleo 2 respectively are situated on the allain stream near manali in the state of himachal pradesh in india fig 1 table 1 the allain stream is a tributary of the beas river which is a part of the indus river system the catchment area of the power project is 140 2 km2 with an altitudinal range from 1806 to 6018 m a s l around 47 of the catchment area is covered by grassland with 22 and 23 of forest and barren land cover respectively a small agricultural area located at the tip of the catchment near the village of prini accounts for just 0 3 of the total catchment area the mean annual sca in the catchment is 64 there are 22 glaciers in the catchment covering an area of 10 9 km2 the average glacier area is 0 5 km2 and the glaciers cover the altitudinal range from 3672 to 5488 m a s l the catchment is located in the monsoon arid transition zone and is influenced by western disturbances from november to april and the indian summer monsoon from may to october azam et al 2019 mean annual precipitation recorded at the bhuntar meteorological observatory fig 1 is 975 mm with equal contributions from both western disturbances and the indian monsoon the mean annual temperature is 17 8 c and ranges from 8 9 c to 25 6 c the major seasons in the study area are considered as autumn october november winter december march summer april june and monsoon july september kulkarni et al 2002 the meteorological land cover soil and glacier data used in this study were acquired from satellite and in situ observations temperature and precipitation data from 1984 to 2018 were acquired from the bhuntar meteorological observatory 1092 m a s l situated 37 km from the catchment the data was extrapolated to different elevation bands using a linear temperature lapse rate of 6 5 c km and a beas specific precipitation gradient of 0 04 m prasad et al 2019 discharge measurements from july 2010 to february 2018 were collected from the allain duhangan hydropower plant adhpl at the allain barrage in the catchment the details of the satellite datasets used are presented in table 2 in addition the volume area v a scaling parameters are taken from prasad et al 2019 temperature and precipitation outputs of five gcms viz inmcm4 miroc5 ipsl cm5a lr gfdl cm3 and canesm2 of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 that project different possible future climates by the end of the century under rcp4 5 and 8 5 are used in the present study table 3 li et al 2019 utilized these models in beas basin and reported a broad spread of future river discharge resulting from the range of future temperatures and precipitation projections thus the selected climate models are helpful to understand the response of hydrological variables and hydropower plants to a variety of climate change scenarios as well as to cover the large uncertainty space in future runoff modelling 3 methods 3 1 model setup weap is a conceptual semi distributed model for the analysis of water resource systems taking different water resources rainfall snow and glacier melt and water demands hydropower into account sieber and purkey 2015 the catchment is divided into 100 m elevation bands and each elevation band is considered as an individual hydrological element with up to four land cover classes i e agriculture forest grassland and barren land glaciers in each elevation band are considered as separate hydrological elements to ensure that the model captures glacier evolution accurately momblanch et al 2019b we use weap s soil moisture method as it takes snow and glacier melt and glacier evolution into account in the runoff modelling this method is based on a two compartment soil water balance that describes evapotranspiration surface runoff interflow and baseflow for a watershed sieber and purkey 2015 evapotranspiration is calculated using a simplified penman monteith equation yates et al 2005 in the upper compartment along with surface runoff and interflow whereas baseflow is estimated in the lower compartment soil properties such as soil storage capacity hydraulic conductivity preferred flow direction and runoff resistance factor are allocated to each land cover area within an elevation band and are calibrated later yates et al 2005 the model is set up from october 1983 to february 2018 with a monthly time step the two years from october 1983 to september 1985 were used as a warm up period to remove the effect of initial conditions due to the small population and agricultural areas we assume that the human water demand in the catchment other than for hydropower is negligible and thus use only the hydrological and power generation modelling capacities of weap 3 2 model calibration and validation we adopt a three fold calibration technique to ensure the model captures the present glacier condition snow cover area and streamflow realistically first we manually calibrated the snow freezing and melting points and the ice melting point in the glaciated catchment by comparing the aggregate glacier mass balance in weap against the mass balance estimated from the improved accumulation area ratio iaar method tawde et al 2017 for 22 glaciers in the catchment the glacier mass balance estimates from 1986 2000 were used for calibration and 2001 2011 for validation secondly we manually calibrated the snow freezing and melting points for non glaciated catchments through the comparison of the simulated areas covered by snow in weap and modis sca due to modis sca data availability the time period of 2004 2010 was used for calibration whereas 2011 2016 was used for validation lastly the soil parameters for each land cover class were calibrated using the parameter estimation tool pest against the measured discharge here the time period 2010 2014 was used for calibration and 2015 2018 was for validation weap as a conceptual model relies on the calibration process and such a thorough stepwise calibration approach helps in minimising internal inconsistency and reduces the risk of error compensation ragettli et al 2014 3 3 modis snow cover extraction modis terra 8 days maximum snow cover product mod10a2 images were extracted to the spatial boundaries of each elevation band to obtain sca images with more than 10 cloud cover were eliminated from the time series tahir et al 2015 which accounted for 6 of the total images cloud pixels were corrected as no snow or snow pixels based on the surrounding pixels from the remaining images based on the critaria described in muhammad and thapa 2020 by visual interpretation taking special care in winter images this approach helps in effectively removing cloud pixels and providing reliable estimates of sca in the catchment finally the average monthly mean sca was estimated by taking the average of the up to four images available in a month 3 4 future projections of climate variables and glacier area the outputs of the selected climate models were extracted from 1986 until the end of the century for the grid location of bhuntar station as the model is calibrated for present using the in situ data measured at the same station tawde et al 2019 later the change factor method anandhi et al 2011 was used to bias correct the monthly means of temperature and precipitation projections for 20 year time slices throughout the century taking 1986 2005 as the baseline period these data were used to calculate additive and multiplicative monthly mean change factors for temperature and precipitation respectively for 2050 average of 2041 2060 and 2090 average of 2081 2100 which were applied to the base data at bhuntar station future changes in glacier area were estimated using a glacier geometry model based on v a scaling marzeion et al 2012 and the future climate projections for each time slice prasad et al 2019 a detailed description of this methodology can be found in the publications mentioned above finally weap was forced with the future temperature precipitation and glacier areas to simulate stream runoff and hydropower generation until the end of the century future power generation was simulated at both plants assuming that there will not be new water resources developments in the allain river in the future 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the total mass loss of 22 glaciers in the catchment simulated by weap during the calibration and validation periods is 12 2 and 11 4 meter water equivalent m w e respectively compared to 12 3 and 11 3 m w e by the iaar method our annual and cumulative mbs are in unison with the iaar method fig s1 furthermore a comparison of our average annual mass balance estimates in the allain catchment with previous studies in the surrounding area at glacier or basin scale shows good agreement table s1 results of the calibration and validation with modis sca show that weap is able to reproduce sca adequately in the catchment fig s2 with r2 of 0 79 and 0 73 respectively the maximum sca in winter and minimum sca simulated in monsoon agree well with modis sca although the sca in summer is underestimated by weap whereas autumn sca is overestimated this can be attributed to the linear temperature and precipitation gradient due to which weap starts building sca earlier than actual snowfall in the catchment the lack of snow redistribution in weap could also contribute to the underestimation of summer sca ragettli et al 2014 calibration and validation against the measured river discharge show that model performance fig s3 and table s3 is excellent for nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 89 and 0 83 and percent bias pbias 0 31 and 1 13 for calibration and validation respectively according to the monthly flow performance criteria of moriasi et al 2007 we observe that the model can reproduce low winter flows accurately but tends to underestimate the monsoon flows which leads to a small negative bias this tendency was also observed in other modelling studies in the beas basin by li et al 2019 and momblanch et al 2019b overall considering the limitations and uncertainty of hydrological modelling in complex mountainous regions the weap model performs well in reproducing the present cryosphere and hydrology of the study area further details of the calibration and validation can be found in the supplementary material 4 2 hydrological regime analysis of the simulated hydrological components suggests that the annual streamflow is mostly contributed by rainfall runoff 43 snowmelt 28 3 and baseflow 25 with a small contribution from glacier melt 3 8 during 1986 2017 however the contributions vary from year to year as shown in fig 2 a relatively high baseflow proportion is consistent with observations that baseflow in the area is enhanced by winter spring snowmelt infiltration to groundwater maurya et al 2018 high flow peaks of 1998 and 2005 are associated with increased winter precipitation in contrast the peak of 2011 was caused by increased monsoon precipitation as seen by the increase in snowmelt and rainfall runoff contributions respectively the low flow years such as 2000 2002 are associated with a higher simulated contribution up to 7 of annual flow of glacier melt demonstrating the tendency of glacier melt to have a buffering effect in drought years in the indus basin pritchard 2019 4 3 hydropower generation hydropower generation was calculated at both aleo 1 and aleo 2 power projects using the simulated runoff and the relevant plant details simulated power generation of the aleo 1 power project fig 3 is consistent throughout the year as its higher head and low flow requirement are always satisfied by the streamflow in contrast the higher flow requirement of the aleo 2 power project are not fulfilled by the stream yearlong leading to monthly variations in the power generation fig 3 similar to streamflow with maximum power generated in july when the plant runs at full capacity and minimum hydropower generated in february when streamflow is generally lowest these different design criteria lead to the average annual hydropower generation at aleo 1 and aleo 2 projects of 26 5 and 18 8 gigawatt hour gwh being 100 and 45 of their total annual generation potential given their installed capacity of 3 mw and 4 8 mw respectively 4 4 future projections the climate change scenarios used in the study suggest a consistent increase in the mean annual temperature throughout the century compared to the base period whereas the changes in precipitation show large variation within the models the weap model outputs show a significant sensitivity of the studied system to these varied future climate change scenarios sca was simulated to steadily reduce through the century along with the glacier extent in all the scenarios the total discharge of allain stream shows considerable uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of change between the individual ensemble members but a prominent change in the seasonality the projected changes in significant elements of study are summarised in table 4 and are elaborated in the subsequent sections 4 4 1 future climate change the mean annual temperature projected to increase by 3 c rcp4 5 and 5 6 c rcp8 5 by the end of the century where the cold scenarios show less warming compared to warm scenarios inmcm4 projects the least warming whereas ipsl cm5a lr shows the highest warming by the end of the century in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the precipitation by the end of the century may increase by 9 9 rcp4 5 and 19 5 rcp8 5 with large spread within the models canesm2 projects increases in the winter precipitation whilst miroc5 shows strengthening of monsoon precipitation by the end of the century fig 4 weap results suggest that the proportion of snowfall in total precipitation will decline gradually from 59 6 in the baseline to 48 3 rcp4 5 and 45 rcp8 5 by 2050 it will further reduce to 41 6 rcp4 5 and 33 7 rcp8 5 by 2090 4 4 2 future changes in cryosphere the entire area of the small and low altitude glaciers in the catchment is below the equilibrium line altitude in all the climate change scenarios used in the study which drives their rapid retreat in future they are projected to lose about 83 86 of the mass by 2050 and disappear completely by the end of century the mass loss is rapid till the middle of the century decreasing from 0 41 gt in 2000 to about 0 07 gt in 2050 but slows down by the end of century tawde et al 2019 the annual glacier mass balance gradually decreases from 0 88 m w e in 2000 to 1 39 m w e in rcp4 5 and 1 45 in rcp8 5 up to 2050 projected sca was also observed to decrease continuously until the end of century as increased temperatures lead to a higher proportion of precipitation falling as rain fig 5 maximum sca depletion occurs in august in the baseline scenario while it is simulated to advance to may june in 2090 as result of earlier snow melt average sca in the catchment declines by 15 3 rcp4 5 and 34 8 rcp8 5 by the end of century the winter sca of 98 of the catchment area in the baseline reduces to 94 rcp4 5 and 84 6 rcp8 5 in 2090 overall the warmer and drier climate projected by ipsl cm5a lr in rcp8 5 projects the highest loss in the cryospheric components whereas canesm2 in which winter precipitation increases significantly shows the least reduction in cryosphere 4 4 3 future hydrological change rising temperature and liquid precipitation in the future result in aet being projected to increase continuously throughout the century by 30 7 rcp4 5 and by 52 7 rcp8 5 in 2090 the simulated streamflow shows variation based on the forcing of each climate change scenario it is projected decrease in the cold dry and warm dry forcings whereas it increases in the wet scenarios the average annual streamflow is projected to change by 12 to 14 6 rcp4 5 and by 18 6 48 1 rcp8 5 by 2090 changes in the cryospheric components in the catchment result in the changes in the contributions of different hydrologic components snowmelt icemelt rainfall runoff and baseflow snow and glacier melt runoff contribution in the total streamflow is observed to gradually decrease in all climate change scenarios whereas rainfall runoff contribution increases by the end of century table 5 baseflow is also observed to increase gradually till the end of century contributing about 29 of total annual streamflow arising from the increase in liquid precipitation in the future immerzeel et al 2012 table 5 the changes in annual river flow also mask important seasonal changes simulated winter flows increase by 35 4 rcp4 5 and 77 8 rcp8 5 whilst autumn flows increase by 32 6 rcp4 5 and 48 9 rcp8 5 by the end of century warmer temperatures produce earlier melting of seasonal snow leading to streamflow peaks appearing in may and april in 2050 and 2090 respectively and the depletion of snow cover which results in reduced snowmelt that is further reflected in attenuation of summer runoff observed in the dry scenarios simulated mean monsoon streamflow is projected to change by 7 2 rcp4 5 and 12 6 rcp8 5 by the end of century as the decrease in monsoon flows in dry scenarios overpowers the increase projected by wet scenarios fig 6 4 4 4 future hydropower generation the simulated hydropower generation of the aleo 1 plant is unaffected by the changes in hydrology and cryosphere in the catchment due to the low flow requirement of the plant table 4 fig 7 the simulated lowest historical and future flows substantially exceed the flow requirements of the plant thus the hydrological requirement of aleo 1 is satisfied in all the climate change scenarios resulting in consistent power generation at maximum productivity throughout the century the power production of the aleo 2 project shows similar behaviour to streamflow it changes by 2 2 to 20 8 rcp4 5 and 5 4 to 40 1 rcp8 5 by the end of the century fig 7 while the wet scenarios show a noticeable increase in hydropower production dry scenarios show a marginal decrease of 2 5 due to the decrease in the peak generation in monsoon months which is partially offset by increases in the remaining months the decreasing snowmelt runoff causes the declining trend of simulated power production in june till the end of the century simulated power production from october to april continuously increases till 2090 in all the climate change scenarios fig 8 indicating that the aleo 2 power project is able to take advantage of the increased winter and autumn flows arising from the higher temperature and earlier melting in the baseline 10 2 and 10 4 of the total simulated annual hydropower generated by aleo 2 is in autumn and winter seasons respectively by the end of the century it increases by 63 7 and 86 3 in rcp8 5 contributing to overall increased power production in wet scenarios and offsetting the decrease in monsoon power production in dry scenarios 5 discussions in the present snow and glacier melt contribution to the annual runoff is significant 18 44 which is in agreement with previous studies in the beas basin bookhagen and burbank 2010 kumar et al 2007 li et al 2015 2019 momblanch et al 2019b future warmer temperatures lead to increased rainfall runoff contributions at the expense of snowmelt runoff which is further reflected in increases in winter flows by the end of the century these trends are following the previous studies in the himalayan catchments ali et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2012 jain et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 mishra et al 2020 momblanch et al 2019b sharma et al 2013 su et al 2016 and imply an increase in water availability in winter however the significant decrease in seasonal snowmelt which is the major contributor of streamflow in pre monsoon may june may reduce water availability for mountain communities the findings of this study indicate that while monsoon streamflows show widespread uncertainty depending on the forcing climate a shift in the seasonality especially in the increased low flows is prominent in all the climate change scenarios previous studies on the impacts of climate change on hydropower generation in the himalayan region have either focused on large reservoir hydropower schemes ali et al 2018 azmat 2015 or a limited range of small run of river hydropower scheme designs mishra et al 2020 in different river basins our study is the first to evaluate the impacts of climate change on two highly contrasting shp designs in addition their co location in the same small catchment means that the simulated differences in climate change sensitivity as seen in the changing hydropower generation is solely due to plant design rather than spatio temporal differences in climate change projections our study has used two ensembles of five gcms representing a range of possible future climates in the study area which enables us to understand the response of water resources and hydropower plants to a variety of climate change scenarios which largely cover the uncertainty space related to future emissions and climate models dry and wet scenarios considered in the study result in the contrasting hydrological impacts of decreased and increased total runoff that can inform understanding of the relative sensitivity of different run of river shp design to future climate change hydropower projects in the himalayan region which rely on relatively low flows and higher hydraulic heads such as aleo 1 provide consistent power generation at maximum productivity throughout the century they show little sensitivity to the climate change induced changes in hydrology as they underutilize available water resources during both the reduced and increased flows of the end of century as indicated by the large amounts of non power water flows their performance is thus robust to the uncertainty in climate change projections this is consistent with the study of mishra et al 2020 who reported that the simulated future changes in inflows across eight gcms under rcp4 5 and 8 5 to the turn of the century did not translate into significant changes in annual power production at two small power plants in the karakoram and central himalaya as both mostly operated at their maximum generation limit in contrast shps designed for high flows and relatively low water heads such as aleo 2 currently work at full capacity in the monsoon season when the streamflow is highest and dramatically reduce generation in winter as the region is covered in seasonal snow and streamflow is low our results show that their future annual and seasonal energy generation are highly sensitive to climate change uncertainty under future climate conditions that lead to reduced annual river discharge as seen in our results of cold dry and warm dry scenarios overall annual energy generation declines slightly but is associated with seasonal generation changes the increased streamflow in winter and autumn due to increased temperatures and earlier snowmelt allows these power projects to start utilising the increased power potential of low flows mishra et al 2020 that partially offsets the decreased monsoon season production however climate conditions that lead to increased streamflow as seen in our results of warm wet and cold wet scenarios result in an increase in power production by the end of the century particularly during the non monsoon period when energy demand is high overall low flow hydropower schemes like aleo 1 have the benefit of providing a constant and reliable rate of energy generation with negligible sensitivity to climate change uncertainty however they are unable to take advantage of increased river flows and their energy generation does not reflect seasonal energy demands and price variations high flow schemes like aleo 2 have the disadvantage that they provide highly variable within year energy generation and are sensitive to climatic variability throughout the year however they can take advantage of the increased hydropower potential in the future particularly in the non monsoon period to increase output enabling energy production to reflect seasonal energy demands and take benefit from seasonal price provisions within power purchase agreements this study has shown how the design of shp schemes directly influences their sensitivity to future climate change and the implications for the amount and seasonality of future energy generation these findings will help reduce the possible impacts of a changing climate on water security and power production and safeguard the investments in the thriving power sector in the mountains through climate adaptive planning and developments 6 conclusions the present study investigates the impacts of ten climate change scenarios two ensembles of five gcms in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 on water availability and hydropower generation of two contrasting shp located in the upper beas basin during 21st century using the weap model the simulated streamflow shows complex relationships between the hydrological response and the future climate with widespread uncertainty in the magnitude and direction however significant changes are simulated in the seasonality of streamflow due to rapid changes in the cryospheric components in particular leading to earlier snowmelt and a long term reduction in icemelt the simulated extent of the catchment s low altitude glaciers in the future decreases rapidly as a response to increasing temperature and disappear entirely by the end of the century snow cover area is also projected to decrease continuously following the reducing snowfall hydropower plants with large flow capacity such as aleo 2 show a behaviour similar to streamflow projections and are more sensitive to changing climate than shps that require low flows but rely on large heads as more hydropower projects are in the offing in small himalayan catchments our study offers insights into possible glacio hydrological changes and their impacts on power production of alternative shp plant designs this understanding can pave the way for climate adaptive planning and developments of small hydropower projects considering the uncertainty in future climate it should help the government and the private sector make climate informed design decisions and assessments of financial risks that will enable shps to achieve their potential for supporting

8266,study region allain catchment a sub basin of beas basin western himalaya study focus this study aims to assess future glacio hydrological changes in a small basin and their impacts on the operation of two small hydropower projects shp with contrasting hydrological requirements the water evaluation and planning weap model is used to integrate cryosphere hydrology and hydropower production modelling in the 21st century using climate changes projected by the ensembles of five global climate models under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 new hydrological insights for the region the total streamflow in the future is projected to have widespread uncertainty in the magnitude but shows noticeable changes in the seasonality of the two shps the one utilizing high flows with low hydraulic head shows a power generation behaviour similar to streamflow projections its annual hydropower production is projected to change by 2 to 21 rcp4 5 and 5 to 40 rcp8 5 by the end of the century the other plant that uses lesser flows but high head maintains its designed power production consistently throughout the century the study indicates that the design of hydropower plants strongly influences their sensitivity to future climate and thus provides important insights into the climate adaptive designs and planning of future hydropower projects in himalaya keywords glaciers indus snowmelt climate change modelling weap 1 introduction the hindukush karakoram himalayan hkh region is often referred to as water towers of asia due to its large concentration of glaciers and seasonal snow that sustains yearlong water supply of major rivers such as indus ganga and brahmaputra about 800 million people living in the mountains and downstream region rely on the water originating in the hkh region for agriculture hydropower generation industrial and domestic usage immerzeel et al 2020 pritchard 2019 these rivers are sustained by snow and glacier melt rainfall and groundwater although the contribution of individual components varies spatially between the sub basins and temporally between the seasons giving this region a complex hydrological nature lutz et al 2014 owing to the steep topographical gradient and the perennial water supply the hkh region has a large hydropower generation potential the gross hydropower potential of the indian hkh region is around 117 gigawatt gw most of which is potentially suitable for large hydropower projects i e with a capacity greater than 25 megawatt mw cea 2020 however large hydropower plants usually require storage structures which are difficult and expensive to realize due to the rugged terrain and incompatible with existing water sharing treaties in the region hussain et al 2019 in contrast shps with 2 25 mw capacity of the run of river type have lower costs related to the necessary built infrastructure and have fewer adverse effects on the environment and local communities kumar and katoch 2014 at present out of the cumulative feasible shp potential of 8 5 gw in the indian hkh region only 1 6 gw have been installed some under the united nations clean development mechanism cdm nep 2018 therefore a major part of the shp potential in india is yet to be tapped consequently the ministry of new renewable energy of india is extensively promoting the development of shp with a target to expand the installed capacity to 5 gw by 2022 nep 2018 both government and private sectors are actively investing in the increasing small hydropower facilities in the himalayas thus information about the changing future water availability and its interaction with plant design e g discharge and head requirements is critical to ensure the long term suitability of infrastructure and investments the hydrology of the hkh rivers is influenced by the precipitation regime snow and glacier melt in the summer and the characteristics of glaciers however the recent changes in the climatic conditions have had critical impacts on the state of cryospheric resources in most regions of the himalayas glaciers are retreating thinning and losing mass azam et al 2018 bolch et al 2012 glacier mass balance observations suggest an increase in mass wastage in the last decade maurer et al 2019 mukherjee et al 2018 tawde et al 2017 with small and low altitude glaciers losing mass at a higher rate than large glaciers prasad et al 2019 tawde et al 2017 also monitoring of winter precipitation in the western himalaya suggests an increase in total precipitation but a decrease in snowfall from 1991 to 2015 negi et al 2018 these changes in the cryosphere will alter the spatial pattern and timing of glacier and snow melt immerzeel et al 2012 lutz et al 2014 which may have a profound impact on the amount and seasonality of water available for hydropower generation most of the river runoff modelling studies in himalaya focus on large basins covering areas larger than 5000 km2 momblanch et al 2019a however the decision making regarding the small hydropower sector occurs at small watersheds several studies have explored the hydrological regimes of small himalayan watersheds using a range of modelling approaches from detailed glacio hydrological models immerzeel et al 2012 ragettli et al 2015 to simple empirical relationships between temperature and melt azam et al 2019 kulkarni et al 2002 rathore et al 2011 the former methods require large amounts of data at a high spatio temporal resolution which are often not available in high elevation catchments whereas the simplicity of the later methods inhibits them from taking the complex water demand structures into account consequently conceptual models which integrate the main hydrological processes with water uses and infrastructures and simulate energy production in multiple hydropower plants over time in a single run offer an appropriate alternative momblanch et al 2019b the present study aims to assess the future changes in hydropower generation of two shp with contrasting discharge head designs and discuss the implications for future shp design in the hkh we have used a water resource systems model that integrates cryospheric resources hydrological processes water infrastructures and water demands we conduct a robust evaluation of the historical model performance using glacier mass balance mb modis snow cover area sca and measured discharge then future changes in runoff and hydropower generation are estimated until the end of the century considering the projections of two ensembles of five global climate models gcm representing different types of future climates under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 2 study area and data the two selected run of river power projects viz 3 mw aleo manali and 4 8 mw aleo 2 hydropower projects henceforth called as aleo 1 and aleo 2 respectively are situated on the allain stream near manali in the state of himachal pradesh in india fig 1 table 1 the allain stream is a tributary of the beas river which is a part of the indus river system the catchment area of the power project is 140 2 km2 with an altitudinal range from 1806 to 6018 m a s l around 47 of the catchment area is covered by grassland with 22 and 23 of forest and barren land cover respectively a small agricultural area located at the tip of the catchment near the village of prini accounts for just 0 3 of the total catchment area the mean annual sca in the catchment is 64 there are 22 glaciers in the catchment covering an area of 10 9 km2 the average glacier area is 0 5 km2 and the glaciers cover the altitudinal range from 3672 to 5488 m a s l the catchment is located in the monsoon arid transition zone and is influenced by western disturbances from november to april and the indian summer monsoon from may to october azam et al 2019 mean annual precipitation recorded at the bhuntar meteorological observatory fig 1 is 975 mm with equal contributions from both western disturbances and the indian monsoon the mean annual temperature is 17 8 c and ranges from 8 9 c to 25 6 c the major seasons in the study area are considered as autumn october november winter december march summer april june and monsoon july september kulkarni et al 2002 the meteorological land cover soil and glacier data used in this study were acquired from satellite and in situ observations temperature and precipitation data from 1984 to 2018 were acquired from the bhuntar meteorological observatory 1092 m a s l situated 37 km from the catchment the data was extrapolated to different elevation bands using a linear temperature lapse rate of 6 5 c km and a beas specific precipitation gradient of 0 04 m prasad et al 2019 discharge measurements from july 2010 to february 2018 were collected from the allain duhangan hydropower plant adhpl at the allain barrage in the catchment the details of the satellite datasets used are presented in table 2 in addition the volume area v a scaling parameters are taken from prasad et al 2019 temperature and precipitation outputs of five gcms viz inmcm4 miroc5 ipsl cm5a lr gfdl cm3 and canesm2 of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 that project different possible future climates by the end of the century under rcp4 5 and 8 5 are used in the present study table 3 li et al 2019 utilized these models in beas basin and reported a broad spread of future river discharge resulting from the range of future temperatures and precipitation projections thus the selected climate models are helpful to understand the response of hydrological variables and hydropower plants to a variety of climate change scenarios as well as to cover the large uncertainty space in future runoff modelling 3 methods 3 1 model setup weap is a conceptual semi distributed model for the analysis of water resource systems taking different water resources rainfall snow and glacier melt and water demands hydropower into account sieber and purkey 2015 the catchment is divided into 100 m elevation bands and each elevation band is considered as an individual hydrological element with up to four land cover classes i e agriculture forest grassland and barren land glaciers in each elevation band are considered as separate hydrological elements to ensure that the model captures glacier evolution accurately momblanch et al 2019b we use weap s soil moisture method as it takes snow and glacier melt and glacier evolution into account in the runoff modelling this method is based on a two compartment soil water balance that describes evapotranspiration surface runoff interflow and baseflow for a watershed sieber and purkey 2015 evapotranspiration is calculated using a simplified penman monteith equation yates et al 2005 in the upper compartment along with surface runoff and interflow whereas baseflow is estimated in the lower compartment soil properties such as soil storage capacity hydraulic conductivity preferred flow direction and runoff resistance factor are allocated to each land cover area within an elevation band and are calibrated later yates et al 2005 the model is set up from october 1983 to february 2018 with a monthly time step the two years from october 1983 to september 1985 were used as a warm up period to remove the effect of initial conditions due to the small population and agricultural areas we assume that the human water demand in the catchment other than for hydropower is negligible and thus use only the hydrological and power generation modelling capacities of weap 3 2 model calibration and validation we adopt a three fold calibration technique to ensure the model captures the present glacier condition snow cover area and streamflow realistically first we manually calibrated the snow freezing and melting points and the ice melting point in the glaciated catchment by comparing the aggregate glacier mass balance in weap against the mass balance estimated from the improved accumulation area ratio iaar method tawde et al 2017 for 22 glaciers in the catchment the glacier mass balance estimates from 1986 2000 were used for calibration and 2001 2011 for validation secondly we manually calibrated the snow freezing and melting points for non glaciated catchments through the comparison of the simulated areas covered by snow in weap and modis sca due to modis sca data availability the time period of 2004 2010 was used for calibration whereas 2011 2016 was used for validation lastly the soil parameters for each land cover class were calibrated using the parameter estimation tool pest against the measured discharge here the time period 2010 2014 was used for calibration and 2015 2018 was for validation weap as a conceptual model relies on the calibration process and such a thorough stepwise calibration approach helps in minimising internal inconsistency and reduces the risk of error compensation ragettli et al 2014 3 3 modis snow cover extraction modis terra 8 days maximum snow cover product mod10a2 images were extracted to the spatial boundaries of each elevation band to obtain sca images with more than 10 cloud cover were eliminated from the time series tahir et al 2015 which accounted for 6 of the total images cloud pixels were corrected as no snow or snow pixels based on the surrounding pixels from the remaining images based on the critaria described in muhammad and thapa 2020 by visual interpretation taking special care in winter images this approach helps in effectively removing cloud pixels and providing reliable estimates of sca in the catchment finally the average monthly mean sca was estimated by taking the average of the up to four images available in a month 3 4 future projections of climate variables and glacier area the outputs of the selected climate models were extracted from 1986 until the end of the century for the grid location of bhuntar station as the model is calibrated for present using the in situ data measured at the same station tawde et al 2019 later the change factor method anandhi et al 2011 was used to bias correct the monthly means of temperature and precipitation projections for 20 year time slices throughout the century taking 1986 2005 as the baseline period these data were used to calculate additive and multiplicative monthly mean change factors for temperature and precipitation respectively for 2050 average of 2041 2060 and 2090 average of 2081 2100 which were applied to the base data at bhuntar station future changes in glacier area were estimated using a glacier geometry model based on v a scaling marzeion et al 2012 and the future climate projections for each time slice prasad et al 2019 a detailed description of this methodology can be found in the publications mentioned above finally weap was forced with the future temperature precipitation and glacier areas to simulate stream runoff and hydropower generation until the end of the century future power generation was simulated at both plants assuming that there will not be new water resources developments in the allain river in the future 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the total mass loss of 22 glaciers in the catchment simulated by weap during the calibration and validation periods is 12 2 and 11 4 meter water equivalent m w e respectively compared to 12 3 and 11 3 m w e by the iaar method our annual and cumulative mbs are in unison with the iaar method fig s1 furthermore a comparison of our average annual mass balance estimates in the allain catchment with previous studies in the surrounding area at glacier or basin scale shows good agreement table s1 results of the calibration and validation with modis sca show that weap is able to reproduce sca adequately in the catchment fig s2 with r2 of 0 79 and 0 73 respectively the maximum sca in winter and minimum sca simulated in monsoon agree well with modis sca although the sca in summer is underestimated by weap whereas autumn sca is overestimated this can be attributed to the linear temperature and precipitation gradient due to which weap starts building sca earlier than actual snowfall in the catchment the lack of snow redistribution in weap could also contribute to the underestimation of summer sca ragettli et al 2014 calibration and validation against the measured river discharge show that model performance fig s3 and table s3 is excellent for nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 89 and 0 83 and percent bias pbias 0 31 and 1 13 for calibration and validation respectively according to the monthly flow performance criteria of moriasi et al 2007 we observe that the model can reproduce low winter flows accurately but tends to underestimate the monsoon flows which leads to a small negative bias this tendency was also observed in other modelling studies in the beas basin by li et al 2019 and momblanch et al 2019b overall considering the limitations and uncertainty of hydrological modelling in complex mountainous regions the weap model performs well in reproducing the present cryosphere and hydrology of the study area further details of the calibration and validation can be found in the supplementary material 4 2 hydrological regime analysis of the simulated hydrological components suggests that the annual streamflow is mostly contributed by rainfall runoff 43 snowmelt 28 3 and baseflow 25 with a small contribution from glacier melt 3 8 during 1986 2017 however the contributions vary from year to year as shown in fig 2 a relatively high baseflow proportion is consistent with observations that baseflow in the area is enhanced by winter spring snowmelt infiltration to groundwater maurya et al 2018 high flow peaks of 1998 and 2005 are associated with increased winter precipitation in contrast the peak of 2011 was caused by increased monsoon precipitation as seen by the increase in snowmelt and rainfall runoff contributions respectively the low flow years such as 2000 2002 are associated with a higher simulated contribution up to 7 of annual flow of glacier melt demonstrating the tendency of glacier melt to have a buffering effect in drought years in the indus basin pritchard 2019 4 3 hydropower generation hydropower generation was calculated at both aleo 1 and aleo 2 power projects using the simulated runoff and the relevant plant details simulated power generation of the aleo 1 power project fig 3 is consistent throughout the year as its higher head and low flow requirement are always satisfied by the streamflow in contrast the higher flow requirement of the aleo 2 power project are not fulfilled by the stream yearlong leading to monthly variations in the power generation fig 3 similar to streamflow with maximum power generated in july when the plant runs at full capacity and minimum hydropower generated in february when streamflow is generally lowest these different design criteria lead to the average annual hydropower generation at aleo 1 and aleo 2 projects of 26 5 and 18 8 gigawatt hour gwh being 100 and 45 of their total annual generation potential given their installed capacity of 3 mw and 4 8 mw respectively 4 4 future projections the climate change scenarios used in the study suggest a consistent increase in the mean annual temperature throughout the century compared to the base period whereas the changes in precipitation show large variation within the models the weap model outputs show a significant sensitivity of the studied system to these varied future climate change scenarios sca was simulated to steadily reduce through the century along with the glacier extent in all the scenarios the total discharge of allain stream shows considerable uncertainty in the magnitude and direction of change between the individual ensemble members but a prominent change in the seasonality the projected changes in significant elements of study are summarised in table 4 and are elaborated in the subsequent sections 4 4 1 future climate change the mean annual temperature projected to increase by 3 c rcp4 5 and 5 6 c rcp8 5 by the end of the century where the cold scenarios show less warming compared to warm scenarios inmcm4 projects the least warming whereas ipsl cm5a lr shows the highest warming by the end of the century in both rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the precipitation by the end of the century may increase by 9 9 rcp4 5 and 19 5 rcp8 5 with large spread within the models canesm2 projects increases in the winter precipitation whilst miroc5 shows strengthening of monsoon precipitation by the end of the century fig 4 weap results suggest that the proportion of snowfall in total precipitation will decline gradually from 59 6 in the baseline to 48 3 rcp4 5 and 45 rcp8 5 by 2050 it will further reduce to 41 6 rcp4 5 and 33 7 rcp8 5 by 2090 4 4 2 future changes in cryosphere the entire area of the small and low altitude glaciers in the catchment is below the equilibrium line altitude in all the climate change scenarios used in the study which drives their rapid retreat in future they are projected to lose about 83 86 of the mass by 2050 and disappear completely by the end of century the mass loss is rapid till the middle of the century decreasing from 0 41 gt in 2000 to about 0 07 gt in 2050 but slows down by the end of century tawde et al 2019 the annual glacier mass balance gradually decreases from 0 88 m w e in 2000 to 1 39 m w e in rcp4 5 and 1 45 in rcp8 5 up to 2050 projected sca was also observed to decrease continuously until the end of century as increased temperatures lead to a higher proportion of precipitation falling as rain fig 5 maximum sca depletion occurs in august in the baseline scenario while it is simulated to advance to may june in 2090 as result of earlier snow melt average sca in the catchment declines by 15 3 rcp4 5 and 34 8 rcp8 5 by the end of century the winter sca of 98 of the catchment area in the baseline reduces to 94 rcp4 5 and 84 6 rcp8 5 in 2090 overall the warmer and drier climate projected by ipsl cm5a lr in rcp8 5 projects the highest loss in the cryospheric components whereas canesm2 in which winter precipitation increases significantly shows the least reduction in cryosphere 4 4 3 future hydrological change rising temperature and liquid precipitation in the future result in aet being projected to increase continuously throughout the century by 30 7 rcp4 5 and by 52 7 rcp8 5 in 2090 the simulated streamflow shows variation based on the forcing of each climate change scenario it is projected decrease in the cold dry and warm dry forcings whereas it increases in the wet scenarios the average annual streamflow is projected to change by 12 to 14 6 rcp4 5 and by 18 6 48 1 rcp8 5 by 2090 changes in the cryospheric components in the catchment result in the changes in the contributions of different hydrologic components snowmelt icemelt rainfall runoff and baseflow snow and glacier melt runoff contribution in the total streamflow is observed to gradually decrease in all climate change scenarios whereas rainfall runoff contribution increases by the end of century table 5 baseflow is also observed to increase gradually till the end of century contributing about 29 of total annual streamflow arising from the increase in liquid precipitation in the future immerzeel et al 2012 table 5 the changes in annual river flow also mask important seasonal changes simulated winter flows increase by 35 4 rcp4 5 and 77 8 rcp8 5 whilst autumn flows increase by 32 6 rcp4 5 and 48 9 rcp8 5 by the end of century warmer temperatures produce earlier melting of seasonal snow leading to streamflow peaks appearing in may and april in 2050 and 2090 respectively and the depletion of snow cover which results in reduced snowmelt that is further reflected in attenuation of summer runoff observed in the dry scenarios simulated mean monsoon streamflow is projected to change by 7 2 rcp4 5 and 12 6 rcp8 5 by the end of century as the decrease in monsoon flows in dry scenarios overpowers the increase projected by wet scenarios fig 6 4 4 4 future hydropower generation the simulated hydropower generation of the aleo 1 plant is unaffected by the changes in hydrology and cryosphere in the catchment due to the low flow requirement of the plant table 4 fig 7 the simulated lowest historical and future flows substantially exceed the flow requirements of the plant thus the hydrological requirement of aleo 1 is satisfied in all the climate change scenarios resulting in consistent power generation at maximum productivity throughout the century the power production of the aleo 2 project shows similar behaviour to streamflow it changes by 2 2 to 20 8 rcp4 5 and 5 4 to 40 1 rcp8 5 by the end of the century fig 7 while the wet scenarios show a noticeable increase in hydropower production dry scenarios show a marginal decrease of 2 5 due to the decrease in the peak generation in monsoon months which is partially offset by increases in the remaining months the decreasing snowmelt runoff causes the declining trend of simulated power production in june till the end of the century simulated power production from october to april continuously increases till 2090 in all the climate change scenarios fig 8 indicating that the aleo 2 power project is able to take advantage of the increased winter and autumn flows arising from the higher temperature and earlier melting in the baseline 10 2 and 10 4 of the total simulated annual hydropower generated by aleo 2 is in autumn and winter seasons respectively by the end of the century it increases by 63 7 and 86 3 in rcp8 5 contributing to overall increased power production in wet scenarios and offsetting the decrease in monsoon power production in dry scenarios 5 discussions in the present snow and glacier melt contribution to the annual runoff is significant 18 44 which is in agreement with previous studies in the beas basin bookhagen and burbank 2010 kumar et al 2007 li et al 2015 2019 momblanch et al 2019b future warmer temperatures lead to increased rainfall runoff contributions at the expense of snowmelt runoff which is further reflected in increases in winter flows by the end of the century these trends are following the previous studies in the himalayan catchments ali et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2012 jain et al 2010 lutz et al 2014 mishra et al 2020 momblanch et al 2019b sharma et al 2013 su et al 2016 and imply an increase in water availability in winter however the significant decrease in seasonal snowmelt which is the major contributor of streamflow in pre monsoon may june may reduce water availability for mountain communities the findings of this study indicate that while monsoon streamflows show widespread uncertainty depending on the forcing climate a shift in the seasonality especially in the increased low flows is prominent in all the climate change scenarios previous studies on the impacts of climate change on hydropower generation in the himalayan region have either focused on large reservoir hydropower schemes ali et al 2018 azmat 2015 or a limited range of small run of river hydropower scheme designs mishra et al 2020 in different river basins our study is the first to evaluate the impacts of climate change on two highly contrasting shp designs in addition their co location in the same small catchment means that the simulated differences in climate change sensitivity as seen in the changing hydropower generation is solely due to plant design rather than spatio temporal differences in climate change projections our study has used two ensembles of five gcms representing a range of possible future climates in the study area which enables us to understand the response of water resources and hydropower plants to a variety of climate change scenarios which largely cover the uncertainty space related to future emissions and climate models dry and wet scenarios considered in the study result in the contrasting hydrological impacts of decreased and increased total runoff that can inform understanding of the relative sensitivity of different run of river shp design to future climate change hydropower projects in the himalayan region which rely on relatively low flows and higher hydraulic heads such as aleo 1 provide consistent power generation at maximum productivity throughout the century they show little sensitivity to the climate change induced changes in hydrology as they underutilize available water resources during both the reduced and increased flows of the end of century as indicated by the large amounts of non power water flows their performance is thus robust to the uncertainty in climate change projections this is consistent with the study of mishra et al 2020 who reported that the simulated future changes in inflows across eight gcms under rcp4 5 and 8 5 to the turn of the century did not translate into significant changes in annual power production at two small power plants in the karakoram and central himalaya as both mostly operated at their maximum generation limit in contrast shps designed for high flows and relatively low water heads such as aleo 2 currently work at full capacity in the monsoon season when the streamflow is highest and dramatically reduce generation in winter as the region is covered in seasonal snow and streamflow is low our results show that their future annual and seasonal energy generation are highly sensitive to climate change uncertainty under future climate conditions that lead to reduced annual river discharge as seen in our results of cold dry and warm dry scenarios overall annual energy generation declines slightly but is associated with seasonal generation changes the increased streamflow in winter and autumn due to increased temperatures and earlier snowmelt allows these power projects to start utilising the increased power potential of low flows mishra et al 2020 that partially offsets the decreased monsoon season production however climate conditions that lead to increased streamflow as seen in our results of warm wet and cold wet scenarios result in an increase in power production by the end of the century particularly during the non monsoon period when energy demand is high overall low flow hydropower schemes like aleo 1 have the benefit of providing a constant and reliable rate of energy generation with negligible sensitivity to climate change uncertainty however they are unable to take advantage of increased river flows and their energy generation does not reflect seasonal energy demands and price variations high flow schemes like aleo 2 have the disadvantage that they provide highly variable within year energy generation and are sensitive to climatic variability throughout the year however they can take advantage of the increased hydropower potential in the future particularly in the non monsoon period to increase output enabling energy production to reflect seasonal energy demands and take benefit from seasonal price provisions within power purchase agreements this study has shown how the design of shp schemes directly influences their sensitivity to future climate change and the implications for the amount and seasonality of future energy generation these findings will help reduce the possible impacts of a changing climate on water security and power production and safeguard the investments in the thriving power sector in the mountains through climate adaptive planning and developments 6 conclusions the present study investigates the impacts of ten climate change scenarios two ensembles of five gcms in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 on water availability and hydropower generation of two contrasting shp located in the upper beas basin during 21st century using the weap model the simulated streamflow shows complex relationships between the hydrological response and the future climate with widespread uncertainty in the magnitude and direction however significant changes are simulated in the seasonality of streamflow due to rapid changes in the cryospheric components in particular leading to earlier snowmelt and a long term reduction in icemelt the simulated extent of the catchment s low altitude glaciers in the future decreases rapidly as a response to increasing temperature and disappear entirely by the end of the century snow cover area is also projected to decrease continuously following the reducing snowfall hydropower plants with large flow capacity such as aleo 2 show a behaviour similar to streamflow projections and are more sensitive to changing climate than shps that require low flows but rely on large heads as more hydropower projects are in the offing in small himalayan catchments our study offers insights into possible glacio hydrological changes and their impacts on power production of alternative shp plant designs this understanding can pave the way for climate adaptive planning and developments of small hydropower projects considering the uncertainty in future climate it should help the government and the private sector make climate informed design decisions and assessments of financial risks that will enable shps to achieve their potential for supporting

8267,study region upper region of the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand study focus the upper gcpr basin is highly regulated by multipurpose reservoirs which obviously have altered the natural streamflow understanding quantitative effects of such alteration is crucial for effective water resource management therefore this study aims to assess how reservoir operation affects the water balance daily flow regime and extreme flows in this basin for this purpose we reconstructed streamflow in the naturalized no reservoir and baseline operation scenarios using the 1 km resolution distributed model to overcome data scarcity we ran the model with global data and parameterization a target storage and release based reservoir operation module was applied in the baseline operation scenario the model results were analyzed in comparison to observations in a wet year a dry year and the period 1989 2014 new hydrological insights for the region the reservoir operation resulted in more evaporation it inverted the natural flow seasonality and smoothed the daily flow regime with decreasing high flows increasing mean flows and low flows greater baseflow contribution and lower flashiness it prevented or mitigated many historical extreme flow incidents the annual flood peaks and minimum flows were markedly mitigated in terms of both magnitudes and frequencies but their timing became more variable and difficult to predict altogether the results highlighted the importance of effective decision making for real time operation which remain challenging in practice keywords reservoir effects naturalized flow scenario analysis distributed hydrological model wflow sbm chao phraya basin 1 introduction the majority of rivers around the world are fragmented by dammed reservoirs zhou et al 2016 although several dams have been removed at the end of their useful lives they are outnumbered by those in operation and under construction o connor et al 2015 the current boom in dammed reservoir construction takes place particularly in regions with emerging economies like southeast asia sea where it serves not only for irrigation and hydrological hazard control but also for hydropower generation zarfl et al 2015 in fact sea has recently become the region with the highest investment for large multipurpose reservoirs siciliano et al 2015 currently there are more than 130 new projects of large reservoirs planned in laos malaysia cambodia myanmar and at the border of myanmar thailand siciliano et al 2015 therefore it is undeniable that dammed reservoirs are a necessity for water resource management and play an important role in flood and drought mitigation in sea despite their benefits dammed reservoirs remain controversial due to their potentially negative impacts on streamflow environment and society reservoir operations alter the natural flow regime i e flow rate flow magnitude and fluctuation in particular the duration timing and frequency of wet and dry extremes from the daily to the long term scale graf 2006 mittal et al 2016 li et al 2017 on the one hand reservoir operations can attenuate flood and drought events by smoothing streamflow with lower flood peaks and higher baseflows e g lee et al 2017 wu et al 2018 gai et al 2019 on the other hand hydrological extremes can be intensified by ineffective management of reservoir water which in some cases had greater influence than climate change e g graf 2006 mittal et al 2016 he et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2018 since sea has an increasing number of dammed reservoirs while being highly exposed to hydrological hazards trenberth et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 there is an urgent need to evaluate effects of reservoir operations on streamflow in specific contexts of this region the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand is one of the most highly regulated river basins by dammed reservoirs in sea the delta area in the basin is also among the most vulnerable areas in the region yusuf and francisco 2009 despite water resource management with several multipurpose reservoirs the gcpr basin still suffers from floods and droughts regularly which devastate the agricultural and environmental resources and subsequently the economic development of the country and the region takeda et al 2016 kinouchi et al 2018 while most reservoirs in neighboring basins such as in the mekong river have been constructed in recent years urban et al 2018 the main reservoirs in the gcpr basin have been operated for over half a century and data on daily reservoir outflows are available for the last 25 years the longer period of observational records in the gcpr basin allows for a comprehensive analysis therefore investigating effects of reservoir operations on streamflow in this basin can also contribute to the understanding and improvement of water resource planning and management in other basins in sea previous studies mentioned conflicting causes of hydrological hazards in the gcpr basin komori et al 2012 suggested that the 2011 gcpr flood one the most catastrophic floods ever recorded in sea was driven by intense precipitation in line with the finding of sayama et al 2015 that a 1 increase in precipitation caused a 4 2 increase in flood inundation in the basin meanwhile van oldenborgh et al 2012 concluded that the 2011 gcpr flood volumes were magnified by non meteorological factors particularly reservoir water management the study of gale and saunders 2013 supported this statement as they found that the precipitation anomaly was higher in 1995 than in 2011 but the 1995 flood was not nearly as severe as the 2011 flood however considering the limited number of studies the respective roles of reservoir operations and extreme weather on hydrological hazards in the gcpr basin remain unclear the attention to reservoir operations and their effects on streamflow in the gcpr basin was drawn after the 2011 flood komori et al 2012 provided an overview of reservoir water management in 2011 the spectrum analysis by tebakari et al 2012 indicated that the observed streamflow downstream of the reservoirs had a periodicity of seven days due to the irrigation purpose since daily streamflow data for this basin have been available only after the reservoir constructions it is impossible to identify changes and trends of observed streamflow from natural to regulated conditions therefore several studies took the approach of comparing observed streamflow to naturalized without reservoir streamflow obtained from hydrological models komori et al 2013 wichakul et al 2013 hanasaki et al 2014 mateo et al 2014 sayama et al 2015 all these studies highlighted effects of reservoir operations on downstream flows in the gcpr basin by analysing hydrographs however they mainly focused on reservoir effects on high flows particularly during the 2011 flood events and excluded reservoir effects on low flows most studies assessed reservoir effects on hydrographs in the downstream floodplain which may be influenced by effects of intensive irrigation in addition reservoir effects on the water balance and daily flow regime in the gcpr basin have not been investigated understanding the naturalized water balance and daily flow regime and how they have been modified by reservoir operations is essential not only from a hydrological viewpoint but also from socio economic and environmental perspectives the knowledge assists dam operators and water resource managers in planning and developing strategies to optimize both human consumption and ecosystem maintenance it also supports adaptive management strategies to predict and deal with such probable changes for other existing or planned reservoirs in the same or a neighboring basin moreover it helps to prepare for expected changes in streamflow after dam removals in the future however the main challenge in investigating the naturalized water balance and daily flow regime in many river basins including the gcpr basin is the lack of observed streamflow data prior to reservoir constructions one of the approaches to overcome the lack of observed streamflow data in reservoir operation studies is hydrological modeling many hydrological models can represent reservoir operation schemes and hydrological responses as part of rainfall runoff processes e g zajac et al 2017 canuto et al 2019 gai et al 2019 distributed hydrological models are often used for reservoir system modeling because they allow the calculation of water interactions between a reservoir and its surrounding area in a spatially distributed manner however distributed models usually require an enormous amount of data which is a drawback for data scarce areas like in sea in addition distributed models usually require area specific and scenario specific calibration which poses a high risk of overparameterization and long computation times to tackle these issues we used the 1 km resolution distributed wflow sbm model with global data and parameterization schellekens et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the model has been set up and evaluated for the upper region of the gcpr basin as elaborated in a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 with a target storage and release based reservoir operation module rom the model was applied to simulate daily streamflow in the baseline operation scenario when reservoir releases were determined solely based on generalized operation rules without real time control in this study we further apply the model to simulate daily streamflow in the naturalized scenario by comparing the simulation results in the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios to the observations which represent the real time operation we can comprehensively analyze effects of reservoir operations in terms of generalized operation rules and real time control on daily streamflow the main aims of this study are to i quantify effects of reservoir operations on the water balance and daily flow regime and ii distinguish effects of reservoir operation and extreme weather on extreme flows in the gcpr basin we analyzed the simulated and observed streamflows over a 25 year period of 1989 2013 by focusing on streamflow at the dam locations instead of floodplain gauges we excluded probable influences of downstream irrigation and highlighted the effects of reservoir operations alone the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the study area in section 3 we summarize the model application and required data next our analysis methods are presented in section 4 including the evaluation of naturalized flow simulations section 4 1 the evaluation of reservoir effects on the water balance section 4 2 the evaluation of reservoir effects on daily flow regime section 4 3 and the evaluation of effects of reservoir operations and extreme weather on extreme flows section 4 4 we present the results in section 5 and the discussion in section 6 followed by the conclusion and outlook in section 7 2 study area the greater chao phraya river basin gcpr located in the heart of thailand covers approximately 158 600 km2 30 of the country s area fig 1 it is divided into the upper and lower regions at nakhon sawan valley where the upstream rivers ping wang yom and nan join and form the chao phraya which drains into the gulf of thailand since the main goal of this study is to assess the reservoir effects we focused on the upper region 104 000 km2 where the main reservoirs are located its major areas are covered by forests and grasslands which have been gradually replaced by agricultural areas particularity rice fields jamrussri and toda 2017 the climate of the upper gcpr basin is distinctly divided into the wet rainy and dry seasons which are influenced by monsoons and tropical cyclones considering the seasonality the thai water year starts from april 1st of any given year to march 31st of the following year i e the year 2011 is from april 1st 2011 to march 31st 2012 the water year and water yearly hereafter will be referred to as year and yearly annual there are seven multipurpose reservoirs in the upper gcpr basin serving irrigation water supply hydroelectricity generation and flood control the bhumibol reservoir storage capacity 13 46 billion m3 has been operated on the ping river since 1964 and the sirikit reservoir storage capacity 9 51 billion m3 has been operated on the nan river since 1977 reservoir locations shown in fig 1 another five reservoirs were constructed on the ping river two wang river two and nan river one a plan to build the first reservoir on the yom river has been postponed since 1980 due to controversial discussion about the myriad of negative environmental and social impacts apichitchat and jung 2015 since the five reservoirs of which four are located upstream of the bhumibol reservoir only account for 7 of the total reservoir capacity in the upper region we assumed that their effects on downstream flows are insignificant at the basin scale and thus focused on the two major reservoirs sirikit and bhumibol the gcpr basin endures regular occurrences of floods and droughts in rainy seasons flooding often occurs because the downstream part of the upper region and most of the lower region are gently sloped hence high discharge from the upper region is likely to flood the lower region in many occasions upstream floodwater cannot flow down at once due to the elevated water level in the chao phraya river itself as a consequence the floodplain above the narrow section at nakhon sawan is inundated for a long period sayama et al 2015 in dry seasons droughts tend to occur when the water storage in the major reservoirs fails to meet the irrigation and consumption demands e g the bhumibol water shortage in 2016 zenkoji et al 2019 the water shortage leads to large losses in agricultural and industrial production kinouchi et al 2018 therefore it is imperative to understand reservoir operations and their effects on the water balance and flow regime in the upper region in order to enhance their capabilities to mitigate hydrological extremes for the entire basin in this study we analyzed the water balance and streamflow in two regulated catchments the sirikit and bhumibol catchments the drainage areas from the headwater until the dam location are 13 155 km2 for sirikit and 25 988 km2 for bhumibol however we defined the sirikit catchment 2020 km2 and the bhumibol catchment 6863 km2 as the drainage areas from the inflow point of each reservoir in the hydrological model to the dam location see fig 1 to be able to analyze their upstream inflows in the water balance two natural catchments located upstream of the reservoirs the nan natural 3546 km2 and yom natural 2018 km2 were also investigated they were used to point out the resemblance of the upstream natural streamflow to the naturalized flow simulation of the sirikit and bhumibol catchments since the observations prior to the reservoir construction are unavailable for the model result validation locations of the four catchments are shown in fig 1 by focusing on the reservoir catchments instead of floodplain catchments downstream we avoided effects of intensive irrigation 3 model and data the application of the wflow sbm model with the simplified target storage and release based reservoir operation module rom in this study is summarized below the full description of wflow sbm is provided in schellekens et al 2019 and the rom calculation is explained in wannasin et al 2021 details on the model development and evaluation for the upper gcpr basin can be found in wannasin et al 2021 the wflow simple bucket model so called wflow sbm is a distributed hydrological model in the wflow modeling platform built within the pcraster and python environments schellekens et al 2019 it was developed based on the topog sbm model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 and has shown good performance in the applications in many basins around the world e g lópez lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 giardino et al 2018 lópez lópez 2018 gebremicael et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 for the entire upper gcpr basin the model has been set up at the 1 km spatial resolution and the 3 hourly timescale wannasin et al 2021 in this study the simulation of the wflow sbm model with the rom for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs is referred to as the baseline operation scenario while the simulation without the reservoir existence is referred to as the naturalized scenario to overcome data scarcity in the upper gcpr basin which is a common challenge in sea most required spatial data for wflow sbm were obtained from global databases the geospatial data included the elevation map from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 the land cover map from globcover bontemps et al 2011 the soil map from soilgrids hengl et al 2017 and the river network map from the royal irrigation department of thailand rid the meteorological data comprised precipitation p from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 database mswep v2 beck et al 2019 and potential evapotranspiration pet from the earth2observe database schellekens et al 2017 the hydrological data consisted of observed daily streamflow observed daily reservoir storage and reservoir operating rule curves of each reservoirs provided by rid and the electricity generating authority of thailand egat only the river network and observed hydrological data were derived from local sources as for the wflow sbm model parameterization seamless distributed parameter maps was implemented instead of full calibration which prevented overparameterization and reduced computation times wannasin et al 2021 the soil related parameter maps e g hydraulic conductivity were calculated with the brakensiek pedotransfer function brakensiek et al 1984 and are not subject to change from the naturalized scenario to the regulated scenario only one soil related parameter ksathorfrac which is the factor for calculating horizontal saturated conductivity and thus greatly affects the lateral subsurface flow was manually calibrated wannasin et al 2021 the land cover related parameter maps were obtained from global databases e g leaf area index or by assigning parameter values from literature review e g manning s roughness coefficient to the globcover land cover types to create the land cover related parameter maps for the naturalized scenarios we firstly converted globcover grid cells marked as reservoir water to naturalized land cover types using the nearest neighbor upscaled interpolation method then we assigned parameter values for the new land cover types we assumed that impacts of gradual land use changes such as agricultural expansion and urbanization were much smaller at the basin scale compared to impacts of reservoirs therefore the uncertainty of naturalized land cover and thus the uncertainty of naturalized parameters were assumed negligible in the baseline operation scenario the number of generalized operational and physical parameters of the rom were minimized to overcome the data scarcity the parameter values were determined based on the reported operating rule curves and databases provided by rid and egat and were applied without calibration as elaborated in wannasin et al 2021 4 evaluation methods we carried out the 25 year simulation from 1989 to 2013 according to the naturalized scenario wflow sbm without reservoir sim nat and baseline operation scenario wflow sbm with the rom sim base the daily simulation results were then analyzed in comparison to the daily observations which reflect the real time operation we used 2006 as the representative year for wet conditions and 2013 for dry conditions although these two years were not the most extreme years recorded they were carefully chosen to distinguish effects of reservoir operations and extreme weather on extreme flows by focusing on the selected catchments locations shown in fig 1 we conduct the analyses in four parts firstly we validated the simulated streamflows in the naturalized scenario secondly we used the data from the naturalized scenario baseline operation scenario and observations to quantify effects of reservoir operations on the long term water balance components next we assessed reservoir effects on key signatures of the daily flow regime lastly we examined effects of reservoir operations and extreme weather on the frequency and recurrence of extreme flows 4 1 simulated streamflow evaluation since the daily streamflow observations prior to the construction of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs are unavailable it was impossible to directly evaluate the accuracy of the naturalized flow simulation for the sirikit and bhumibol catchments therefore we validated their naturalized flows by visually comparing the resemblance of their daily hydrographs to those of the natural catchments upstream note that the model performance in the baseline operation scenario has been evaluated in wannasin et al 2021 4 2 analyses of reservoir effects on the water balance to evaluate effects of reservoir operations on the catchment water balance the water balances of the upstream natural catchments were deliberated as baselines we then compared water balance components of the regulated catchments among the naturalized scenario baseline operation scenario and observations precipitation p and upstream inflow i are partitioned into actual evapotranspiration aet streamflow q and storage change δs which includes both subsurface storage and reservoir storage during a given time period since some water balance components e g groundwater storage change and seepage are difficult to estimate they are often determined as the residuals of the water balance equation kampf and burges 2010 the water balance is expressed as 1 p i a e t q δ s where i and q refer to streamflow in this context subsurface and overland flows across the catchment boundary were excluded as they were negligible in the simulations and unavailable from the observations in the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios the water balance components on the left hand side of equation 1 were extracted from the wflow sbm simulations then δs was calculated as the residual of the water balance for comparison we also calculated δs using observed q and made use of mswep v2 p and i and aet data from the simulations due to unavailable observed data 4 3 analyses of reservoir effects on the daily flow regime to understand effects of reservoir operations on the daily flow regime we focus on the sirikit reservoir and analyzed three streamflow signatures the flow duration curve fdc baseflow index bfi and flashiness index fi the signatures were compared among the naturalized scenario baseline operation scenario and observation considering the missing data in the observed streamflow record we quantified the signatures for each year available and for the long periods of 1989 1997 and 2003 2013 4 3 1 flow duration curve the daily flow regime can be summarized in the comprehensive form of the fdc which is the empirical cumulative frequency of daily streamflow as a function of the percentage of time that the streamflow is exceeded the slope of the fdc represents the streamflow variability including both high and low flows to quantify reservoir effects on the daily fdc we calculated and compared the slopes of the fdcs median flows q 50 high flows and low flows among the simulations and observation we defined high flows as the flows that are exceeded 10 of the time q 10 and low flows as being exceeded 90 of the time q 90 as generally the fdc between the 33rd and 66th flow percentiles is nearly linear on a semi log scale sawicz et al 2011 the fdc slope slopefdc is defined as 2 slope fdc ln q 33 ln q 66 0 66 0 33 where q 33 and q 66 are the daily streamflow values at the 33rd and 66th percentile a steeper slope refers to higher variability of daily flows 4 3 2 baseflow index baseflow is part of streamflow that comes from persistent delayed sources and is thus highly correlated to the water storage in a catchment hisdal et al 2004 in natural catchments baseflow mainly comes from groundwater whereas in catchments with highly regulated dammed reservoirs baseflow mainly comes from reservoir water in this study we separated baseflow from the daily streamflow time series using the separation procedure of gustard et al 1992 we calculated the minima of 5 day non overlapping consecutive periods and identified turning points of the minima sequence a minimum became a turning point if 0 9 times its value was less than or equal to the neighboring minimum connecting the turning points formed the baseflow separation line in the hydrograph daily baseflow values were then assigned with linear interpolation between the turning points the baseflow was set equal to the total streamflow on any day that the estimated baseflow exceeded the total streamflow the base flow index bfi is the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow in a given period 3 bfi i 1 n q base i 1 n q total where q base refers to the daily baseflow and q total refers to the daily streamflow i is the given time step day and n is the number of days in the given period bfi values range between 0 and 1 a higher index value means a higher contribution of baseflow to total streamflow to quantify reservoir effects on the daily baseflow we calculated and compared the bfi values among the simulated and observed streamflow time series 4 3 3 flashiness index while the slopefdc indicates the overall variability of daily streamflow regardless of the chronological order flashiness reflects the absolute day to day fluctuations in the streamflow magnitude flashy streams have much daily change while stable streams have little daily change poff et al 1997 we used the richards baker flashiness index fi baker et al 2004 which is quantified by the ratio of daily streamflow fluctuations relative to the total streamflow in a given period 4 fi i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where q is daily streamflow i is the given time step day and n is the number of days in the given period fi values range between 0 and 2 of which zero represents an absolutely constant flow higher index values mean larger fluctuations of daily streamflow streamflow time series with a steep slopefdc tend to give a high fi value however streamflow time series with similar slopefdc values can result in very different fi values because fi excludes the seasonal and inter annual variability within the given period therefore to quantify reservoir effects on the daily flashiness we calculated and compared the fi values among the simulated and observed streamflow time series 4 4 analyses of reservoir and extreme weather effects on extreme flows to understand effects of reservoir operations on extreme flows we focus on the sirikit reservoir and assessed the frequency and recurrence of extreme flows in relation to magnitude and timing among the simulations and observation in this study extreme flows refer to annual maximum daily flows amax and annual minimum daily flows amin for the upper gcpr basin very high flows in the dry season are usually employed for irrigation and do not cause flooding likewise very low flows in the rainy season are meant to prevent downstream inundation and do not lead to drought therefore we computed amax in the period of may october rainy season and amin in the rest of the year although durrans 1988 suggested that total probability methods are suitable for estimating flood frequency in regulated catchments the capability of the gumbel extreme value distribution to represent flood frequency in reservoir dominated catchments has been demonstrated e g batalla et al 2004 lee et al 2017 in addition the gumbel distribution was suggested as one of the best fit functions to analyze yearly low flows matalas 1963 langat et al 2019 therefore it was selected for the frequency analysis of amax and amin based on the 25 year period of daily streamflow data in this study to distinguish effects of extreme weather on daily extreme flows we assessed the relationship between the amax or amin and the associated weather we used the sum of precipitation and upstream inflow minus actual evapotranspiration p i aet here called effective inflow on the day that the amax or amin occurred and over the 30 days preceding the extreme flow event to represent the weather condition 5 results 5 1 naturalized flow the visual comparison of the simulated daily streamflow in the naturalized scenario sim nat q sim nat for the sirikit and bhumibol catchments to the daily streamflow observations obs q obs for the upstream natural catchments implies satisfactory results produced by the wflow sbm model the daily hydrographs of q sim nat for both regulated catchments shown as red lines in fig 2 c and d present trends comparable to the hydrographs for the upstream natural catchments in fig 2 a and b the strong seasonal variation with very low flows in the dry season as well as steep rising limbs and high flood peaks in the rainy season suggests that the wflow sbm model can reconstruct the naturalized flows regardless of the uncertainty in the naturalized land cover setting 5 2 effects of reservoir operation on the water balance the simulated water balances of the nan natural and yom natural catchments are similar to each other in terms of water budget distribution based on the yearly average data table 1 note that these natural catchments are located at the headwaters and thus do not have upstream inflows see their locations in fig 1 the annual aet pet ratios for the two catchments ranged between 0 68 and 0 70 approximately two thirds of the annual p evaporated and one third flowed downstream the annual q sim nat tends to underestimate the annual q obs especially for the nan natural catchment consequently the disparity between the simulated and observed storage changes δs sim nat and δs obs is also considerable however it should be noted that the δs obs values were calculated using the mswep v2 p data and the simulated aet data from the naturalized scenario since the observed aet data are unavailable these data sources could also be a source of bias affecting the simulated storage the simulated water balance in the baseline operation scenario sim base of the sirikit catchment is different from its naturalized scenario table 1 note that the sirikit catchment is located midstream and thus receives inflows from upstream see its location in fig 1 the annual aet pet ratio increased from 0 63 in the naturalized scenario to 0 68 in the baseline operation scenario with 8 increase in evaporation loss concurrently the annual streamflow from the baseline operation scenario q sim base increased with respect to the annual q sim nat leading to a greater δs sim base than δs sim nat table 1 the last two rows also shows the water balance components in the baseline operation scenario at the reservoir scale compared to the measurements of reservoir outflow and storage change for the sirikit reservoir the annual q sim base tends to be smaller than the annual q obs the difference between the δs sim base and δs obs is also large since they were both computed by closing the water balance the simulated water balance in the baseline operation scenario of the bhumibol catchment on the other hand is similar to its water balance in the naturalized scenario table 1 this catchment is also located midstream and receives inflows from upstream see its location in fig 1 due to the prompt surcharge releases by the rom the q sim base behaved like the q sim nat in very wet periods as also evident in fig 2 d as a result aet pet ratios in the naturalized scenario 0 60 and baseline operation scenario 0 61 were almost the same with only 2 increase in evaporation loss by reservoir operation the annual q sim base for the bhumibol reservoir was much higher than its annual q obs leading to the large gap between the δs sim base and δs obs focusing on the sirikit catchment the dissimilarity in magnitude and timing of its cumulative q time series between the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios further clarifies the reservoir effects on the catchment water balance fig 3 in the naturalized scenario the long term mean cumulative q sim nat red line in fig 3 e increased dramatically from july to october consistently with the long term mean cumulative p and i blue lines in fig 3 a and b the cumulative q sim nat was significantly higher in the wet year 2006 dotted line than in the dry year 2013 dashed line on the contrary the long term mean cumulative q sim base orange line in fig 3 f increased more gradually over the period of one year exceptions are found for 2006 and other wet years when the cumulative q sim base surged in the rainy season due to the rom surcharge releases as also evident in fig 2 c notably the cumulative q sim base in 2013 is comparable to the long term average despite the lower p and i fig 3 also illustrates the different patterns of the sirikit catchment storage in the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios here called s sim nat and s sim base because the cumulative value of the catchment storage changes is a catchment storage with respect to the initial condition the long term mean s sim nat red line in fig 3 g increased during the first half of the year peaking in mid september 330 mm before dropping to around zero by the end of the year in 2006 the s sim nat rose strikingly since the beginning of the rainy season in response to storm water in 2013 on the other hand it remained small until july as monsoons arrived later than usual in contrast the long term mean s sim base orange line in fig 3 h slightly decreased from the start of the year and remained negative until august after that it rose to a peak in mid october 1285 mm in the latter half of the year the δs sim base volume steadily declined a smaller negative δs sim base value was found at the end of 2013 than 2006 5 3 effects of reservoir operation on the daily flow regime the daily q sim nat time series of the sirikit catchment deviated significantly from the q sim base and q obs time series as visible in fig 2 c the q sim nat time series presented a strong seasonal variation with very low flows in the dry season and steep rising limbs and high peak flows in the rainy season meanwhile the q sim base and q obs time series were smoother with higher flows in the dry season and diminished peak flows in the rainy season the q sim base time series however had a short period with high peak flows from the reservoir surcharge releases by the rom the poor fits between the q sim nat and q obs for the sirikit catchment reflect the effect of reservoir operation on daily streamflow in addition the difference between the q sim base and q obs indicates the effect of real time operation with decision making on top of the generalized operation rules the daily fdcs and flow signatures of the sirikit catchment are different among the naturalized scenario fdcsim nat baseline operation scenario fdcsim base and observation fdcobs as demonstrated in fig 4 and table 2 overall the fdcsim nat is steeper than the fdcsim base and fdcobs as indicated by the greater slopefdc values the flattening of the fdcsim base and fdcobs is the result of increasing mean flow and low flow and reducing high flow the fdcsim base shows less variability with lower slopefdc compared to the fdcobs due to lower high flows and higher low flows in addition the fdcsim base differed more from the fdcobs in the dry year 2013 than in the wet year 2006 as the q sim base maintained low flows at a higher level notably the q sim nat and q sim base were perennial throughout the study period whereas the q obs ceased for 4 of the time during the years 1989 1997 the flow signatures also differ between the years 1989 1997 and the years 2003 2013 with increased median high and low flows in the latter period in all scenarios in accordance with the steep slope of the fdcsim nat the q sim nat for the sirikit catchment received only a small contribution from baseflow low bfi and was very flashy high fi as illustrated in table 2 and fig 5 the bfisim nat 0 62 and fisim nat 0 22 in the years 1989 1997 express that the q sim nat had a baseflow contribution of 62 and an average day to day fluctuation of 22 similar index values are found for the years 2003 2013 the q sim base on the contrary presented significantly higher bfi and lower fi values in line with the flatter fdc curves in both the 1989 1997 and 2003 2013 periods note that in the baseline operation scenario and observation the bfi is no longer representing slowly emptying aquifers but emptying reservoirs although the fdcsim base and fdcobs show relatively similar shapes fig 4 the q obs was more flashy and had a lower baseflow contribution than the q sim base fig 5 especially in the years 1989 1997 the q obs was even more flashy with a lower baseflow contribution than the q sim nat table 2 the bfiobs increased and the fiobs reduced in the years 2003 2013 all scenarios indicate that the streamflow was slightly more flashy in the wet years than in the dry years 5 4 effects of reservoir operation on extreme flows the annual maximum daily flows amax for the sirikit catchment were significantly higher in the naturalized scenario amax sim nat than in the baseline operation scenario amax sim base and observation amax obs as illustrated in fig 6 a the amax sim nat showed notable inter annual variability whereas the amax sim base and amax obs were more stable throughout the 25 year period the long term mean of amax decreased from the naturalized scenario 92 mm day 1 by 84 to the baseline operation scenario and the observation 15 mm day 1 the highest amax volume in the naturalized scenario 292 mm day 1 in 1989 was significantly greater than in the baseline operation scenario 49 mm day 1 in 2011 and the observation 35 mm day 1 in 2011 the differences in amax among the two simulation scenarios and the observation were larger in the wet years than in the dry years the annual daily minimum flows amin for the sirikit catchment were significantly lower in the naturalized scenario amin sim nat than in the baseline operation scenario amin sim base as demonstrated in fig 6 b the long term mean of amin increased from the naturalized scenario 0 3 mm day 1 by 1567 to the baseline operation scenario 5 mm day 1 and by 507 to the observation 2 mm day 1 the amin sim nat remained less than 1 mm day 1 but the river was not ephemeral the amin sim base remained lower than 7 mm day 1 interestingly the observation amin obs showed more variability with an evident increasing trend from the years 1989 1997 less than 1 mm day 1 to the years 2003 2013 1 5 mm day 1 in line with the bfi in fig 5 a note that the amin obs reached zero six times during the 1989 1997 period the return periods of amax for the sirikit catchment indicate that annual flood peaks occurred most frequently and with the highest magnitudes in the naturalized scenario fig 7 a the 5 year return period flood was significantly reduced from the naturalized scenario 135 mm day 1 by approximately 84 to the baseline operation scenario 22 mm day 1 and observation 20 mm day 1 the amax sim nat with the up to 5 year return periods tend to take place in august and september fig 7 b on the other hand the amax sim base and amax obs with the up to 5 year return periods tend to take place in may which is the transition period from the dry season to the rainy season and thus may not cause as severe floodling as those occurred in august october the return periods of amin for the sirikit catchment indicate that annual minimum flows occurred most frequently and severely in the naturalized scenario fig 7 c the 5 year return period minimum flow increased from the naturalized scenario 0 3 mm day 1 by 1233 to the baseline operation scenario 4 mm day 1 and by 100 to the observation 0 6 mm day 1 fig 7 d shows that the amin sim nat with the up to 5 year return periods tend to occur in the end of the dry season march april the amin sim base and amin obs with the up to 5 year return periods on the other hand tend to occur in the beginning of the dry season november 5 5 effects of extreme weather on extreme flows fig 8 illustrates the relationship between extreme flows including amax and amin and cumulative amounts of effective inflow p i aet in one day and 30 days prior to the extreme flow incidents the cumulative effective inflows had an influence on the amax especially in the naturalized scenario fig 8 a and c the amax sim nat has the highest correlation to the one day effective inflow r 2 0 92 the amax sim base to the 30 day effective inflow r 2 0 45 and the amax obs to the 30 day effective inflow r 2 0 21 on the other hand there is no clear relation between amin and effective inflow in any scenario fig 8 b and d 6 discussion 6 1 effects of reservoir operations on the water balance the water balance of the sirikit and bhumibol catchments changed significantly from the naturalized scenario to the baseline operation scenario in terms of magnitude and timing the higher annual aet in the baseline operation scenario resulted from the direct evaporation from the reservoir water surface and streamflow table 1 the corresponding trends between p and i and the rapid q sim nat visible as sharp increase of its cumulative indicate the natural rainfall runoff process with a quick catchment response fig 3 on the other hand the steady q sim base visible as gradual increase of its cumulative and the large annual δs sim base values imply that the reservoir operations markedly altered the natural rainfall runoff process with a longer residence time of water the effects of the reservoir operation on the water balance were apparent in dry years as the reservoirs tried to fulfill the target downstream water demand with stored water from the previous rainy season although this led to a very low reservoir storage at the end of the year it should be kept in mind that the aforementioned effects refer to the baseline reservoir operation with the generalized operation rules by the rom which are different from the real time reservoir operation observations since only the observed reservoir storage and outflow are available we could not thoroughly analyze the effects of the real time operation on the water balance however it is obvious that the real time operation is unique and much more flexible for each reservoir due to the circumstance specific judgments by dam operators affecting the water balance to another extent this was reflected in the higher annual streamflow for the sirikit catchment but lower annual streamflow for the bhumibol catchment compared to their naturalized flows table 1 6 2 effects of reservoir operations on the daily flow regime major alterations by the reservoir operations were the flatter fdc and more smooth flow regime due to increasing daily median flows q 50 and daily low flows q 90 and decreasing daily high flows q 10 compared to the naturalized flow fig 4 and table 2 the reservoir operations completely inverted the seasonality of the naturalized flow regime with significantly higher daily streamflow in the dry season and lower daily streamflow in the rainy season fig 2 c and d hanasaki et al 2006 and yassin et al 2019 also reported similar results for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs the high reservoir outflows in the dry season were mainly to compensate environmental flows including downstream irrigation supply and hydropower generation at the same time the draw down of reservoir storage provided space to restore water in the next rainy season meanwhile the low reservoir outflows in the rainy season were to prevent overflows in the downstream floodplains changes in the daily flow regime were more complicated with the real time operation than with the baseline operation a good example is when the real time operation slowly released the surcharge water or paused the daily release to prevent or moderate flooding downstream fig 2 c and d since water in the upper gcpr basin comes from seasonal precipitation the naturalized flow was very variable low bfi and high fi fig 5 causing the basin to be at risk of both flash floods and intensive dry periods on the other hand the regulated flow with the baseline operation had a high and stable baseflow contribution from the reservoir storage high bfi and low fi this indicates that the daily streamflow was not flashy and enabled to sustain the minimum water demands in the period of low or absent precipitation the real time operation however failed to overcome these problems during 1989 1997 but significantly improved with more daily baseflow contribution and less daily flashiness in 2003 2013 more experiences of dam operators gained over time may have been relevant for this improvement 6 3 effects of reservoir operations on extreme flows both baseline and real time reservoir operations substantially reduced the magnitude and frequency of the annual flood peaks annual maximum daily flows although the extent of the effects varied between years most of the naturalized flood peaks in the rainy season were absorbed by the reservoirs as visible in fig 2 c and 2 d the magnitudes of annual flood peaks fig 6 a and the 5 year return period flood fig 7 a were significantly diminished by both baseline and real time operations especially in wet years this included the 2011 catastrophic flooding that affected the entire gcpr basin interestingly timing of the annual flood peak incidents shifted and became more variable with the real time operation fig 7 b it should be noted that the annual flood peaks that occurred in may are unlikely to cause flooding as it is the beginning of the rainy season after a prolonged dry period the naturalized annual flood peaks and the annual flood peaks with the baseline operation usually occurred in august and september meanwhile the real time operation disrupted this pattern causing the annual flood peaks to take place from june to october for this reason the real time operation alleviated many historical flood incidents but at the same time their variable timing can pose a challenge in the reservoir system modeling the severity and frequency of the annual minimum flows also markedly declined with the baseline operation figs 6 b and 7 c however the real time operations worsened the annual minimum flows in the years 1989 1997 during this period the observed annual minimum flows were lower than those in the naturalized scenario and even ceased in some dry seasons indicating that the real time operation might trigger some drought events these drastic minimum flows were eliminated in the years 2003 2013 correspondingly to the bfi improvement the timing of the annual minimum flows also shifted fig 7 d note that the annual minimum flows occurring in november december usually do not lead to water shortage as the extensive monsoon period just passed the naturalized annual minimum flows occurred in march and april which is the driest period of the years thus putting the basin at risk of droughts the real time operation apparently solved this issue better than the baseline operation with only three years of the annual minimum flows occurring in the drought risk period 6 4 effects of extreme weather on extreme flows the reservoir operations were the main cause of the inconsistency in the relationship between the effective inflows p i aet and annual flood peaks in the baseline and real time operation scenarios fig 8 therefore based on our results it is likely that the reservoir operation played a more important role than extreme weather in mitigating or magnifying the extreme flow events in the upper gcpr basin however the slightly positive correlation between the effective inflows and annual flood peaks indicates that extreme precipitation events magnified historical flood incidents to some extent although they were not as severe as those in the naturalized scenario similar results were reported by komori et al 2012 and sayama et al 2015 unfortunately it is difficult to completely separate the roles of extreme weather and the reservoir operation this study did not explicitly account for effects of climate variability on extreme flows and the gumbel extreme value analyses fig 7 assumed that there was no trend in annual precipitation however we acknowledge the probable changes in monsoon patterns in term of magnitudes timing and direction over the past decades in sea and thailand e g singhrattna et al 2005 loo et al 2015 the shift in monsoon direction for example can result in less reservoir inflow and concurrently more direct floodwater in the downstream region these climate factors influence extreme weather events and real time reservoir operations which will affect extreme flows 6 5 effects of real time control on extreme flows according to our findings we deduce that the generalized operation rules as represented by the baseline operation scenario alone could not effectively manage the reservoir water resources throughout a year and that decision making and real time control as represented by the observation are necessary for preventing and mitigating extreme flow incidents there was apparently a change in the real time operation from the 1989 1997 period to the 2003 2013 period resulting in the notable improvements in the streamflow signatures table 2 and fig 5 it highlights the importance of experience in decision making of dam operators gained over time as a result we acknowledge that the gumbel extreme value analyses of the observation should be interpreted with care with the real time control the reservoir could for instance release more water in drier years and close the spillway for a while in wetter years to prevent overtopping the downstream floodwater during storm events for some events in the past however the real time operation was problematic such as when the reservoir stored too much storm water and had to release surcharge water to prevent dam failures thus intensifying downstream inundations komori et al 2012 this underlines the need of more effective real time forecasting and decision supporting tools in order to provide more sustainable reservoir operations in the future 7 conclusion and outlook the upper gcpr basin has been highly regulated by multipurpose reservoirs for over half a century while the reservoirs support agriculture and hydropower generation their regulations have modified the natural flows posing a challenge to water resource management this study explored the quantitative effects of the major reservoirs sirikit and bhumibol on the water balance daily flow regime and extreme flows during the 1989 2013 period we used the global data driven wflow sbm model to simulate streamflows in the naturalized scenario without reservoir and the baseline operation scenario with generalized operation rules as described in detail in the companion paper wannasin et al 2021 we analyzed key hydrological signatures in both scenarios and compared these to the observational data which represent the real time operation the main findings are as follows 1 the reservoir operation disrupted the natural water balance and rainfall runoff processes in terms of both magnitude and timing especially with higher evaporation loss 2 the reservoir operation inverted the natural seasonality of the daily flow regime with higher flows in the dry season and lower flows in the rainy season in the long term the daily median flows q 50 and low flows q 90 markedly increased while daily high flows q 10 markedly reduced the daily baseflow contribution was greater indicating that streamflow came mostly from the delayed source reservoirs and thus that the daily flows became less flashy and more constant throughout a year 3 the reservoir operation prevented or mitigated many extreme flow incidents in the past it reduced the magnitude of annual flood peaks and increased the annual minimum flows most of the annual minimum flows were also maintained above the naturalized environmental flows except in some dry seasons during the 1990s both annual flood peaks and minimum flows occurred less frequently but their timing became more variable and thus difficult to predict 4 annual flood peaks and minimum flows were more influenced by the real time reservoir operation than by extreme weather however extreme weather does tend to amplify the severity of flooding 5 the difference between reservoir outflows from the baseline operation simulation and from the real time operation observation highlights the importance of decision making and real time control to optimize reservoir outflows on the daily basis the findings on the effects of reservoir operation in the upper gcpr basin can benefit thailand in the light of sustainable reservoir management under the recent national water resource management master plan for the 2019 2037 period at a larger scale the insights of the reservoir effects from this basin can be of assistance to dam operators and water managers for both existing and planned reservoirs in sea and other tropical regions in the future the river basins in thailand and sea will probably be more intensively regulated by more reservoirs such management needs to be carefully planned in all aspects of hydrology ecology and economic development to optimize water resources and prevent hydrological hazards more studies on the effects of other reservoirs considering their different purposes sizes and locations are encouraged the future challenge lies in optimizing the real time operations for a more effective and sustainable operational and strategic water management especially for floods and droughts under changing climate and rapid economic development author statement c wannasin conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation data curation writing original draft

8267,study region upper region of the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand study focus the upper gcpr basin is highly regulated by multipurpose reservoirs which obviously have altered the natural streamflow understanding quantitative effects of such alteration is crucial for effective water resource management therefore this study aims to assess how reservoir operation affects the water balance daily flow regime and extreme flows in this basin for this purpose we reconstructed streamflow in the naturalized no reservoir and baseline operation scenarios using the 1 km resolution distributed model to overcome data scarcity we ran the model with global data and parameterization a target storage and release based reservoir operation module was applied in the baseline operation scenario the model results were analyzed in comparison to observations in a wet year a dry year and the period 1989 2014 new hydrological insights for the region the reservoir operation resulted in more evaporation it inverted the natural flow seasonality and smoothed the daily flow regime with decreasing high flows increasing mean flows and low flows greater baseflow contribution and lower flashiness it prevented or mitigated many historical extreme flow incidents the annual flood peaks and minimum flows were markedly mitigated in terms of both magnitudes and frequencies but their timing became more variable and difficult to predict altogether the results highlighted the importance of effective decision making for real time operation which remain challenging in practice

boom in dammed reservoir construction takes place particularly in regions with emerging economies like southeast asia sea where it serves not only for irrigation and hydrological hazard control but also for hydropower generation zarfl et al 2015 in fact sea has recently become the region with the highest investment for large multipurpose reservoirs siciliano et al 2015 currently there are more than 130 new projects of large reservoirs planned in laos malaysia cambodia myanmar and at the border of myanmar thailand siciliano et al 2015 therefore it is undeniable that dammed reservoirs are a necessity for water resource management and play an important role in flood and drought mitigation in sea despite their benefits dammed reservoirs remain controversial due to their potentially negative impacts on streamflow environment and society reservoir operations alter the natural flow regime i e flow rate flow magnitude and fluctuation in particular the duration timing and frequency of wet and dry extremes from the daily to the long term scale graf 2006 mittal et al 2016 li et al 2017 on the one hand reservoir operations can attenuate flood and drought events by smoothing streamflow with lower flood peaks and higher baseflows e g lee et al 2017 wu et al 2018 gai et al 2019 on the other hand hydrological extremes can be intensified by ineffective management of reservoir water which in some cases had greater influence than climate change e g graf 2006 mittal et al 2016 he et al 2017 di baldassarre et al 2018 since sea has an increasing number of dammed reservoirs while being highly exposed to hydrological hazards trenberth et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 there is an urgent need to evaluate effects of reservoir operations on streamflow in specific contexts of this region the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand is one of the most highly regulated river basins by dammed reservoirs in sea the delta area in the basin is also among the most vulnerable areas in the region yusuf and francisco 2009 despite water resource management with several multipurpose reservoirs the gcpr basin still suffers from floods and droughts regularly which devastate the agricultural and environmental resources and subsequently the economic development of the country and the region takeda et al 2016 kinouchi et al 2018 while most reservoirs in neighboring basins such as in the mekong river have been constructed in recent years urban et al 2018 the main reservoirs in the gcpr basin have been operated for over half a century and data on daily reservoir outflows are available for the last 25 years the longer period of observational records in the gcpr basin allows for a comprehensive analysis therefore investigating effects of reservoir operations on streamflow in this basin can also contribute to the understanding and improvement of water resource planning and management in other basins in sea previous studies mentioned conflicting causes of hydrological hazards in the gcpr basin komori et al 2012 suggested that the 2011 gcpr flood one the most catastrophic floods ever recorded in sea was driven by intense precipitation in line with the finding of sayama et al 2015 that a 1 increase in precipitation caused a 4 2 increase in flood inundation in the basin meanwhile van oldenborgh et al 2012 concluded that the 2011 gcpr flood volumes were magnified by non meteorological factors particularly reservoir water management the study of gale and saunders 2013 supported this statement as they found that the precipitation anomaly was higher in 1995 than in 2011 but the 1995 flood was not nearly as severe as the 2011 flood however considering the limited number of studies the respective roles of reservoir operations and extreme weather on hydrological hazards in the gcpr basin remain unclear the attention to reservoir operations and their effects on streamflow in the gcpr basin was drawn after the 2011 flood komori et al 2012 provided an overview of reservoir water management in 2011 the spectrum analysis by tebakari et al 2012 indicated that the observed streamflow downstream of the reservoirs had a periodicity of seven days due to the irrigation purpose since daily streamflow data for this basin have been available only after the reservoir constructions it is impossible to identify changes and trends of observed streamflow from natural to regulated conditions therefore several studies took the approach of comparing observed streamflow to naturalized without reservoir streamflow obtained from hydrological models komori et al 2013 wichakul et al 2013 hanasaki et al 2014 mateo et al 2014 sayama et al 2015 all these studies highlighted effects of reservoir operations on downstream flows in the gcpr basin by analysing hydrographs however they mainly focused on reservoir effects on high flows particularly during the 2011 flood events and excluded reservoir effects on low flows most studies assessed reservoir effects on hydrographs in the downstream floodplain which may be influenced by effects of intensive irrigation in addition reservoir effects on the water balance and daily flow regime in the gcpr basin have not been investigated understanding the naturalized water balance and daily flow regime and how they have been modified by reservoir operations is essential not only from a hydrological viewpoint but also from socio economic and environmental perspectives the knowledge assists dam operators and water resource managers in planning and developing strategies to optimize both human consumption and ecosystem maintenance it also supports adaptive management strategies to predict and deal with such probable changes for other existing or planned reservoirs in the same or a neighboring basin moreover it helps to prepare for expected changes in streamflow after dam removals in the future however the main challenge in investigating the naturalized water balance and daily flow regime in many river basins including the gcpr basin is the lack of observed streamflow data prior to reservoir constructions one of the approaches to overcome the lack of observed streamflow data in reservoir operation studies is hydrological modeling many hydrological models can represent reservoir operation schemes and hydrological responses as part of rainfall runoff processes e g zajac et al 2017 canuto et al 2019 gai et al 2019 distributed hydrological models are often used for reservoir system modeling because they allow the calculation of water interactions between a reservoir and its surrounding area in a spatially distributed manner however distributed models usually require an enormous amount of data which is a drawback for data scarce areas like in sea in addition distributed models usually require area specific and scenario specific calibration which poses a high risk of overparameterization and long computation times to tackle these issues we used the 1 km resolution distributed wflow sbm model with global data and parameterization schellekens et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the model has been set up and evaluated for the upper region of the gcpr basin as elaborated in a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 with a target storage and release based reservoir operation module rom the model was applied to simulate daily streamflow in the baseline operation scenario when reservoir releases were determined solely based on generalized operation rules without real time control in this study we further apply the model to simulate daily streamflow in the naturalized scenario by comparing the simulation results in the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios to the observations which represent the real time operation we can comprehensively analyze effects of reservoir operations in terms of generalized operation rules and real time control on daily streamflow the main aims of this study are to i quantify effects of reservoir operations on the water balance and daily flow regime and ii distinguish effects of reservoir operation and extreme weather on extreme flows in the gcpr basin we analyzed the simulated and observed streamflows over a 25 year period of 1989 2013 by focusing on streamflow at the dam locations instead of floodplain gauges we excluded probable influences of downstream irrigation and highlighted the effects of reservoir operations alone the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the study area in section 3 we summarize the model application and required data next our analysis methods are presented in section 4 including the evaluation of naturalized flow simulations section 4 1 the evaluation of reservoir effects on the water balance section 4 2 the evaluation of reservoir effects on daily flow regime section 4 3 and the evaluation of effects of reservoir operations and extreme weather on extreme flows section 4 4 we present the results in section 5 and the discussion in section 6 followed by the conclusion and outlook in section 7 2 study area the greater chao phraya river basin gcpr located in the heart of thailand covers approximately 158 600 km2 30 of the country s area fig 1 it is divided into the upper and lower regions at nakhon sawan valley where the upstream rivers ping wang yom and nan join and form the chao phraya which drains into the gulf of thailand since the main goal of this study is to assess the reservoir effects we focused on the upper region 104 000 km2 where the main reservoirs are located its major areas are covered by forests and grasslands which have been gradually replaced by agricultural areas particularity rice fields jamrussri and toda 2017 the climate of the upper gcpr basin is distinctly divided into the wet rainy and dry seasons which are influenced by monsoons and tropical cyclones considering the seasonality the thai water year starts from april 1st of any given year to march 31st of the following year i e the year 2011 is from april 1st 2011 to march 31st 2012 the water year and water yearly hereafter will be referred to as year and yearly annual there are seven multipurpose reservoirs in the upper gcpr basin serving irrigation water supply hydroelectricity generation and flood control the bhumibol reservoir storage capacity 13 46 billion m3 has been operated on the ping river since 1964 and the sirikit reservoir storage capacity 9 51 billion m3 has been operated on the nan river since 1977 reservoir locations shown in fig 1 another five reservoirs were constructed on the ping river two wang river two and nan river one a plan to build the first reservoir on the yom river has been postponed since 1980 due to controversial discussion about the myriad of negative environmental and social impacts apichitchat and jung 2015 since the five reservoirs of which four are located upstream of the bhumibol reservoir only account for 7 of the total reservoir capacity in the upper region we assumed that their effects on downstream flows are insignificant at the basin scale and thus focused on the two major reservoirs sirikit and bhumibol the gcpr basin endures regular occurrences of floods and droughts in rainy seasons flooding often occurs because the downstream part of the upper region and most of the lower region are gently sloped hence high discharge from the upper region is likely to flood the lower region in many occasions upstream floodwater cannot flow down at once due to the elevated water level in the chao phraya river itself as a consequence the floodplain above the narrow section at nakhon sawan is inundated for a long period sayama et al 2015 in dry seasons droughts tend to occur when the water storage in the major reservoirs fails to meet the irrigation and consumption demands e g the bhumibol water shortage in 2016 zenkoji et al 2019 the water shortage leads to large losses in agricultural and industrial production kinouchi et al 2018 therefore it is imperative to understand reservoir operations and their effects on the water balance and flow regime in the upper region in order to enhance their capabilities to mitigate hydrological extremes for the entire basin in this study we analyzed the water balance and streamflow in two regulated catchments the sirikit and bhumibol catchments the drainage areas from the headwater until the dam location are 13 155 km2 for sirikit and 25 988 km2 for bhumibol however we defined the sirikit catchment 2020 km2 and the bhumibol catchment 6863 km2 as the drainage areas from the inflow point of each reservoir in the hydrological model to the dam location see fig 1 to be able to analyze their upstream inflows in the water balance two natural catchments located upstream of the reservoirs the nan natural 3546 km2 and yom natural 2018 km2 were also investigated they were used to point out the resemblance of the upstream natural streamflow to the naturalized flow simulation of the sirikit and bhumibol catchments since the observations prior to the reservoir construction are unavailable for the model result validation locations of the four catchments are shown in fig 1 by focusing on the reservoir catchments instead of floodplain catchments downstream we avoided effects of intensive irrigation 3 model and data the application of the wflow sbm model with the simplified target storage and release based reservoir operation module rom in this study is summarized below the full description of wflow sbm is provided in schellekens et al 2019 and the rom calculation is explained in wannasin et al 2021 details on the model development and evaluation for the upper gcpr basin can be found in wannasin et al 2021 the wflow simple bucket model so called wflow sbm is a distributed hydrological model in the wflow modeling platform built within the pcraster and python environments schellekens et al 2019 it was developed based on the topog sbm model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 and has shown good performance in the applications in many basins around the world e g lópez lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 giardino et al 2018 lópez lópez 2018 gebremicael et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 for the entire upper gcpr basin the model has been set up at the 1 km spatial resolution and the 3 hourly timescale wannasin et al 2021 in this study the simulation of the wflow sbm model with the rom for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs is referred to as the baseline operation scenario while the simulation without the reservoir existence is referred to as the naturalized scenario to overcome data scarcity in the upper gcpr basin which is a common challenge in sea most required spatial data for wflow sbm were obtained from global databases the geospatial data included the elevation map from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 the land cover map from globcover bontemps et al 2011 the soil map from soilgrids hengl et al 2017 and the river network map from the royal irrigation department of thailand rid the meteorological data comprised precipitation p from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 database mswep v2 beck et al 2019 and potential evapotranspiration pet from the earth2observe database schellekens et al 2017 the hydrological data consisted of observed daily streamflow observed daily reservoir storage and reservoir operating rule curves of each reservoirs provided by rid and the electricity generating authority of thailand egat only the river network and observed hydrological data were derived from local sources as for the wflow sbm model parameterization seamless distributed parameter maps was implemented instead of full calibration which prevented overparameterization and reduced computation times wannasin et al 2021 the soil related parameter maps e g hydraulic conductivity were calculated with the brakensiek pedotransfer function brakensiek et al 1984 and are not subject to change from the naturalized scenario to the regulated scenario only one soil related parameter ksathorfrac which is the factor for calculating horizontal saturated conductivity and thus greatly affects the lateral subsurface flow was manually calibrated wannasin et al 2021 the land cover related parameter maps were obtained from global databases e g leaf area index or by assigning parameter values from literature review e g manning s roughness coefficient to the globcover land cover types to create the land cover related parameter maps for the naturalized scenarios we firstly converted globcover grid cells marked as reservoir water to naturalized land cover types using the nearest neighbor upscaled interpolation method then we assigned parameter values for the new land cover types we assumed that impacts of gradual land use changes such as agricultural expansion and urbanization were much smaller at the basin scale compared to impacts of reservoirs therefore the uncertainty of naturalized land cover and thus the uncertainty of naturalized parameters were assumed negligible in the baseline operation scenario the number of generalized operational and physical parameters of the rom were minimized to overcome the data scarcity the parameter values were determined based on the reported operating rule curves and databases provided by rid and egat and were applied without calibration as elaborated in wannasin et al 2021 4 evaluation methods we carried out the 25 year simulation from 1989 to 2013 according to the naturalized scenario wflow sbm without reservoir sim nat and baseline operation scenario wflow sbm with the rom sim base the daily simulation results were then analyzed in comparison to the daily observations which reflect the real time operation we used 2006 as the representative year for wet conditions and 2013 for dry conditions although these two years were not the most extreme years recorded they were carefully chosen to distinguish effects of reservoir operations and extreme weather on extreme flows by focusing on the selected catchments locations shown in fig 1 we conduct the analyses in four parts firstly we validated the simulated streamflows in the naturalized scenario secondly we used the data from the naturalized scenario baseline operation scenario and observations to quantify effects of reservoir operations on the long term water balance components next we assessed reservoir effects on key signatures of the daily flow regime lastly we examined effects of reservoir operations and extreme weather on the frequency and recurrence of extreme flows 4 1 simulated streamflow evaluation since the daily streamflow observations prior to the construction of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs are unavailable it was impossible to directly evaluate the accuracy of the naturalized flow simulation for the sirikit and bhumibol catchments therefore we validated their naturalized flows by visually comparing the resemblance of their daily hydrographs to those of the natural catchments upstream note that the model performance in the baseline operation scenario has been evaluated in wannasin et al 2021 4 2 analyses of reservoir effects on the water balance to evaluate effects of reservoir operations on the catchment water balance the water balances of the upstream natural catchments were deliberated as baselines we then compared water balance components of the regulated catchments among the naturalized scenario baseline operation scenario and observations precipitation p and upstream inflow i are partitioned into actual evapotranspiration aet streamflow q and storage change δs which includes both subsurface storage and reservoir storage during a given time period since some water balance components e g groundwater storage change and seepage are difficult to estimate they are often determined as the residuals of the water balance equation kampf and burges 2010 the water balance is expressed as 1 p i a e t q δ s where i and q refer to streamflow in this context subsurface and overland flows across the catchment boundary were excluded as they were negligible in the simulations and unavailable from the observations in the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios the water balance components on the left hand side of equation 1 were extracted from the wflow sbm simulations then δs was calculated as the residual of the water balance for comparison we also calculated δs using observed q and made use of mswep v2 p and i and aet data from the simulations due to unavailable observed data 4 3 analyses of reservoir effects on the daily flow regime to understand effects of reservoir operations on the daily flow regime we focus on the sirikit reservoir and analyzed three streamflow signatures the flow duration curve fdc baseflow index bfi and flashiness index fi the signatures were compared among the naturalized scenario baseline operation scenario and observation considering the missing data in the observed streamflow record we quantified the signatures for each year available and for the long periods of 1989 1997 and 2003 2013 4 3 1 flow duration curve the daily flow regime can be summarized in the comprehensive form of the fdc which is the empirical cumulative frequency of daily streamflow as a function of the percentage of time that the streamflow is exceeded the slope of the fdc represents the streamflow variability including both high and low flows to quantify reservoir effects on the daily fdc we calculated and compared the slopes of the fdcs median flows q 50 high flows and low flows among the simulations and observation we defined high flows as the flows that are exceeded 10 of the time q 10 and low flows as being exceeded 90 of the time q 90 as generally the fdc between the 33rd and 66th flow percentiles is nearly linear on a semi log scale sawicz et al 2011 the fdc slope slopefdc is defined as 2 slope fdc ln q 33 ln q 66 0 66 0 33 where q 33 and q 66 are the daily streamflow values at the 33rd and 66th percentile a steeper slope refers to higher variability of daily flows 4 3 2 baseflow index baseflow is part of streamflow that comes from persistent delayed sources and is thus highly correlated to the water storage in a catchment hisdal et al 2004 in natural catchments baseflow mainly comes from groundwater whereas in catchments with highly regulated dammed reservoirs baseflow mainly comes from reservoir water in this study we separated baseflow from the daily streamflow time series using the separation procedure of gustard et al 1992 we calculated the minima of 5 day non overlapping consecutive periods and identified turning points of the minima sequence a minimum became a turning point if 0 9 times its value was less than or equal to the neighboring minimum connecting the turning points formed the baseflow separation line in the hydrograph daily baseflow values were then assigned with linear interpolation between the turning points the baseflow was set equal to the total streamflow on any day that the estimated baseflow exceeded the total streamflow the base flow index bfi is the ratio of baseflow to total streamflow in a given period 3 bfi i 1 n q base i 1 n q total where q base refers to the daily baseflow and q total refers to the daily streamflow i is the given time step day and n is the number of days in the given period bfi values range between 0 and 1 a higher index value means a higher contribution of baseflow to total streamflow to quantify reservoir effects on the daily baseflow we calculated and compared the bfi values among the simulated and observed streamflow time series 4 3 3 flashiness index while the slopefdc indicates the overall variability of daily streamflow regardless of the chronological order flashiness reflects the absolute day to day fluctuations in the streamflow magnitude flashy streams have much daily change while stable streams have little daily change poff et al 1997 we used the richards baker flashiness index fi baker et al 2004 which is quantified by the ratio of daily streamflow fluctuations relative to the total streamflow in a given period 4 fi i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where q is daily streamflow i is the given time step day and n is the number of days in the given period fi values range between 0 and 2 of which zero represents an absolutely constant flow higher index values mean larger fluctuations of daily streamflow streamflow time series with a steep slopefdc tend to give a high fi value however streamflow time series with similar slopefdc values can result in very different fi values because fi excludes the seasonal and inter annual variability within the given period therefore to quantify reservoir effects on the daily flashiness we calculated and compared the fi values among the simulated and observed streamflow time series 4 4 analyses of reservoir and extreme weather effects on extreme flows to understand effects of reservoir operations on extreme flows we focus on the sirikit reservoir and assessed the frequency and recurrence of extreme flows in relation to magnitude and timing among the simulations and observation in this study extreme flows refer to annual maximum daily flows amax and annual minimum daily flows amin for the upper gcpr basin very high flows in the dry season are usually employed for irrigation and do not cause flooding likewise very low flows in the rainy season are meant to prevent downstream inundation and do not lead to drought therefore we computed amax in the period of may october rainy season and amin in the rest of the year although durrans 1988 suggested that total probability methods are suitable for estimating flood frequency in regulated catchments the capability of the gumbel extreme value distribution to represent flood frequency in reservoir dominated catchments has been demonstrated e g batalla et al 2004 lee et al 2017 in addition the gumbel distribution was suggested as one of the best fit functions to analyze yearly low flows matalas 1963 langat et al 2019 therefore it was selected for the frequency analysis of amax and amin based on the 25 year period of daily streamflow data in this study to distinguish effects of extreme weather on daily extreme flows we assessed the relationship between the amax or amin and the associated weather we used the sum of precipitation and upstream inflow minus actual evapotranspiration p i aet here called effective inflow on the day that the amax or amin occurred and over the 30 days preceding the extreme flow event to represent the weather condition 5 results 5 1 naturalized flow the visual comparison of the simulated daily streamflow in the naturalized scenario sim nat q sim nat for the sirikit and bhumibol catchments to the daily streamflow observations obs q obs for the upstream natural catchments implies satisfactory results produced by the wflow sbm model the daily hydrographs of q sim nat for both regulated catchments shown as red lines in fig 2 c and d present trends comparable to the hydrographs for the upstream natural catchments in fig 2 a and b the strong seasonal variation with very low flows in the dry season as well as steep rising limbs and high flood peaks in the rainy season suggests that the wflow sbm model can reconstruct the naturalized flows regardless of the uncertainty in the naturalized land cover setting 5 2 effects of reservoir operation on the water balance the simulated water balances of the nan natural and yom natural catchments are similar to each other in terms of water budget distribution based on the yearly average data table 1 note that these natural catchments are located at the headwaters and thus do not have upstream inflows see their locations in fig 1 the annual aet pet ratios for the two catchments ranged between 0 68 and 0 70 approximately two thirds of the annual p evaporated and one third flowed downstream the annual q sim nat tends to underestimate the annual q obs especially for the nan natural catchment consequently the disparity between the simulated and observed storage changes δs sim nat and δs obs is also considerable however it should be noted that the δs obs values were calculated using the mswep v2 p data and the simulated aet data from the naturalized scenario since the observed aet data are unavailable these data sources could also be a source of bias affecting the simulated storage the simulated water balance in the baseline operation scenario sim base of the sirikit catchment is different from its naturalized scenario table 1 note that the sirikit catchment is located midstream and thus receives inflows from upstream see its location in fig 1 the annual aet pet ratio increased from 0 63 in the naturalized scenario to 0 68 in the baseline operation scenario with 8 increase in evaporation loss concurrently the annual streamflow from the baseline operation scenario q sim base increased with respect to the annual q sim nat leading to a greater δs sim base than δs sim nat table 1 the last two rows also shows the water balance components in the baseline operation scenario at the reservoir scale compared to the measurements of reservoir outflow and storage change for the sirikit reservoir the annual q sim base tends to be smaller than the annual q obs the difference between the δs sim base and δs obs is also large since they were both computed by closing the water balance the simulated water balance in the baseline operation scenario of the bhumibol catchment on the other hand is similar to its water balance in the naturalized scenario table 1 this catchment is also located midstream and receives inflows from upstream see its location in fig 1 due to the prompt surcharge releases by the rom the q sim base behaved like the q sim nat in very wet periods as also evident in fig 2 d as a result aet pet ratios in the naturalized scenario 0 60 and baseline operation scenario 0 61 were almost the same with only 2 increase in evaporation loss by reservoir operation the annual q sim base for the bhumibol reservoir was much higher than its annual q obs leading to the large gap between the δs sim base and δs obs focusing on the sirikit catchment the dissimilarity in magnitude and timing of its cumulative q time series between the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios further clarifies the reservoir effects on the catchment water balance fig 3 in the naturalized scenario the long term mean cumulative q sim nat red line in fig 3 e increased dramatically from july to october consistently with the long term mean cumulative p and i blue lines in fig 3 a and b the cumulative q sim nat was significantly higher in the wet year 2006 dotted line than in the dry year 2013 dashed line on the contrary the long term mean cumulative q sim base orange line in fig 3 f increased more gradually over the period of one year exceptions are found for 2006 and other wet years when the cumulative q sim base surged in the rainy season due to the rom surcharge releases as also evident in fig 2 c notably the cumulative q sim base in 2013 is comparable to the long term average despite the lower p and i fig 3 also illustrates the different patterns of the sirikit catchment storage in the naturalized and baseline operation scenarios here called s sim nat and s sim base because the cumulative value of the catchment storage changes is a catchment storage with respect to the initial condition the long term mean s sim nat red line in fig 3 g increased during the first half of the year peaking in mid september 330 mm before dropping to around zero by the end of the year in 2006 the s sim nat rose strikingly since the beginning of the rainy season in response to storm water in 2013 on the other hand it remained small until july as monsoons arrived later than usual in contrast the long term mean s sim base orange line in fig 3 h slightly decreased from the start of the year and remained negative until august after that it rose to a peak in mid october 1285 mm in the latter half of the year the δs sim base volume steadily declined a smaller negative δs sim base value was found at the end of 2013 than 2006 5 3 effects of reservoir operation on the daily flow regime the daily q sim nat time series of the sirikit catchment deviated significantly from the q sim base and q obs time series as visible in fig 2 c the q sim nat time series presented a strong seasonal variation with very low flows in the dry season and steep rising limbs and high peak flows in the rainy season meanwhile the q sim base and q obs time series were smoother with higher flows in the dry season and diminished peak flows in the rainy season the q sim base time series however had a short period with high peak flows from the reservoir surcharge releases by the rom the poor fits between the q sim nat and q obs for the sirikit catchment reflect the effect of reservoir operation on daily streamflow in addition the difference between the q sim base and q obs indicates the effect of real time operation with decision making on top of the generalized operation rules the daily fdcs and flow signatures of the sirikit catchment are different among the naturalized scenario fdcsim nat baseline operation scenario fdcsim base and observation fdcobs as demonstrated in fig 4 and table 2 overall the fdcsim nat is steeper than the fdcsim base and fdcobs as indicated by the greater slopefdc values the flattening of the fdcsim base and fdcobs is the result of increasing mean flow and low flow and reducing high flow the fdcsim base shows less variability with lower slopefdc compared to the fdcobs due to lower high flows and higher low flows in addition the fdcsim base differed more from the fdcobs in the dry year 2013 than in the wet year 2006 as the q sim base maintained low flows at a higher level notably the q sim nat and q sim base were perennial throughout the study period whereas the q obs ceased for 4 of the time during the years 1989 1997 the flow signatures also differ between the years 1989 1997 and the years 2003 2013 with increased median high and low flows in the latter period in all scenarios in accordance with the steep slope of the fdcsim nat the q sim nat for the sirikit catchment received only a small contribution from baseflow low bfi and was very flashy high fi as illustrated in table 2 and fig 5 the bfisim nat 0 62 and fisim nat 0 22 in the years 1989 1997 express that the q sim nat had a baseflow contribution of 62 and an average day to day fluctuation of 22 similar index values are found for the years 2003 2013 the q sim base on the contrary presented significantly higher bfi and lower fi values in line with the flatter fdc curves in both the 1989 1997 and 2003 2013 periods note that in the baseline operation scenario and observation the bfi is no longer representing slowly emptying aquifers but emptying reservoirs although the fdcsim base and fdcobs show relatively similar shapes fig 4 the q obs was more flashy and had a lower baseflow contribution than the q sim base fig 5 especially in the years 1989 1997 the q obs was even more flashy with a lower baseflow contribution than the q sim nat table 2 the bfiobs increased and the fiobs reduced in the years 2003 2013 all scenarios indicate that the streamflow was slightly more flashy in the wet years than in the dry years 5 4 effects of reservoir operation on extreme flows the annual maximum daily flows amax for the sirikit catchment were significantly higher in the naturalized scenario amax sim nat than in the baseline operation scenario amax sim base and observation amax obs as illustrated in fig 6 a the amax sim nat showed notable inter annual variability whereas the amax sim base and amax obs were more stable throughout the 25 year period the long term mean of amax decreased from the naturalized scenario 92 mm day 1 by 84 to the baseline operation scenario and the observation 15 mm day 1 the highest amax volume in the naturalized scenario 292 mm day 1 in 1989 was significantly greater than in the baseline operation scenario 49 mm day 1 in 2011 and the observation 35 mm day 1 in 2011 the differences in amax among the two simulation scenarios and the observation were larger in the wet years than in the dry years the annual daily minimum flows amin for the sirikit catchment were significantly lower in the naturalized scenario amin sim nat than in the baseline operation scenario amin sim base as demonstrated in fig 6 b the long term mean of amin increased from the naturalized scenario 0 3 mm day 1 by 1567 to the baseline operation scenario 5 mm day 1 and by 507 to the observation 2 mm day 1 the amin sim nat remained less than 1 mm day 1 but the river was not ephemeral the amin sim base remained lower than 7 mm day 1 interestingly the observation amin obs showed more variability with an evident increasing trend from the years 1989 1997 less than 1 mm day 1 to the years 2003 2013 1 5 mm day 1 in line with the bfi in fig 5 a note that the amin obs reached zero six times during the 1989 1997 period the return periods of amax for the sirikit catchment indicate that annual flood peaks occurred most frequently and with the highest magnitudes in the naturalized scenario fig 7 a the 5 year return period flood was significantly reduced from the naturalized scenario 135 mm day 1 by approximately 84 to the baseline operation scenario 22 mm day 1 and observation 20 mm day 1 the amax sim nat with the up to 5 year return periods tend to take place in august and september fig 7 b on the other hand the amax sim base and amax obs with the up to 5 year return periods tend to take place in may which is the transition period from the dry season to the rainy season and thus may not cause as severe floodling as those occurred in august october the return periods of amin for the sirikit catchment indicate that annual minimum flows occurred most frequently and severely in the naturalized scenario fig 7 c the 5 year return period minimum flow increased from the naturalized scenario 0 3 mm day 1 by 1233 to the baseline operation scenario 4 mm day 1 and by 100 to the observation 0 6 mm day 1 fig 7 d shows that the amin sim nat with the up to 5 year return periods tend to occur in the end of the dry season march april the amin sim base and amin obs with the up to 5 year return periods on the other hand tend to occur in the beginning of the dry season november 5 5 effects of extreme weather on extreme flows fig 8 illustrates the relationship between extreme flows including amax and amin and cumulative amounts of effective inflow p i aet in one day and 30 days prior to the extreme flow incidents the cumulative effective inflows had an influence on the amax especially in the naturalized scenario fig 8 a and c the amax sim nat has the highest correlation to the one day effective inflow r 2 0 92 the amax sim base to the 30 day effective inflow r 2 0 45 and the amax obs to the 30 day effective inflow r 2 0 21 on the other hand there is no clear relation between amin and effective inflow in any scenario fig 8 b and d 6 discussion 6 1 effects of reservoir operations on the water balance the water balance of the sirikit and bhumibol catchments changed significantly from the naturalized scenario to the baseline operation scenario in terms of magnitude and timing the higher annual aet in the baseline operation scenario resulted from the direct evaporation from the reservoir water surface and streamflow table 1 the corresponding trends between p and i and the rapid q sim nat visible as sharp increase of its cumulative indicate the natural rainfall runoff process with a quick catchment response fig 3 on the other hand the steady q sim base visible as gradual increase of its cumulative and the large annual δs sim base values imply that the reservoir operations markedly altered the natural rainfall runoff process with a longer residence time of water the effects of the reservoir operation on the water balance were apparent in dry years as the reservoirs tried to fulfill the target downstream water demand with stored water from the previous rainy season although this led to a very low reservoir storage at the end of the year it should be kept in mind that the aforementioned effects refer to the baseline reservoir operation with the generalized operation rules by the rom which are different from the real time reservoir operation observations since only the observed reservoir storage and outflow are available we could not thoroughly analyze the effects of the real time operation on the water balance however it is obvious that the real time operation is unique and much more flexible for each reservoir due to the circumstance specific judgments by dam operators affecting the water balance to another extent this was reflected in the higher annual streamflow for the sirikit catchment but lower annual streamflow for the bhumibol catchment compared to their naturalized flows table 1 6 2 effects of reservoir operations on the daily flow regime major alterations by the reservoir operations were the flatter fdc and more smooth flow regime due to increasing daily median flows q 50 and daily low flows q 90 and decreasing daily high flows q 10 compared to the naturalized flow fig 4 and table 2 the reservoir operations completely inverted the seasonality of the naturalized flow regime with significantly higher daily streamflow in the dry season and lower daily streamflow in the rainy season fig 2 c and d hanasaki et al 2006 and yassin et al 2019 also reported similar results for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs the high reservoir outflows in the dry season were mainly to compensate environmental flows including downstream irrigation supply and hydropower generation at the same time the draw down of reservoir storage provided space to restore water in the next rainy season meanwhile the low reservoir outflows in the rainy season were to prevent overflows in the downstream floodplains changes in the daily flow regime were more complicated with the real time operation than with the baseline operation a good example is when the real time operation slowly released the surcharge water or paused the daily release to prevent or moderate flooding downstream fig 2 c and d since water in the upper gcpr basin comes from seasonal precipitation the naturalized flow was very variable low bfi and high fi fig 5 causing the basin to be at risk of both flash floods and intensive dry periods on the other hand the regulated flow with the baseline operation had a high and stable baseflow contribution from the reservoir storage high bfi and low fi this indicates that the daily streamflow was not flashy and enabled to sustain the minimum water demands in the period of low or absent precipitation the real time operation however failed to overcome these problems during 1989 1997 but significantly improved with more daily baseflow contribution and less daily flashiness in 2003 2013 more experiences of dam operators gained over time may have been relevant for this improvement 6 3 effects of reservoir operations on extreme flows both baseline and real time reservoir operations substantially reduced the magnitude and frequency of the annual flood peaks annual maximum daily flows although the extent of the effects varied between years most of the naturalized flood peaks in the rainy season were absorbed by the reservoirs as visible in fig 2 c and 2 d the magnitudes of annual flood peaks fig 6 a and the 5 year return period flood fig 7 a were significantly diminished by both baseline and real time operations especially in wet years this included the 2011 catastrophic flooding that affected the entire gcpr basin interestingly timing of the annual flood peak incidents shifted and became more variable with the real time operation fig 7 b it should be noted that the annual flood peaks that occurred in may are unlikely to cause flooding as it is the beginning of the rainy season after a prolonged dry period the naturalized annual flood peaks and the annual flood peaks with the baseline operation usually occurred in august and september meanwhile the real time operation disrupted this pattern causing the annual flood peaks to take place from june to october for this reason the real time operation alleviated many historical flood incidents but at the same time their variable timing can pose a challenge in the reservoir system modeling the severity and frequency of the annual minimum flows also markedly declined with the baseline operation figs 6 b and 7 c however the real time operations worsened the annual minimum flows in the years 1989 1997 during this period the observed annual minimum flows were lower than those in the naturalized scenario and even ceased in some dry seasons indicating that the real time operation might trigger some drought events these drastic minimum flows were eliminated in the years 2003 2013 correspondingly to the bfi improvement the timing of the annual minimum flows also shifted fig 7 d note that the annual minimum flows occurring in november december usually do not lead to water shortage as the extensive monsoon period just passed the naturalized annual minimum flows occurred in march and april which is the driest period of the years thus putting the basin at risk of droughts the real time operation apparently solved this issue better than the baseline operation with only three years of the annual minimum flows occurring in the drought risk period 6 4 effects of extreme weather on extreme flows the reservoir operations were the main cause of the inconsistency in the relationship between the effective inflows p i aet and annual flood peaks in the baseline and real time operation scenarios fig 8 therefore based on our results it is likely that the reservoir operation played a more important role than extreme weather in mitigating or magnifying the extreme flow events in the upper gcpr basin however the slightly positive correlation between the effective inflows and annual flood peaks indicates that extreme precipitation events magnified historical flood incidents to some extent although they were not as severe as those in the naturalized scenario similar results were reported by komori et al 2012 and sayama et al 2015 unfortunately it is difficult to completely separate the roles of extreme weather and the reservoir operation this study did not explicitly account for effects of climate variability on extreme flows and the gumbel extreme value analyses fig 7 assumed that there was no trend in annual precipitation however we acknowledge the probable changes in monsoon patterns in term of magnitudes timing and direction over the past decades in sea and thailand e g singhrattna et al 2005 loo et al 2015 the shift in monsoon direction for example can result in less reservoir inflow and concurrently more direct floodwater in the downstream region these climate factors influence extreme weather events and real time reservoir operations which will affect extreme flows 6 5 effects of real time control on extreme flows according to our findings we deduce that the generalized operation rules as represented by the baseline operation scenario alone could not effectively manage the reservoir water resources throughout a year and that decision making and real time control as represented by the observation are necessary for preventing and mitigating extreme flow incidents there was apparently a change in the real time operation from the 1989 1997 period to the 2003 2013 period resulting in the notable improvements in the streamflow signatures table 2 and fig 5 it highlights the importance of experience in decision making of dam operators gained over time as a result we acknowledge that the gumbel extreme value analyses of the observation should be interpreted with care with the real time control the reservoir could for instance release more water in drier years and close the spillway for a while in wetter years to prevent overtopping the downstream floodwater during storm events for some events in the past however the real time operation was problematic such as when the reservoir stored too much storm water and had to release surcharge water to prevent dam failures thus intensifying downstream inundations komori et al 2012 this underlines the need of more effective real time forecasting and decision supporting tools in order to provide more sustainable reservoir operations in the future 7 conclusion and outlook the upper gcpr basin has been highly regulated by multipurpose reservoirs for over half a century while the reservoirs support agriculture and hydropower generation their regulations have modified the natural flows posing a challenge to water resource management this study explored the quantitative effects of the major reservoirs sirikit and bhumibol on the water balance daily flow regime and extreme flows during the 1989 2013 period we used the global data driven wflow sbm model to simulate streamflows in the naturalized scenario without reservoir and the baseline operation scenario with generalized operation rules as described in detail in the companion paper wannasin et al 2021 we analyzed key hydrological signatures in both scenarios and compared these to the observational data which represent the real time operation the main findings are as follows 1 the reservoir operation disrupted the natural water balance and rainfall runoff processes in terms of both magnitude and timing especially with higher evaporation loss 2 the reservoir operation inverted the natural seasonality of the daily flow regime with higher flows in the dry season and lower flows in the rainy season in the long term the daily median flows q 50 and low flows q 90 markedly increased while daily high flows q 10 markedly reduced the daily baseflow contribution was greater indicating that streamflow came mostly from the delayed source reservoirs and thus that the daily flows became less flashy and more constant throughout a year 3 the reservoir operation prevented or mitigated many extreme flow incidents in the past it reduced the magnitude of annual flood peaks and increased the annual minimum flows most of the annual minimum flows were also maintained above the naturalized environmental flows except in some dry seasons during the 1990s both annual flood peaks and minimum flows occurred less frequently but their timing became more variable and thus difficult to predict 4 annual flood peaks and minimum flows were more influenced by the real time reservoir operation than by extreme weather however extreme weather does tend to amplify the severity of flooding 5 the difference between reservoir outflows from the baseline operation simulation and from the real time operation observation highlights the importance of decision making and real time control to optimize reservoir outflows on the daily basis the findings on the effects of reservoir operation in the upper gcpr basin can benefit thailand in the light of sustainable reservoir management under the recent national water resource management master plan for the 2019 2037 period at a larger scale the insights of the reservoir effects from this basin can be of assistance to dam operators and water managers for both existing and planned reservoirs in sea and other tropical regions in the future the river basins in thailand and sea will probably be more intensively regulated by more reservoirs such management needs to be carefully planned in all aspects of hydrology ecology and economic development to optimize water resources and prevent hydrological hazards more studies on the effects of other reservoirs considering their different purposes sizes and locations are encouraged the future challenge lies in optimizing the real time operations for a more effective and sustainable operational and strategic water management especially for floods and

8268,study region upper region of the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand study focus this study presents a 1 km resolution distributed hydrological model wflow sbm with global spatial data and parameterization for estimating daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin with the aim to overcome in situ data scarcity often occurring in southeast asia we forced the model with the mswep v2 precipitation and earth2observe potential evapotranspiration datasets seamless distributed parameter maps based on pedotransfer functions ptfs and literature review were applied to bypass calibration only the ksathorfrac parameter determining the lateral subsurface flow was calibrated a target storage and release based reservoir operation module rom was implemented to simulate reservoir releases we compared the simulated daily streamflows obtained from different ptfs and evaluated the model performance in the period 1989 2014 new hydrological insights for the region the global data driven wflow sbm model can reconstruct daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin especially for natural catchments kge 0 78 the rom can capture the seasonal variability of reservoir releases but not very accurately at the daily timescale kge 0 43 since the actual reservoir operations are too complex different ptfs and ksathorfrac values only introduce little uncertainty in the streamflow results therefore the proposed model provides an opportunity for streamflow estimation in other ungauged or data scarce basins in southeast asia nonetheless the difficulty in the reservoir system modeling reflects the necessity of better understanding of human intervention on daily streamflow keywords wflow sbm reservoir modeling data scarcity global forcing data pedotransfer function chao phraya basin 1 introduction floods and droughts have caused profound damage at the global scale amplified by climate change and land use change chang and franczyk 2008 dai 2011 ward et al 2013 bagley et al 2014 these hydrological hazards have dramatically increased in many regions and are expected to become more frequent and severe in the future trenberth et al 2014 winsemius et al 2016 southeast asia sea is a region that is exceptionally prone to both floods hirabayashi et al 2013 ceola et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 and droughts cook et al 2010 dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 the vulnerability of sea is partially due to the changes in monsoon dynamics and partially due to socio economic development such as urbanization deforestation and cultivation in the developing countries mitigating these hydrological hazards in sea requires rational water resource planning and management at the basin scale the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand is representative of the vulnerable and highly regulated river basins in sea considering its agriculture and water resource managements despite the water regulation by several multipurpose reservoirs the basin has still experienced hydrological hazards almost annually the most catastrophic floods occurred in 1995 2006 and 2011 followed by serious droughts in 2013 2016 takeda et al 2016 kinouchi et al 2018 the 2011 gcpr flood was one of the most devastating hazards recorded in sea with an inundated area of over 30 000 km2 13 million people affected and more than 800 fatalities komori et al 2012 this calls for the development of comprehensive hydrological models for the basin particularly at the sub daily timescale to assist early warning and mitigation of floods and droughts similar extreme events have occurred in neighboring countries such as vietnam and myanmar luu et al 2018 myo lin et al 2018 thereupon knowledge obtained from hydrological modeling in the gcpr basin can also contribute to water resource management in other sea basins several hydrological models have been developed over the past decades for better understanding of rainfall runoff processes and have become important tools for scenario simulations predictions and decision making for river basin management e g mysiak et al 2005 ajami et al 2008 cloke and pappenberger 2009 hydrological models can be classified as lumped or distributed according to the spatial representation singh and woolhiser 2002 lumped models mathematically simplify the rainfall runoff processes in a basin with spatially averaged parameters lumped model parameters have to be calibrated as they cannot be obtained from direct measurements thus limiting model applications to gauged basins crawford 1966 with improvements in computer technologies distributed models have been developed singh and woolhiser 2002 which allow mathematically describing the rainfall runoff processes in a spatially distributed way this model type uses parameters directly related to physical characteristics of the basin e g topography soil land cover and river network and takes into account spatial heterogeneity in both physical characteristics and meteorological inputs therefore distributed models potentially provide additional and more correct description of hydrological processes in the basin compared to lumped models refsgaard and knudsen 1996 wicks and bathurst 1996 since distributed models can fulfill various needs in spatial modeling such as flood and drought extents they have been widely used in water resource planning and management despite their benefits distributed models are much more complex and difficult to apply than lumped models firstly introduced in the 1970s the distributed models were expected to be used without prior calibration by directly determining model parameters from field data abbott et al 1986 this means the model results significantly depend on the accuracy of geospatial and spatial meteorological input data gourley and vieux 2006 in practice however these in situ data are not always available especially for ungauged or sparsely gauged basins in developing countries including in sea grayson and blöschl 2001 therefore like lumped models some distributed parameters are still subject to calibration refsgaard 1997 calibrating a distributed model generally sets different parameter values to different grid cells which poses a high risk of overparameterization requires enormous computational demands at fine resolutions and obstructs model applications in large basins beven 2006 fortunately the advancement in remote sensing and geographic information system gis data including soils land cover and climate in recent decades can potentially complement some absences of field data and provide new means of spatial calibration and validation many remote sensing and gis data are available in global public domains with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions fortin et al 2001 skidmore 2017 with the availability of global high resolution soil data e g hengl et al 2017 the recent attention has also been focused on pedotransfer functions ptfs for soil related parameterization traditionally used in soil science ptfs characterize soil hydraulic properties using predictive functions and structural soil data van looy et al 2017 therefore they have great potential to facilitate soil related parameters such as the water retention characteristic and hydraulic conductivity in distributed models zhao et al 2016a imhoff et al 2020 together with powerful computer resources we can attempt to maximize the use of remote sensing gis and ptfs data in order to minimize the number of calibrated parameters in distributed models this offers an opportunity to develop more feasible and reliable distributed models for basins with data scarcity like in sea in basins that are highly regulated by dammed reservoirs hydrological models also need explicit reservoir operation components this is yet another motivation to use distributed hydrological models in this context failure to represent reservoir operations limits the model performances and their applicability in scenario analyses with climate land use and operation changes yassin et al 2019 the existing reservoir operation schemes in hydrological models are categorized into four types natural lake inflow and demand based data driven and target storage and release based yassin et al 2019 the natural lake method is limited to uncontrolled reservoirs without dams the inflow and demand based methods determine reservoir releases as a function of inflows and downstream water demands but cannot account for reservoir operations in detail the data driven methods can simulate reservoir releases more accurately but cannot provide insight into the reservoir operation mechanisms due to their black box characteristics the target storage and release based methods consider reservoir storage zoning and adjust reservoir releases as a function of dynamic target storage so called operating rule curves the main challenge for this type of methods is the large amount of required data such as the storage zone setting and actual rule curves of each reservoir that are not always documented or easy to obtain however considering the growing availability of global data the target storage and release based methods seems to be the most promising for the simulation of multipurpose reservoirs at the daily timescale e g zhao et al 2016b zajac et al 2017 yassin et al 2019 previous studies have investigated the performance of various distributed models on the monthly and daily streamflow simulations in the gcpr basin and other highly regulated basins in sea e g kite 2000 kure and tebakari 2012 sayama et al 2015 many of them have utilized global geospatial data e g thanapakpawin et al 2007 vo and gourbesville 2016 bhagabati and kawasaki 2017 livneh et al 2017 some studies have further implemented daily meteorological data from global databases to force the models instead of using gauged data and they have shown promising performances e g wang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 li et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 few studies have implemented the target storage and release based methods e g kite 2001 mateo et al 2014 however all mentioned studies still needed to calibrate a few to several distributed parameters that are related to soil land cover or reservoir operation to date no study has applied distributed models with global parameterization to simulate daily streamflow in the gcpr and other sea basins this study aims to develop a 1 km resolution distributed hydrological model with global spatial data and parameterization for estimating daily streamflow in the upper region of the gcpr basin to overcome in situ data scarcity often occurring in sea and to minimize the model calibration we used the wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2019 which has shown good performance in basins across a large range of elevations and drainage areas e g lópez lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 giardino et al 2018 lópez lópez 2018 gebremicael et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the utilized global remote sensing and gis data included i static geospatial data from global databases ii meteorological forcing data from the global reanalysis iii seamless distributed maps for soil related parameters obtained with ptfs and iv seamless distributed maps for land cover related parameters obtained from literature review and global databases model results from different ptfs were investigated a reservoir operation module rom with a target storage and release based method was implemented with a minimum number of parameters and accessible operating rule curve data without calibration the performance of the global data driven wflow sbm model with the rom were evaluated in both natural and regulated catchments the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the study area in section 3 we summarize the selected global datasets the methodology including the wflow sbm model parameterization reservoir operation module and model evaluation are presented in section 4 next the results on model performance are shown in section 5 the results are then discussed in section 6 followed by the conclusion and outlook in section 7 2 study area the greater chao phraya river basin gcpr is thailand s largest and most important basin with respect to land and water resource development the entire basin covers an area of approximately 158 600 km2 accounting for 30 of the country s surface area fig 1 the basin can be divided geographically into the upper region 66 and lower region 34 this study focused on the upper region where the main reservoirs are located this region consists of four sub basins namely the ping river 34 500 km2 wang river 10 800 km2 yom river 24 000 km2 and nan river 34 700 km2 the elevation of the upper region ranges from 22 to 2534 m above sea level the four rivers merge at nakhon sawan and form the origin of the chao phraya river the river then drains through the lower region with intensive rice cultivation and densely populated areas before emptying into the gulf of thailand the climate of the upper gcpr basin is characterized by tropical monsoons and cyclones contributing to the high seasonal variability of precipitation the wet rainy season is when the southwest monsoons from the indian ocean together with tropical cyclones from the pacific ocean and south china sea bring very humid air towards the basin causing heavy rainfall from may to october therefrom the northeast monsoons bring cool and dry air from the siberian anticyclone causing the dry season from november to april bachelet et al 1992 kripalani et al 1995 considering the seasonality the thai water year is set as a period from april 1st of any given year to march 31st of the following year from this point onward we refer to water year and water yearly as year and yearly annual i e the year 2011 is from april 1st 2011 to march 31st 2012 the long term yearly average of precipitation from 1989 to 2013 is 1060 mm the highest yearly precipitation was recorded in 2011 1449 mm and the lowest in 1993 841 mm most precipitation 86 occurs in the rainy season accordingly annual maximum daily flows often occur in september and october while annual minimum daily flows mostly occur in january the highest daily streamflow ever recorded at nakhon sawan was 5450 m3 s 1 october 2006 and the lowest was 52 m3 s 1 april 1994 for the purposes of irrigation hydropower generation and flood control seven large dammed reservoirs have been constructed and operated in the upper gcpr basin over the past 55 years the bhumibol and sirikit reservoirs locations shown in fig 1 are the two largest ones in terms of storage capacity they are currently managed by the royal irrigation department of thailand rid and the electricity generating authority of thailand egat principle characteristics of the two reservoirs obtained from rid are presented in table 1 together they account for 93 of the total reservoir capacity 24 7 billion m3 in the upper region therefore we focus on modeling the bhumibol and sirikit reservoirs in this study with the assumption that the influences of the other five reservoirs on streamflow are insignificant at the basin scale to investigate the model performance we selected two natural and two regulated catchments in the upper gcpr basin catchment locations shown in fig 1 the natural catchments from the nan and yom headwaters were selected based on available data and will be called the nan natural 3546 km2 and yom natural 2018 km2 the regulated catchments represent the drainage areas from the headwater until the dam location and will be called the sirikit catchment 13 155 km2 and bhumibol catchment 25 988 km2 3 data this study required geospatial data meteorological data and hydrological data for the model setup and validation the geospatial data were used to represent the physical characteristics of the basin in the wflow sbm model the meteorological data were used as model driving forces the hydrological data were used in the parameter optimization and result analyses most data were obtained from global databases as we attempted to overcome data scarcity in the study area which is a common challenge in sea the geospatial data comprised the digital elevation model dem land cover types soil types and river network the dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 the land cover from globcover bontemps et al 2011 the soil from soilgrids hengl et al 2017 and the river network from the royal irrigation department rid the dem and river network data were employed to create the distributed maps of basin boundary local drainage direction strahler stream orders and river length per grid cell in the wflow sbm model these maps indicate the flow directions and control hydrological processes in a distributed way in this study the land cover and soil data were not directly used as model inputs but were used in the estimation of global parameters see section 4 2 the meteorological data for forcing the wflow sbm model were precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet p data were obtained from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 beck et al 2019 the dataset was constructed using gauges satellites and reanalyses with corrections for distributional biases and systematic terrestrial p biases it is available at high spatial 10 km and temporal 3 hourly resolutions for the 1979 2017 period pet data were obtained from the earth2observe database schellekens et al 2017 as the successor of the watch forcing data era interim wfdei data weedon et al 2014 they are offered with many calculation methods of which we selected the fao penman monteith pet dataset allen et al 1998 it is also available at the high spatial 10 km and temporal daily resolutions for the 1979 2014 period sperna weiland et al 2015 both the mswep v2 p and the earth2observe pet datasets have shown to produce promising model results in many hydrological and meteorological studies e g tarnavsky et al 2018 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 beck et al 2017 beck et al 2020 and therefore were chosen to force the wflow sbm model for the upper gcpr basin since we did not have to compute the pet nor account for snow processes within the model other forcing data such as temperature and solar radiation were unnecessary the required hydrological data included observed daily streamflow at the outlets of the study catchments and reservoirs of interest observed daily storage of each reservoir and dynamic operating rule curves of each reservoir the data were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand rid and the electricity generating authority of thailand egat the observed daily streamflow is the average of the observed hourly streamflow from 6 00 p m of the previous day to 6 00 p m of the defined day their availability varies among gauges see table 2 the reservoir operating rule curves consist of the long term monthly target storage of each reservoir derived from the rid report and the long term monthly target water demand that we manually extracted from the observed daily streamflow data of each reservoir more detail in section 4 3 in reality these reservoir operating rule curves serve as guidelines for dam operators 4 methodology 4 1 wflow sbm model the wflow simple bucket model so called wflow sbm is a conceptual rainfall runoff model in the spatially distributed wflow modeling platform which is pcraster and python based schellekens et al 2019 the soil water processes of wflow sbm are based on the topog sbm model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 the flow processes for subsurface overland and river flows are based on the kinematic wave approach that are comparable to the topkapi todini and ciarapica 2002 and g2g bell et al 2007 models while topog sbm is suitable for small areas wflow sbm is more widely applicable vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 schellekens et al 2019 in contrast to many conceptual models wflow sbm calculates the lateral subsurface flow explicitly and uses parameters that represent simplified physical characteristics of a basin vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 it has shown good performance in a broad range of applications e g lópez lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 giardino et al 2018 lópez lópez 2018 gebremicael et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the scheme of wflow sbm is illustrated in fig 2 the one dimensional model is constructed on a grid cell network of eight flow directions d8 for surface and subsurface flow routing with the presence of both vertical and lateral flows it has four main routines i a precipitation snow routine based on the hbv model lindström et al 1997 ii a rainfall interception routine based on the modified rutter model rutter et al 1971 1975 or gash model gash 1979 iii a soil water routine based on topog sbm and iv a flow generation routine with the kinematic wave function water enters each grid cell through the precipitation snow routine and is transferred to the rainfall interception routine throughfall and streamflow infiltrate into the soil and flows between the stacked unsaturated zone and saturated zone the soil column can also be divided into different layers to allow for transfer of water within the unsaturated zone brooks and corey 1964 part of the water evaporates depending on soil water content and vegetation cover the soil water routine assumes an exponential decay of the saturated hydraulic conductivity with soil depth beven and kirkby 1979 in the flow generation routine the subsurface overland and river flows are then routed according to the d8 direction 4 2 wflow sbm parameterization aiming to tackle the issues on data scarcity and overparameterization for the upper gcpr basin we set up the wflow sbm model with global parameterization recently seamless distributed parameter maps at the global scale have been available for wflow sbm schellekens et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the main parameters and their sources for global parameterization used in this study are indicated in table 3 the seamless distributed maps of soil related parameters for wflow sbm were estimated with pedotransfer functions ptfs based on soil types from the soilgrids database imhoff et al 2020 they were initially applied to the rhine basin and then regionalized to the global scale at the highest resolution of 250 m using the multi parameter regionalization technique mpr samaniego et al 2010 among five soil related parameters table 3 users can choose different ptfs such as brakensiek brakensiek et al 1984 and cosby cosby et al 1984 functions to estimate two highly sensitive parameters ksatver vertical saturated conductivity and m decay rate of ksatver we ran the wflow sbm model simulations with the brakensiek ptf b and cosby ptf c parameter sets to investigate the effect of different ptfs on the model performance the spatial comparison of both parameter sets for the upper gcpr basin is shown in fig 3 the seamless distributed maps of land cover related parameters for wflow sbm were either estimated from literature review or taken directly from global databases as indicated in table 3 the parameter maps from literature review were collected as look up tables and assigned to the land cover types of the globcover database at its original resolution of 300 m the parameter maps from global databases had different resolutions depending on their sources this application assumed that the uncertainty in land cover changes over the study period is negligible at the basin scale examples of the spatial distribution of parameters associated with the land cover types for the upper gcpr basin are shown in fig 4 other insensitive parameters of wflow sbm were set as default values schellekens et al 2019 leaving only one soil related parameter ksathorfrac to be calibrated ksathorfrac is the multiplication factor applied to ksatver vertical saturated conductivity to calculate horizontal saturated conductivity for computing the lateral subsurface flow this parameter compensates for anisotropy small scale soil core saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements that do not represent larger scale hydraulic conductivity and smaller flow length scales hillslope in reality which cannot be represented with the model resolution the ratio of horizontal saturated conductivity to vertical saturated conductivity has been reported for catchments in temperate climates with typical values of 20 100 calver and cammeraat 1993 refsgaard 1997 brooks et al 2004 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 gauthier et al 2009 4 3 reservoir operation module we modeled the regulated outflows of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs by including a reservoir operation module rom within the kinematic wave routing of wflow sbm to do so grid cells of the dam locations and reservoir surface areas were indicated the rom is a reservoir water balance algorithm with a target storage and release based operation method the reservoir storage in the rom is divided into four zones inactive storage conservation storage flood control storage and surcharge storage as illustrated in fig 5 a the operating rule curve parameters include the target downstream water demand target maximum storage and target minimum storage as part of the distributed model the rom also requires parameters representing physical characteristics of each reservoir as defined in table 4 both operational and physical parameters are simplified and can be obtained directly from local data sources rid and egat or calculated from observed streamflow data without calibration this allows for exploring the competence of available data the values of the operating rule curve parameters for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs are shown in fig 5 b and c the physical parameter values for each reservoir are indicated as the last three components in table 1 although the rom was developed as part of wflow sbm schellekens et al 2019 its complete description has not been published before therefore we explain step wise calculations of the rom in brief here overall at a given time step the rom updates the water storage state and computes a volume of water to be released with algorithms to meet a required demand while also maintaining the storage at an optimal level considering the target maximum and minimum storage to calculate the change in the reservoir storage the storage at the previous time step upstream inflow and precipitation and evaporation over the reservoir surface at the current time step are taken into account 1 r e s v o l t r e s v o l t 1 r e s i n f l o w t r e s p t r e s e t t δ t where resvol is reservoir storage m3 resinflow is upstream inflow m3 time step 1 resp is precipitation over the reservoir surface m3 time step 1 reset is evaporation over the reservoir surface m3 time step 1 δt is the computing time step e g daily t is the current time step and t 1 is the previous time step then the current resvol as a fraction of the reservoir maximum storage is computed 2 r e s v o l f r a c t r e s v o l t r e s v o l t 1 2 r e s m a x v o l where resvolfrac is the storage fraction resmaxvol is the reservoir maximum storage known as the flood control storage level m3 the environmental outflow of a given reservoir here called the demand release is determined using a sigmoid curve to scale for the target storage and downstream water demand of the reservoir 3 r e s q d e m a n d t min s f t d d t δ t r e s v o l t where resqdemand is the demand release m3 sf is the sigmoid curve factor and dd is the downstream water demand m3 time step 1 which is associated with the seasonality and often set on a long term monthly basis see fig 5 b sf influences the extent to which resqdemand increases or decreases and is calculated by 4 s f t 1 1 exp c r e s v o l f r a c t r e s m i n f r a c where c is steepness of the sigmoid curve and resminfrac is the target fraction of minimum storage known as the inactive storage level see fig 5 c when the current resvolfrac equals resminfrac the argument of the exponential function is zero and the denominator becomes two this implies that when the reservoir storage reaches the inactive storage level which can occur in dry seasons the reservoir only releases a resqdemand equal to half of dd resqdemand decreases further as resvolfrac drops below resminfrac resvol is updated after taking out resqdemand subsequently resvolfrac is re determined with eq 2 the target fraction of maximum storage known as the conservation storage level is used as a guideline to not only maintain the active storage but also prevent the flood storage it is conditional on water supply and demand throughout the year and often set on a long term monthly basis see fig 5 c the amount of water to be released from the reservoir to let resvol continuously meet the conservation storage level is computed as 5 r e s q t a r g e t t max 0 r e s v o l t r e s m a x v o l r e s m a x f r a c t where resmaxfrac is the target fraction of maximum storage and resqtarget m3 is the target amount of water to be released to meet resmaxfrac if resvol is higher than resmaxvol the surcharge storage resqspill m3 is spilled to prevent dam failure 6 r e s q s p i l l t max 0 r e s v o l t r e s m a x v o l eqs 5 and 6 indicate that the reservoir release does not exceed dd unless resvol is projected to surpass resmaxfrac or resmaxvol in case of water excess the amount of water to be released apart from the demand release is 7 r e s q e x t r a t min r e s q t a r g e t t r e s q s p i l l t r e s m a x q δ t r e s q d e m a n d t where resqextra m3 is the extra amount of water to be released and resmaxq m3 time step 1 is the maximum release capacity of a reservoir see table 1 since the environmental outflow resqdemand is already calculated before updating resvol eq 3 it is subtracted from the resmaxq amount in this step finally the total release resqtotal m3 time step 1 of the current time step is calculated according to 8 r e s q t o t a l t r e s q d e m a n d t r e s

km grid cells could account for the areas of the two major reservoirs the meteorological maps and seamless distributed parameter maps were upscaled or downscaled to the target resolution with parameter specific upscaling procedures imhoff et al 2020 although our study focused on the daily timescale we ran the model at the 3 hourly time step to be able to calculate the model results at the daily timescale using the same aggregation period as applied in the daily observations 6 00 p m 6 00 p m the daily pet data were divided into 3 hourly data using hourly fractions we manually calibrated ksathorfrac for the years 2010 2011 which contain extremely wet and dry periods the parameter was calibrated separately for the ptf b and ptf c soil related parameter sets with the parameter values ranging from 100 to 800 we then validated the optimized ksathorfrac values for the period of 1989 2013 excluding 2010 2011 we used 2006 and 2013 as the representative years for wet and dry conditions in the upper gcpr basin the hydro meteorological details of the extreme years and the entire study period for the selected four catchments in the upper gcpr basin are shown in table 2 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was used as the objective function to optimize the ksathorfrac parameter and to evaluate the accuracy of the wflow sbm model and the rom at the daily timescale the kge is the combination of three criteria that assess different hydrological dynamics correlation variability error and bias error given by 9 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between simulated streamflow and observed streamflow giving the error in the dynamics α is the ratio of the standard deviation of simulated streamflow over the standard deviation of observed streamflow giving the error in the variability and β is the ratio between the mean simulated streamflow and the mean observed streamflow giving the bias the kge ranges from to 1 with an ideal value at unity when all three components are equal to 1 gupta 2009 5 results 5 1 parameter optimization and uncertainty during the calibration of the ksathorfrac parameter we found that higher ksathorfrac values generally attenuate the magnitude of streamflow especially for peak flows and flatten their recession limbs with the same ksathorfrac value the ptf b parameter set produces daily streamflow with steeper peaks and more rapid recessions than the ptf c parameter set this is because ptf b presents more varying ksatver values with lower m values over the study area fig 3 resulting in less daily baseflow contribution the optimized ksathorfrac value for the upper gcpr basin is 550 for ptf b and 120 for ptf c the range of the simulated daily streamflows with the ksathorfrac values between 100 and 800 is more narrow for ptf b than for ptf c light colored bands in fig 6 indicating that ptf b introduces a smaller uncertainty in the streamflow results compared to ptf c with their optimized ksathorfrac values ptf b and ptf c deliver similar estimates of daily streamflow for both natural and regulated catchments as demonstrated by the colored lines in fig 6 and the goodness of fit indicators in table 5 ptf b outperforms ptf c in the natural catchments while ptf c performs better in the regulated catchments ptf b tends to result in higher α but smaller β compared to ptf c indicating a lower error in the variability less overestimating or underestimating the variability in daily streamflow but a larger bias more overestimating or underestimating the mean streamflow this is because ptf b captures the daily streamflow fluctuation and magnitudes of daily peak flows more accurately whereas ptf c is better at simulating daily baseflow as also visible in fig 6 5 2 model performance in natural catchments overall the wflow sbm model with the global data and seamless distributed parameter maps can reconstruct the observed daily streamflow for the natural catchments the daily hydrographs of the nan natural catchment fig 7 a and b and yom natural catchment fig 7 c and d show good fits in the peak timing and seasonal variability between the observed and simulated streamflows in both wet year 2006 and dry year 2013 table 5 indicates satisfactory model performance with the kge value in the validation period ranging between 0 63 and 0 65 for the nan natural catchment and 0 78 for the yom natural catchment apart from the spatial uncertainty in model parameters the varying model performances between the two catchments can be attributed to the difference in the catchment characteristics particularly the elevation and land cover a large part of the nan natural catchment is mountainous with forest areas as shown in figs 1 and 4 therefore its hydrological processes are more difficult to simulate compared to the yom natural catchment that is less steep with more grasslands the difficulty is caused by the higher amount and variability in precipitation which result in the higher and more fluctuating streamflow as also evident in table 2 as a result the peak flow magnitude in the nan natural catchment was five times higher than in the yom natural catchment in the wet year fig 7 a and c and nine times higher in the dry year fig 7 b and d for both catchments the model tends to underestimate peak flows in the rainy season especially at the beginning of the monsoon period and miss peak flows generated by local storm events in the dry season 5 3 model performance in regulated catchments the wflow sbm model with the rom shows varying performances when simulating the regulated streamflow for the sirikit and bhumibol catchments table 5 on the one hand the daily streamflow estimate for the sirikit catchment is passable with the highest kge of 0 43 ptf c in the validation period on the other hand the model failed to estimate the daily streamflow for the bhumibol catchment resulting in negative kge values in both calibration and validation periods the major sources of error for both catchments are the inflexibility of the daily reservoir releases and the prompt releases of surcharge water by the rom in the very wet periods as evidenced in fig 7 e g and h therefore the resulting accuracy for both reservoirs tends to be higher in the dry season than in the rainy season and higher in dry years than in wet years to elaborate the rom performance the daily water storage computed by the rom for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs are compared to observations in fig 8 overall the simulated reservoir storage reasonably captures the inter and intra annual variability although the magnitude is not accurate the storage tends to be underestimated for the sirikit reservoir and overestimated for the bhumibol reservoir in very wet periods the storage is overestimated and exceeds the monthly target maximum top of gray band in fig 8 this occurred more often for the bhumibol reservoir than for the sirikit reservoir especially after the year 2003 as a result the goodness of fit of the simulated storage table 5 is significantly better for the sirikit reservoir highest kge 0 81 with ptf c than the bhumibol reservoir kge 0 59 for both ptf b and for ptf c due to the storage overestimation the rom released surcharge storage promptly according to eq 7 producing the unrealistic streamflow as appeared in 2006 fig 7 e and g although the observed daily storage of both reservoirs also exceeded the monthly target maximum in some wet years e g 1995 2006 and 2011 fig 8 most of observed surcharged water was allowed to stay in the reservoirs instead of being spilled at once therefore the observed peak outflow due to surcharge storage was not as huge as the outflow simulated by the rom fig 7 e h due to the limited flexibility of the rom it cannot capture the dynamics of the observed reservoir releases at the daily timescale however it does show satisfactory performance at the monthly timescale see the supplementary document 6 discussion 6 1 wflow sbm with global data and parameterization to our knowledge this is the first study that applied the wflow sbm model to simulate the daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin by setting up the model with global geospatial datasets e g srtm elevation forcing the model with global meteorological datasets mswep v2 p and earth2observe pet and applying the seamless parameter maps based on soilgrids globcover and other global databases e g modis lai we are able to circumvent the poor availability of in situ data often occurring in sea the seamless distributed parameter maps were applied to all but one sensitive soil related parameter ksathorfrac for which ptfs were unavailable imhoff et al 2020 although a full calibration procedure may improve the model performance calibrating only one parameter prevented overparameterization and equifinality as well as reduced the computational time when simulating such a large basin at high spatial and temporal resolutions the model sensitivity to the soil related parameter maps with different pedotransfer functions ptf b and ptf c became apparent due to the difference in the optimized ksathorfrac values 550 for ptf b and 120 for ptf c ksathorfrac controls horizontal saturated conductivity which influences the magnitude of the lateral subsurface flow and thus streamflow dynamics and recession after a peak fig 6 the parameter is therefore sensitive to the other soil related parameters particularly ksatver vertical saturated conductivity and m decay rate of ksatver see full description in table 3 ptf b and ptf c produced very different spatial values of ksatver and m as visible in fig 3 therefore we suggest calibrating ksathorfrac with respect to the selected ptf parameter set and study area furthermore calibrating the ksathorfrac based on soil types or elevation instead of calibrating it as a constant value may improve the model performance which can benefit the model application for the real time forecasting purpose although more computational efforts are demanded nevertheless the range of streamflows simulated with the ksathorfrac values of 100 800 is not very large especially for ptf b fig 6 therefore running the model without any calibration only introduces a little uncertainty which makes it possible to apply it in ungauged basins other sources of model uncertainty such as the meteorological geospatial and hydrological input data were not investigated in this study but could play a role in the model errors firstly the synthetic meteorological data from global databases are subject to their own spatial 10 km and temporal 3 hourly daily resolutions which were coarser than the target resolutions of the model 1 km and 3 hourly as a result the p data failed to present local storm events leading to the absence of local peak flows in dry seasons and in the beginning of rainy seasons for natural catchments fig 7 a d in a similar manner the quality of the pet data directly affects the actual evapotranspiration aet estimates but their accuracy was difficult to evaluate secondly the seamless distributed maps for the land cover related parameters were created based on the land cover database from the year 2009 fig 4 in fact the land cover in the upper gcpr basin has gradually changed over time with decreasing forest areas and increasing agricultural areas jamrussri and toda 2017 therefore assigning the land cover related parameters based on yearly land cover maps may improve the model results lastly quality of the observed streamflow data was unverified and could also affect the model performance evaluation to some extent considering the study purpose we conclude that the wflow sbm model with global data and parameterization is capable of simulating the daily streamflow for natural catchments fig 7 a d and table 5 but less effective for the regulated catchments due to limitations in the rom see section 6 2 for more detail in most study catchments the goodness of fit results were higher during the validation than during the calibration potentially because the short calibration period years 2010 2011 was both extremely wet and dry while the validation period years 1989 2013 excluding 2010 2011 also contained more regular hydrological conditions nonetheless the wflow sbm model outperforms the swat model that was run with observed daily meteorological data and fully calibrated for the same study area jamrussri and toda 2017 therefore it has potential to serve as a tool for the upper gcpr basin and other ungauged or data scarce catchments in sea 6 2 reservoir operation module reservoir operation modules with the target storage and release based methods usually require a large amount of data for an individual reservoir that may be undocumented or difficult to obtain particularly for data scarce areas like sea yassin et al 2019 found that even when the required data are available they usually contain considerable uncertainties so that optimizing operational parameters is still insufficient to represent the absolute storage release relationship for many reservoirs especially the multipurpose ones considering limited data available for the upper gcpr basin the rom was therefore designed to minimize the number of operational parameters and utilize accessible data without calibration fig 5 and table 4 which also allowed for investigating the data competence the main error in the rom results was the daily storage that exceeded the monthly target maximum in the rainy seasons fig 8 in response the surcharge water was promptly released by the rom causing unrealistic flood peaks fig 7 e g and h especially for the bhumibol reservoir meanwhile the observations showed that the daily storage also exceeded the monthly target maximum in some wet years however the surcharge was not released at once but was held and gradually released to prevent downstream floods in some occasions the daily releases were paused for a few days to control downstream floods this indicates the high flexibility of the actual reservoir operations on a day to day basis which could not be captured by the rom that is based on the monthly operating rule curves and piece wise linear regression algorithm this flexibility reflects real time decision making by dam operators to meet occasional targets such as mitigating floods satisfying downstream irrigation demands and increasing the hydropower generation yassin et al 2019 therefore the rom simulations in this study can be seen as the baseline operation scenario which reflects the generalized operations without further impacts of human intervention this baseline simulation is useful for analyzing effects of reservoir operations on downstream flows which is presented in a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 although the real time decision making is beyond the capability of the rom and other mathematical operation modules we suggest that the rom performance can still be upgraded in the future with i a more accurate storage calculation and ii a more complex release algorithm the storage calculation may be improved with the higher accuracy of daily reservoir inflows and direct aet losses computed by the wflow sbm model in this study the upstream inflows of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs were simulated as naturalized flows and indirectly validated with upstream flows since reliable reservoir inflow data are unavailable however there are four reservoirs located upstream of the bhumibol reservoir which have been operated since 2003 therefore the simulated inflows could be inaccurate although this was impossible to evaluate without reliable observed data this explains the storage overestimation for the bhumibol reservoir after 2003 fig 8 b meanwhile the inaccuracy of the daily aet could be partly due to simplification of the rom itself since the water surface area of each reservoir was set as a fixed value table 1 despite the daily storage change the amount of daily evaporating water could be under or overestimated therefore the reservoir area elevation storage relationship e g zhao et al 2016b may increase the accuracy of the daily aet losses and thus the daily storage estimated by the rom the main factor determining the release algorithm in the rom is the monthly target downstream water demand dd without existing data the dd of each reservoir was estimated as the long term monthly average of the reservoir outflow fig 5 which could be a source of significant uncertainty for the daily outflow simulation another limitation of this algorithm is that it intends to meet the target dd without considering the daily inflows e g thresholds for flooding normal and low inflows or maximum acceptable streamflow at downstream control points e g at nakhon sawan adding these factors into the outflow determination process e g zhao et al 2016b yassin et al 2019 may rectify the unrealistic surcharge releases in addition a release coefficient e g annual coefficients as a function of mean total annual inflow could introduce the inter annual release variability into the module hanasaki et al 2006 however more parameters also mean more uncertainty sources and thus their competence should be carefully assessed 6 3 human impacts on hydrological modeling and streamflow our findings are in substantial agreement with previous studies concluding that simulating the outflows of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs is challenging due to the complex patterns of real time decision making by dam operators neither target storage and release based methods nor inflow and demand based methods applied in the past could satisfactorily reconstruct the actual operations of these two reservoirs at the daily timescale e g hanasaki et al 2006 mateo et al 2014 yassin et al 2019 the recent study of yassin et al 2019 suggested that it was mainly due to the high ratio of the maximum reservoir storage and the mean total annual inflow of both reservoirs 0 5 indicating more radical regulations compared to many other reservoirs worldwide moreover since the outflows of the sirikit and bhimibol reservoirs conjugate at nakhon sawan it is likely that both reservoirs are jointly operated in real time to manage floods and droughts in the downstream floodplain as also reported during the 2011 gcpr flooding komori et al 2012 recently yang et al 2019 found that the data driven method artificial neural networks anns could learn the complex pattern of the observed reservoir outflow records and reproduce the daily outflow more accurately for both sirikit nse 0 93 and bhumibol reservoirs nse 0 86 therefore they can be useful tools for real time reservoir outflow simulation and forecasting however since anns are black boxes they cannot reveal the insights of real time decision making in the actual operations of the reservoirs which remain imperative for better and more sustainable reservoir water management in the future above all the unsatisfactory simulations of the reservoir outflows by the rom reflect the strong and prompt human intervention on daily streamflow in the areas that are at risks of floods and droughts like the upper gcpr basin and other basins in sea understanding of quantitative impacts of reservoir operations especially with real time decision making on downstream flows is essential therefore we further applied the developed model and results from this study to assess the effects of reservoir operations on the daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin in a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 with deeper knowledge on both reservoir system modeling and reservoir effects we expect to be more capable of improving hydrological modeling and water resource management simultaneously 7 conclusion and outlook this study concerned the development of a 1 km resolution distributed hydrological model wflow sbm with global spatial data and parameterization and the exploration of its performance in estimating daily streamflow in the upper greater chao phraya river basin the main findings are as follows 1 the global data driven wflow sbm model can satisfactorily estimate daily streamflow in the natural catchments highest kge 0 78 in the validation period 2 the wflow sbm model was not able to estimate daily streamflow in regulated catchments very well due to the simplified algorithm of the reservoir operation module rom highest kge 0 43 in the validation period 3 the rom with the monthly operation rules can capture the seasonal variability of the reservoir storage and releases but cannot take into account real time decision making by dam operators the rom results therefore reflect the baseline operations without further impacts of human intervention 4 the difference between daily reservoir outflows from the baseline operation simulations and from the real time operation observations highlights the strong effect and importance of real time decision making to optimize the reservoir releases promptly especially during extreme events at the same time it also addresses the source of difficulties in modeling large scale multipurpose reservoirs a more complex module with optimized parameters may improve the results but uncertainties remain high 5 with rooms for improvements the proposed model can reasonably serve as a tool for analyzing catchment scale hydrological variations in the gcpr basin and provide an opportunity for streamflow estimation in other ungauged or data scarce basins in southeast asia based on the findings more studies on the use of seamless parameter maps based on global data for distributed hydrological modeling in other data scarce basins are encouraged effects of using different global meteorological datasets on the model performance should also be explored future challenges in the reservoir system modeling include gaining a better understanding of the complexity of the real time operations and improving the model performance for multipurpose reservoirs a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 describes the application of the

8268,study region upper region of the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand study focus this study presents a 1 km resolution distributed hydrological model wflow sbm with global spatial data and parameterization for estimating daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin with the aim to overcome in situ data scarcity often occurring in southeast asia we forced the model with the mswep v2 precipitation and earth2observe potential evapotranspiration datasets seamless distributed parameter maps based on pedotransfer functions ptfs and literature review were applied to bypass calibration only the ksathorfrac parameter determining the lateral subsurface flow was calibrated a target storage and release based reservoir operation module rom was implemented to simulate reservoir releases we compared the simulated daily streamflows obtained from different ptfs and evaluated the model performance in the period 1989 2014 new hydrological insights for the region the global data driven wflow sbm model can reconstruct daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin especially for natural catchments kge 0 78 the rom can capture the seasonal variability of reservoir releases but not very accurately at the daily timescale kge 0 43 since the actual reservoir operations are too complex different ptfs and ksathorfrac values only introduce little uncertainty in the streamflow results therefore the proposed model provides an opportunity for streamflow estimation in other ungauged or data scarce basins in southeast asia nonetheless the difficulty in the reservoir system modeling reflects the necessity of better understanding of human intervention on daily streamflow keywords wflow sbm reservoir modeling data scarcity global forcing data pedotransfer function chao phraya basin 1 introduction floods and droughts have caused profound damage at the global scale amplified by climate change and land use change chang and franczyk 2008 dai 2011 ward et al 2013 bagley et al 2014 these hydrological hazards have dramatically increased in many regions and are expected to become more frequent and severe in the future trenberth et al 2014 winsemius et al 2016 southeast asia sea is a region that is exceptionally prone to both floods hirabayashi et al 2013 ceola et al 2014 arnell and gosling 2016 and droughts cook et al 2010 dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 the vulnerability of sea is partially due to the changes in monsoon dynamics and partially due to socio economic development such as urbanization deforestation and cultivation in the developing countries mitigating these hydrological hazards in sea requires rational water resource planning and management at the basin scale the greater chao phraya river gcpr basin in thailand is representative of the vulnerable and highly regulated river basins in sea considering its agriculture and water resource managements despite the water regulation by several multipurpose reservoirs the basin has still experienced hydrological hazards almost annually the most catastrophic floods occurred in 1995 2006 and 2011 followed by serious droughts in 2013 2016 takeda et al 2016 kinouchi et al 2018 the 2011 gcpr flood was one of the most devastating hazards recorded in sea with an inundated area of over 30 000 km2 13 million people affected and more than 800 fatalities komori et al 2012 this calls for the development of comprehensive hydrological models for the basin particularly at the sub daily timescale to assist early warning and mitigation of floods and droughts similar extreme events have occurred in neighboring countries such as vietnam and myanmar luu et al 2018 myo lin et al 2018 thereupon knowledge obtained from hydrological modeling in the gcpr basin can also contribute to water resource management in other sea basins several hydrological models have been developed over the past decades for better understanding of rainfall runoff processes and have become important tools for scenario simulations predictions and decision making for river basin management e g mysiak et al 2005 ajami et al 2008 cloke and pappenberger 2009 hydrological models can be classified as lumped or distributed according to the spatial representation singh and woolhiser 2002 lumped models mathematically simplify the rainfall runoff processes in a basin with spatially averaged parameters lumped model parameters have to be calibrated as they cannot be obtained from direct measurements thus limiting model applications to gauged basins crawford 1966 with improvements in computer technologies distributed models have been developed singh and woolhiser 2002 which allow mathematically describing the rainfall runoff processes in a spatially distributed way this model type uses parameters directly related to physical characteristics of the basin e g topography soil land cover and river network and takes into account spatial heterogeneity in both physical characteristics and meteorological inputs therefore distributed models potentially provide additional and more correct description of hydrological processes in the basin compared to lumped models refsgaard and knudsen 1996 wicks and bathurst 1996 since distributed models can fulfill various needs in spatial modeling such as flood and drought extents they have been widely used in water resource planning and management despite their benefits distributed models are much more complex and difficult to apply than lumped models firstly introduced in the 1970s the distributed models were expected to be used without prior calibration by directly determining model parameters from field data abbott et al 1986 this means the model results significantly depend on the accuracy of geospatial and spatial meteorological input data gourley and vieux 2006 in practice however these in situ data are not always available especially for ungauged or sparsely gauged basins in developing countries including in sea grayson and blöschl 2001 therefore like lumped models some distributed parameters are still subject to calibration refsgaard 1997 calibrating a distributed model generally sets different parameter values to different grid cells which poses a high risk of overparameterization requires enormous computational demands at fine resolutions and obstructs model applications in large basins beven 2006 fortunately the advancement in remote sensing and geographic information system gis data including soils land cover and climate in recent decades can potentially complement some absences of field data and provide new means of spatial calibration and validation many remote sensing and gis data are available in global public domains with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions fortin et al 2001 skidmore 2017 with the availability of global high resolution soil data e g hengl et al 2017 the recent attention has also been focused on pedotransfer functions ptfs for soil related parameterization traditionally used in soil science ptfs characterize soil hydraulic properties using predictive functions and structural soil data van looy et al 2017 therefore they have great potential to facilitate soil related parameters such as the water retention characteristic and hydraulic conductivity in distributed models zhao et al 2016a imhoff et al 2020 together with powerful computer resources we can attempt to maximize the use of remote sensing gis and ptfs data in order to minimize the number of calibrated parameters in distributed models this offers an opportunity to develop more feasible and reliable distributed models for basins with data scarcity like in sea in basins that are highly regulated by dammed reservoirs hydrological models also need explicit reservoir operation components this is yet another motivation to use distributed hydrological models in this context failure to represent reservoir operations limits the model performances and their applicability in scenario analyses with climate land use and operation changes yassin et al 2019 the existing reservoir operation schemes in hydrological models are categorized into four types natural lake inflow and demand based data driven and target storage and release based yassin et al 2019 the natural lake method is limited to uncontrolled reservoirs without dams the inflow and demand based methods determine reservoir releases as a function of inflows and downstream water demands but cannot account for reservoir operations in detail the data driven methods can simulate reservoir releases more accurately but cannot provide insight into the reservoir operation mechanisms due to their black box characteristics the target storage and release based methods consider reservoir storage zoning and adjust reservoir releases as a function of dynamic target storage so called operating rule curves the main challenge for this type of methods is the large amount of required data such as the storage zone setting and actual rule curves of each reservoir that are not always documented or easy to obtain however considering the growing availability of global data the target storage and release based methods seems to be the most promising for the simulation of multipurpose reservoirs at the daily timescale e g zhao et al 2016b zajac et al 2017 yassin et al 2019 previous studies have investigated the performance of various distributed models on the monthly and daily streamflow simulations in the gcpr basin and other highly regulated basins in sea e g kite 2000 kure and tebakari 2012 sayama et al 2015 many of them have utilized global geospatial data e g thanapakpawin et al 2007 vo and gourbesville 2016 bhagabati and kawasaki 2017 livneh et al 2017 some studies have further implemented daily meteorological data from global databases to force the models instead of using gauged data and they have shown promising performances e g wang et al 2016 liu et al 2017 li et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 few studies have implemented the target storage and release based methods e g kite 2001 mateo et al 2014 however all mentioned studies still needed to calibrate a few to several distributed parameters that are related to soil land cover or reservoir operation to date no study has applied distributed models with global parameterization to simulate daily streamflow in the gcpr and other sea basins this study aims to develop a 1 km resolution distributed hydrological model with global spatial data and parameterization for estimating daily streamflow in the upper region of the gcpr basin to overcome in situ data scarcity often occurring in sea and to minimize the model calibration we used the wflow sbm model schellekens et al 2019 which has shown good performance in basins across a large range of elevations and drainage areas e g lópez lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 giardino et al 2018 lópez lópez 2018 gebremicael et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the utilized global remote sensing and gis data included i static geospatial data from global databases ii meteorological forcing data from the global reanalysis iii seamless distributed maps for soil related parameters obtained with ptfs and iv seamless distributed maps for land cover related parameters obtained from literature review and global databases model results from different ptfs were investigated a reservoir operation module rom with a target storage and release based method was implemented with a minimum number of parameters and accessible operating rule curve data without calibration the performance of the global data driven wflow sbm model with the rom were evaluated in both natural and regulated catchments the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce the study area in section 3 we summarize the selected global datasets the methodology including the wflow sbm model parameterization reservoir operation module and model evaluation are presented in section 4 next the results on model performance are shown in section 5 the results are then discussed in section 6 followed by the conclusion and outlook in section 7 2 study area the greater chao phraya river basin gcpr is thailand s largest and most important basin with respect to land and water resource development the entire basin covers an area of approximately 158 600 km2 accounting for 30 of the country s surface area fig 1 the basin can be divided geographically into the upper region 66 and lower region 34 this study focused on the upper region where the main reservoirs are located this region consists of four sub basins namely the ping river 34 500 km2 wang river 10 800 km2 yom river 24 000 km2 and nan river 34 700 km2 the elevation of the upper region ranges from 22 to 2534 m above sea level the four rivers merge at nakhon sawan and form the origin of the chao phraya river the river then drains through the lower region with intensive rice cultivation and densely populated areas before emptying into the gulf of thailand the climate of the upper gcpr basin is characterized by tropical monsoons and cyclones contributing to the high seasonal variability of precipitation the wet rainy season is when the southwest monsoons from the indian ocean together with tropical cyclones from the pacific ocean and south china sea bring very humid air towards the basin causing heavy rainfall from may to october therefrom the northeast monsoons bring cool and dry air from the siberian anticyclone causing the dry season from november to april bachelet et al 1992 kripalani et al 1995 considering the seasonality the thai water year is set as a period from april 1st of any given year to march 31st of the following year from this point onward we refer to water year and water yearly as year and yearly annual i e the year 2011 is from april 1st 2011 to march 31st 2012 the long term yearly average of precipitation from 1989 to 2013 is 1060 mm the highest yearly precipitation was recorded in 2011 1449 mm and the lowest in 1993 841 mm most precipitation 86 occurs in the rainy season accordingly annual maximum daily flows often occur in september and october while annual minimum daily flows mostly occur in january the highest daily streamflow ever recorded at nakhon sawan was 5450 m3 s 1 october 2006 and the lowest was 52 m3 s 1 april 1994 for the purposes of irrigation hydropower generation and flood control seven large dammed reservoirs have been constructed and operated in the upper gcpr basin over the past 55 years the bhumibol and sirikit reservoirs locations shown in fig 1 are the two largest ones in terms of storage capacity they are currently managed by the royal irrigation department of thailand rid and the electricity generating authority of thailand egat principle characteristics of the two reservoirs obtained from rid are presented in table 1 together they account for 93 of the total reservoir capacity 24 7 billion m3 in the upper region therefore we focus on modeling the bhumibol and sirikit reservoirs in this study with the assumption that the influences of the other five reservoirs on streamflow are insignificant at the basin scale to investigate the model performance we selected two natural and two regulated catchments in the upper gcpr basin catchment locations shown in fig 1 the natural catchments from the nan and yom headwaters were selected based on available data and will be called the nan natural 3546 km2 and yom natural 2018 km2 the regulated catchments represent the drainage areas from the headwater until the dam location and will be called the sirikit catchment 13 155 km2 and bhumibol catchment 25 988 km2 3 data this study required geospatial data meteorological data and hydrological data for the model setup and validation the geospatial data were used to represent the physical characteristics of the basin in the wflow sbm model the meteorological data were used as model driving forces the hydrological data were used in the parameter optimization and result analyses most data were obtained from global databases as we attempted to overcome data scarcity in the study area which is a common challenge in sea the geospatial data comprised the digital elevation model dem land cover types soil types and river network the dem was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 the land cover from globcover bontemps et al 2011 the soil from soilgrids hengl et al 2017 and the river network from the royal irrigation department rid the dem and river network data were employed to create the distributed maps of basin boundary local drainage direction strahler stream orders and river length per grid cell in the wflow sbm model these maps indicate the flow directions and control hydrological processes in a distributed way in this study the land cover and soil data were not directly used as model inputs but were used in the estimation of global parameters see section 4 2 the meteorological data for forcing the wflow sbm model were precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet p data were obtained from the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 2 mswep v2 beck et al 2019 the dataset was constructed using gauges satellites and reanalyses with corrections for distributional biases and systematic terrestrial p biases it is available at high spatial 10 km and temporal 3 hourly resolutions for the 1979 2017 period pet data were obtained from the earth2observe database schellekens et al 2017 as the successor of the watch forcing data era interim wfdei data weedon et al 2014 they are offered with many calculation methods of which we selected the fao penman monteith pet dataset allen et al 1998 it is also available at the high spatial 10 km and temporal daily resolutions for the 1979 2014 period sperna weiland et al 2015 both the mswep v2 p and the earth2observe pet datasets have shown to produce promising model results in many hydrological and meteorological studies e g tarnavsky et al 2018 liu et al 2019 xu et al 2019 beck et al 2017 beck et al 2020 and therefore were chosen to force the wflow sbm model for the upper gcpr basin since we did not have to compute the pet nor account for snow processes within the model other forcing data such as temperature and solar radiation were unnecessary the required hydrological data included observed daily streamflow at the outlets of the study catchments and reservoirs of interest observed daily storage of each reservoir and dynamic operating rule curves of each reservoir the data were provided by the royal irrigation department of thailand rid and the electricity generating authority of thailand egat the observed daily streamflow is the average of the observed hourly streamflow from 6 00 p m of the previous day to 6 00 p m of the defined day their availability varies among gauges see table 2 the reservoir operating rule curves consist of the long term monthly target storage of each reservoir derived from the rid report and the long term monthly target water demand that we manually extracted from the observed daily streamflow data of each reservoir more detail in section 4 3 in reality these reservoir operating rule curves serve as guidelines for dam operators 4 methodology 4 1 wflow sbm model the wflow simple bucket model so called wflow sbm is a conceptual rainfall runoff model in the spatially distributed wflow modeling platform which is pcraster and python based schellekens et al 2019 the soil water processes of wflow sbm are based on the topog sbm model vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 the flow processes for subsurface overland and river flows are based on the kinematic wave approach that are comparable to the topkapi todini and ciarapica 2002 and g2g bell et al 2007 models while topog sbm is suitable for small areas wflow sbm is more widely applicable vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 schellekens et al 2019 in contrast to many conceptual models wflow sbm calculates the lateral subsurface flow explicitly and uses parameters that represent simplified physical characteristics of a basin vertessy and elsenbeer 1999 it has shown good performance in a broad range of applications e g lópez lópez et al 2016 hassaballah et al 2017 giardino et al 2018 lópez lópez 2018 gebremicael et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the scheme of wflow sbm is illustrated in fig 2 the one dimensional model is constructed on a grid cell network of eight flow directions d8 for surface and subsurface flow routing with the presence of both vertical and lateral flows it has four main routines i a precipitation snow routine based on the hbv model lindström et al 1997 ii a rainfall interception routine based on the modified rutter model rutter et al 1971 1975 or gash model gash 1979 iii a soil water routine based on topog sbm and iv a flow generation routine with the kinematic wave function water enters each grid cell through the precipitation snow routine and is transferred to the rainfall interception routine throughfall and streamflow infiltrate into the soil and flows between the stacked unsaturated zone and saturated zone the soil column can also be divided into different layers to allow for transfer of water within the unsaturated zone brooks and corey 1964 part of the water evaporates depending on soil water content and vegetation cover the soil water routine assumes an exponential decay of the saturated hydraulic conductivity with soil depth beven and kirkby 1979 in the flow generation routine the subsurface overland and river flows are then routed according to the d8 direction 4 2 wflow sbm parameterization aiming to tackle the issues on data scarcity and overparameterization for the upper gcpr basin we set up the wflow sbm model with global parameterization recently seamless distributed parameter maps at the global scale have been available for wflow sbm schellekens et al 2019 imhoff et al 2020 the main parameters and their sources for global parameterization used in this study are indicated in table 3 the seamless distributed maps of soil related parameters for wflow sbm were estimated with pedotransfer functions ptfs based on soil types from the soilgrids database imhoff et al 2020 they were initially applied to the rhine basin and then regionalized to the global scale at the highest resolution of 250 m using the multi parameter regionalization technique mpr samaniego et al 2010 among five soil related parameters table 3 users can choose different ptfs such as brakensiek brakensiek et al 1984 and cosby cosby et al 1984 functions to estimate two highly sensitive parameters ksatver vertical saturated conductivity and m decay rate of ksatver we ran the wflow sbm model simulations with the brakensiek ptf b and cosby ptf c parameter sets to investigate the effect of different ptfs on the model performance the spatial comparison of both parameter sets for the upper gcpr basin is shown in fig 3 the seamless distributed maps of land cover related parameters for wflow sbm were either estimated from literature review or taken directly from global databases as indicated in table 3 the parameter maps from literature review were collected as look up tables and assigned to the land cover types of the globcover database at its original resolution of 300 m the parameter maps from global databases had different resolutions depending on their sources this application assumed that the uncertainty in land cover changes over the study period is negligible at the basin scale examples of the spatial distribution of parameters associated with the land cover types for the upper gcpr basin are shown in fig 4 other insensitive parameters of wflow sbm were set as default values schellekens et al 2019 leaving only one soil related parameter ksathorfrac to be calibrated ksathorfrac is the multiplication factor applied to ksatver vertical saturated conductivity to calculate horizontal saturated conductivity for computing the lateral subsurface flow this parameter compensates for anisotropy small scale soil core saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements that do not represent larger scale hydraulic conductivity and smaller flow length scales hillslope in reality which cannot be represented with the model resolution the ratio of horizontal saturated conductivity to vertical saturated conductivity has been reported for catchments in temperate climates with typical values of 20 100 calver and cammeraat 1993 refsgaard 1997 brooks et al 2004 weiler and mcdonnell 2007 gauthier et al 2009 4 3 reservoir operation module we modeled the regulated outflows of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs by including a reservoir operation module rom within the kinematic wave routing of wflow sbm to do so grid cells of the dam locations and reservoir surface areas were indicated the rom is a reservoir water balance algorithm with a target storage and release based operation method the reservoir storage in the rom is divided into four zones inactive storage conservation storage flood control storage and surcharge storage as illustrated in fig 5 a the operating rule curve parameters include the target downstream water demand target maximum storage and target minimum storage as part of the distributed model the rom also requires parameters representing physical characteristics of each reservoir as defined in table 4 both operational and physical parameters are simplified and can be obtained directly from local data sources rid and egat or calculated from observed streamflow data without calibration this allows for exploring the competence of available data the values of the operating rule curve parameters for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs are shown in fig 5 b and c the physical parameter values for each reservoir are indicated as the last three components in table 1 although the rom was developed as part of wflow sbm schellekens et al 2019 its complete description has not been published before therefore we explain step wise calculations of the rom in brief here overall at a given time step the rom updates the water storage state and computes a volume of water to be released with algorithms to meet a required demand while also maintaining the storage at an optimal level considering the target maximum and minimum storage to calculate the change in the reservoir storage the storage at the previous time step upstream inflow and precipitation and evaporation over the reservoir surface at the current time step are taken into account 1 r e s v o l t r e s v o l t 1 r e s i n f l o w t r e s p t r e s e t t δ t where resvol is reservoir storage m3 resinflow is upstream inflow m3 time step 1 resp is precipitation over the reservoir surface m3 time step 1 reset is evaporation over the reservoir surface m3 time step 1 δt is the computing time step e g daily t is the current time step and t 1 is the previous time step then the current resvol as a fraction of the reservoir maximum storage is computed 2 r e s v o l f r a c t r e s v o l t r e s v o l t 1 2 r e s m a x v o l where resvolfrac is the storage fraction resmaxvol is the reservoir maximum storage known as the flood control storage level m3 the environmental outflow of a given reservoir here called the demand release is determined using a sigmoid curve to scale for the target storage and downstream water demand of the reservoir 3 r e s q d e m a n d t min s f t d d t δ t r e s v o l t where resqdemand is the demand release m3 sf is the sigmoid curve factor and dd is the downstream water demand m3 time step 1 which is associated with the seasonality and often set on a long term monthly basis see fig 5 b sf influences the extent to which resqdemand increases or decreases and is calculated by 4 s f t 1 1 exp c r e s v o l f r a c t r e s m i n f r a c where c is steepness of the sigmoid curve and resminfrac is the target fraction of minimum storage known as the inactive storage level see fig 5 c when the current resvolfrac equals resminfrac the argument of the exponential function is zero and the denominator becomes two this implies that when the reservoir storage reaches the inactive storage level which can occur in dry seasons the reservoir only releases a resqdemand equal to half of dd resqdemand decreases further as resvolfrac drops below resminfrac resvol is updated after taking out resqdemand subsequently resvolfrac is re determined with eq 2 the target fraction of maximum storage known as the conservation storage level is used as a guideline to not only maintain the active storage but also prevent the flood storage it is conditional on water supply and demand throughout the year and often set on a long term monthly basis see fig 5 c the amount of water to be released from the reservoir to let resvol continuously meet the conservation storage level is computed as 5 r e s q t a r g e t t max 0 r e s v o l t r e s m a x v o l r e s m a x f r a c t where resmaxfrac is the target fraction of maximum storage and resqtarget m3 is the target amount of water to be released to meet resmaxfrac if resvol is higher than resmaxvol the surcharge storage resqspill m3 is spilled to prevent dam failure 6 r e s q s p i l l t max 0 r e s v o l t r e s m a x v o l eqs 5 and 6 indicate that the reservoir release does not exceed dd unless resvol is projected to surpass resmaxfrac or resmaxvol in case of water excess the amount of water to be released apart from the demand release is 7 r e s q e x t r a t min r e s q t a r g e t t r e s q s p i l l t r e s m a x q δ t r e s q d e m a n d t where resqextra m3 is the extra amount of water to be released and resmaxq m3 time step 1 is the maximum release capacity of a reservoir see table 1 since the environmental outflow resqdemand is already calculated before updating resvol eq 3 it is subtracted from the resmaxq amount in this step finally the total release resqtotal m3 time step 1 of the current time step is calculated according to 8 r e s q t o t a l t r e s q d e m a n d t r e s q e x t r a t δ t 4 4 model application and evaluation we applied the wflow sbm model to the entire upper gcpr basin at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 km and temporal resolution of 3 h the 1 km grid cells could account for the areas of the two major reservoirs the meteorological maps and seamless distributed parameter maps were upscaled or downscaled to the target resolution with parameter specific upscaling procedures imhoff et al 2020 although our study focused on the daily timescale we ran the model at the 3 hourly time step to be able to calculate the model results at the daily timescale using the same aggregation period as applied in the daily observations 6 00 p m 6 00 p m the daily pet data were divided into 3 hourly data using hourly fractions we manually calibrated ksathorfrac for the years 2010 2011 which contain extremely wet and dry periods the parameter was calibrated separately for the ptf b and ptf c soil related parameter sets with the parameter values ranging from 100 to 800 we then validated the optimized ksathorfrac values for the period of 1989 2013 excluding 2010 2011 we used 2006 and 2013 as the representative years for wet and dry conditions in the upper gcpr basin the hydro meteorological details of the extreme years and the entire study period for the selected four catchments in the upper gcpr basin are shown in table 2 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 was used as the objective function to optimize the ksathorfrac parameter and to evaluate the accuracy of the wflow sbm model and the rom at the daily timescale the kge is the combination of three criteria that assess different hydrological dynamics correlation variability error and bias error given by 9 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between simulated streamflow and observed streamflow giving the error in the dynamics α is the ratio of the standard deviation of simulated streamflow over the standard deviation of observed streamflow giving the error in the variability and β is the ratio between the mean simulated streamflow and the mean observed streamflow giving the bias the kge ranges from to 1 with an ideal value at unity when all three components are equal to 1 gupta 2009 5 results 5 1 parameter optimization and uncertainty during the calibration of the ksathorfrac parameter we found that higher ksathorfrac values generally attenuate the magnitude of streamflow especially for peak flows and flatten their recession limbs with the same ksathorfrac value the ptf b parameter set produces daily streamflow with steeper peaks and more rapid recessions than the ptf c parameter set this is because ptf b presents more varying ksatver values with lower m values over the study area fig 3 resulting in less daily baseflow contribution the optimized ksathorfrac value for the upper gcpr basin is 550 for ptf b and 120 for ptf c the range of the simulated daily streamflows with the ksathorfrac values between 100 and 800 is more narrow for ptf b than for ptf c light colored bands in fig 6 indicating that ptf b introduces a smaller uncertainty in the streamflow results compared to ptf c with their optimized ksathorfrac values ptf b and ptf c deliver similar estimates of daily streamflow for both natural and regulated catchments as demonstrated by the colored lines in fig 6 and the goodness of fit indicators in table 5 ptf b outperforms ptf c in the natural catchments while ptf c performs better in the regulated catchments ptf b tends to result in higher α but smaller β compared to ptf c indicating a lower error in the variability less overestimating or underestimating the variability in daily streamflow but a larger bias more overestimating or underestimating the mean streamflow this is because ptf b captures the daily streamflow fluctuation and magnitudes of daily peak flows more accurately whereas ptf c is better at simulating daily baseflow as also visible in fig 6 5 2 model performance in natural catchments overall the wflow sbm model with the global data and seamless distributed parameter maps can reconstruct the observed daily streamflow for the natural catchments the daily hydrographs of the nan natural catchment fig 7 a and b and yom natural catchment fig 7 c and d show good fits in the peak timing and seasonal variability between the observed and simulated streamflows in both wet year 2006 and dry year 2013 table 5 indicates satisfactory model performance with the kge value in the validation period ranging between 0 63 and 0 65 for the nan natural catchment and 0 78 for the yom natural catchment apart from the spatial uncertainty in model parameters the varying model performances between the two catchments can be attributed to the difference in the catchment characteristics particularly the elevation and land cover a large part of the nan natural catchment is mountainous with forest areas as shown in figs 1 and 4 therefore its hydrological processes are more difficult to simulate compared to the yom natural catchment that is less steep with more grasslands the difficulty is caused by the higher amount and variability in precipitation which result in the higher and more fluctuating streamflow as also evident in table 2 as a result the peak flow magnitude in the nan natural catchment was five times higher than in the yom natural catchment in the wet year fig 7 a and c and nine times higher in the dry year fig 7 b and d for both catchments the model tends to underestimate peak flows in the rainy season especially at the beginning of the monsoon period and miss peak flows generated by local storm events in the dry season 5 3 model performance in regulated catchments the wflow sbm model with the rom shows varying performances when simulating the regulated streamflow for the sirikit and bhumibol catchments table 5 on the one hand the daily streamflow estimate for the sirikit catchment is passable with the highest kge of 0 43 ptf c in the validation period on the other hand the model failed to estimate the daily streamflow for the bhumibol catchment resulting in negative kge values in both calibration and validation periods the major sources of error for both catchments are the inflexibility of the daily reservoir releases and the prompt releases of surcharge water by the rom in the very wet periods as evidenced in fig 7 e g and h therefore the resulting accuracy for both reservoirs tends to be higher in the dry season than in the rainy season and higher in dry years than in wet years to elaborate the rom performance the daily water storage computed by the rom for the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs are compared to observations in fig 8 overall the simulated reservoir storage reasonably captures the inter and intra annual variability although the magnitude is not accurate the storage tends to be underestimated for the sirikit reservoir and overestimated for the bhumibol reservoir in very wet periods the storage is overestimated and exceeds the monthly target maximum top of gray band in fig 8 this occurred more often for the bhumibol reservoir than for the sirikit reservoir especially after the year 2003 as a result the goodness of fit of the simulated storage table 5 is significantly better for the sirikit reservoir highest kge 0 81 with ptf c than the bhumibol reservoir kge 0 59 for both ptf b and for ptf c due to the storage overestimation the rom released surcharge storage promptly according to eq 7 producing the unrealistic streamflow as appeared in 2006 fig 7 e and g although the observed daily storage of both reservoirs also exceeded the monthly target maximum in some wet years e g 1995 2006 and 2011 fig 8 most of observed surcharged water was allowed to stay in the reservoirs instead of being spilled at once therefore the observed peak outflow due to surcharge storage was not as huge as the outflow simulated by the rom fig 7 e h due to the limited flexibility of the rom it cannot capture the dynamics of the observed reservoir releases at the daily timescale however it does show satisfactory performance at the monthly timescale see the supplementary document 6 discussion 6 1 wflow sbm with global data and parameterization to our knowledge this is the first study that applied the wflow sbm model to simulate the daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin by setting up the model with global geospatial datasets e g srtm elevation forcing the model with global meteorological datasets mswep v2 p and earth2observe pet and applying the seamless parameter maps based on soilgrids globcover and other global databases e g modis lai we are able to circumvent the poor availability of in situ data often occurring in sea the seamless distributed parameter maps were applied to all but one sensitive soil related parameter ksathorfrac for which ptfs were unavailable imhoff et al 2020 although a full calibration procedure may improve the model performance calibrating only one parameter prevented overparameterization and equifinality as well as reduced the computational time when simulating such a large basin at high spatial and temporal resolutions the model sensitivity to the soil related parameter maps with different pedotransfer functions ptf b and ptf c became apparent due to the difference in the optimized ksathorfrac values 550 for ptf b and 120 for ptf c ksathorfrac controls horizontal saturated conductivity which influences the magnitude of the lateral subsurface flow and thus streamflow dynamics and recession after a peak fig 6 the parameter is therefore sensitive to the other soil related parameters particularly ksatver vertical saturated conductivity and m decay rate of ksatver see full description in table 3 ptf b and ptf c produced very different spatial values of ksatver and m as visible in fig 3 therefore we suggest calibrating ksathorfrac with respect to the selected ptf parameter set and study area furthermore calibrating the ksathorfrac based on soil types or elevation instead of calibrating it as a constant value may improve the model performance which can benefit the model application for the real time forecasting purpose although more computational efforts are demanded nevertheless the range of streamflows simulated with the ksathorfrac values of 100 800 is not very large especially for ptf b fig 6 therefore running the model without any calibration only introduces a little uncertainty which makes it possible to apply it in ungauged basins other sources of model uncertainty such as the meteorological geospatial and hydrological input data were not investigated in this study but could play a role in the model errors firstly the synthetic meteorological data from global databases are subject to their own spatial 10 km and temporal 3 hourly daily resolutions which were coarser than the target resolutions of the model 1 km and 3 hourly as a result the p data failed to present local storm events leading to the absence of local peak flows in dry seasons and in the beginning of rainy seasons for natural catchments fig 7 a d in a similar manner the quality of the pet data directly affects the actual evapotranspiration aet estimates but their accuracy was difficult to evaluate secondly the seamless distributed maps for the land cover related parameters were created based on the land cover database from the year 2009 fig 4 in fact the land cover in the upper gcpr basin has gradually changed over time with decreasing forest areas and increasing agricultural areas jamrussri and toda 2017 therefore assigning the land cover related parameters based on yearly land cover maps may improve the model results lastly quality of the observed streamflow data was unverified and could also affect the model performance evaluation to some extent considering the study purpose we conclude that the wflow sbm model with global data and parameterization is capable of simulating the daily streamflow for natural catchments fig 7 a d and table 5 but less effective for the regulated catchments due to limitations in the rom see section 6 2 for more detail in most study catchments the goodness of fit results were higher during the validation than during the calibration potentially because the short calibration period years 2010 2011 was both extremely wet and dry while the validation period years 1989 2013 excluding 2010 2011 also contained more regular hydrological conditions nonetheless the wflow sbm model outperforms the swat model that was run with observed daily meteorological data and fully calibrated for the same study area jamrussri and toda 2017 therefore it has potential to serve as a tool for the upper gcpr basin and other ungauged or data scarce catchments in sea 6 2 reservoir operation module reservoir operation modules with the target storage and release based methods usually require a large amount of data for an individual reservoir that may be undocumented or difficult to obtain particularly for data scarce areas like sea yassin et al 2019 found that even when the required data are available they usually contain considerable uncertainties so that optimizing operational parameters is still insufficient to represent the absolute storage release relationship for many reservoirs especially the multipurpose ones considering limited data available for the upper gcpr basin the rom was therefore designed to minimize the number of operational parameters and utilize accessible data without calibration fig 5 and table 4 which also allowed for investigating the data competence the main error in the rom results was the daily storage that exceeded the monthly target maximum in the rainy seasons fig 8 in response the surcharge water was promptly released by the rom causing unrealistic flood peaks fig 7 e g and h especially for the bhumibol reservoir meanwhile the observations showed that the daily storage also exceeded the monthly target maximum in some wet years however the surcharge was not released at once but was held and gradually released to prevent downstream floods in some occasions the daily releases were paused for a few days to control downstream floods this indicates the high flexibility of the actual reservoir operations on a day to day basis which could not be captured by the rom that is based on the monthly operating rule curves and piece wise linear regression algorithm this flexibility reflects real time decision making by dam operators to meet occasional targets such as mitigating floods satisfying downstream irrigation demands and increasing the hydropower generation yassin et al 2019 therefore the rom simulations in this study can be seen as the baseline operation scenario which reflects the generalized operations without further impacts of human intervention this baseline simulation is useful for analyzing effects of reservoir operations on downstream flows which is presented in a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 although the real time decision making is beyond the capability of the rom and other mathematical operation modules we suggest that the rom performance can still be upgraded in the future with i a more accurate storage calculation and ii a more complex release algorithm the storage calculation may be improved with the higher accuracy of daily reservoir inflows and direct aet losses computed by the wflow sbm model in this study the upstream inflows of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs were simulated as naturalized flows and indirectly validated with upstream flows since reliable reservoir inflow data are unavailable however there are four reservoirs located upstream of the bhumibol reservoir which have been operated since 2003 therefore the simulated inflows could be inaccurate although this was impossible to evaluate without reliable observed data this explains the storage overestimation for the bhumibol reservoir after 2003 fig 8 b meanwhile the inaccuracy of the daily aet could be partly due to simplification of the rom itself since the water surface area of each reservoir was set as a fixed value table 1 despite the daily storage change the amount of daily evaporating water could be under or overestimated therefore the reservoir area elevation storage relationship e g zhao et al 2016b may increase the accuracy of the daily aet losses and thus the daily storage estimated by the rom the main factor determining the release algorithm in the rom is the monthly target downstream water demand dd without existing data the dd of each reservoir was estimated as the long term monthly average of the reservoir outflow fig 5 which could be a source of significant uncertainty for the daily outflow simulation another limitation of this algorithm is that it intends to meet the target dd without considering the daily inflows e g thresholds for flooding normal and low inflows or maximum acceptable streamflow at downstream control points e g at nakhon sawan adding these factors into the outflow determination process e g zhao et al 2016b yassin et al 2019 may rectify the unrealistic surcharge releases in addition a release coefficient e g annual coefficients as a function of mean total annual inflow could introduce the inter annual release variability into the module hanasaki et al 2006 however more parameters also mean more uncertainty sources and thus their competence should be carefully assessed 6 3 human impacts on hydrological modeling and streamflow our findings are in substantial agreement with previous studies concluding that simulating the outflows of the sirikit and bhumibol reservoirs is challenging due to the complex patterns of real time decision making by dam operators neither target storage and release based methods nor inflow and demand based methods applied in the past could satisfactorily reconstruct the actual operations of these two reservoirs at the daily timescale e g hanasaki et al 2006 mateo et al 2014 yassin et al 2019 the recent study of yassin et al 2019 suggested that it was mainly due to the high ratio of the maximum reservoir storage and the mean total annual inflow of both reservoirs 0 5 indicating more radical regulations compared to many other reservoirs worldwide moreover since the outflows of the sirikit and bhimibol reservoirs conjugate at nakhon sawan it is likely that both reservoirs are jointly operated in real time to manage floods and droughts in the downstream floodplain as also reported during the 2011 gcpr flooding komori et al 2012 recently yang et al 2019 found that the data driven method artificial neural networks anns could learn the complex pattern of the observed reservoir outflow records and reproduce the daily outflow more accurately for both sirikit nse 0 93 and bhumibol reservoirs nse 0 86 therefore they can be useful tools for real time reservoir outflow simulation and forecasting however since anns are black boxes they cannot reveal the insights of real time decision making in the actual operations of the reservoirs which remain imperative for better and more sustainable reservoir water management in the future above all the unsatisfactory simulations of the reservoir outflows by the rom reflect the strong and prompt human intervention on daily streamflow in the areas that are at risks of floods and droughts like the upper gcpr basin and other basins in sea understanding of quantitative impacts of reservoir operations especially with real time decision making on downstream flows is essential therefore we further applied the developed model and results from this study to assess the effects of reservoir operations on the daily streamflow in the upper gcpr basin in a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 with deeper knowledge on both reservoir system modeling and reservoir effects we expect to be more capable of improving hydrological modeling and water resource management simultaneously 7 conclusion and outlook this study concerned the development of a 1 km resolution distributed hydrological model wflow sbm with global spatial data and parameterization and the exploration of its performance in estimating daily streamflow in the upper greater chao phraya river basin the main findings are as follows 1 the global data driven wflow sbm model can satisfactorily estimate daily streamflow in the natural catchments highest kge 0 78 in the validation period 2 the wflow sbm model was not able to estimate daily streamflow in regulated catchments very well due to the simplified algorithm of the reservoir operation module rom highest kge 0 43 in the validation period 3 the rom with the monthly operation rules can capture the seasonal variability of the reservoir storage and releases but cannot take into account real time decision making by dam operators the rom results therefore reflect the baseline operations without further impacts of human intervention 4 the difference between daily reservoir outflows from the baseline operation simulations and from the real time operation observations highlights the strong effect and importance of real time decision making to optimize the reservoir releases promptly especially during extreme events at the same time it also addresses the source of difficulties in modeling large scale multipurpose reservoirs a more complex module with optimized parameters may improve the results but uncertainties remain high 5 with rooms for improvements the proposed model can reasonably serve as a tool for analyzing catchment scale hydrological variations in the gcpr basin and provide an opportunity for streamflow estimation in other ungauged or data scarce basins in southeast asia based on the findings more studies on the use of seamless parameter maps based on global data for distributed hydrological modeling in other data scarce basins are encouraged effects of using different global meteorological datasets on the model performance should also be explored future challenges in the reservoir system modeling include gaining a better understanding of the complexity of the real time operations and improving the model performance for multipurpose reservoirs a companion paper wannasin et al 2021 describes the application of the global data driven wflow sbm model with the rom on investigating the reservoir operations and their effects on the daily flow regime in the same basin declaration of competing interest the authors

8269,study region oued fez morocco study focus urban catchments are heterogeneous in terms of land use and have both natural and artificial drainage networks modelling them is not a straightforward task especially in data scarce settings this study investigates network representation in hydrological modelling using field data collected between 2008 and 2018 on the oued fez catchment the road network is used as a proxy for the stormwater network two production functions scs 1972 and a linear reservoir are coupled to the lag and route transfer function three types of land use classes are used tests are carried out at hourly and 5 minute time steps using both the natural and modified drainage networks new hydrological insights for the region fifty three rainfall runoff events are monitored on the urban part of the catchment over the 2008 2018 period the highest rainfall values are recorded in 2008 2009 while the highest peak flow values are recorded in 2017 2018 this is due to stream channelisation and increased stormwater network coverage using the road network with minimal land use classes improves the model performance at both the hourly and 5 minute time steps keywords hydrological modelling flood events urbanisation distributed hydrological models athys oued fez catchment 1 introduction the complexity of urban catchments is a challenge for hydrological studies due to the presence of artificial drainage networks and the high spatial variability of the urban fabric in order to model such catchments these particularities need to be considered a significant number of studies have been carried out on urbanisation and its influence on the hydrological behaviour of urban catchments urban sprawl leads to fundamental disturbances in hydrological systems güneralp et al 2015 zambrano et al 2018 salvadore et al 2015 have indicated that drainage directions are often artificially modified on urban catchments and that this increases consequently the magnitude and frequency of floods urbanisation is also known to increase flow velocity runoff volume and reduce infiltration rates huang et al 2008 du et al 2012 fletcher et al 2013 miller et al 2014 xu and zhao 2016 habibi and seo 2018 other studies have focused on the impact of impervious surfaces on runoff generation palla and gnecco 2015 stated that land artificialisation through increased impervious surfaces promotes surface runoff segond et al 2007 have shown that on impervious areas a high proportion of rainfall becomes effective and produces runoff contrary to pervious areas in addition the time to peak of the flood hydrographs decreases and peak flow increases huang et al 2008 accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of urban catchments in hydrological modelling requires the use of high resolution data and complex spatially distributed hydrological models salvadore et al 2015 fatichi et al 2016 however complexity in the models does not guarantee a better performance pérez sánchez et al 2019 since complex models involve more parameters that may translate into a large number of parameters to be calibrated when limited observational data is available a high risk of overparameterisation may occur andréassian et al 2012 the challenge hence is to find this equilibrium since the 1970s many models have been developed to study the hydrological behaviour of urban catchments or to manage them zoppou 2000 rodriguez et al 2003 bach et al 2014 salvadore et al 2015 cristiano et al 2018 swmm huber and dickinson 1988 is one of the most documented ones and has been used in a number of studies barco et al 2008 krebs et al 2014 leandro and martins 2016 yao et al 2016 hydraulic models such as canoe insavalor sogreah 1997 and mike refsgaard and storm 1995 have also been used to model runoff lhomme et al 2004 hamouda and lahbassi 2012 these models spatial discretisation schemes account for the layout of the stormwater network most of these models represent the inlets and manholes as nodes and the conduits as segments schmitt et al 2004 rodriguez et al 2003 and 2008 chen et al 2018 the difference lies in the representation of the surface flow units some use triangular networks to discretise the streets schmitt et al 2004 crossroads paquier et al 2015 and buildings fewtrell et al 2008 leandro et al 2016 others use a semi distributed approach for surface flow including hydrological units cadastral parcels river elements and streets rodriguez et al 2003 and 2008 jankowfsky et al 2014 chen et al 2018 however the data needed to run these models is not always available in some developing and developed countries accurate maps of the stormwater and wastewater networks are not available chahinian et al 2019 hence some authors have also tried to adapt generic hydrological models to urban catchments perrin and bouvier 2004 lhomme et al 2006 bouvier et al 2018 aliyari et al 2019 these approaches are thought to be well adapted to large scale catchments and metropolitan areas especially in data scarce regions an important feature of distributed hydrological models is the drainage network and that of urban catchments has been the object of particular interest in the literature it is now established that urbanisation decreases dramatically the natural channel density graf 1977 meyer and wallace 2001 indeed in an attempt to control flows and allow urban development natural channels are often buried or covered and as such are no longer visible to the naked eye or reported on maps thus simply using drainage network extraction procedures based on digital terrain models o callaghan and mark 1984 tarboton et al 1991 might not be sufficient in addition urbanisation also leads to the development of artificial drainage networks which increase the overall drainage density graf 1977 by adding artificial links roads in particular are reported to increase drainage by providing new trajectories for surface water bannister 1979 concentrating flows and increasing their velocity shuster et al 2005 according to ogden et al 2011 the increases in drainage density particularly when moving from low values to middle and high values produce significant increases in the flood peaks however drainage density is reported to have an asymptotic behaviour and beyond a threshold value its influence is less on peak flow and runoff volume ogden et al 2011 kroczak and bryndal 2015 have shown that the incorporation of the road network improves flood simulation significantly these authors conclude that the spatial distribution of impervious surfaces has a marked effect on the hydrological response and emphasise the need to use a distributed model which allows the incorporation of detailed rainfall information as well as the imperviousness of the study zone oued fez is a perfect example of these urban catchments where the extent of urbanisation strongly impacts the hydrological response a number of studies lombard latune et al 2010 reynard et al 2013 akdim et al 2013 highlighted the particularity of the study area characterised by high spatial variability of rainfall and strong spatial heterogeneity of land use namely in the downstream part which is highly urbanised a first modelling attempt was carried out by lombard latune et al 2010 using a lumped model thus the representation and impact of the catchment s drainage network could not be assessed the objective of the work is to investigate network representation in hydrological modelling on urban catchments in data scarce contexts by using a distributed approach using a generic distributed hydrological model and the road network as a proxy for urban water networks tests are carried out using the natural drainage network and a modified drainage network that includes the road network with this aim two production functions and two parameterisation schemes are compared at hourly and five minute time steps after a brief description of the study area s characteristics and available data a detailed overview of the tested hydrological models will be given finally the main results will be presented analysed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 the oued fez catchment oued fez fig 1 a is a tributary of the sebou which is the largest river system in morocco covering a total area of 814 km2 this catchment is drained by a dense hydrographical network and has oued fez as its main tributary oued fez flows in an easterly direction from the karstic spring of ras el ma through the city of fez its main tributaries oueds boufekrane el mehraz and ain chkef pour into oued fez in the urban area and the river then flows into the sebou 4 km downstream of the city the catchment is considered urban since more than 10 of its area is located within the city of fez where the medina old city is heavily built up and represents the craft centre of the city lombard latune et al 2010 the catchment can be divided into two parts based on the predominant land use types natural karstic zones in the upstream part and urban in the downstream part in order to reduce flooding two dams have been constructed on the oued fez catchment the molay arafa dam was built on oued el mehraz in 1993 with a capacity of 0 60 mm3 the el gaada dam was built on oued boufekrane in 1991 with a capacity of 2 90 mm3 in addition a diversion channel with an evacuation capacity of 35 m3 s 1 was built to divert part of the water stored in the molay arafa dam to the el gaada dam metle 2020 the catchment is located on two groundwater systems a deep triassic aquifer and the shallow unconfined sais aquifer falling piezometric levels due to a combination of over exploitation and droughts have been reported for both since the end of the 1970s abhs 2005 the pedologic cover of the catchment is dominated by calcimagnesic soils and to a lesser extent by vertisols then by scattered alluvial soils bellarbi et al 2011 the prevailing climate is semi arid continental characterised by hot dry summers and cold wet winters in the absence of mean daily temperatures we used the mean monthly temperatures to estimate the mean annual temperature whose value is 16 9 c for the 1970 2011 period at the fez sais station for the same period the mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet is 863 mm year 1 using thornthwaite s method this method was chosen because it relies only on temperature data time series of annual and monthly rainfall from 1972 to 2015 44 years collected by the sebou river basin authority agence du bassin hydraulique de sebou abhs have been used to analyse annual and seasonal trends in rainfall five rain gauges for which long records are available are used for the study three of which are located on the oued fez catchment the remaining two are within the sebou catchment boundaries but outside our study area fig 1a the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 which is widely used to detect trends in time series of meteorological variables see a review in yue et al 2002 and kisi 2015 and is well adapted to study rainfall variation hamed 2008 tabari and talaee 2011 jain and kumar 2012 is used it is combined with sen s slope test sen 1968 to detect the magnitude of these trends the trend analysis has been carried out on all rain gauges at seasonal and yearly time steps since the lag 1 correlation showed no significant serial correlation the mann kendall test was used directly without the need for a pre whitening procedure the results fig 2 show that at the annual timescale the ifrane and immouzzer rain gauges which are located in the upstream part of the study area have a positive but statistically non significant trend at a significance level α of 5 p 0 05 going downstream a negative but statistically non significant trend p 0 05 can be observed for the sefrou sais and abhs stations similar trends were also identified for the winter season for all the rain gauges in the study area spring and summer have negative trends while autumn show a positive trend the magnitude of rainfall trends has also been characterised using sen s slope test table 1 an increase in annual rainfall at a rate of 0 40 mm year 1 is detected over the study period the rainy seasons autumn and winter are characterised by an increase in rainfall rates 2 71 and 0 25 mm year 1 respectively while a decrease in rainfall rates with values of 0 12 and 1 97 mm year 1 is observed for the summer and spring seasons the precipitation concentration index pci oliver 1980 is used to study the concentration of annual precipitation and its spatial variation over the entire study area de luis et al 2011 amiri and mesgari 2017 it is calculated at an annual timescale using the following equation 1 p c i annual i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 100 where pi refers to the monthly precipitation for month i l according to olivier 1980 pci values 10 indicate a low precipitation concentration i e uniform precipitation while pci 20 shows very high concentration and strong irregularity the results table 2 show that the oued fez catchment is characterised by an irregular distribution of precipitation with mean values of pci ranging from 16 to 19 the irregularity of the rainfall distribution increases when moving downstream the abhs and sais rain gauges located in the city of fez downstream part have higher values of pci 19 and 18 respectively while the rain gauges located in the upstream zone immouzzer sefrou and ifrane rain gauges have pci values of around 16 this increased irregularity of rainfall may be partly explained by the gradual increase in urbanisation urban development is lower in the upstream part of the catchment and higher in the downstream part where the city of fez is located this is known to have an impact on atmospheric dynamics at a local scale and to affect rainfall distribution salvadore et al 2015 consequently storms can be highly localised maier et al 2020 although there is no clear consensus on this issue most studies emphasise that urbanisation has an important impact on rainfall in terms of rainfall intensity and its spatial distribution for instance zhu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2007 concluded that urbanisation can potentially increase the precipitation intensity in mega cities such as beijing the effects of urbanisation on summertime precipitation were also assessed in osaka japan by shimadera et al 2015 who showed that urbanisation increased not only the precipitation intensity but also its duration furthermore liang and ding 2017 studied the effect of urbanisation on the long term variation of extreme precipitation over shanghai and showed that urbanisation increased the frequency and intensity of rainfall however the effect of urbanisation on the total amount of rainfall was found to be different and no conclusion could be drawn indeed while some authors found that urbanisation increased total rainfall shimadera et al 2015 liang and ding 2017 zhu et al 2019 others concluded that urbanisation decreased total rainfall guo et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 the different trends of total rainfall in urban areas could be attributed partly to the difficulty in separating atmospheric circulation and local topographic effects as most cities are located in different geographic and climatic conditions have different regional circulation and possibly have different urban aerosol emissions guo et al 2006 2 2 the experimental setting in the urban and peri urban sub catchment of oued fez the urban and peri urban sub catchment of oued fez covers an area of 397 km2 fig 1b since 2008 our team has collected discharge and rainfall data in this zone in september 2008 a stream gauge was installed at the catchment outlet the water level is automatically recorded every five minutes by means of a pressure transducer pdcr 1830 700 mbar druck and subsequently converted into discharge using a rating curve established by our research team over the 2008 2017 period three rating curves were established the first one was valid from 01 10 2008 to 30 11 2010 the second one from 30 11 2010 to 01 01 2014 and the last one has been valid since 01 01 2017 eight stream flow gauging campaigns were used to establish the first two rating curves which were obtained by fitting a second degree polynomial four campaigns were used to establish the third rating curve a full topographical survey was carried out as the river bed had been modified following works by the water agency note that at 0 90 m the gauging station is flooded the third rating curve was established using the baratin method le coz et al 2013 which has the advantage of taking into account the hydraulic controls of the cross section and producing uncertainty estimates due to the stage graphs and the parameters of the function used to fit the rating curve the last measured stage value for the current rating curve is 0 57 m corresponding to a discharge value of 0 57 m3 s 1 when disregarding all sources of errors the last extrapolated stage value is 0 71 m corresponding to a discharge value of 2 87 m3 s 1 a monitoring network composed of four rain gauges has been gradually implemented in the urban part of oued fez rainfall is measured by means of tipping bucket 0 20 mm rain gauges note that for the 2008 2009 period rainfall was recorded at 12 minute intervals by fst fez s physics department for the rain gauges implemented later rainfall was measured at 5 minute intervals fig 3 shows hourly streamflow series from 2008 to 2018 an important variability of streamflow especially in terms of peak flows can be observed note that no flows were recorded between january and april 2010 as our gauging station was flooded the water agency also undertook works in the river bed and the discharge measurements were suspended between 2014 and 2016 higher mean flows were recorded during the 2008 2009 period which was exceptionally wet and characterised by a high number of rainy days in terms of peak flow the 2017 2018 period has the highest values 2008 2009 can be considered as an intermediate period while 2011 2012 has the lowest values of peak flow the high values observed for the 2017 2018 period can be explained mainly by the fact that since 2014 several portions of the oued fez el mehraz and ain chkef rivers have been canalised flow conditions have also been impacted by the implementation of a new wastewater treatment plant in fez in 2014 the station has a treatment capacity of 1 2 m eqh and a daily discharge of 155400 m3 up to its construction all of the city s sewage was flushed directly into the river koukkal et al 2004 perrin et al 2014 the temporal dynamics of the effluent discharge was assessed by gauging a sewage canal located to the right of the gauging station located on oued fez this canal was originally built as part of a wastewater pre treatment facility and was used to convey water to a small hydro electric plant nowadays it flows into the fez wastewater treatment plant but may overflow occasionally the results of our gauging campaign on september 15th 2010 an ordinary working day showed that wastewater discharge in the canal increased from 1 06 m3 s 1 at 07 45 a m to 1 76 m3 s 1 at 10 13 a m reached a maximum value of 1 95 m3 s 1 at 2 40 p m and remained at 18 40 m3 s 1 at 4 40 p m note that wastewater dynamics may vary during the ramadan period when water and food consumption is prohibited until fast breaking time and at the height of the touristic season the temporal dynamics may also be assessed using oued fez s discharge time series on rainless days using a baseflow separation method eckhardt 2008 stewart 2015 however in order to quantify it accurately the discharge of the springs that flow into oued fez should be subtracted and we do not have this information before 2009 the wastewater network consisted mainly of combined sewers with a total length of 2050 km the circular pipes had diameters ranging between 300 and 1600 mm while the ovoids had heights ranging between t100 and t240 amarti riffi 2013 between 2010 and 2016 the stormwater coverage improved and is now over 99 muat 2016 currently stormwater overflows occur only when the wastewater treatment plant is out of service despite our best efforts we could not get quantifiable data on the updated network namely a map detailing its layout and attributes hence we could not use a hydraulic model to specifically model the water flow in the pipes and sewer overflows we had to resort to a simpler modelling approach and use the street network as a proxy for the stormwater network our hypothesis is that as per design rules both networks are laid either under the pavement or the road thus we could indirectly account for the flow dynamics and different travel times our study focuses on rainfall runoff events not all four rainfall gauges were operational over the study period this was due to the gradual deployment of the monitoring network and to equipment breakdown thereby a strict quality control procedure was conducted by considering the breakdown periods and removing outlier values we retained a threshold of 6 mm for rainfall events and a time gap of 30 min to separate two consecutive events through this operation 53 flood events corresponding to three periods were chosen for rainfall runoff modelling table 3 the 2008 2009 period this period includes 17 flood events rainfall varies between 6 and 40 2 mm maximum rainfall intensity at an hourly time step ranges from 3 24 to 13 1 mm h 1 45 6 144 mm h 1for dt 12 min and discharge from 1 5 to 44 m3 s 1 the 2011 2012 period this period includes 16 flood events total rainfall varies between 8 2 mm and 31 3 mm maximum rainfall intensity at an hourly time step varies between 2 5 and 10 2 mm h 1 4 5 and 56 4 mm h 1 for dt 5 min and discharge from 3 5 to 8 m3 s 1 the 2017 2018 period 20 flood events were recorded during the third period using all four rainfall gauges total rainfall varies between 7 0 and 29 6 mm maximum rainfall intensity at an hourly step varies between 2 3 and 7 6 mm h 1 5 7 and 36 6 mm h 1 for dt 5 min and discharge between 7 9 and 38 7 m3 s 1 of the events in our sample 1 occurred in the summer the most important flood events in terms of runoff depth and peak flow are recorded in winter to investigate the catchment s hydrological behaviour and signature we investigated the rainfall runoff relationship mcmillan et al 2017 addor et al 2018 hydrological signatures may be calculated based on a variety of data sources but in practice they are usually based on discharge time series addor et al 2018 since we only have streamflow measurements and simulations at the catchment outlet we have carried out a comparison on the rainfall runoff relationships between 2008 2012 and 2017 2018 in order to determine the hydrological similarity or changes across the two periods the results presented in fig 4 show a linear relationship with a good correlation between rainfall and observed runoff for the flood events of the 2008 2012 period r2 0 74 by contrast there is no linear relationship or correlation between rainfall and observed runoff for the flood events belonging to the 2017 2018 period r2 0 17 this change may be due to the increasing imperviousness caused by urban development channelisation of watercourses and the extension of drainage networks guan et al 2016 wang et al 2020 which leads to a flash runoff response to rainstorms burns et al 2005 and an increase of total runoff wang et al 2020 namely during uniform low intensity rainfall events guan et al 2016 for instance the events of 22 10 2008 and 12 04 2018 both occurring in wet conditions had maximum rainfall intensities of 6 20 and 6 mm h 1 respectively and produced 534 mm and 914 mm of runoff for total rainfall values and durations of the same order of magnitude the decrease of r² could have been caused by greater uncertainty on higher runoff values due to measurement errors and the extrapolation of the rating curve however we do not think that is the case in this study since the highest rainfall runoff and peak flow values all events considered were recorded during the 2008 2009 period 2 3 the models the athys modelling platform http www athys soft org bouvier and delclaux 1996 was chosen for this work it is a spatially distributed hydrological modelling platform which includes several production functions that assimilate the soil to a linear reservoir the reservoir is fed through infiltrated rain and the drainage losses represent both evaporation and percolation a portion of the drainage losses may contribute to sub surface flow fig 5 a a literature review of the available models in the athys platform was carried out in order to identify the ones most adapted to the urban and semi arid nature of the catchment another important consideration was the data available on the study zone since we did not have access to data on the soils hydrodynamic properties we had to resort to empirical models in addition given the fact that runoff is mainly due to hortonian overland flow on this catchment we could not use tomodel beven and kirkby 1979 franchini et al 1996 beven 1997 which assumes saturation excess flow as a result two production functions scs and a variable runoff coefficient function were selected and combined with the lag route transfer function their main work hypotheses are detailed in the sections below 2 3 1 the scs production function the first production function is the scs soil conservation service usda 1972 which has been widely used due to its simplicity in estimating the amount of rainfall contributed to the runoff michaud and sorooshian 1994 hughes 1994 tramblay et al 2010a 2010b in addition it is well adapted to different types of flood generation processes steenhuis et al 1995 and is still used to analyse the impact of urbanisation on runoff li et al 2018 the scs function gives an empirical relation between the depth of excess precipitation or direct runoff r t and the depth of precipitation p t after runoff begins chahinian et al 2005 in the athys modelling platform on each cell the instantaneous version of the scs model gaume et al 2004 is used to divide rainfall into infiltrated accumulated rain 2 r t i t p t 0 2 s p t 0 8 s 2 p t 0 2 s p t 0

of a single linear reservoir and draws its name from the fact that it is the third reservoir model of the athys environment and is referenced under this name in the graphical user interface the model

into account storage reservoirs such as lakes and dams since the transfer of the effective rainfall produced by each cell to the outlet is added individually 2 4 sensitivity analysis of the selected models a basic sensitivity analysis was carried and two parameters were found to be sensitive for scs lr and three for reservoir3 lr table 4a and 4b the methodology consists in running simulations while modifying the set parameter values by 25 50 and 75 as carried out in fleischmann et al 2018 and samadi et al 2019 the event of 01 05 2011 with a reference set of parameters for scs lr s 35 mm w 0 20 ds 4 day 1 v0 2 90 m s 1 and k0 0 70 and reservoir3 lr sto 30 mm inf 2 mm h 1 w 0 20 ds 4 day 1 v0 2 70 m s 1 and k0 0 70 was chosen for the sensitivity test only one parameter per run was tested and the remaining ones were set to fixed values throughout the runs the sensitivity results for model parameters with regard to runoff volume vr and peak flows qp for scs lr and reservoir3 lr are presented in table 4a and 4b it can be seen that for scs lr s has the greatest influence on the runoff volume and peak flow as a 25 increase in parameter s induces 21 and 63 variation on these variables respectively the same increase in parameter ds induces 3 variation in volume and 4 in peak flow while for parameter ω the variation is by 22 and 11 respectively note that setting ω 0 would lead to no drainage uptake while ω 1 would lead to total drainage uptake the parameters of the transfer function have a slight impact on the volume but a greater influence on the peak flow in this regard v0 is more sensitive than k0 a 25 decrease in both induces 3 variation in volume and 36 in peak flow for v0 and respectively 1 and 8 for k0 the results of the sensitivity analysis of the scs lr model are in accordance with those of nguyen and bouvier 2019 for the reservoir3 lr model table 4b of all the parameters of the production function sto has the greatest impact on the peak flow a 25 decrease in the value of sto induces 16 variation in the simulated peak flow ω and ds yield important variations in volume since they control reservoir drainage and uptake a 25 decrease in ω yields 24 variation in the volume and 12 in the peak flow however on impervious surfaces the possibility of drainage uptake is slim the results for the transfer function remain unchanged i e v0 is more sensitive than k0 based on the sensitivity analysis results it was decided to calibrate s and v0 for the scs lr model and sto and v0 for the reservoir3 lr model since we had no prior knowledge of the value of the parameter inf we resorted to calibrating it as well the remaining parameters were set to ω 0 ds 4 day 1 and k0 0 70 2 5 the parametrisation schemes 2 5 1 extracting the drainage network the advanced land observing satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar radiometric terrain correction alos palsar rtc https asf alaska edu data sets sar data sets alos palsar high resolution digital elevation model dem with a 12 5 metre resolution is used to generate the natural drainage network using athys s in built extraction procedure alos palsar was selected because several studies found it to perform better than other open source dems ali et al 2012 courty et al 2019 ngula niipele and chen 2019 the dem is first resampled at 10 m spatial resolution and then used to determine the natural drainage network using the d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 tarboton et al 1991 built into athys once pits are removed the drainage direction of each cell is determined based on the steepest slope and the flow accumulation is calculated the network corresponding to a 10 ha flow accumulation threshold is extracted and corrected using the 1 25000 scale topographic maps this drainage network will be referred to as natural drainage nd a map of the street network is used to force the drainage directions along the motorways the street network is really dense in the old medina and fez jedid sectors with very narrow pedestrian streets that cannot be mapped correctly at the scale we worked at hence we used the road network i e streets that could be travelled by motor vehicles this network was burned into the dem by reducing the elevation of the cells on which this artificial network is located as carried out by rodriguez et al 2000 and gironas et al 2010 and a new drainage network was extracted this drainage network will be referred to as the modified drainage network md fig 6 note that the model is fully gridded with independent cells i e each cell produces an elementary hydrograph by modifying the drainage directions the distance to the outlet or length lk and the upstream drained area by the cell will be modified fig 7 however since we use the simple formulation of the transfer function eq 9 only the change in distance will directly impact our results the simple formulation is not impacted by the changes in slope value either when comparing the distributions of lk for both drainage models fig 7 it can be seen that by adding the road network new shorter connections are created resulting in a decrease of the maximum lk value from 1066 m nd to 866 m md and a shift in the median lk value which moves from 583 m to 444 m the 1st and 3rd quantiles are also lower 270 m and 607 m for md as opposed to 368 m and 775 m for nd 2 5 2 spatial discretisation in order to represent the effect of urbanisation on runoff generation we have divided the urban area of the oued fez catchment into production classes based on land use fig 1b two land use maps were created using google earth images from 2008 and 2017 the first one was used for the 2008 2012 period and the second one for the 2017 2018 period the urban sprawl corresponds to a total area of 7 80 km2 and is mostly concentrated in the peri urban area located in the southern part of the catchment namely around the districts of ain chkef and ouled tayeb fig 1b according to official sources the development of ain chkef has increased by 0 33 between 2007 and 2014 and 40 of the housing in ouled tayeb was built after 2009 matnuhpv 2019 hence the potential errors in land use type for the 2011 2012 events do not concern the more densely built areas whose limits have been stable throughout the study period but rather the peri urban areas whose impervious surfaces may be over estimated between 2008 and 2012 the building permits granted by the state amounted to a total built area of 1 10 km2 excluding roads built by the government haut commissariat au plan 2020 hence by using the 2008 land use maps for the 2011 2012 events the value of parameter s might be over estimated for these plots we started with six classes and after some primary tests decided to reduce them to three as a compromise between over parametrisation and representativeness this is in accordance with jakeman and hornberger 1993 who assume that five parameters should be sufficient to reproduce hydrological processes of course the number of parameters for accurate representation of the hydrological processes is model based and high capacity computers nowadays remove some of the limitations that were common in the early days of distributed hydrological modelling however hydrological systems are highly non linear with threshold effects on catchments with limited data it would still be difficult to correctly calibrate a large number of parameters without getting into equifinality problems the three classes are the za class corresponds to agricultural and natural areas the zu class corresponds to urban areas formed by isolated dwellings or buildings the zud class corresponds to densely urbanised areas such as the old medina and aouinat el hajaj districts for each model three sets of parameters corresponding to the three land use classes are calibrated for the production function table 5 the parameters to be calibrated are s for the scs model and inf and sto for the reservoir3 model for both models ω and ds are set to default values of 0 and 4 day 1 for the transfer function parameter v0 is calibrated and k0 is set to 0 70 two values of v0 are calibrated one using the natural drainage network nd and one using the modified drainage network md calibration is carried out using the model s in built automatic calibration procedure based on the simplex algorithm on each event of the calibration set independently rainfall is interpolated using thiessen polygons no rainfall and runoff data are available on the upstream part of the catchment which is mostly rural anyway given its karstic nature we assumed that this zone s direct contribution to the runoff at the catchment outlet is insignificant at the event time scale mean duration 880 min it contributes mainly through springs which already pour into the river network and are accounted for indirectly this assumption will have to be revised in the future in light of new experimental data 2 6 model calibration and validation the coupled scs lr and reservoir3 lr models of the athys platform are tested on the peri urban and urban parts of oued fez in event based mode at hourly and sub hourly time steps the split sample test procedure klemeš 1986 is used and the flood events recorded over the entire study period are divided into two sets randomly the first one is used to calibrate the models parameters while the second one is used to verify the reproducibility of the results and to assess the representativeness of the calibrated parameter sets validation the median value of the calibrated parameters is used to simulate the events of the validation set the nash and sutcliffe efficiency measure nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to assess the models ability to reproduce the observed flood hydrographs in addition the rmse is used to quantify the errors on peak flows and runoff volumes 11 n s e 1 i 1 n q s i m i q o b s i 2 i 1 n q s i m i q o b s 2 12 r m s e i 1 n v s i

and 6b present the median values of the calibrated parameters at hourly time steps it can be seen that the maximum retention capacity of the soil reservoir s for the scs lr model and the reservoir capacity sto for the reservoir3 lr model are variable the minimum values of s are obtained for the zud class which corresponds to densely urbanised areas this suggests that densely urbanised areas are highly impervious and infiltration is very low the maximum values are obtained for the za class which corresponds to agricultural areas characterised by a high infiltration capacity the median parameter values are nearly double those of the urban areas i e in comparison with agricultural areas retention is reduced by a factor of two in urban areas we can further observe that the median values of both s and sto when using a modified drainage network are slightly lower than those obtained when using a natural network this can be explained by the fact that taking into account urbanisation has contributed to an increase in surface runoff and a decrease in infiltration capacity as highlighted also by several studies such as miller et al 2014 and xu and zhao 2016 table 7a and 7b present the median values of the calibrated parameters at 5 minute time steps it shows similar trends to those found when calibrating events at an hourly time step i e the minimum values of the production parameters s and sto correspond to the heavily urbanised areas while agricultural areas are characterised by the highest values the optimal values of the inf parameter for the reservoir3 model are also lowest for the densely urbanised area class zud and highest for the agricultural zones class za furthermore no correlation was found between the calibrated values of parameter s and the classical previous 5 day antecedent rainfall at both time steps at the hourly time step r2 0 05 for s za and r2 0 01 s zu for the scs lrn model and r2 0 02 and r2 0 01 for the scs lrm model at the 5 minute time step r2 0 14 for s za and r2 0 17 s zu for the scs lrn model and r2 0 16 for s za and r2 0 12 for s zu for scs lrm the maximum velocity reached at the outlet v0 is characterised by a slight inter event variation as also highlighted by laganier et al 2014 who indicated that the v0 values are variable but consistent with the commonly observed velocities by analysing the calibrated values of the v0 parameter it can be seen that the minimum values are obtained for low intensity events while high intensity events were characterised by the greatest values we further investigated parameter changes across time periods for both time steps tables 6a 6b and 7a 7b a decrease in the s and sto parameter values and an increase in the v0 parameter values can be observed between 2011 2012 and 2017 2018 these changes are thought to be due to an increase in the channelisation of the hydrographic network as well as an increase in the urbanisation of the catchment 3 1 evaluation of the models performance at different time steps 3 1 1 calibration phase the investigation of the models performance is based on the nash and sutcliffe criterion nse is presented in fig 8 the boxplots represent the distribution of the criterion for the hourly data 2008 2018 26 events and 5 minute time steps 2011 2018 data 17 events they indicate that the results of the simulations are not spread out at the hourly time step the median nse values range between 0 73 and 0 85 and the percentage of events having nse 0 6 varies from 84 to 88 thus the models performance can be considered satisfactory when comparing the ranking of the four models it can be seen that the scs lrm model is the most appropriate for the calibration database while the reservoir3 lrn model shows a lower performance and has the lowest nse median values flood event simulations at a finer time scale 5 min were also carried out using flood events recorded during the 2011 2018 periods the results indicate that all four models are able to reproduce the flood hydrographs correctly the median nse ranges between 0 51 and 0 69 for the scs lrm 77 of the events have nse 0 6 the percentage drops to 65 for reservoir3 lrm and 53 for scs lrn the lowest values are those of reservoir3 lrn with 47 similarly to the results obtained at the hourly time step scs lrm outperforms the other three models the determination coefficient r2 and the rmse were used to judge the models performance in terms of the runoff volume and peak flow restitution the linear regressions between the observed and simulated flood events in terms of runoff volumes and peak flow are presented in fig 9 a and b a good correspondence can be seen between the observed and simulated runoff volumes for all tested models at the hourly time step fig 9a with r2 varying between 0 97 and 0 98 and rmse between 0 16 and 0 25 in terms of peak flow a good agreement can be noticed also between the two hydrographs with r2 varying between 0 88 and 0 93 and rmse between 0 18 and 0 23 at the 5 minute time step fig 9b and table 8 the r2 and rmse values drop slightly for both volume 0 94 to 0 97 and 0 22 to 0 32 respectively and peak flow 0 78 to 0 93 and 0 23 to 0 42 visual comparison of the simulated and observed hydrographs see examples in fig 10 a and b also shows a good agreement 3 1 2 validation phase the median values of the calibrated parameters at different time steps 60 and 5 min are used to simulate the validation events note that for the 5 minute time step only the 19 flood events recorded during the 2011 2012 and 2017 2018 periods are used based on the nse criterion the models performance is degraded at the hourly time step the median nse values range between 0 39 and 0 56 save for scs lrn and reservoir3 lrn the models give the same performance at the 5 minute time step with the median nse values varying between 0 27 and 0 57 fig 8 at the hourly time step the models ranking remains unchanged 45 of the flood events simulated by the scs lrm model have an nse value 0 6 the percentage drops to 34 for reservoir3 lrn and rises to 37 for reservoir3 lrm the models ranking is unchanged at the 5 minute time step for scs lrm 47 of events have an nse 0 6 42 for reservoir3 lrm 35 for scs lrn and 12 for reservoir3 lrn similar performances are obtained when looking at the runoff volume and peak flow simulation at both time steps fig 9 and table 8 at the hourly time step the r2 and rmse for the runoff volume range between 0 23 to 0 37 and 58 to 0 63 and between 0 19 to 0 41 and 0 53 to 0 69 respectively for peak flow for the 5 minute time step they drop to 0 13 to 0 69 and 0 31 to 0 87 respectively for volume and 0 17 to 0 50 and 0 45 to 0 61 for peak flow the performance is slightly degraded in both calibration and validation when reducing the modelling time step fig 9b ficchi et al 2016 found similar results and stated that although the performance of the tested model was greatly improved when changing from a 1 day to a 6 h time step a reverse trend was found when decreasing the time step from 1 h to 6 min the same study showed that reducing the time step has the opposite effect under high flow conditions this finding is consistent with our results as the rainfall runoff events simulated at the 5 minute time step are characterised by higher flow conditions than those modelled at an hourly time step the models capacity to reproduce the catchment s hydrological response was assessed by analysing the relationship between rainfall and simulated runoff for all events fig 11 this analysis was carried out at an hourly time step to be able to use the largest available dataset it can be seen that the linear relationship is correctly reproduced for the 2008 2011 events with slightly higher values for the correlation coefficient 0 81 r2 0 85 and save for the reservoir3 lrm model similar values for the slope of the regression line 0 20 a 0 22 the non linear relationship of the 2017 2018 events is also reproduced with even lower values for the correlation coefficient 0 07 r2 0 23 all criteria and time steps considered the models performance in validation is poor the models lack of robustness is increased by the change in the rainfall runoff relationship on the catchment fig 4 throughout the study period on the one hand 2008 2009 was an exceptionally wet year annual rainfall of 810 mm vs 523 mm for 2017 2018 and on the other the flow conditions on the catchment were modified as highlighted by the experimental data fig 4 and the observations made in the field regarding the extension of the stormwater and wastewater networks by calibrating and validating the models within and not across the periods i e using the median of the parameters for each period better results are obtained at the hourly time step the median nse values range between 0 61 and 0 74 and at the 5 minute time step between 0 48 and 0 62 3 2 effect of rain gauge network density and rainfall event type on the models performance the modelling results were further investigated to highlight any possible effect of the rain gauge network density on the models performance the rainfall events were divided into two groups single gauge events i e events recorded when only a single rain gauge was implemented and multiple gauge events i e events recorded when two or more rain gauges were implemented the analysis was only carried out at the hourly time step because our database did not contain any single gauge events at the 5 minute time step and only 5 events for which rainfall was measured using two gauges when examining the models results based on the rain gauge density using the nse criterion it was found that for the calibration phase all the tested models reproduce the observed hydrographs well when rainfall information is provided by two or four rain gauges fig 12 a the median nse value of the four models ranges between 0 62 and 0 72 for the events where rainfall information is obtained using a single gauge and between 0 74 and 0 89 when using multiple rain gauges the results are poorer for the validation phase where the models performance is lower for the events where the rainfall information was provided by multiple rain gauges however this is not thought to be due to the rainfall information but rather to the models lack of robustness and overall poor performance in validation as can be seen in table 3 all the events for which rainfall information is provided by a single rain gauge belong to the 2008 2012 period while nearly all the events for which rainfall information is provided by multiple rain gauges belong to the 2017 2018 period thus the median values of the calibrated parameters converge towards the optimum values of the 2008 2012 period which constitutes 65 of the total number of events in our database we further wanted to investigate the influence of the rainfall type we used the 75th and 25th percentiles value of total rainfall to separate the events all events where the total rainfall was below the 25th percentile were considered as low rainfall events and those where the total rainfall was above the 75th percentile were considered as high rainfall events the results at the hourly time step fig 12b both in calibration and validation indicate that the selected models are able to reproduce the high rainfall events 0 72 nse median 0 78 and perform less well on low rainfall events 0 63 nse median 0 89 the findings are similar at the 5 minute time step despite the lower nse thresholds i e 0 54 nse 0 72 for high rainfall events as opposed to low rainfall events 0 27 nse 0 54 note that nse is known to be more sensitive to high flow values tegegne et al 2017 4 discussion the analysis of the calibrated parameters at the hourly time step indicates that the median values of parameter s for urban areas is 28 mm using the scs lrn model and 26 mm for the scs lrm model these results are in the same range as those reported by bouvier et al 2018 on the ouagadougou metropolitan area the s values calibrated for the agricultural zones are consistent with those of laganier et al 2014 who identified similar variation trends on the predominantly rural anduze catchment 108 s 408 mm the values of the transfer parameter v0 however are slightly higher than those obtained by tramblay et al 2010a 2010b laganier et al 2014 and coustau et al 2012 they are in the same order of magnitude as those obtained by tramblay et al 2011 who showed that v0 tends to increase when using uniform rainfall as opposed to when using spatially distributed rainfall inputs arnaud et al 2002 also indicate that the calibration of rainfall runoff models is impacted by uniform rainfall our results show that the median vo value for the tested models varies between 3 24 m s 1 and 4 m s 1 when the rainfall information comes from one rain gauge and ranges between 3 11 m s 1 and 3 50 m s 1 when the rainfall is provided by four rain gauges these values can also be partly explained by the urban nature of our catchment v0 has slightly higher values when using the modified drainage network md as input for the reservoir3 model than when using the natural drainage network nd at both time steps this can be explained by the configuration of the modified drainage md by adding the road network shorter connections are created between the cells and the distances to the outlet lk are decreased fig 7 in order to maintain the same routing time tm the velocity vk will have to slightly increase when analysing the v0 values it can be noticed that the flood events that belong to the 2017 2018 period are characterised by relatively high v0 values compared to those calibrated for events belonging to the 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 periods this is mainly due to the fact that several waterways have been canalised since 2014 ain smen oued el mehraz ain chkef it should however be noted that the fez wastewater treatment plant was built in 2014 and until its construction the combined sewer outflows as well as the stormwater outflows poured directly into the river since 2017 the situation has changed and the higher velocity values may be due to these changes despite measures taken to overcome the risk of overparameterisation the latter may partly explain the relatively lower performance of the reservoir3 lr model as compared to scs lr as the number of calibrated parameters for the first model was 5 against 4 for the second one the use of more calibrated parameters may increase the hydrological modelling uncertainty her et al 2019 and explain the drop in performance during the validation phase arsenault et al 2018 unfortunately we did not have access to additional discharge data to calibrate the models spatially and given the layout of the river network i e unstable cross sections canalised inaccessible underground reaches and the high exposure of the material to theft in some sectors we could not implement additional intermediate gauging stations this study showed that the tested models performance was higher when rainfall information is provided from multiple rain gauges which suggests that an additional knowledge of spatial rainfall variability has the potential to improve the models performance pechlivanidis et al 2009 reached similar conclusions and noted that the reproduction of flood events could be affected if the spatial variability of rainfall is not well represented arnaud et al 2002 also reported similar results in mexico city as did emmanuel et al 2015 on the gardon d anduze catchment southern france or ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 on catchments located in belgium france the netherlands and the uk albeit using urban drainage models gires et al 2012 and bruni et al 2015 also highlighted the sensitivity of the model outputs to the spatial variability of rainfall the optimal coverage needed for the oued fez catchment is an open question as implementing rain gauges in the western part of the catchment is not feasible at present due to the presence of sensitive installations considering the results of the calibration and validation phases at either hourly or 5 minute time steps it is clear that using the modified drainage network i e forcing drainage directions along the road network and using production classes according to the urbanisation level ensures better performance than when using the natural drainage network additionally scs lr seems to perform better than reservoir3 lr this is true in calibration and validation and at both time steps thus even a minimal representation of the urban nature of the catchment through modified drainage directions and production classes based on the degree of urbanisation seems to yield better results this solution was implemented because we did not have access to a map of the stormwater network and the approach proved to be effective and well adapted to the complex configuration of the oued fez catchment it might be useful elsewhere as well however when working on water quality a separate representation of the stormwater and wastewater networks might be necessary as flow and in situ environmental conditions induce bio chemical transformations that impact solute and particular pollutant fluxes chebbo and gromaire 2004 andrés doménech et al 2018 in some west african cities e g bamako and ouagadougou where open air channels are used for stormwater field surveys may be carried out to get their geometrical and hydraulic characteristics in cities like fez where the vast majority of these networks are underground alternative solutions relying on geophysical methods and probabilistic methods may be needed bilal et al 2018 using the simple formulation of the lag and route model without interactive cells also has its limitations the first is that using independent cells would not allow the calculation of discharge values at sub catchment or street level this would make the use of such models limited in urban flooding and inundation studies however it is also true that using a simple formulation that relies only on distance makes the transfer function less sensitive to errors on slope values a common problem in flat environments in this application we used a fully gridded model if the model s structure had been based on hydrological units and river network segments such as in swat arnold and fohrer 2005 or modspa moussa et al 2007 the drainage network s layout would have varied based on the upstream drained area threshold in our configuration the network is already dense since all the cells are taken into account when calculating the discharge an alternative would have been to use higher resolution maps where the river network is more densely represented to correct the drainage directions but such maps were not available for oued fez in addition many portions of the catchment are urban stream deserts napieralski et al 2015 i e areas where surface stream channels are not visible because they have been buried or covered by urban development and as such would likely not be reported on maps this is a major concern for urban catchments as it contributes to the difficulty in defining the hydrographic network 5 conclusion this study has presented an attempt at drainage network representation for distributed hydrological modelling on urban catchments where the layout of the stormwater network is not available a case study is presented on the oued fez catchment using two hydrological models of the athys platform in event based mode at hourly and 5 minute time steps original discharge data recorded at one streamflow gauge and rainfall data recorded at 1 4 rain gauges depending on the study period are used to calibrate and validate the selected models our findings show that the approach adopted to take into account the urban configuration of the oued fez catchment by modifying the drainage directions and by differentiating runoff production according to urbanisation improves the performance of the hydrological models in addition comparison of the models in terms of performance shows that the scs lr model reproduces the flood hydrographs better than the reservoir3 lr model regardless of the drainage network and the time step used although a slight degradation of the models performance is noted for the sub hourly time step our results show that when a map of the stormwater network is not available modellers might use the road network as a proxy to simulate flow at the catchment outlet however for water quality studies this approach might be too limited as in situ transformations would not be accounted for and contaminant flux calculations would be impacted thus an accurate representation of the stormwater and wastewater networks is still necessary by using a fully gridded model where all the cells are used for flow routing the river network s layout does not vary based on the upstream drained area threshold and thus the modelling results are not impacted by this feature however they are prone to uncertainties related to the difficulty in delineating the hydrographic network of urban catchments which are sometimes buried or covered by urban development in addition using the simple formulation of the lag and route model without interactive cells does not allow discharge calculations at sub catchment or street level this would make the use of such models too limited for urban flooding and inundation studies however since a simple formulation relies only on the distance to the outlet it is less sensitive to errors in slope values a common problem in flat environments nevertheless additional discharge data would be necessary to calibrate the models spatially and to identify the hydrological processes that may need to be accounted for in more specific conceptual models funding this work was supported by

8269,study region oued fez morocco study focus urban catchments are heterogeneous in terms of land use and have both natural and artificial drainage networks modelling them is not a straightforward task especially in data scarce settings this study investigates network representation in hydrological modelling using field data collected between 2008 and 2018 on the oued fez catchment the road network is used as a proxy for the stormwater network two production functions scs 1972 and a linear reservoir are coupled to the lag and route transfer function three types of land use classes are used tests are carried out at hourly and 5 minute time steps using both the natural and modified drainage networks new hydrological insights for the region fifty three rainfall runoff events are monitored on the urban part of the catchment over the 2008 2018 period the highest rainfall values are recorded in 2008 2009 while the highest peak flow values are recorded in 2017 2018 this is due to stream channelisation and increased stormwater network coverage using the road network with minimal land use classes improves the model performance at both the hourly and 5 minute time steps keywords hydrological modelling flood events urbanisation distributed hydrological models athys oued fez catchment 1 introduction the complexity of urban catchments is a challenge for hydrological studies due to the presence of artificial drainage networks and the high spatial variability of the urban fabric in order to model such catchments these particularities need to be considered a significant number of studies have been carried out on urbanisation and its influence on the hydrological behaviour of urban catchments urban sprawl leads to fundamental disturbances in hydrological systems güneralp et al 2015 zambrano et al 2018 salvadore et al 2015 have indicated that drainage directions are often artificially modified on urban catchments and that this increases consequently the magnitude and frequency of floods urbanisation is also known to increase flow velocity runoff volume and reduce infiltration rates huang et al 2008 du et al 2012 fletcher et al 2013 miller et al 2014 xu and zhao 2016 habibi and seo 2018 other studies have focused on the impact of impervious surfaces on runoff generation palla and gnecco 2015 stated that land artificialisation through increased impervious surfaces promotes surface runoff segond et al 2007 have shown that on impervious areas a high proportion of rainfall becomes effective and produces runoff contrary to pervious areas in addition the time to peak of the flood hydrographs decreases and peak flow increases huang et al 2008 accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of urban catchments in hydrological modelling requires the use of high resolution data and complex spatially distributed hydrological models salvadore et al 2015 fatichi et al 2016 however complexity in the models does not guarantee a better performance pérez sánchez et al 2019 since complex models involve more parameters that may translate into a large number of parameters to be calibrated when limited observational data is available a high risk of overparameterisation may occur andréassian et al 2012 the challenge hence is to find this equilibrium since the 1970s many models have been developed to study the hydrological behaviour of urban catchments or to manage them zoppou 2000 rodriguez et al 2003 bach et al 2014 salvadore et al 2015 cristiano et al 2018 swmm huber and dickinson 1988 is one of the most documented ones and has been used in a number of studies barco et al 2008 krebs et al 2014 leandro and martins 2016 yao et al 2016 hydraulic models such as canoe insavalor sogreah 1997 and mike refsgaard and storm 1995 have also been used to model runoff lhomme et al 2004 hamouda and lahbassi 2012 these models spatial discretisation schemes account for the layout of the stormwater network most of these models represent the inlets and manholes as nodes and the conduits as segments schmitt et al 2004 rodriguez et al 2003 and 2008 chen et al 2018 the difference lies in the representation of the surface flow units some use triangular networks to discretise the streets schmitt et al 2004 crossroads paquier et al 2015 and buildings fewtrell et al 2008 leandro et al 2016 others use a semi distributed approach for surface flow including hydrological units cadastral parcels river elements and streets rodriguez et al 2003 and 2008 jankowfsky et al 2014 chen et al 2018 however the data needed to run these models is not always available in some developing and developed countries accurate maps of the stormwater and wastewater networks are not available chahinian et al 2019 hence some authors have also tried to adapt generic hydrological models to urban catchments perrin and bouvier 2004 lhomme et al 2006 bouvier et al 2018 aliyari et al 2019 these approaches are thought to be well adapted to large scale catchments and metropolitan areas especially in data scarce regions an important feature of distributed hydrological models is the drainage network and that of urban catchments has been the object of particular interest in the literature it is now established that urbanisation decreases dramatically the natural channel density graf 1977 meyer and wallace 2001 indeed in an attempt to control flows and allow urban development natural channels are often buried or covered and as such are no longer visible to the naked eye or reported on maps thus simply using drainage network extraction procedures based on digital terrain models o callaghan and mark 1984 tarboton et al 1991 might not be sufficient in addition urbanisation also leads to the development of artificial drainage networks which increase the overall drainage density graf 1977 by adding artificial links roads in particular are reported to increase drainage by providing new trajectories for surface water bannister 1979 concentrating flows and increasing their velocity shuster et al 2005 according to ogden et al 2011 the increases in drainage density particularly when moving from low values to middle and high values produce significant increases in the flood peaks however drainage density is reported to have an asymptotic behaviour and beyond a threshold value its influence is less on peak flow and runoff volume ogden et al 2011 kroczak and bryndal 2015 have shown that the incorporation of the road network improves flood simulation significantly these authors conclude that the spatial distribution of impervious surfaces has a marked effect on the hydrological response and emphasise the need to use a distributed model which allows the incorporation of detailed rainfall information as well as the imperviousness of the study zone oued fez is a perfect example of these urban catchments where the extent of urbanisation strongly impacts the hydrological response a number of studies lombard latune et al 2010 reynard et al 2013 akdim et al 2013 highlighted the particularity of the study area characterised by high spatial variability of rainfall and strong spatial heterogeneity of land use namely in the downstream part which is highly urbanised a first modelling attempt was carried out by lombard latune et al 2010 using a lumped model thus the representation and impact of the catchment s drainage network could not be assessed the objective of the work is to investigate network representation in hydrological modelling on urban catchments in data scarce contexts by using a distributed approach using a generic distributed hydrological model and the road network as a proxy for urban water networks tests are carried out using the natural drainage network and a modified drainage network that includes the road network with this aim two production functions and two parameterisation schemes are compared at hourly and five minute time steps after a brief description of the study area s characteristics and available data a detailed overview of the tested hydrological models will be given finally the main results will be presented analysed and discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 the oued fez catchment oued fez fig 1 a is a tributary of the sebou which is the largest river system in morocco covering a total area of 814 km2 this catchment is drained by a dense hydrographical network and has oued fez as its main tributary oued fez flows in an easterly direction from the karstic spring of ras el ma through the city of fez its main tributaries oueds boufekrane el mehraz and ain chkef pour into oued fez in the urban area and the river then flows into the sebou 4 km downstream of the city the catchment is considered urban since more than 10 of its area is located within the city of fez where the medina old city is heavily built up and represents the craft centre of the city lombard latune et al 2010 the catchment can be divided into two parts based on the predominant land use types natural karstic zones in the upstream part and urban in the downstream part in order to reduce flooding two dams have been constructed on the oued fez catchment the molay arafa dam was built on oued el mehraz in 1993 with a capacity of 0 60 mm3 the el gaada dam was built on oued boufekrane in 1991 with a capacity of 2 90 mm3 in addition a diversion channel with an evacuation capacity of 35 m3 s 1 was built to divert part of the water stored in the molay arafa dam to the el gaada dam metle 2020 the catchment is located on two groundwater systems a deep triassic aquifer and the shallow unconfined sais aquifer falling piezometric levels due to a combination of over exploitation and droughts have been reported for both since the end of the 1970s abhs 2005 the pedologic cover of the catchment is dominated by calcimagnesic soils and to a lesser extent by vertisols then by scattered alluvial soils bellarbi et al 2011 the prevailing climate is semi arid continental characterised by hot dry summers and cold wet winters in the absence of mean daily temperatures we used the mean monthly temperatures to estimate the mean annual temperature whose value is 16 9 c for the 1970 2011 period at the fez sais station for the same period the mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet is 863 mm year 1 using thornthwaite s method this method was chosen because it relies only on temperature data time series of annual and monthly rainfall from 1972 to 2015 44 years collected by the sebou river basin authority agence du bassin hydraulique de sebou abhs have been used to analyse annual and seasonal trends in rainfall five rain gauges for which long records are available are used for the study three of which are located on the oued fez catchment the remaining two are within the sebou catchment boundaries but outside our study area fig 1a the mann kendall test mann 1945 kendall 1975 which is widely used to detect trends in time series of meteorological variables see a review in yue et al 2002 and kisi 2015 and is well adapted to study rainfall variation hamed 2008 tabari and talaee 2011 jain and kumar 2012 is used it is combined with sen s slope test sen 1968 to detect the magnitude of these trends the trend analysis has been carried out on all rain gauges at seasonal and yearly time steps since the lag 1 correlation showed no significant serial correlation the mann kendall test was used directly without the need for a pre whitening procedure the results fig 2 show that at the annual timescale the ifrane and immouzzer rain gauges which are located in the upstream part of the study area have a positive but statistically non significant trend at a significance level α of 5 p 0 05 going downstream a negative but statistically non significant trend p 0 05 can be observed for the sefrou sais and abhs stations similar trends were also identified for the winter season for all the rain gauges in the study area spring and summer have negative trends while autumn show a positive trend the magnitude of rainfall trends has also been characterised using sen s slope test table 1 an increase in annual rainfall at a rate of 0 40 mm year 1 is detected over the study period the rainy seasons autumn and winter are characterised by an increase in rainfall rates 2 71 and 0 25 mm year 1 respectively while a decrease in rainfall rates with values of 0 12 and 1 97 mm year 1 is observed for the summer and spring seasons the precipitation concentration index pci oliver 1980 is used to study the concentration of annual precipitation and its spatial variation over the entire study area de luis et al 2011 amiri and mesgari 2017 it is calculated at an annual timescale using the following equation 1 p c i annual i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 100 where pi refers to the monthly precipitation for month i l according to olivier 1980 pci values 10 indicate a low precipitation concentration i e uniform precipitation while pci 20 shows very high concentration and strong irregularity the results table 2 show that the oued fez catchment is characterised by an irregular distribution of precipitation with mean values of pci ranging from 16 to 19 the irregularity of the rainfall distribution increases when moving downstream the abhs and sais rain gauges located in the city of fez downstream part have higher values of pci 19 and 18 respectively while the rain gauges located in the upstream zone immouzzer sefrou and ifrane rain gauges have pci values of around 16 this increased irregularity of rainfall may be partly explained by the gradual increase in urbanisation urban development is lower in the upstream part of the catchment and higher in the downstream part where the city of fez is located this is known to have an impact on atmospheric dynamics at a local scale and to affect rainfall distribution salvadore et al 2015 consequently storms can be highly localised maier et al 2020 although there is no clear consensus on this issue most studies emphasise that urbanisation has an important impact on rainfall in terms of rainfall intensity and its spatial distribution for instance zhu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2007 concluded that urbanisation can potentially increase the precipitation intensity in mega cities such as beijing the effects of urbanisation on summertime precipitation were also assessed in osaka japan by shimadera et al 2015 who showed that urbanisation increased not only the precipitation intensity but also its duration furthermore liang and ding 2017 studied the effect of urbanisation on the long term variation of extreme precipitation over shanghai and showed that urbanisation increased the frequency and intensity of rainfall however the effect of urbanisation on the total amount of rainfall was found to be different and no conclusion could be drawn indeed while some authors found that urbanisation increased total rainfall shimadera et al 2015 liang and ding 2017 zhu et al 2019 others concluded that urbanisation decreased total rainfall guo et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 the different trends of total rainfall in urban areas could be attributed partly to the difficulty in separating atmospheric circulation and local topographic effects as most cities are located in different geographic and climatic conditions have different regional circulation and possibly have different urban aerosol emissions guo et al 2006 2 2 the experimental setting in the urban and peri urban sub catchment of oued fez the urban and peri urban sub catchment of oued fez covers an area of 397 km2 fig 1b since 2008 our team has collected discharge and rainfall data in this zone in september 2008 a stream gauge was installed at the catchment outlet the water level is automatically recorded every five minutes by means of a pressure transducer pdcr 1830 700 mbar druck and subsequently converted into discharge using a rating curve established by our research team over the 2008 2017 period three rating curves were established the first one was valid from 01 10 2008 to 30 11 2010 the second one from 30 11 2010 to 01 01 2014 and the last one has been valid since 01 01 2017 eight stream flow gauging campaigns were used to establish the first two rating curves which were obtained by fitting a second degree polynomial four campaigns were used to establish the third rating curve a full topographical survey was carried out as the river bed had been modified following works by the water agency note that at 0 90 m the gauging station is flooded the third rating curve was established using the baratin method le coz et al 2013 which has the advantage of taking into account the hydraulic controls of the cross section and producing uncertainty estimates due to the stage graphs and the parameters of the function used to fit the rating curve the last measured stage value for the current rating curve is 0 57 m corresponding to a discharge value of 0 57 m3 s 1 when disregarding all sources of errors the last extrapolated stage value is 0 71 m corresponding to a discharge value of 2 87 m3 s 1 a monitoring network composed of four rain gauges has been gradually implemented in the urban part of oued fez rainfall is measured by means of tipping bucket 0 20 mm rain gauges note that for the 2008 2009 period rainfall was recorded at 12 minute intervals by fst fez s physics department for the rain gauges implemented later rainfall was measured at 5 minute intervals fig 3 shows hourly streamflow series from 2008 to 2018 an important variability of streamflow especially in terms of peak flows can be observed note that no flows were recorded between january and april 2010 as our gauging station was flooded the water agency also undertook works in the river bed and the discharge measurements were suspended between 2014 and 2016 higher mean flows were recorded during the 2008 2009 period which was exceptionally wet and characterised by a high number of rainy days in terms of peak flow the 2017 2018 period has the highest values 2008 2009 can be considered as an intermediate period while 2011 2012 has the lowest values of peak flow the high values observed for the 2017 2018 period can be explained mainly by the fact that since 2014 several portions of the oued fez el mehraz and ain chkef rivers have been canalised flow conditions have also been impacted by the implementation of a new wastewater treatment plant in fez in 2014 the station has a treatment capacity of 1 2 m eqh and a daily discharge of 155400 m3 up to its construction all of the city s sewage was flushed directly into the river koukkal et al 2004 perrin et al 2014 the temporal dynamics of the effluent discharge was assessed by gauging a sewage canal located to the right of the gauging station located on oued fez this canal was originally built as part of a wastewater pre treatment facility and was used to convey water to a small hydro electric plant nowadays it flows into the fez wastewater treatment plant but may overflow occasionally the results of our gauging campaign on september 15th 2010 an ordinary working day showed that wastewater discharge in the canal increased from 1 06 m3 s 1 at 07 45 a m to 1 76 m3 s 1 at 10 13 a m reached a maximum value of 1 95 m3 s 1 at 2 40 p m and remained at 18 40 m3 s 1 at 4 40 p m note that wastewater dynamics may vary during the ramadan period when water and food consumption is prohibited until fast breaking time and at the height of the touristic season the temporal dynamics may also be assessed using oued fez s discharge time series on rainless days using a baseflow separation method eckhardt 2008 stewart 2015 however in order to quantify it accurately the discharge of the springs that flow into oued fez should be subtracted and we do not have this information before 2009 the wastewater network consisted mainly of combined sewers with a total length of 2050 km the circular pipes had diameters ranging between 300 and 1600 mm while the ovoids had heights ranging between t100 and t240 amarti riffi 2013 between 2010 and 2016 the stormwater coverage improved and is now over 99 muat 2016 currently stormwater overflows occur only when the wastewater treatment plant is out of service despite our best efforts we could not get quantifiable data on the updated network namely a map detailing its layout and attributes hence we could not use a hydraulic model to specifically model the water flow in the pipes and sewer overflows we had to resort to a simpler modelling approach and use the street network as a proxy for the stormwater network our hypothesis is that as per design rules both networks are laid either under the pavement or the road thus we could indirectly account for the flow dynamics and different travel times our study focuses on rainfall runoff events not all four rainfall gauges were operational over the study period this was due to the gradual deployment of the monitoring network and to equipment breakdown thereby a strict quality control procedure was conducted by considering the breakdown periods and removing outlier values we retained a threshold of 6 mm for rainfall events and a time gap of 30 min to separate two consecutive events through this operation 53 flood events corresponding to three periods were chosen for rainfall runoff modelling table 3 the 2008 2009 period this period includes 17 flood events rainfall varies between 6 and 40 2 mm maximum rainfall intensity at an hourly time step ranges from 3 24 to 13 1 mm h 1 45 6 144 mm h 1for dt 12 min and discharge from 1 5 to 44 m3 s 1 the 2011 2012 period this period includes 16 flood events total rainfall varies between 8 2 mm and 31 3 mm maximum rainfall intensity at an hourly time step varies between 2 5 and 10 2 mm h 1 4 5 and 56 4 mm h 1 for dt 5 min and discharge from 3 5 to 8 m3 s 1 the 2017 2018 period 20 flood events were recorded during the third period using all four rainfall gauges total rainfall varies between 7 0 and 29 6 mm maximum rainfall intensity at an hourly step varies between 2 3 and 7 6 mm h 1 5 7 and 36 6 mm h 1 for dt 5 min and discharge between 7 9 and 38 7 m3 s 1 of the events in our sample 1 occurred in the summer the most important flood events in terms of runoff depth and peak flow are recorded in winter to investigate the catchment s hydrological behaviour and signature we investigated the rainfall runoff relationship mcmillan et al 2017 addor et al 2018 hydrological signatures may be calculated based on a variety of data sources but in practice they are usually based on discharge time series addor et al 2018 since we only have streamflow measurements and simulations at the catchment outlet we have carried out a comparison on the rainfall runoff relationships between 2008 2012 and 2017 2018 in order to determine the hydrological similarity or changes across the two periods the results presented in fig 4 show a linear relationship with a good correlation between rainfall and observed runoff for the flood events of the 2008 2012 period r2 0 74 by contrast there is no linear relationship or correlation between rainfall and observed runoff for the flood events belonging to the 2017 2018 period r2 0 17 this change may be due to the increasing imperviousness caused by urban development channelisation of watercourses and the extension of drainage networks guan et al 2016 wang et al 2020 which leads to a flash runoff response to rainstorms burns et al 2005 and an increase of total runoff wang et al 2020 namely during uniform low intensity rainfall events guan et al 2016 for instance the events of 22 10 2008 and 12 04 2018 both occurring in wet conditions had maximum rainfall intensities of 6 20 and 6 mm h 1 respectively and produced 534 mm and 914 mm of runoff for total rainfall values and durations of the same order of magnitude the decrease of r² could have been caused by greater uncertainty on higher runoff values due to measurement errors and the extrapolation of the rating curve however we do not think that is the case in this study since the highest rainfall runoff and peak flow values all events considered were recorded during the 2008 2009 period 2 3 the models the athys modelling platform http www athys soft org bouvier and delclaux 1996 was chosen for this work it is a spatially distributed hydrological modelling platform which includes several production functions that assimilate the soil to a linear reservoir the reservoir is fed through infiltrated rain and the drainage losses represent both evaporation and percolation a portion of the drainage losses may contribute to sub surface flow fig 5 a a literature review of the available models in the athys platform was carried out in order to identify the ones most adapted to the urban and semi arid nature of the catchment another important consideration was the data available on the study zone since we did not have access to data on the soils hydrodynamic properties we had to resort to empirical models in addition given the fact that runoff is mainly due to hortonian overland flow on this catchment we could not use tomodel beven and kirkby 1979 franchini et al 1996 beven 1997 which assumes saturation excess flow as a result two production functions scs and a variable runoff coefficient function were selected and combined with the lag route transfer function their main work hypotheses are detailed in the sections below 2 3 1 the scs production function the first production function is the scs soil conservation service usda 1972 which has been widely used due to its simplicity in estimating the amount of rainfall contributed to the runoff michaud and sorooshian 1994 hughes 1994 tramblay et al 2010a 2010b in addition it is well adapted to different types of flood generation processes steenhuis et al 1995 and is still used to analyse the impact of urbanisation on runoff li et al 2018 the scs function gives an empirical relation between the depth of excess precipitation or direct runoff r t and the depth of precipitation p t after runoff begins chahinian et al 2005 in the athys modelling platform on each cell the instantaneous version of the scs model gaume et al 2004 is used to divide rainfall into infiltrated accumulated rain 2 r t i t p t 0 2 s p t 0 8 s 2 p t 0 2 s p t 0 8 s where r t runoff at time t l t 1 i t rainfall intensity at time t l t 1 p t cumulated rainfall at time t l s maximum storage capacity of the reservoir assimilated to the soil l s is likely to vary on an event basis according to the initial water deficit 2 3 2 the variable runoff coefficient production function reservoir3 reservoir3 is a specific production model implemented in athys it consists of a single linear reservoir and draws its name from the fact that it is the third reservoir model of the athys environment and is referenced under this name in the graphical user interface the model assumes a constant initial abstraction and an infiltration capacity that varies based on the reservoir s fill level 3 r t i t i n f s t s t o i f i t i n f 4 e l s e r t 0 where s t water level in the

to obtain the full event hydrograph for the catchment outlet fig 5b this conceptual model is a generalisation of the unit hydrograph to a grid structure and is considered as a good approximation of the transfer process with lower calculation times two formulations are used to determine the flow velocity bouvier et al 2018 when assuming a constant velocity 9 vk v0 for all cells the transfer

into account storage reservoirs such as lakes and dams since the transfer of the effective rainfall produced by each cell to the outlet is added individually 2 4 sensitivity analysis of the selected models a basic sensitivity analysis was carried and two parameters were found to be sensitive for scs lr and three for reservoir3 lr table 4a and 4b the methodology consists in running simulations while modifying the set parameter values by 25 50 and 75 as carried out in fleischmann et al 2018 and samadi et al 2019 the event of 01 05 2011 with a reference set of parameters for scs lr s 35 mm w 0 20 ds 4 day 1 v0 2 90 m s 1 and k0 0 70 and reservoir3 lr sto 30 mm inf 2 mm h 1 w 0 20 ds 4 day 1 v0 2 70 m s 1 and k0 0 70 was chosen for the sensitivity test only one parameter per run was tested and the remaining ones were set to fixed values throughout the runs the sensitivity results for model parameters with regard to runoff volume vr and peak flows qp for scs lr and reservoir3 lr are presented in table 4a and 4b it can be seen that for scs lr s has the greatest influence on the runoff volume and peak flow as a 25 increase in parameter s induces 21 and 63 variation on these variables respectively the same increase in parameter ds induces 3 variation in volume and 4 in peak flow while for parameter ω the variation is by 22 and 11 respectively note that setting ω 0 would lead to no drainage uptake while ω 1 would lead to total drainage uptake the parameters of the transfer function have a slight impact on the volume but a greater influence on the peak flow in this regard v0 is more sensitive than k0 a 25 decrease in both induces 3 variation in volume and 36 in peak flow for v0 and respectively 1 and 8 for k0 the results of the sensitivity analysis of the scs lr model are in accordance with those of nguyen and bouvier 2019 for the reservoir3 lr model table 4b of all the parameters of the production function sto has the greatest impact on the peak flow a 25 decrease in the value of sto induces 16 variation in the simulated peak flow ω and ds yield important variations in volume since they control reservoir drainage and uptake a 25 decrease in ω yields 24 variation in the volume and 12 in the peak flow however on impervious surfaces the possibility of drainage uptake is slim the results for the transfer function remain unchanged i e v0 is more sensitive than k0 based on the sensitivity analysis results it was decided to calibrate s and v0 for the scs lr model and sto and v0 for the reservoir3 lr model since we had no prior knowledge of the value of the parameter inf we resorted to calibrating it as well the remaining parameters were set to ω 0 ds 4 day 1 and k0 0 70 2 5 the parametrisation schemes 2 5 1 extracting the drainage network the advanced land observing satellite phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar radiometric terrain correction alos palsar rtc https asf alaska edu data sets sar data sets alos palsar high resolution digital elevation model dem with a 12 5 metre resolution is used to generate the natural drainage network using athys s in built extraction procedure alos palsar was selected because several studies found it to perform better than other open source dems ali et al 2012 courty et al 2019 ngula niipele and chen 2019 the dem is first resampled at 10 m spatial resolution and then used to determine the natural drainage network using the d8 algorithm o callaghan and mark 1984 tarboton et al 1991 built into athys once pits are removed the drainage direction of each cell is determined based on the steepest slope and the flow accumulation is calculated the network corresponding to a 10 ha flow accumulation threshold is extracted and corrected using the 1 25000 scale topographic maps this drainage network will be referred to as natural drainage nd a map of the street network is used to force the drainage directions along the motorways the street network is really dense in the old medina and fez jedid sectors with very narrow pedestrian streets that cannot be mapped correctly at the scale we worked at hence we used the road network i e streets that could be travelled by motor vehicles this network was burned into the dem by reducing the elevation of the cells on which this artificial network is located as carried out by rodriguez et al 2000 and gironas et al 2010 and a new drainage network was extracted this drainage network will be referred to as the modified drainage network md fig 6 note that the model is fully gridded with independent cells i e each cell produces an elementary hydrograph by modifying the drainage directions the distance to the outlet or length lk and the upstream drained area by the cell will be modified fig 7 however since we use the simple formulation of the transfer function eq 9 only the change in distance will directly impact our results the simple formulation is not impacted by the changes in slope value either when comparing the distributions of lk for both drainage models fig 7 it can be seen that by adding the road network new shorter connections are created resulting in a decrease of the maximum lk value from 1066 m nd to 866 m md and a shift in the median lk value which moves from 583 m to 444 m the 1st and 3rd quantiles are also lower 270 m and 607 m for md as opposed to 368 m and 775 m for nd 2 5 2 spatial discretisation in order to represent the effect of urbanisation on runoff generation we have divided the urban area of the oued fez catchment into production classes based on land use fig 1b two land use maps were created using google earth images from 2008 and 2017 the first one was used for the 2008 2012 period and the second one for the 2017 2018 period the urban sprawl corresponds to a total area of 7 80 km2 and is mostly concentrated in the peri urban area located in the southern part of the catchment namely around the districts of ain chkef and ouled tayeb fig 1b according to official sources the development of ain chkef has increased by 0 33 between 2007 and 2014 and 40 of the housing in ouled tayeb was built after 2009 matnuhpv 2019 hence the potential errors in land use type for the 2011 2012 events do not concern the more densely built areas whose limits have been stable throughout the study period but rather the peri urban areas whose impervious surfaces may be over estimated between 2008 and 2012 the building permits granted by the state amounted to a total built area of 1 10 km2 excluding roads built by the government haut commissariat au plan 2020 hence by using the 2008 land use maps for the 2011 2012 events the value of parameter s might be over estimated for these plots we started with six classes and after some primary tests decided to reduce them to three as a compromise between over parametrisation and representativeness this is in accordance with jakeman and hornberger 1993 who assume that five parameters should be sufficient to reproduce hydrological processes of course the number of parameters for accurate representation of the hydrological processes is model based and high capacity computers nowadays remove some of the limitations that were common in the early days of distributed hydrological modelling however hydrological systems are highly non linear with threshold effects on catchments with limited data it would still be difficult to correctly calibrate a large number of parameters without getting into equifinality problems the three classes are the za class corresponds to agricultural and natural areas the zu class corresponds to urban areas formed by isolated dwellings or buildings the zud class corresponds to densely urbanised areas such as the old medina and aouinat el hajaj districts for each model three sets of parameters corresponding to the three land use classes are calibrated for the production function table 5 the parameters to be calibrated are s for the scs model and inf and sto for the reservoir3 model for both models ω and ds are set to default values of 0 and 4 day 1 for the transfer function parameter v0 is calibrated and k0 is set to 0 70 two values of v0 are calibrated one using the natural drainage network nd and one using the modified drainage network md calibration is carried out using the model s in built automatic calibration procedure based on the simplex algorithm on each event of the calibration set independently rainfall is interpolated using thiessen polygons no rainfall and runoff data are available on the upstream part of the catchment which is mostly rural anyway given its karstic nature we assumed that this zone s direct contribution to the runoff at the catchment outlet is insignificant at the event time scale mean duration 880 min it contributes mainly through springs which already pour into the river network and are accounted for indirectly this assumption will have to be revised in the future in light of new experimental data 2 6 model calibration and validation the coupled scs lr and reservoir3 lr models of the athys platform are tested on the peri urban and urban parts of oued fez in event based mode at hourly and sub hourly time steps the split sample test procedure klemeš 1986 is used and the flood events recorded over the entire study period are divided into two sets randomly the first one is used to calibrate the models parameters while the second one is used to verify the reproducibility of the results and to assess the representativeness of the calibrated parameter sets validation the median value of the calibrated parameters is used to simulate the events of the validation set the nash and sutcliffe efficiency measure nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to assess the models ability to reproduce the observed flood hydrographs in addition the rmse is used to quantify the errors on peak flows and runoff volumes 11 n s e 1 i 1 n q s i m i q o b s i 2 i 1 n q s i m i q o b s 2 12 r m s e i 1 n v s i

and 6b present the median values of the calibrated parameters at hourly time steps it can be seen that the maximum retention capacity of the soil reservoir s for the scs lr model and the reservoir capacity sto for the reservoir3 lr model are variable the minimum values of s are obtained for the zud class which corresponds to densely urbanised areas this suggests that densely urbanised areas are highly impervious and infiltration is very low the maximum values are obtained for the za class which corresponds to agricultural areas characterised by a high infiltration capacity the median parameter values are nearly double those of the urban areas i e in comparison with agricultural areas retention is reduced by a factor of two in urban areas we can further observe that the median values of both s and sto when using a modified drainage network are slightly lower than those obtained when using a natural network this can be explained by the fact that taking into account urbanisation has contributed to an increase in surface runoff and a decrease in infiltration capacity as highlighted also by several studies such as miller et al 2014 and xu and zhao 2016 table 7a and 7b present the median values of the calibrated parameters at 5 minute time steps it shows similar trends to those found when calibrating events at an hourly time step i e the minimum values of the production parameters s and sto correspond to the heavily urbanised areas while agricultural areas are characterised by the highest values the optimal values of the inf parameter for the reservoir3 model are also lowest for the densely urbanised area class zud and highest for the agricultural zones class za furthermore no correlation was found between the calibrated values of parameter s and the classical previous 5 day antecedent rainfall at both time steps at the hourly time step r2 0 05 for s za and r2 0 01 s zu for the scs lrn model and r2 0 02 and r2 0 01 for the scs lrm model at the 5 minute time step r2 0 14 for s za and r2 0 17 s zu for the scs lrn model and r2 0 16 for s za and r2 0 12 for s zu for scs lrm the maximum velocity reached at the outlet v0 is characterised by a slight inter event variation as also highlighted by laganier et al 2014 who indicated that the v0 values are variable but consistent with the commonly observed velocities by analysing the calibrated values of the v0 parameter it can be seen that the minimum values are obtained for low intensity events while high intensity events were characterised by the greatest values we further investigated parameter changes across time periods for both time steps tables 6a 6b and 7a 7b a decrease in the s and sto parameter values and an increase in the v0 parameter values can be observed between 2011 2012 and 2017 2018 these changes are thought to be due to an increase in the channelisation of the hydrographic network as well as an increase in the urbanisation of the catchment 3 1 evaluation of the models performance at different time steps 3 1 1 calibration phase the investigation of the models performance is based on the nash and sutcliffe criterion nse is presented in fig 8 the boxplots represent the distribution of the criterion for the hourly data 2008 2018 26 events and 5 minute time steps 2011 2018 data 17 events they indicate that the results of the simulations are not spread out at the hourly time step the median nse values range between 0 73 and 0 85 and the percentage of events having nse 0 6 varies from 84 to 88 thus the models performance can be considered satisfactory when comparing the ranking of the four models it can be seen that the scs lrm model is the most appropriate for the calibration database while the reservoir3 lrn model shows a lower performance and has the lowest nse median values flood event simulations at a finer time scale 5 min were also carried out using flood events recorded during the 2011 2018 periods the results indicate that all four models are able to reproduce the flood hydrographs correctly the median nse ranges between 0 51 and 0 69 for the scs lrm 77 of the events have nse 0 6 the percentage drops to 65 for reservoir3 lrm and 53 for scs lrn the lowest values are those of reservoir3 lrn with 47 similarly to the results obtained at the hourly time step scs lrm outperforms the other three models the determination coefficient r2 and the rmse were used to judge the models performance in terms of the runoff volume and peak flow restitution the linear regressions between the observed and simulated flood events in terms of runoff volumes and peak flow are presented in fig 9 a and b a good correspondence can be seen between the observed and simulated runoff volumes for all tested models at the hourly time step fig 9a with r2 varying between 0 97 and 0 98 and rmse between 0 16 and 0 25 in terms of peak flow a good agreement can be noticed also between the two hydrographs with r2 varying between 0 88 and 0 93 and rmse between 0 18 and 0 23 at the 5 minute time step fig 9b and table 8 the r2 and rmse values drop slightly for both volume 0 94 to 0 97 and 0 22 to 0 32 respectively and peak flow 0 78 to 0 93 and 0 23 to 0 42 visual comparison of the simulated and observed hydrographs see examples in fig 10 a and b also shows a good agreement 3 1 2 validation phase the median values of the calibrated parameters at different time steps 60 and 5 min are used to simulate the validation events note that for the 5 minute time step only the 19 flood events recorded during the 2011 2012 and 2017 2018 periods are used based on the nse criterion the models performance is degraded at the hourly time step the median nse values range between 0 39 and 0 56 save for scs lrn and reservoir3 lrn the models give the same performance at the 5 minute time step with the median nse values varying between 0 27 and 0 57 fig 8 at the hourly time step the models ranking remains unchanged 45 of the flood events simulated by the scs lrm model have an nse value 0 6 the percentage drops to 34 for reservoir3 lrn and rises to 37 for reservoir3 lrm the models ranking is unchanged at the 5 minute time step for scs lrm 47 of events have an nse 0 6 42 for reservoir3 lrm 35 for scs lrn and 12 for reservoir3 lrn similar performances are obtained when looking at the runoff volume and peak flow simulation at both time steps fig 9 and table 8 at the hourly time step the r2 and rmse for the runoff volume range between 0 23 to 0 37 and 58 to 0 63 and between 0 19 to 0 41 and 0 53 to 0 69 respectively for peak flow for the 5 minute time step they drop to 0 13 to 0 69 and 0 31 to 0 87 respectively for volume and 0 17 to 0 50 and 0 45 to 0 61 for peak flow the performance is slightly degraded in both calibration and validation when reducing the modelling time step fig 9b ficchi et al 2016 found similar results and stated that although the performance of the tested model was greatly improved when changing from a 1 day to a 6 h time step a reverse trend was found when decreasing the time step from 1 h to 6 min the same study showed that reducing the time step has the opposite effect under high flow conditions this finding is consistent with our results as the rainfall runoff events simulated at the 5 minute time step are characterised by higher flow conditions than those modelled at an hourly time step the models capacity to reproduce the catchment s hydrological response was assessed by analysing the relationship between rainfall and simulated runoff for all events fig 11 this analysis was carried out at an hourly time step to be able to use the largest available dataset it can be seen that the linear relationship is correctly reproduced for the 2008 2011 events with slightly higher values for the correlation coefficient 0 81 r2 0 85 and save for the reservoir3 lrm model similar values for the slope of the regression line 0 20 a 0 22 the non linear relationship of the 2017 2018 events is also reproduced with even lower values for the correlation coefficient 0 07 r2 0 23 all criteria and time steps considered the models performance in validation is poor the models lack of robustness is increased by the change in the rainfall runoff relationship on the catchment fig 4 throughout the study period on the one hand 2008 2009 was an exceptionally wet year annual rainfall of 810 mm vs 523 mm for 2017 2018 and on the other the flow conditions on the catchment were modified as highlighted by the experimental data fig 4 and the observations made in the field regarding the extension of the stormwater and wastewater networks by calibrating and validating the models within and not across the periods i e using the median of the parameters for each period better results are obtained at the hourly time step the median nse values range between 0 61 and 0 74 and at the 5 minute time step between 0 48 and 0 62 3 2 effect of rain gauge network density and rainfall event type on the models performance the modelling results were further investigated to highlight any possible effect of the rain gauge network density on the models performance the rainfall events were divided into two groups single gauge events i e events recorded when only a single rain gauge was implemented and multiple gauge events i e events recorded when two or more rain gauges were implemented the analysis was only carried out at the hourly time step because our database did not contain any single gauge events at the 5 minute time step and only 5 events for which rainfall was measured using two gauges when examining the models results based on the rain gauge density using the nse criterion it was found that for the calibration phase all the tested models reproduce the observed hydrographs well when rainfall information is provided by two or four rain gauges fig 12 a the median nse value of the four models ranges between 0 62 and 0 72 for the events where rainfall information is obtained using a single gauge and between 0 74 and 0 89 when using multiple rain gauges the results are poorer for the validation phase where the models performance is lower for the events where the rainfall information was provided by multiple rain gauges however this is not thought to be due to the rainfall information but rather to the models lack of robustness and overall poor performance in validation as can be seen in table 3 all the events for which rainfall information is provided by a single rain gauge belong to the 2008 2012 period while nearly all the events for which rainfall information is provided by multiple rain gauges belong to the 2017 2018 period thus the median values of the calibrated parameters converge towards the optimum values of the 2008 2012 period which constitutes 65 of the total number of events in our database we further wanted to investigate the influence of the rainfall type we used the 75th and 25th percentiles value of total rainfall to separate the events all events where the total rainfall was below the 25th percentile were considered as low rainfall events and those where the total rainfall was above the 75th percentile were considered as high rainfall events the results at the hourly time step fig 12b both in calibration and validation indicate that the selected models are able to reproduce the high rainfall events 0 72 nse median 0 78 and perform less well on low rainfall events 0 63 nse median 0 89 the findings are similar at the 5 minute time step despite the lower nse thresholds i e 0 54 nse 0 72 for high rainfall events as opposed to low rainfall events 0 27 nse 0 54 note that nse is known to be more sensitive to high flow values tegegne et al 2017 4 discussion the analysis of the calibrated parameters at the hourly time step indicates that the median values of parameter s for urban areas is 28 mm using the scs lrn model and 26 mm for the scs lrm model these results are in the same range as those reported by bouvier et al 2018 on the ouagadougou metropolitan area the s values calibrated for the agricultural zones are consistent with those of laganier et al 2014 who identified similar variation trends on the predominantly rural anduze catchment 108 s 408 mm the values of the transfer parameter v0 however are slightly higher than those obtained by tramblay et al 2010a 2010b laganier et al 2014 and coustau et al 2012 they are in the same order of magnitude as those obtained by tramblay et al 2011 who showed that v0 tends to increase when using uniform rainfall as opposed to when using spatially distributed rainfall inputs arnaud et al 2002 also indicate that the calibration of rainfall runoff models is impacted by uniform rainfall our results show that the median vo value for the tested models varies between 3 24 m s 1 and 4 m s 1 when the rainfall information comes from one rain gauge and ranges between 3 11 m s 1 and 3 50 m s 1 when the rainfall is provided by four rain gauges these values can also be partly explained by the urban nature of our catchment v0 has slightly higher values when using the modified drainage network md as input for the reservoir3 model than when using the natural drainage network nd at both time steps this can be explained by the configuration of the modified drainage md by adding the road network shorter connections are created between the cells and the distances to the outlet lk are decreased fig 7 in order to maintain the same routing time tm the velocity vk will have to slightly increase when analysing the v0 values it can be noticed that the flood events that belong to the 2017 2018 period are characterised by relatively high v0 values compared to those calibrated for events belonging to the 2008 2009 and 2011 2012 periods this is mainly due to the fact that several waterways have been canalised since 2014 ain smen oued el mehraz ain chkef it should however be noted that the fez wastewater treatment plant was built in 2014 and until its construction the combined sewer outflows as well as the stormwater outflows poured directly into the river since 2017 the situation has changed and the higher velocity values may be due to these changes despite measures taken to overcome the risk of overparameterisation the latter may partly explain the relatively lower performance of the reservoir3 lr model as compared to scs lr as the number of calibrated parameters for the first model was 5 against 4 for the second one the use of more calibrated parameters may increase the hydrological modelling uncertainty her et al 2019 and explain the drop in performance during the validation phase arsenault et al 2018 unfortunately we did not have access to additional discharge data to calibrate the models spatially and given the layout of the river network i e unstable cross sections canalised inaccessible underground reaches and the high exposure of the material to theft in some sectors we could not implement additional intermediate gauging stations this study showed that the tested models performance was higher when rainfall information is provided from multiple rain gauges which suggests that an additional knowledge of spatial rainfall variability has the potential to improve the models performance pechlivanidis et al 2009 reached similar conclusions and noted that the reproduction of flood events could be affected if the spatial variability of rainfall is not well represented arnaud et al 2002 also reported similar results in mexico city as did emmanuel et al 2015 on the gardon d anduze catchment southern france or ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 on catchments located in belgium france the netherlands and the uk albeit using urban drainage models gires et al 2012 and bruni et al 2015 also highlighted the sensitivity of the model outputs to the spatial variability of rainfall the optimal coverage needed for the oued fez catchment is an open question as implementing rain gauges in the western part of the catchment is not feasible at present due to the presence of sensitive installations considering the results of the calibration and validation phases at either hourly or 5 minute time steps it is clear that using the modified drainage network i e forcing drainage directions along the road network and using production classes according to the urbanisation level ensures better performance than when using the natural drainage network additionally scs lr seems to perform better than reservoir3 lr this is true in calibration and validation and at both time steps thus even a minimal representation of the urban nature of the catchment through modified drainage directions and production classes based on the degree of urbanisation seems to yield better results this solution was implemented because we did not have access to a map of the stormwater network and the approach proved to be effective and well adapted to the complex configuration of the oued fez catchment it might be useful elsewhere as well however when working on water quality a separate representation of the stormwater and wastewater networks might be necessary as flow and in situ environmental conditions induce bio chemical transformations that impact solute and particular pollutant fluxes chebbo and gromaire 2004 andrés doménech et al 2018 in some west african cities e g bamako and ouagadougou where open air channels are used for stormwater field surveys may be carried out to get their geometrical and hydraulic characteristics in cities like fez where the vast majority of these networks are underground alternative solutions relying on geophysical methods and probabilistic methods may be needed bilal et al 2018 using the simple formulation of the lag and route model without interactive cells also has its limitations the first is that using independent cells would not allow the calculation of discharge values at sub catchment or street level this would make the use of such models limited in urban flooding and inundation studies however it is also true that using a simple formulation that relies only on distance makes the transfer function less sensitive to errors on slope values a common problem in flat environments in this application we used a fully gridded model if the model s structure had been based on hydrological units and river network segments such as in swat arnold and fohrer 2005 or modspa moussa et al 2007 the drainage network s layout would have varied based on the upstream drained area threshold in our configuration the network is already dense since all the cells are taken into account when calculating the discharge an alternative would have been to use higher resolution maps where the river network is more densely represented to correct the drainage directions but such maps were not available for oued fez in addition many portions of the catchment are urban stream deserts napieralski et al 2015 i e areas where surface stream channels are not visible because they have been buried or covered by urban development and as such would likely not be reported on maps this is a major concern for urban catchments as it contributes to the difficulty in defining the hydrographic network 5 conclusion this study has presented an attempt at drainage network representation for distributed hydrological modelling on urban catchments where the layout of the stormwater network is not available a case study is presented on the oued fez catchment using two hydrological models of the athys platform in event based mode at hourly and 5 minute time steps original discharge data recorded at one streamflow gauge and rainfall data recorded at 1 4 rain gauges depending on the study period are used to calibrate and validate the selected models our findings show that the approach adopted to take into account the urban configuration of the oued fez catchment by modifying the drainage directions and by differentiating runoff production according to urbanisation improves the performance of the hydrological models in addition comparison of the models in terms of performance shows that the scs lr model reproduces the flood hydrographs better than the reservoir3 lr model regardless of the drainage network and the time step used although a slight degradation of the models performance is noted for the sub hourly time step our results show that when a map of the stormwater network is not available modellers might use the road network as a proxy to simulate flow at the catchment outlet however for water quality studies this approach might be too limited as in situ transformations would not be accounted for and contaminant flux calculations would be impacted thus an accurate representation of the stormwater and wastewater networks is still necessary by using a fully gridded model where all the cells are used for flow routing the river network s layout does not vary based on the upstream drained area threshold and thus the modelling results are not impacted by this feature however they are prone to uncertainties related to the difficulty in delineating the hydrographic network of urban catchments which are sometimes buried or covered by urban development in addition using the simple formulation of the lag and route model without interactive cells does not allow discharge calculations at sub catchment or street level this would make the use of such models too limited for urban flooding and inundation studies however since a simple formulation relies only on the distance to the outlet it is less sensitive to errors in slope values a common problem in flat environments nevertheless additional discharge data would be necessary to calibrate the models spatially and to identify the hydrological processes that may need to be accounted for in more specific conceptual models funding this work was supported by
