965,riparian areas of riverine plains develop extensive floodable areas named riverine wetlands which are essential to the water cycle balance and ecosystem dynamics in this study we contrasted the hydrological and physicochemical variables of riverine wetlands of both peri urban areas impacted by intensive farming and those of rural areas with the indicators of the biotic structure taxonomic richness shannon diversity and total density of benthic diatoms phytoplankton zooplankton macroinvertebrates chironomids fishes turtles and birds the study was performed on riverine waters of the pampean plain argentina with four seasonal samplings conducted in 2017 2018 our results showed that the significant deepening of the groundwater level caused by aquifer overexploitation in peri urban areas as well as the declining surface water quality with higher phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations affected the taxonomic richness diversity and total density of the biotic assemblages of riverine wetlands the taxonomic richness of birds turtles phytoplankton chironomids and fishes was the most sensitive to land use phytoplankton chironomid and fish diversity showed the greatest differences between rural and peri urban riverine waters while the total density of chironomids and birds showed the greatest differences according to land use the results suggest that the socioeconomic development in those riverine wetlands that still maintain conditions close to the natural ones needs to be subject to guidelines derived from integrated basin management and sustainable urban planning keywords food and water demands urbanization biodiversity lowland streams 1 introduction a fluvial system includes different subsystems connected by horizontal and vertical hydrological flows with a continuum of spatial and functional variation vannote et al 1980 naiman et al 1988 riparian zones of river plains develop riverine wetlands rws which are extensive floodable areas essential to the water cycle balance and ecosystem functioning epa 2015 their key role in groundwater recharge the high biodiversity they harbour and their harvestable production are among the several ecosystem services they provide martin ortega et al 2015 until recently rws were the least studied sections of the drainage systems and were excluded from water resource management planning biggs et al 2016 the number of studies on these systems have increased recently considering their functional and structural importance for the drainage network and their critical relevance for the preservation of diversity and ecosystem services zhao et al 2019 the increasing human population determines a rise in the demand for water energy and food while these resources become progressively scarcer covarrubias 2019 therefore this requires changes in the use of natural resources and land uses to supply these demands which have an impact on natural ecosystems wetlands are impacted by anthropogenic activities such as urbanization and agriculture causing water over exploitation untreated domestic effluents and habitat destruction usually agriculture is the most frequent land use around the urban centers covering peri urban and rural areas which affects the structure and dynamics of wetlands ehrenfeld 2000 farming activities lead to groundwater over exploitation and water eutrophication caused by the increase in phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations due to the overuse of fertilizers moreover the input of organic matter generated by this activity reduces the water dissolved oxygen while pesticides produce harmful effects on biodiversity beketov et al 2013 epa 2015 the expansion of urbanization over rural and natural areas is also observed in south america pimentel et al 1998 ryder and brown 2000 including the pampean plain the expansion of cities transforms rural spaces into urban ones with rural urban interfaces relying on the development of infrastructure and services to make the resources of their surroundings profitable thus damaging or removing wetlands martin ortega et al 2015 butsch and heinkel 2020 the pampean plain is a vast territory of the neotropical region dominated by low topographic slope and a large number of wetlands its hydrological dynamics is characterized by alternating phases of drought and water excesses driven by climatic phenomena such as the el niño southern oscillation enso sala et al 1998 the rainfall regimes and geomorphology develop riverine wetlands in fluvial floodplains which are fed by the overflow of rivers and streams ringuelet 1962 brinson et al 1995 or by groundwater depending on the phase of the hydroperiod junk et al 1989 finlayson et al 2013 this plain is one of the most fertile territories in argentina and therefore one of the main sources of income for the country in the form of grain and beef exports rubio et al 2019 until the early 20th century most of the rws in the pampean plain were impacted by extensive livestock production and small scale agriculture in this last century the strong development of urban centers has increased the demand for food and water as is the case of the city of la plata currently inhabited by almost 1 million people establishing a stressful social and ecological scenario matteucci and morello 2009 frediani 2013 these activities usually cover many rws in this region and overexploit the groundwater resource auge 2005 kruse et al 2017 until 1955 the whole water supply for irrigation industry and drinking was exclusively extracted from wells placed in the centre of the town which caused the saline front to advance from the coastal plain therefore new wells were built in the peri urban area and the service was supplemented with surface water from the río de la plata estuary currently groundwater is exploited mainly in peri urban and rural areas in the south of the city of la plata with the contribution of over 80 hm3 year 1 generating the deepening of the regional water table kruse et al 2014 the need to develop a more sustainable approach to the management of water resources as well as to protect the ecosystems where these resources are found is essential particularly in highly productive areas such as the pampean plain considering that biotic and abiotic responses are indicators of environmental change offering powerful tools to make decisions on the management of river corridors robinson et al 2002 in this study we analyse the hydrological and physicochemical variables and indicators of biotic structure taxonomic richness shannon diversity and total density to contrast rws of peri urban areas affected by intensive farming with those of rural areas the hypothesis to be tested is that the increase in demand for food and water associated with the advance of urban areas and intensive agriculture over rural areas promotes significant changes in the hydrology water table physicochemical variables and biotic structure of the rws 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the pampean plain in the ne of the province of buenos aires argentina fig 1 with a humid to subhumid climate an average annual rainfall of 1060 mm year 1 and an evapotranspiration of 783 mm year 1 laurencena et al 2010 the stability in the permanence of surface water in the wetlands of this region is given by the contribution of groundwater to the base level of the watercourses deluchi et al 2005 to maximize the understanding of the effects of urban resource demands on rws and to minimize the variability given by natural hydrological and meteorological regimes rws located in the same region near the city of la plata were selected such rws are located along the carnaval rw1 del gato rw2 cajaravillas rw3 and chubichaminí rw4 streams with their catchments being subjected to different land uses table 1 rws 1 and 2 are in the vicinities of the urban center of the city of la plata where farming is the main anthropogenic activity downstream the carnaval and del gato streams run through densely populated areas and their channels have been heavily impacted by anthropic action channelization piping etc conditioning their connection with the estuary of the río de la plata the over extraction for crop irrigation and drinking water supply of the city of la plata and its surroundings has caused the local deepening of the water tables particularly in the southern sector of the city fig 1b this has contributed to the loss of groundwater supply to the base flow of the streams where these rws occur deluchi et al 2005 garcía and zanandrea 2017 rw3 and 4 are located in rural areas of the city of la plata where extensive livestock production is the main anthropic activity these rws receive groundwater and surface water with a greater volume being supplied by the former both rws flow downstream through rural areas that do not hinder their natural drainage to the río de la plata estuary the rws studied are inhabited by a diverse aquatic vegetation with a cover greater than 60 with assemblages mainly represented by palustrine species such as typha latifolia schoenoplectus californicus ludwigia peploides hydrocotyle ranunculoides among the most frequent and abundant as well as the exotic species iris pseudacorus and among the floating ones lemna minuta zanotti and gómez 2019 facultative species were observed close to watercourses such as hydrocotyle bonariensis nothoscordum bonariense lessingianthus rubricaulis alternanthera philoxeroides bacopa monnieri eryngium ebracteatum and polygonum punctatum mostly represented in rural rws following the classification of manzano et al 2002 the studied ecosystems can be characterized as continental epigenetic hypogenic or mixed wetlands with open drainage a seasonal hydroperiod with greater flow in winter due to lower evapotranspiration and a renewal rate of less than 25 per year 2 2 sampling seasonal samplings were performed in autumn march 2017 winter june 2017 spring november 2017 and summer february 2018 in the four rws the methodological techniques implemented regarding the land use meteorological hydrological and biological indicators of the rws are described below 2 1 1 land uses meteorology and hydrology of rws the land use characterization followed the criteria of laurencena et al 2010 the regional characterization of the basin was performed based on landsat 8 etm satellite images air temperature and rainfall data were recorded from a weather station davis vantage pro2 installed in the study area the relationship between the topographic and groundwater levels of the rw was obtained by differential gps in rws with shallow water tables data loggers solinst model 3001 ltc levelogger edge produced continuous records of groundwater levels with a 1 hour sampling frequency during the study period drillings reaching a final depth of 8 m b g s metres below ground surface were made with a hand operated rotary drilling system to identify the position of the water table isophreatic maps were drawn to determine the relationship between rws and groundwater a geographic information system gis was used to integrate the data obtained the base cartography was made including raster and vector layers of satellite images topographic and land use maps sample points and groundwater flow maps the watershed characterization was performed with a digital elevation model dem from an image captured by the alos satellite equipped with a palsar phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar radar sensor with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m tools of spatial analysis for fill flow accumulation and flow direction were used to delimit the drainage basin finally the digitalization of the drainage network was conducted using a raster calculator tool to identify the main and secondary drainage networks and the hydrological characteristics to be analyzed at different scales of detail 2 1 2 physicochemical characteristics of the water conductivity turbidity ph percentage of dissolved oxygen saturation and temperature were measured in situ with a multiparameter device horiba water samples 250 ml were collected in triplicate and transported under refrigeration to the laboratory where nutrients were analyzed according to mackereth et al 1978 and the oxygen demands bod5 and cod according to eaton et al 1998 2 1 3 descriptors of biotic structure in order to analyze the biotic structure of the rws assemblages of benthic diatoms phytoplankton zooplankton macroinvertebrates chironomids fishes turtles and birds were studied benthic diatom samples were collected in triplicate from the surface layer 5 mm of the sediment epipelon by pipetting 1 cm2 of the bed in the laboratory samples were oxidized with h2o2 100 vol washed and mounted in naphrax for identification under optical microscope the relative abundance was estimated by counting 400 frustules descy and

ekman dredge 100 cm2 and fixed with 5 formalin in the laboratory samples were filtered through 500 µm pore sieves and stained with erythrosin b specimens were separated under stereomicroscope identified according to lopretto and tell 1995 and merritt et al 2008 quantified and expressed as individuals m 2 in addition samples were obtained with a 250 µm pore size mesh d net in triplicate from an area of 0 4 m x 0 4 m to analyze the assemblages of chironomids diptera chironomidae specimens of chironomids were identified following andersen et al 2013 and silva et al 2018 quantified and expressed as individuals m 2 fish sampling was conducted with a seine net width 15 m height 1 1 m mesh size 10 mm between opposite knots cod end length 2 m and mesh size 5 mm between opposite knots and a push net width 0 36 cm height 0 46 cm mesh size 1 1 mm handle 2 m the sampling effort was the same in each site consisting in one seine haul by one person in each shore along 20 m upstream and five fishing attempts with the push net in shallower or vegetated areas where the seine net could not be used easily identified species were counted in the field and returned alive to the water the remaining specimens were euthanized with an overdose of anesthetic benzocaine in excess initially preserved in 10 formalin which was later replaced by 70 ethanol for laboratory identification fish specimens were identified following ringuelet et al 1967 almirón et al 2015 and mirande and koerber 2015 fishing gear was standardized for the estimation of individuals m 2 turtle sampling methods depended on the depth of each site in the rws in shallower sites turtles were counted by the same operator following the methodology of muddling reported by bury et al 2012 by direct visual and or tactile inspection in deeper sites trotlines without hooks were used along 600 m following semeñiuk et al 2017 turtles were identified in the sample site following cabrera 1998 and immediately released alive to analyze the bird assemblage a linear 1000 m long transect running parallel to the watercourse was sampled for 60 min starting 15 min before sunrise time of sunrise was obtained from a gps atlasgps the same operator moved at a constant speed identifying and counting all observed individuals or songbirds heard along the width of the rw and a lateral strip of 50 m specimens were identified following rodríguez mata et al 2006 and ridgely and tudor 2009 and the nomenclature followed remsen et al 2016 2 1 4 statistical analysis the taxonomic richness of each assemblage was determined from the number of taxa identified in each sampling date the shannon wiener diversity index was calculated considering the taxonomic richness and the abundance of taxa shannon and weaver 1963 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses were performed by sorting the rws according to four datasets the environmental variables taxonomic richness s shannon wiener diversity index h and total density td of each taxonomic group the variable values were standardized subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation environmental variables except for ph and water table depth and td were previously ln x 1 transformed distance matrices were made using the euclidean distance method differences between rws in terms of the land use factor rural vs peri urban were tested by anosim analysis in each ordination and the method of point biserial correlation was used to identify the variables explaining differences related to land uses the analyses were performed with vegan oksanen et al 2013 and indicator species de cáceres et al 2010 packages from r core development team software r core team 2018 the relationships between biological variables average values of s h and td of phytoplankton zooplankton macroinvertebrates chironomids fishes and birds and the average values of the environmental variables obtained for each rw were analyzed through redundancy analysis rda previously a detrended correspondence analysis dca was performed to determine whether the response model of the biological variables was linear or unimodal the biological variables were log10 x 1 transformed to obtain a normal distribution or an approximation and environmental variables were standardized ter braak and smilauer 1988 since the maximum gradient length did not exceed a standard deviation the rda analysis was applied ter braak 1986 environmental variables were tested individually by means of the monte carlo test the variance inflation factor for all variables was 5 indicating absence of multicollinearity ter braak 1986 ter braak and smilauer 1988 a monte carlo permutation test was performed to obtain the overall significance of the ordination 3 results 3 1 land uses meteorology and hydrology upstream from rws 1 and 2 the land use is predominantly urban 68 and 95 respectively while the remaining area shows a peri urban land use rws 3 and 4 are surrounded by rural land fig 1a rainfall average in the sampled periods fluctuated between 80 mm march 2017 and 0 5 mm february 2018 the latter during an intense drought within a la niña phase of the enso phenomenon temperature ranged between 12 5 c june 2017 and 24 c february 2018 fig 2 hydrological parameters are shown in table 1 the anosim revealed that the water table levels of rural rws were significantly more superficial than those of peri urban rws in which the water table level was deeper than 10 m b g s the last two rws were shallower and endured a retraction of the humid zone during summer 3 2 physicochemical characteristics the absence of surface water during summer in rws 1 and 2 did not allow to obtain physicochemical and biotic samples in the remaining seasons these rws showed significantly higher total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations rw2 lower dissolved oxygen saturation rws 3 and 4 higher conductivity values and rw4 higher turbidity and cod p 0 001 table 2 3 3

chironomids 21 taxa fishes 34 taxa turtles 3 taxa and birds 87 taxa were identified 67 were found in rw3 63 in rw4 48 in rw2 and 37 in rw1 taxonomic richness values were higher in the rural rws for benthic diatoms phytoplankton and birds in rw3 for macroinvertebrates and zooplankton and in rw4 for fishes and chironomids fig 3 the h index values fig 4 were higher in the rural rws for chironomids and phytoplankton in rw3 for macroinvertebrates benthic diatoms and zooplankton and in rw4 for fishes fig 4 density values were variable for the different taxonomic groups in the studied rws fig 5 macroinvertebrate density was higher in rw1 but chironomids showed clearly lower values in this rw bird density was higher in both rural rws in the four datasets analyzed by means of nmds analysis samples were ordered into two main groups depending on the land uses fig 6 the rural and peri urban groups were significantly different according to the anosim test results table 3 analyses based on environmental variables and taxonomic richness were the ones that most differentiated the rws according to their land use the analysis of environmental variables showed that the differences between groups were supported by significantly higher values of water temperature conductivity and cod in rural rws and significantly higher values of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in peri urban rws the s values of birds turtles phytoplankton chironomids and fishes were the most sensitive to land use the h values of phytoplankton chironomids and fishes showed the main differences between rural and peri urban rws concerning td birds and chironomids were the assemblages that showed the greatest differences according to land use 3 4 environmental variables vs biological descriptors rda analysis showed the first two axes accounted significantly p 0 01 for 79 of the variability of the response variables fig 7 four environmental variables were retained in the analysis water table total phosphorus cod and water temperature ordered from the highest to the lowest amount of variation explained total phosphorus concentration and water table left of the biplot together with water temperature and cod right of the biplot weighted heavily on axis 1 61 of the variability rws 1 and 2 are on the left of fig 7 related to the increase in the concentration of total phosphorus and depth of the water table rws 3 and 4 are on the right of fig 7 related to higher values of water temperature and cod the highest h and or s of birds fishes macroinvertebrates chironomids and phytoplankton were related to higher values of temperature and cod as well as the highest densities of birds and chironomids besides the highest density of fish specimens was related to greater values of total phosphorus and a deeper water table 4 discussion the present study shows that the impact of the activities in the peri urban environment on rws the deepening of the water table and the decline in surface water quality as well as the reduction in the richness diversity and total density of biotic assemblages was significantly greater than in the case of rural land use the groundwater level has been identified as a key factor in surface water permanence in the rws in the last decades the city of la plata has become one of the main intensive greenhouse horticulture production areas in argentina transforming rural areas into peri urban or urban ones lópez and rotger 2020 the population growth involved a change in land use and higher water demands for irrigation and human consumption thus the peri urban wetlands were strongly affected by the excessive groundwater extraction kruse 2015 cabral et al 2018 as was observed in rws 1 and 2 changes in the surface water groundwater relationship lead to the loss of the groundwater connection affecting the river baseflow and reducing the persistence of wetlands mainly in periods of low rainfall in addition our study showed that peri urban rws contained higher concentrations of phosphorus and total nitrogen these results agree with studies conducted on similar systems which have demonstrated how wetlands exposed to agriculture and urbanization function as nutrient sinks jordan et al 2011 cunha et al 2019 owing to agricultural activities agrochemicals were reported in the watercourses along which the peri urban rws occur herbicides fungicides and insecticides were identified in the bottom sediments of the carnaval stream with a total concentration of 3715 ng g 1 dw mac loughlin et al 2017 similar results were reported by rimoldi et al 2018 in the del gato stream also warning about high heavy metal concentrations some exceeding the guideline levels for the protection of aquatic life in accordance with argentine law on hazardous wastes no 24 051 93 on the other hand the cattle manure produced by the cows that occasionally entered into the rural rws to drinking water caused an increase in the water dissolved organic matter while their trampling increased the water turbidity this situation was more evident in rw4 the volume of surface water and its permanence in time are also modulators of the dynamics of biological communities neiff 1990 in our study the absence of surface water the deterioration of water quality and the pollution of peri urban rws affected the biotic structure as described below the assemblages of benthic diatoms were less diverse in peri urban rws with prevalence of tolerant to eutrophication and to organic matter taxa such as nitzschia palea n amphibia sellaphora pupula pseudofallacia monoculata gomphonema parvulum gómez and licursi 2001 licursi and gómez 2003 in relation to phytoplankton the relatively deeper water column at the rural rws favoured the development of a large number of euplanktonic species bauer 2009 such as crucigenia quadrata dictyosphaerium pulchellum d subsolitarium didymocystis bicellularis eutetramorus fotti lepocinclis limnophila and phacus longicauda on the other hand in the rws of urban areas with shallower water column depths and with highest nutrient concentrations the filamentous cyanobacteria jaaginema subtilissimum and phormidium articulatum and the pennal diatom nitzschia palea were dominant the zooplankton showed a similar pattern to phytoplankton in rural rws euplanktonic species represented by rotifers copepods and cladocers whose diets are mainly phytoplankton based generally predominated such as the rotifer keratella tropica and the nauplii larvae of cyclopoid copepods ringuelet 1962 claps et al 2004 shallow peri urban rws favoured the prevalence of detritivorous ticoplanktonic species related to the benthic community such as the testaceous amoebae difflugia arcella and euglypha the lower richness of rotifers in contrast to testaceous amoebae is recognized in the literature as a response to anthropic stressors bonecker et al 2013 likewise the assemblages of benthic macroinvertebrates were less diverse in peri urban rws this observation agrees with the one reported by solís et al 2016 for streams in the same study area these authors observed significant differences between the assemblages of streams of rural areas with or without agriculture with taxa being less tolerant to pollution in the latter in correspondence with these results we observed in the rural rws different macroinvertebrates recognized in the literature as being sensitive to eutrophication and organic matter including the gastropods uncancylus and hebetancylus ancylidae the insects americabaetis and campsurus ephemeroptera baetidae and polymitarcyidae respectively hexacylloepus and austrolimnius coleoptera elmidae hydroptila trichoptera hydroptilidae lestes odonata lestidae and the crab sylviocarcinus trichodactylidae barbour et al 1999 rodrigues capítulo et al 2001 in these rws the chironomids polypedilum and rheotanytarsus were best represented unlike what was observed in peri urban rws where chironomus was the best represented chironomid species fish assemblages were also more diverse in rural rws with a predominance of characiformes and siluriformes this assemblage structure is considered as a good environmental condition for assemblages of neotropical fish araujo et al 2003 ferreira and cassati 2006 in the case of fish assemblages from peri urban rws they showed a low number of species dominated by corydoras paleatus and cnesterodon decemmaculatus these species have morphological adaptations such as the upward orientation of their mouth to take dissolved oxygen in the uppermost layer of the water lewis 1970 kramer and mehegan 1981 and physiological ones such as a modification of the caudal portion of the intestine as an accessory air breathing organ plaul et al 2016 that enable their survival in low concentrations of dissolved oxygen and eutrophic environments both species have been reported as dominant in polluted environments in argentina and uruguay hued and bistoni 2005 chalar et al 2013 freshwater turtles were significantly affected by surface water instability the species collected are strictly dependent on the presence of surface water for periods longer than one year in part this is related to the mode of locomotion swimming turtles such as trachemys dorbigni and phrynops hilarii establish their populations exclusively in sites with a permanent water level while those with bottom walking locomotor mode such as hydromedusa tectifera are adapted to semi permanent water levels astort 1983 alcalde et al 2010 therefore swimming species were found only in rural rws where the surface water was permanent considering that the turtle populations are declining worldwide nickerson et al 2019 the information on the environmental conditions of the rws studied is essential to establish turtle management guidelines in the case of birds the rws permanently covered by water generate favourable conditions mainly for those of aquatic habits such as amazonetta brasiliensis chauna torquata cygnus melancoryphus and those belonging to the genus anas found in our study in the rural rws flooded grasslands bordering aquatic environments are used by birds that require grassland vegetation cover during breeding blanco 1999 as was observed in our study for example aramides ypecaha a cajaneus laterallus leucopyrrhus pardirallus sanguinolentus gallinula melanops g galeata fulica leucoptera phleocryptes melanops and tachuris rubrigastra these rws were also favourable for spartonoica maluroides a species considered vulnerable in argentina lópez lanús et al 2008 and almost threatened worldwide birdlife international 2019 the analyses of fishes and turtles in our study showed that if the watercourses that connect the rws with the río de la plata are not or are just scarcely modified it favours a greater richness and diversity of these assemblages by allowing their movement along the unpolluted and unhindered fluvial corridor for example fish species from the río de la plata estuary such as juveniles of prochilodus lineatus and megaleporinus obtusidens were found in rural rws suggesting that these species use wetlands as nursery areas according to gibbs 2000 most species that depend on wetlands live in multiple local populations sustained by occasional migrations the same occurred with the turtles t dorbigni and p hilarii usually found on the riverside of the estuary alcalde et al 2012 saibene et al 2012 and only collected in the rural rws in our study our results showed that the biodiversity is more threatened in those rws impacted by agriculture and urbanization due to the water demands for human consumption and productive activities according to epa 2015 wetland conservation makes it necessary to consider that hydrological basins are integrated into multiple spatial and temporal scales through surface and groundwater flows transport and transformation of physical and chemical materials and movements of organisms along with human activities in their environment agricultural land uses degrade streams by increasing nonpoint inputs of pollutants impacting riparian and stream channel habitat and altering flows allan 2004 some studies have documented declines in water quality habitat and biological assemblages as the extent of agricultural land increases within catchments roth et al 1996 song et al 2009 the increase in human population in the pampean region implies a higher demand for food and water requiring changes in the land use of rural areas rodrigues capítulo et al 2010 in addition the future climate change scenarios for the pampean plain which predict a moderate increase in rainfall will favour the displacement of the agricultural frontier reaching or affecting rws from areas not yet destined for agriculture the conservation of rws requires political decisions focused on hydrological problems at a regional scale as well as an urbanization planning that prevents the progress on wetlands to guarantee the permanence of these environments and the benefits they provide rodrigues capítulo et al 2020 lopez and rotger 2020 therefore for the conservation of rws the status of the upstream and downstream basins of rws must be addressed to ensure a minimum density of healthy wetlands in human dominated landscapes favouring the conservation of biodiversity and the benefits that rws provide to ecosystems and humans the multidisciplinary approach of the present study represents a baseline in the management guidelines to improve the conservation state of these environments and can be replicated in rws with similar climatic and hydrological characteristics around the world finally recognizing the role of rws their monitoring should be considered as a key to assess the status of the watercourses to which these wetlands are linked 5 conclusions the comparative analysis of the studied rws shows two contrasting environmental qualities rural rws are closer to the natural pampean environment whereas peri urban rws are strongly affected by human activity the significant deepening of the water table due to agricultural practices and extraction of water for urbanizations together with the nutrient inputs to watercourses has had detrimental effects on biodiversity the experience obtained in the rws with a strong deterioration of the basins suggests that in those rws that still maintain conditions close to the natural ones the socioeconomic development must be subject to guidelines that derive from an integrated management of basins and sustainable urban planning declaration of competing interest none declared acknowledgments financial support for this study was provided by pict 2015 1342 agencia

965,riparian areas of riverine plains develop extensive floodable areas named riverine wetlands which are essential to the water cycle balance and ecosystem dynamics in this study we contrasted the hydrological and physicochemical variables of riverine wetlands of both peri urban areas impacted by intensive farming and those of rural areas with the indicators of the biotic structure taxonomic richness shannon diversity and total density of benthic diatoms phytoplankton zooplankton macroinvertebrates chironomids fishes turtles and birds the study was performed on riverine waters of the pampean plain argentina with four seasonal samplings conducted in 2017 2018 our results showed that the significant deepening of the groundwater level caused by aquifer overexploitation in peri urban areas as well as the declining surface water quality with higher phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations affected the taxonomic richness diversity and total density of the biotic assemblages of riverine wetlands the taxonomic richness of birds turtles phytoplankton chironomids and fishes was the most sensitive to land use phytoplankton chironomid and fish diversity showed the greatest differences between rural and peri urban riverine waters while the total density of chironomids and birds showed the greatest differences according to land use the results suggest that the socioeconomic development in those riverine wetlands that still maintain conditions close to the natural ones needs to be subject to guidelines derived from integrated basin management and sustainable

of diversity and ecosystem services zhao et al 2019 the increasing human population determines a rise in the demand for water energy and food while these resources become progressively scarcer covarrubias 2019 therefore this requires changes in the use of natural resources and land uses to supply these demands which have an impact on natural ecosystems wetlands are impacted by anthropogenic

centers covering peri urban and rural areas which affects the structure and dynamics of wetlands ehrenfeld 2000 farming activities lead to groundwater over exploitation and water eutrophication caused by the increase in phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations due to the overuse of fertilizers moreover the input of organic matter generated by this activity reduces the water dissolved oxygen while pesticides produce harmful effects on biodiversity beketov et al 2013 epa 2015 the expansion of urbanization over rural and natural areas is also observed in south america pimentel et al 1998 ryder and brown 2000 including the pampean plain the expansion of cities transforms rural spaces into urban ones with rural urban interfaces relying on the development of infrastructure and services to make the resources of their surroundings profitable thus damaging or removing wetlands martin ortega et al 2015 butsch and heinkel 2020 the pampean plain is a vast territory of the neotropical region dominated by low topographic slope and a large number of wetlands its hydrological dynamics is characterized by alternating phases of drought and water excesses driven by climatic phenomena such as the el niño southern oscillation enso sala et al 1998 the rainfall regimes and geomorphology develop riverine wetlands in fluvial floodplains which are fed by the overflow of rivers and streams ringuelet 1962 brinson et al 1995 or by groundwater depending on the phase of the hydroperiod junk et al 1989 finlayson et al 2013 this plain is one of the most fertile territories in argentina and therefore one of the main sources of income for the country in the form of grain and beef exports rubio et al 2019 until the early 20th century most of the rws in the pampean plain were impacted by extensive livestock production and small scale agriculture in this last century the strong development of urban centers has increased the demand for food and water as is the case of the city of la plata currently inhabited by almost 1 million people establishing a stressful social and ecological scenario matteucci and morello 2009 frediani 2013 these activities usually cover many rws in this region and overexploit the groundwater resource auge 2005 kruse et al 2017 until 1955 the whole water supply for irrigation industry and drinking was exclusively extracted from wells placed in the centre of the town which caused the saline front to advance from the coastal plain therefore new wells were built in the peri urban area and the service was supplemented with surface water from the río de la plata estuary currently groundwater is exploited mainly in peri urban and rural areas in the south of the city of la plata with the contribution of over 80 hm3 year 1 generating the deepening of the regional water table kruse et al 2014 the need to develop a more sustainable approach to the management of water resources as well as to protect the ecosystems where these resources are found is essential particularly in highly productive areas such as the pampean plain considering that biotic and abiotic responses are indicators of environmental change offering powerful tools to make decisions on the management of river corridors robinson et al 2002 in this study we analyse the hydrological and physicochemical variables and indicators of biotic structure taxonomic richness shannon diversity and total density to contrast rws of peri urban areas affected by intensive farming with those of rural areas the hypothesis to be tested is that the increase in demand for food and water associated with the advance of urban areas and intensive agriculture over rural areas promotes significant changes in the hydrology water table physicochemical variables and biotic structure of the rws 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the pampean plain in the ne of the province of buenos aires argentina fig 1 with a humid to subhumid climate an average annual rainfall of 1060 mm year 1 and an evapotranspiration of 783 mm year 1 laurencena et al 2010 the stability in the permanence of surface water in the wetlands of this region is given by the contribution of groundwater to the base level of the watercourses deluchi et al 2005 to maximize the understanding of the effects of urban resource demands on rws and to minimize the variability given by natural hydrological and meteorological regimes rws located in the same region near the city of la plata were selected such rws are located along the carnaval rw1 del gato rw2 cajaravillas rw3 and chubichaminí rw4 streams with their catchments being subjected to different land uses table 1 rws 1 and 2 are in the vicinities of the urban center of the city of la plata where farming is the main anthropogenic activity downstream the carnaval and del gato streams run through densely populated areas and their channels have been heavily impacted by anthropic action channelization piping etc conditioning their connection with the estuary of the río de la plata the over extraction for crop irrigation and drinking water supply of the city of la plata and its surroundings has caused the local deepening of the water tables particularly in the southern sector of the city fig 1b this has contributed to the loss of groundwater supply to the base flow of the streams where these rws occur deluchi et al 2005 garcía and zanandrea 2017 rw3 and 4 are located in rural areas of the city of la plata where extensive livestock production is the main anthropic activity these rws receive groundwater and surface water with a greater volume being supplied by the former both rws flow downstream through rural areas that do not hinder their natural drainage to the río de la plata estuary the rws studied are inhabited by a diverse aquatic vegetation with a cover greater than 60 with assemblages mainly represented by palustrine species such as typha latifolia schoenoplectus californicus ludwigia peploides hydrocotyle ranunculoides among the most frequent and abundant as well as the exotic species iris pseudacorus and among the floating ones lemna minuta zanotti and gómez 2019 facultative species were observed close to watercourses such as hydrocotyle bonariensis nothoscordum bonariense lessingianthus rubricaulis alternanthera philoxeroides bacopa monnieri eryngium ebracteatum and polygonum punctatum mostly represented in rural rws following the classification of manzano et al 2002 the studied ecosystems can be characterized as continental epigenetic hypogenic or mixed wetlands with open drainage a seasonal hydroperiod with greater flow in winter due to lower evapotranspiration and a renewal rate of less than 25 per year 2 2 sampling seasonal samplings were performed in autumn march 2017 winter june 2017 spring november 2017 and summer february 2018 in the four rws the methodological techniques implemented regarding the land use meteorological hydrological and biological indicators of the rws are described below 2 1 1 land uses meteorology and hydrology of rws the land use characterization followed the criteria of laurencena et al 2010 the regional characterization of the basin was performed based on landsat 8 etm satellite images air temperature and rainfall data were recorded from a weather station davis vantage pro2 installed in the study area the relationship between the topographic and groundwater levels of the rw was obtained by differential gps in rws with shallow water tables data loggers solinst model 3001 ltc levelogger edge produced continuous records of groundwater levels with a 1 hour sampling frequency during the study period drillings reaching a final depth of 8 m b g s metres below ground surface were made with a hand operated rotary drilling system to identify the position of the water table isophreatic maps were drawn to determine the relationship between rws and groundwater a geographic information system gis was used to integrate the data obtained the base cartography was made including raster and vector layers of satellite images topographic and land use maps sample points and groundwater flow maps the watershed characterization was performed with a digital elevation model dem from an image captured by the alos satellite equipped with a palsar phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar radar sensor with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m tools of spatial analysis for fill flow accumulation and flow direction were used to delimit the drainage basin finally the digitalization of the drainage network was conducted using a raster calculator tool to identify the main and secondary drainage networks and the hydrological characteristics to be analyzed at different scales of detail 2 1 2 physicochemical characteristics of the water conductivity turbidity ph percentage of dissolved oxygen saturation and temperature were measured in situ with a multiparameter device horiba water

from an area of 0 4 m x 0 4 m to analyze the assemblages of chironomids diptera chironomidae specimens of chironomids were identified following andersen et al 2013 and silva et al 2018 quantified and expressed as individuals m 2 fish sampling was conducted with a seine net width 15 m height 1 1 m mesh size 10 mm between opposite knots cod end length 2 m and mesh size 5 mm between opposite knots and a push net width 0 36 cm height 0 46 cm mesh size 1 1 mm handle 2 m the sampling effort was the same in each site consisting in one seine haul by one person in each shore along 20 m upstream and five fishing attempts with the push net in shallower or vegetated areas where the seine net could not be used easily identified species were counted in the field and returned alive to the water the remaining specimens were euthanized with an overdose of anesthetic benzocaine in excess initially preserved in 10 formalin which was later replaced by 70 ethanol for laboratory identification fish specimens were identified following ringuelet et al 1967 almirón et al 2015 and mirande and koerber 2015 fishing gear was standardized for the estimation of individuals m 2 turtle sampling methods depended on the depth of each site in the rws in shallower sites turtles were counted by the same operator following the methodology of muddling reported by bury et al 2012 by direct visual and or tactile inspection in deeper sites trotlines without hooks were used along 600 m following semeñiuk et al 2017 turtles were identified in the sample site following cabrera 1998 and immediately released alive to analyze the bird assemblage a linear 1000 m long transect running parallel to the watercourse was sampled for 60 min starting 15 min before sunrise time of sunrise was obtained from a gps atlasgps the same operator moved at a constant speed identifying and counting all observed individuals or songbirds heard along the width of the rw and a lateral strip of 50 m specimens were identified following rodríguez mata et al 2006 and ridgely and tudor 2009 and the nomenclature followed remsen et al 2016 2 1 4 statistical analysis the taxonomic richness of each assemblage was determined from the number of taxa identified in each sampling date the shannon wiener diversity index was calculated considering the taxonomic richness and the abundance of taxa shannon and weaver 1963 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analyses were performed by sorting the rws according to four datasets the environmental variables taxonomic richness s shannon wiener diversity index h and total density td of each taxonomic group the variable values were standardized subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation environmental variables except for ph and water table depth and td were previously ln x 1 transformed distance matrices were made using the euclidean distance method differences between rws in terms of the land use factor rural vs peri urban were tested by anosim analysis in each ordination and the method of point biserial correlation was used to identify the variables explaining differences related to land uses the analyses were performed with vegan oksanen et al 2013 and indicator species de cáceres et al 2010 packages from r core development team software r core team 2018 the relationships between biological variables average values of s h and td of phytoplankton zooplankton macroinvertebrates chironomids fishes and birds and the average values of the environmental variables obtained for each rw were analyzed through redundancy analysis rda previously a detrended correspondence analysis dca was performed to determine whether the response model of the biological variables was linear or unimodal the biological variables were log10 x 1 transformed to obtain a normal distribution or an approximation and environmental variables were standardized ter braak and smilauer 1988 since the maximum gradient length did not exceed a standard deviation the rda analysis was applied ter braak 1986 environmental variables were tested individually by means of the monte carlo test the variance inflation factor for all variables was 5 indicating absence of multicollinearity ter braak 1986 ter braak and smilauer 1988 a monte carlo permutation test was performed to obtain the overall significance of the ordination 3 results 3 1 land uses meteorology and hydrology upstream from rws 1 and 2 the land use is predominantly urban 68 and 95 respectively while the remaining area shows a peri urban land use rws 3 and 4 are surrounded by rural land fig 1a rainfall average in the sampled periods fluctuated between 80 mm march 2017 and 0 5 mm february 2018 the latter during an intense drought within a la niña phase of the enso phenomenon temperature ranged between 12 5 c june 2017 and 24 c february 2018 fig 2 hydrological parameters are shown in table 1 the anosim revealed that the water table levels of rural rws were significantly more superficial than those of peri urban rws in which the water table level was deeper than 10 m b g s the last two rws were shallower and endured a retraction of the humid zone during summer 3 2 physicochemical characteristics the absence of surface water during summer in rws 1 and 2 did not allow to obtain physicochemical and biotic samples in the remaining seasons these rws showed

benthic diatoms phytoplankton and birds in rw3 for macroinvertebrates and zooplankton and in rw4 for fishes and chironomids fig 3 the h index values fig 4 were higher in the rural rws for chironomids and phytoplankton in rw3 for macroinvertebrates benthic diatoms and zooplankton and in rw4 for fishes fig 4 density values were variable for the different taxonomic groups in the studied rws fig 5 macroinvertebrate density was higher in rw1 but chironomids showed clearly lower values in this rw bird density was higher in both rural rws in the four datasets analyzed by means of nmds analysis samples were ordered into two main groups depending on the land uses fig 6 the rural and peri urban groups were significantly different according to the anosim test results table 3 analyses based on environmental variables and taxonomic richness were the ones that most differentiated the rws according to their land use the analysis of environmental variables showed that the differences between groups were supported by significantly higher values of water temperature conductivity and cod in rural rws and significantly higher values of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in peri urban rws the s values of birds turtles phytoplankton chironomids and fishes were the most sensitive to land use the h values of phytoplankton chironomids and fishes showed the main differences between rural and peri urban rws concerning td birds and chironomids were the assemblages that showed the greatest differences according to land use 3 4 environmental variables vs biological descriptors rda analysis

temperature and cod right of the biplot weighted heavily on axis 1 61 of the variability rws 1 and 2 are on the left of fig 7 related to the increase in the concentration of total phosphorus and depth

were related to higher values of temperature and cod as well as the highest densities of birds and chironomids besides the highest density of fish specimens was related to greater values of total phosphorus and a deeper water table 4 discussion the present study shows that the impact of the activities in the peri urban environment on rws the deepening of the water table and the decline in surface water quality as well as the reduction in the richness diversity and total density of biotic assemblages was significantly greater than in the case of rural land use the groundwater level has been identified as a key factor in surface water permanence in the rws in the last decades the city of la plata has become one of the main intensive greenhouse horticulture production areas in argentina transforming rural areas into peri urban or urban ones lópez and rotger 2020 the population growth involved a change in land use and higher water demands for irrigation and human consumption thus the peri urban wetlands were strongly affected by the excessive groundwater extraction kruse 2015 cabral et al 2018 as was observed in rws 1 and 2 changes in the surface water groundwater relationship lead to the loss of the groundwater connection affecting the river baseflow and reducing the persistence of wetlands mainly in periods of low rainfall in addition our study showed that peri urban rws contained higher concentrations of phosphorus and total nitrogen these results agree with studies conducted on similar systems which have demonstrated how wetlands exposed to agriculture and urbanization function as nutrient sinks jordan et al 2011 cunha et al 2019 owing to agricultural activities agrochemicals were reported in the watercourses along which the peri urban rws occur herbicides fungicides and insecticides were identified in the bottom sediments of the carnaval stream with a total concentration of 3715 ng g 1 dw mac loughlin et al 2017 similar results were reported by rimoldi et al 2018 in the del gato stream also warning about high heavy metal concentrations some exceeding the guideline levels for the protection of aquatic life in accordance with argentine law on hazardous wastes no 24 051 93 on the other hand the cattle manure produced by the cows that occasionally entered into the rural rws to drinking water caused an increase in the water dissolved organic matter while their trampling increased the water turbidity this situation was more evident in rw4 the volume of surface water and its permanence in time are also modulators of the dynamics of biological communities neiff 1990 in our study the absence of surface water the deterioration of water quality and the pollution of peri urban rws affected the biotic structure as described below the assemblages of benthic diatoms were less diverse in peri urban rws with prevalence of tolerant to eutrophication and to organic matter taxa such as nitzschia palea n amphibia sellaphora pupula pseudofallacia monoculata gomphonema parvulum gómez and licursi 2001 licursi and gómez 2003 in relation to phytoplankton the relatively deeper water column at the rural rws favoured the development of a large number of euplanktonic species bauer 2009 such as crucigenia quadrata dictyosphaerium pulchellum d subsolitarium didymocystis bicellularis eutetramorus fotti lepocinclis limnophila and phacus longicauda on the other hand in the rws of urban areas with shallower water column depths and with highest nutrient concentrations the filamentous cyanobacteria jaaginema subtilissimum and phormidium articulatum and the pennal diatom nitzschia palea were dominant the zooplankton showed a similar pattern to phytoplankton in rural rws euplanktonic species represented by rotifers copepods and cladocers whose diets are mainly phytoplankton based generally predominated such as the rotifer keratella tropica and the nauplii larvae of cyclopoid copepods ringuelet 1962 claps et al 2004 shallow peri urban rws favoured the prevalence of detritivorous ticoplanktonic species related to the benthic community such as the testaceous amoebae difflugia arcella and euglypha the lower richness of rotifers in contrast to testaceous amoebae is recognized in the literature as a response to anthropic stressors bonecker et al 2013 likewise the assemblages of benthic macroinvertebrates were less diverse in peri urban rws this observation agrees with the one reported by solís et al 2016 for streams in the same study area these authors observed significant differences between the assemblages of streams of rural areas with or without agriculture with taxa being less tolerant to pollution in the latter in correspondence with these results we observed in the rural rws different macroinvertebrates recognized in the literature as being sensitive to eutrophication and organic matter including the gastropods uncancylus and hebetancylus ancylidae the insects americabaetis and campsurus ephemeroptera baetidae and polymitarcyidae respectively hexacylloepus and austrolimnius coleoptera elmidae hydroptila trichoptera hydroptilidae lestes odonata lestidae and the crab sylviocarcinus trichodactylidae barbour et al 1999 rodrigues capítulo et al 2001 in these rws the chironomids polypedilum and rheotanytarsus were best represented unlike what was observed in peri urban rws where chironomus was the best represented chironomid species fish assemblages were also more diverse in rural rws with a predominance of characiformes and siluriformes this assemblage structure is considered as a good environmental condition for assemblages of neotropical fish araujo et al 2003 ferreira and cassati 2006 in the case of fish assemblages from peri urban rws they showed a low number of species dominated by corydoras paleatus and cnesterodon decemmaculatus these species have morphological adaptations such as the upward orientation of their mouth to take dissolved oxygen in the uppermost layer of the water lewis 1970 kramer and mehegan 1981 and physiological ones such as a modification of the caudal portion of the intestine as an accessory air breathing organ plaul et al 2016 that enable their survival in low concentrations of dissolved oxygen and eutrophic environments both species have been reported as dominant in polluted environments in argentina and uruguay hued and bistoni 2005 chalar et al 2013 freshwater turtles were significantly affected by surface water instability the species collected are strictly dependent on the presence of surface water for periods longer than one year in part this is related to the mode of locomotion swimming turtles such as trachemys dorbigni and phrynops hilarii establish their populations exclusively in sites with a permanent water level while those with bottom walking locomotor mode such as hydromedusa tectifera are adapted to semi permanent water levels astort 1983 alcalde et al 2010 therefore swimming species were found only in rural rws where the surface water was permanent considering that the turtle populations are declining worldwide nickerson et al 2019 the information on the environmental conditions of the rws studied is essential to establish turtle management guidelines in the case of birds the rws permanently covered by water generate favourable conditions mainly for those of aquatic habits such as amazonetta brasiliensis chauna torquata cygnus melancoryphus and those belonging to the genus anas found in our study in the rural rws flooded grasslands bordering aquatic environments are used by birds that require grassland vegetation cover during breeding blanco 1999 as was observed in our study for example aramides ypecaha a cajaneus laterallus leucopyrrhus pardirallus sanguinolentus gallinula melanops g galeata fulica leucoptera phleocryptes melanops and tachuris rubrigastra these rws were also favourable for spartonoica maluroides a species considered vulnerable in argentina lópez lanús et al 2008 and almost threatened worldwide birdlife international 2019 the analyses of fishes and turtles in our study showed that if the watercourses that connect the rws with the río de la plata are not or are just scarcely modified it favours a greater richness and diversity of these assemblages by allowing their movement along the unpolluted and unhindered fluvial corridor for example fish species from the río de la plata estuary such as juveniles of prochilodus lineatus and megaleporinus obtusidens were found in rural rws suggesting that these species use wetlands as nursery areas according to gibbs 2000 most species that depend on wetlands live in multiple local populations sustained by occasional migrations the same occurred with the turtles t dorbigni and p hilarii usually found on the riverside of the estuary alcalde et al 2012 saibene et al 2012 and only collected in the rural rws in our study our results showed that the biodiversity is more threatened in those rws impacted by agriculture and urbanization due to the water demands for human consumption and productive activities according to epa 2015 wetland conservation makes it necessary to consider that hydrological basins are integrated into multiple spatial and temporal scales through surface and groundwater flows transport and transformation of physical and chemical materials and movements of organisms along with human activities in their environment agricultural land uses degrade streams by increasing nonpoint inputs of pollutants impacting riparian and stream channel habitat and altering flows allan 2004 some studies have documented declines in water quality habitat and biological assemblages as the extent of agricultural land increases within catchments roth et al 1996 song et al 2009 the increase in human population in the pampean region implies a higher demand for food and water requiring changes in the land use of rural areas rodrigues capítulo et al 2010 in addition the future climate change scenarios for the pampean plain which predict a moderate increase in rainfall will favour the displacement of the agricultural frontier reaching or affecting rws from areas not yet destined for agriculture the conservation of rws requires political decisions focused on hydrological problems at a regional scale as well as an urbanization planning that prevents the progress on wetlands to guarantee the permanence of these environments and the benefits they provide rodrigues capítulo et al 2020 lopez and rotger 2020 therefore for the conservation of rws the status of the upstream and downstream basins of rws must be addressed to ensure a minimum density of healthy wetlands in human dominated landscapes favouring the conservation of biodiversity and the benefits that rws provide to ecosystems and humans the multidisciplinary approach of the present study represents a baseline in the management guidelines to improve the conservation state of these environments and can be replicated in rws with similar climatic and hydrological characteristics around the world finally recognizing the role of rws their monitoring should be considered as a key to assess the status of the watercourses to which these wetlands are linked 5 conclusions the comparative analysis of the studied rws shows two contrasting environmental qualities rural rws are closer to the natural pampean environment whereas peri urban rws are strongly affected by human activity the significant deepening of the water table due to agricultural practices and extraction of water for urbanizations together with the nutrient inputs to watercourses has had detrimental effects on biodiversity the experience obtained in the rws with a strong deterioration of the basins suggests that in those rws that still maintain conditions close to the natural ones the socioeconomic development must be subject to guidelines that derive from an integrated management of basins and sustainable urban planning declaration of competing interest none declared acknowledgments financial support for this study was provided by pict 2015 1342 agencia

966,the progression of water erosion patterns from rill to gully erosion significantly affects the level of soil aggregate degradation and thereby stimulates variations in the biochemical mechanisms controlling the oc mineralization ratio these conditions can affect the exchange of carbon from biosphere to atmosphere we examined the effect of erosion progression on the physical and biochemical soil properties controlling the c mineralization ratio within the original soils eroded by the rill and gully processes aggregate size distribution geometric mean diameter gmd mean weight diameter mwd exchangeable cations dissolved organic carbon doc microbial respiration and microbial biomass carbon mbc were measured despite the greater proportion of the labile components of oc in the rill soils the c mineralization ratio exhibited lower values in these soils compared with the gully soils a higher value of gmd mwd and exchangeable cations were observed in the rill soils the results of the stepwise multiple regressions illustrated that the higher c mineralization ratio in the gully soils is significantly positively correlated with doc and microbial respiration by contrast the lower c mineralization ratio in the rill soils was found to be significantly negatively related to the gmd doc and mwd these variations may be attributed to the effects of the increasing soil aggregate stability on lower vulnerability of labile organic carbon to microbial mineralization the lower transport capacity of the rill erosion process causes a less loss of soc and micro aggregate compared with the gully erosion process the labile fractions of soc could bond with clay fractions and exchangeable cations to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregates encouraging higher resistance of doc against microbial mineralization in the rill soils this conceptual approach of combining our field survey data with an empirical model aids in a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms controlling the c mineralization ratio under the progression of soil erosion keywords geomorphic processes aggregate stability erosion progression soil degradation 1 introduction detachment and transportation of soil particles by overland flow are the most important causes of land degradation in water erosion prone environments that significantly affect the global carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems mohseni and salar 2021 different stages of linear erosion development such as rilling and gullying can irreversibly damage the soil aggregate properties smith et al 2001 chaplot et al 2005 su et al 2010 soil aggregate is recognized as a major factor protecting the soc against decomposition and mineralization by soil microbial respiration quijano et al 2019 the progression of water erosion patterns from rill to gully erosion significantly affects the level of soil aggregate degradation physiochemical indicators such as particles size distribution geometric mean diameter mean weight diameter and labile components of soc including dissolved soc and microbial biomass carbon six et al 2000 nael et al 2004 and thereby stimulates changes in the biochemical mechanisms controlling the oc mineralization ratio within the original soils eroded by the rill and gully erosion processes the rill and gully have recognized as two stages of erosion progression that different driving forces encourage the appearance and development of these erosional landforms jiang et al 2019 the rill erosion process occurs due to the concentration of the flow into small channels that their depth is less than 10 cm in this condition the concentrated flow forces detached particles from the walls and at the bottom of the rill rill head cut migration and sidewall expansion affected by the overland flow encourage the development of rill channels into the ephemeral gullies that are larger than rills in terms of length and width and smaller than classical gullies finally classical gullies are referred to the stage of channel development where land is taken out of the production in this type of erosion gullies cannot be removed by tillage operation rill and ephemeral gully erosion are the transitional phases to irreversible states of soil erosion i e classical gullies therefore geo conservation and restoration efforts in these stages can help to prevent the occurrence of such irreversible transitions in initial erosion stages such as the rill erosion process labile oc rich topsoil layer strongly removes by raindrop energy owens et al 2002 mueller nedebock et al 2016 rill head cut migration and sidewall expansion affected by the overland flow encourage the development of rill channels into the gully causing the degradation of a larger amount of oc rich topsoil that is combined with deeper horizons poor in oc bryan 2000 nadeu et al 2011 these conditions weaken the aggregate structural stability in the original soils eroded by the gullies compared with the rill erosion schiettecatte et al 2008 therefore variability in the depth of the soil layer eroded by the different erosion stages significantly affects the quantity of labile components of soc and the characteristics of soil aggregates which can be considered as the indicators for evaluating the soil degradation levels su et al 2010 in the original soils influenced by the rill and gully erosion processes these conditions can be responsible for variability in mechanisms controlling the level of soc vulnerability to microbial respiration under the different erosion patterns to date many studies have focused on the role of different water erosion stages such as interrill rill and gully erosion in soc cycling roose et al 2006 zhang et al 2006 kuhn et al 2009 huang et al 2010 hemelryck et al 2010 nadeu et al 2011 cantón et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 quijano et al 2019 the majority of studies in this field investigated the impacts of water erosion patterns on the dynamics of soc during sediment transport and deposition processes these studies showed that different erosion processes could cause a preferential accumulation of soc in deposited sediments however the fate of the original soils eroded by the rill and gully erosion processes and their function on the physical and biochemical soil properties controlling the vulnerability level of soc to microbial mineralization have been extensively neglected in this study we illustrate the impact of different erosion stages including the rill and gully erosion processes on the relationship pattern between the

controlling the c mineralization ratio within the original soils eroded by the rill and gully erosion processes table 4 displays the results of the multiple linear stepwise regressions which indicate that the independent variables controlling the c mineralization ratio differed significantly under the different erosion patterns in the case of the rill erosion process independent factors that controlled the c mineralization ratio included gmd doc and mwd whereas a combination of variables of vwc doc and soil microbial respiration affected the c mineralization ratio in the original soils eroded by the gully the regression results showed the highly significant negative linear relationships of gmd doc and mwd with the c mineralization ratio in the original soils eroded by the rills whereas the gully soils indicated the statistically significant positive linear relationships of vwc doc and soil microbial respiration with the c mineralization ratio further the results of the pearson correlation analysis explain the relationship between some predictor controls affecting the c mineralization ratio under the rill and gully erosion processes fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the original soils eroded by the rill and gully processes indicated that the correlation between doc and soil stability indicators mwd and gmd is significant and positive this relationship shows that the labile fractions of oc have a crucial impact on the formation of soil aggregates and subsequently higher stability of the soil the greater aggregate stability causes the lower vulnerability of labile organic carbon to the mineralization and then causes the greater doc 4 discussion despite extensive research on the role of different water erosion stages such as interrill rill and gully erosion processes in organic carbon cycling within deposited sediments schiettecatte et al 2008 kuhn et al 2009 huang et al 2010 nadeu et al 2011 cantón et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 quijano et al 2019 there is no dedicated study showing the impact of the progression of soil erosion on the fate of the eroded soils and its function on the physical and biochemical soil characteristics controlling the c mineralization ratio the results of the multiple regressions illustrate how the different erosion stages affect the relationship pattern between the c mineralization ratio and the associated physiochemical edaphic factors the findings highlighted significant differences in the factors impacting on the c mineralization ratio over erosion progression table 4 the greater c mineralization ratio in the gully soils is significantly positively correlated with vwc doc and soil microbial respiration contrary to expectation despite the generally greater proportion of labile components of oc mbc and doc in the original soils eroded by the rill erosion process the c mineralization ratio represented lower values in these soils tables 3 4 further the c mineralization ratio exhibited a negative relationship with the gmd doc and mwd in the rill soils table 4 this result contradicts the findings of previous studies that show an increase in labile organic carbon preferentially stimulates soil microbial respiration and c mineralization franco otero et al 2012 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the variations in the relationship patterns between the c mineralization ratio and the associated edaphic variables within the rill and gully soils can explain the impacts of the relationship between the soil stability indicators and doc on the control of the c mineralization ratio under the different erosion stages table 4 and fig 3 the soil aggregate size distribution and its characteristics including the mwd and gmd are the most fundamental physical characteristics that significantly affect the vulnerability rate of doc contained in eroded soils to microbial mineralization meskini vishkaee davatgar 2018 on the other hand labile components of oc are the determinant factors of soil degradation status marchetti et al 2012 due to their impacts on the soil structural stability characteristics the negative relationship between the c mineralization ratio and doc in the rill soils can be interpreted by the effects of increasing soil aggregate stability i e gmd and mwd on enhancing physical soc protection causing lower vulnerability of labile organic carbon to microbial mineralization although the distributions of some sized aggregates in the studied soils did not show apparent trends the gmd and mwd represented the characterizations caused by the different erosion stages table 2 the higher values of mwd and gmd showed the greater structural stability of the original soils eroded by the rills compared with the gully erosion process as shown in fig 3 the labile fractions of oc have a crucial impact on the formation of soil aggregates and subsequently higher stability of the soil the rill erosion process is restricted to the surface soil layers shi et al 2012 jiang et al 2019 although oc rich topsoil is detached and transported through rill erosion the lower transport capacity of this process causes a less soc loss in the eroded soils compared with the gully erosion process therefore the labile fractions of oc could bond with clay fractions and exchangeable cations variables that showed greater concentration in the rill soils table 3 to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregates desrochers et al 2020 these conditions facilitate higher stability of the rill soils increasing mwd and gmd and subsequently enhanced physical protection of labile organic carbon against microbial respiration in the original soils eroded by the rills by contrast the higher capacity of the gully erosion process to transport a larger amount of oc rich topsoil that is combined with deeper horizons poor in oc bryan 2000 nadeu et al 2011 promoted the breakdown of soil aggregates and organic mineral complexes which exposed the soc to microbial mineralization as a result reduced physical protection of soc might be responsible for the positive relationship between the c mineralization ratio and doc in the gully soils our findings showed that fluctuations in the proportion of labile components of soc and the level of soil aggregate stability under the different erosion patterns could significantly vary the biochemical mechanisms controlling the c mineralization ratio disturbing the soil c flux balance in terms of aggregate size distribution only the micro aggregates showed significant differences between the different erosion patterns the rill and gully erosion processes have a high potential for the breakdown and dispersion of macro aggregates by runoff the heavy water erosion causes a portion of the coarse size aggregates being disintegrated to small size aggregates by mechanical agitation resultant from the raindrop and the fast runoff under such erosive processes in addition the continued detachment and entrainment of different soil layers by the rill and gully erosion processes exacerbate the weathering of macro aggregates stimulating the production of more micro aggregates however the rill and gully erosion processes show the different amounts of the transportation of eroded soils that could cause the statistically significant differences of micro aggregates between the rills and gullies the lower transport capacity of the rill erosion process encourages lower micro aggregate losses compared with the gully erosion process the soc contained in the micro aggregates is inaccessible to microbial decomposition over long term timescales virto et al 2010 schweizer et al 2019 therefore despite potentially higher microbial activity in the rill soils the increasing micro aggregate promotes greater resistance of soc against mineralization the c mineralization ratio and soil microbial respiration originated from the decomposition of organic matter have recognized as the most important sources of co2 flux carbon loss from the soil surface to the atmosphere conant et al 2000 esch et al 2016 li et al 2017 mahmoudzadeh et al 2020 our findings highlight that variations in the level of soil aggregate stability due to the nature of rill and gully erosion processes could vary the relationship patterns between the c mineralization ratio and the associated edaphic variables encouraging hot spots of soil carbon reservoir and co2 flux 5 conclusions the present study quantified the impact of the rill and gully erosion processes on biochemical mechanisms controlling the c mineralization ratio despite the labile components of organic carbon were considerably higher in the original soils eroded by the rill erosion the c mineralization ratio significantly became lower in the rill soils compared with the gully soils this can probably be explained by the impact of the interaction between the aggregate stability indicators and doc on the formation of soil aggregates that could significantly decrease the soc vulnerability to microbial mineralization the rill and gully erosion processes exhibit the different amounts of the eroded material from soil with different aggregation degrees which cause the distinguishing ratio of c mineralization rill head cut migration and sidewall expansion affected by the overland flow promote the development of rill channels into the gully causing the transportation of a larger amount of oc rich topsoil that is combined with deeper horizons poor in oc this condition degrades soil structure and weakens aggregate stability in the original soils eroded by the gully erosion by contrast the lower transport capacity of the rill erosion process causes lower losses of soc and micro aggregate the labile fractions of soc can bond with clay fractions and exchangeable cations to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregates this condition stimulates less vulnerability of doc to microbial mineralization in the rill soils compared with the gully soils our findings illustrated the impacts of the different erosion stages on variability in the relationship patterns between the c mineralization ratio and the associated edaphic variables encouraging hot spots of soil carbon reservoir and co2 flux within water erosion prone environments declaration of competing interest none declared ethical statement authors state

966,the progression of water erosion patterns from rill to gully erosion significantly affects the level of soil aggregate degradation and thereby stimulates variations in the biochemical mechanisms controlling the oc mineralization ratio these conditions can affect the exchange of carbon from biosphere to atmosphere we examined the effect of erosion progression on the physical and biochemical soil properties controlling the c mineralization ratio within the original soils eroded by the rill and gully processes aggregate size distribution geometric mean diameter gmd mean weight diameter mwd exchangeable cations dissolved organic carbon doc microbial respiration and microbial biomass carbon mbc were measured despite the greater proportion of the labile components of oc in the rill soils the c mineralization ratio exhibited lower values in these soils compared with the gully soils a higher value of gmd mwd and exchangeable cations were observed in the rill soils the results of the stepwise multiple regressions illustrated that the higher c mineralization ratio in the gully soils is significantly positively correlated with doc and microbial respiration by contrast the lower c mineralization ratio in the rill soils was found to be significantly negatively related to the gmd doc and mwd these variations may be attributed to the effects of the increasing soil aggregate stability on lower vulnerability of labile organic carbon to microbial mineralization the lower transport capacity of the rill erosion process causes a less loss of soc and micro aggregate compared with the gully erosion process the labile fractions of soc could bond with clay fractions and exchangeable cations to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregates encouraging higher resistance of doc against microbial mineralization in the rill soils this conceptual approach of combining our field survey data with an empirical model aids in a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms controlling the c mineralization ratio under the progression of soil erosion keywords geomorphic processes aggregate stability erosion progression soil degradation 1 introduction detachment and transportation of soil particles by overland flow are the most important causes of land degradation in water erosion prone environments that significantly affect the global carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems mohseni and salar 2021 different stages of linear erosion development such as rilling and gullying can irreversibly damage the soil aggregate properties smith et al 2001 chaplot et al 2005 su et al 2010 soil aggregate is recognized as a major factor protecting the soc against decomposition and mineralization by soil microbial respiration quijano et al 2019 the progression of water erosion patterns from rill to gully erosion significantly affects the level of soil aggregate degradation physiochemical indicators such as particles size distribution geometric mean diameter mean weight diameter and labile components of soc including dissolved soc and microbial biomass carbon six et al 2000 nael et al 2004 and thereby stimulates changes in the biochemical mechanisms controlling the oc mineralization ratio within the original soils eroded by the rill and gully erosion processes the rill and gully have recognized as two stages of erosion progression that different driving forces encourage the appearance and development of these erosional landforms jiang et al 2019 the rill erosion process occurs due to the concentration of the flow into small channels that their depth is less than 10 cm in this condition the concentrated flow forces detached particles from the walls and at the bottom of the rill rill head cut migration and sidewall expansion affected by the overland flow encourage the development of rill channels into the ephemeral gullies that are larger than rills in terms of length and width and smaller than classical gullies finally classical gullies are referred to the stage of channel development where land is taken out of the production in this type of erosion gullies cannot be removed by tillage operation rill and ephemeral gully erosion are the transitional phases to irreversible states of soil erosion i e classical gullies therefore geo conservation and restoration efforts in these stages can help to prevent the occurrence of such irreversible transitions in initial erosion stages such as the rill erosion process labile oc rich topsoil layer strongly removes by raindrop energy owens et al 2002 mueller nedebock et al 2016 rill head cut migration and sidewall expansion affected by the overland flow encourage the development of rill channels into the gully causing the degradation of a larger amount of oc rich topsoil that is combined with deeper horizons poor in oc bryan 2000 nadeu et al 2011 these conditions weaken the aggregate structural stability in the original soils eroded by the gullies compared with the rill erosion schiettecatte et al 2008 therefore variability in the depth of the soil layer eroded by the different erosion stages significantly affects the quantity of labile components of soc and the characteristics of soil aggregates which can be considered as the indicators for evaluating the soil degradation levels su et al 2010 in the original soils influenced by the rill and gully erosion processes these conditions can be responsible for variability in mechanisms controlling the level of soc vulnerability to microbial respiration under the different erosion patterns to date many studies have focused on the role of different water erosion stages such as interrill rill and gully erosion in soc cycling roose et al 2006 zhang et al 2006 kuhn et al 2009 huang et al 2010 hemelryck et al 2010 nadeu et al 2011 cantón et al 2014 jiang et al 2019 quijano et al 2019 the majority of studies in this field investigated the impacts of water erosion patterns on the dynamics of soc during sediment transport and deposition processes these studies showed that different erosion processes could cause a preferential accumulation of soc in deposited sediments however the fate of the original soils eroded by the rill and gully erosion processes and their function on the physical and biochemical soil properties controlling the vulnerability level of soc to microbial mineralization have been extensively neglected in this study we illustrate the impact of different erosion stages including the rill and gully erosion processes on the relationship pattern between the

no dedicated study showing the impact of the progression of soil erosion on the fate of the eroded soils and its function on the physical and biochemical soil characteristics controlling the c mineralization ratio the results of the multiple regressions illustrate how the different erosion stages affect the relationship pattern between the c mineralization ratio and the associated physiochemical edaphic factors the findings highlighted significant differences in the factors impacting on the c mineralization ratio over erosion progression table 4 the greater c mineralization ratio in the gully soils is significantly positively correlated with vwc doc and soil microbial respiration contrary to expectation despite the generally greater proportion of labile components of oc mbc and doc in the original soils eroded by the rill erosion process the c mineralization ratio represented lower values in these soils tables 3 4 further the c mineralization ratio exhibited a negative relationship with the gmd doc and mwd in the rill soils table 4 this result contradicts the findings of previous studies that show an increase in labile organic carbon preferentially stimulates soil microbial respiration and c mineralization franco otero et al 2012 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the variations in the relationship patterns between the c mineralization ratio and the associated edaphic variables within the rill and gully soils can explain the impacts of the relationship between the soil stability indicators and doc on the control of the c mineralization ratio under the different erosion stages table 4 and fig 3 the soil aggregate size distribution and its characteristics including the mwd and gmd are the most fundamental physical characteristics that significantly affect the vulnerability rate of doc contained in eroded soils to microbial mineralization meskini vishkaee davatgar 2018 on the other hand labile components of oc are the determinant factors of soil degradation status marchetti et al 2012 due to their impacts on the soil structural stability characteristics the negative relationship between the c mineralization ratio and doc in the rill soils can be interpreted by the effects of increasing soil aggregate stability i e gmd and mwd on enhancing physical soc protection causing lower vulnerability of labile organic carbon to microbial mineralization although the distributions of some sized aggregates in the studied soils did not show apparent trends the gmd and mwd represented the characterizations caused by the different erosion stages table 2 the higher values of mwd and gmd showed the greater structural stability of the original soils eroded by the rills compared with the gully erosion process as shown in fig 3 the labile fractions of oc have a crucial impact on the formation of soil aggregates and subsequently higher stability of the soil the rill erosion process is restricted to the surface soil layers shi et al 2012 jiang et al 2019 although oc rich topsoil is detached and transported through rill erosion the lower transport capacity of this process causes a less soc loss in the eroded soils compared with the gully erosion process therefore the labile fractions of oc could bond with clay fractions and exchangeable cations variables that showed greater concentration in the rill soils table 3 to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregates desrochers et al 2020 these conditions facilitate higher stability of the rill soils increasing mwd and gmd and subsequently enhanced physical protection of labile organic carbon against microbial respiration in the original soils eroded by the rills by contrast the higher capacity of the gully erosion process to transport a larger amount of oc rich topsoil that is combined with deeper horizons poor in oc bryan 2000 nadeu et al 2011 promoted the breakdown of soil aggregates and organic mineral complexes which exposed the soc to microbial mineralization as a result reduced physical protection of soc might be responsible for the positive relationship between the c mineralization ratio and doc in the gully soils our findings showed that fluctuations in the proportion of labile components of soc and the level of soil aggregate stability under the different erosion patterns could significantly vary the biochemical mechanisms controlling the c mineralization ratio disturbing the soil c flux balance in terms of aggregate size distribution only the micro aggregates showed significant differences between the different erosion patterns the rill and gully erosion processes have a high potential for the breakdown and dispersion of macro aggregates by runoff the heavy water erosion causes a portion of the coarse size aggregates being disintegrated to small size aggregates by mechanical agitation resultant from the raindrop and the fast runoff under such erosive processes in addition the continued detachment and entrainment of different soil layers by the rill and gully erosion processes exacerbate the weathering of macro aggregates stimulating the production of more micro aggregates however the rill and gully erosion processes show the different amounts of the transportation of eroded soils that could cause the statistically significant differences of micro aggregates between the rills and gullies the lower transport capacity of the rill erosion process encourages lower micro aggregate losses compared with the gully erosion process the soc contained in the micro aggregates is inaccessible to microbial decomposition over long term timescales virto et al 2010 schweizer et al 2019 therefore despite potentially higher microbial activity in the rill soils the increasing micro aggregate promotes greater resistance of soc against mineralization the c mineralization ratio and soil microbial respiration originated from the decomposition of organic matter have recognized as the most important sources of co2 flux carbon loss from the soil surface to the atmosphere conant et al 2000 esch et al 2016 li et al 2017 mahmoudzadeh et al 2020 our findings highlight that variations in the level of soil aggregate stability due to the nature of rill and gully erosion processes could vary the relationship patterns between the c mineralization ratio and the associated edaphic variables encouraging hot spots of soil carbon reservoir and co2 flux 5 conclusions the present study quantified the impact of the rill and gully erosion processes on biochemical mechanisms controlling the c mineralization ratio despite the labile components of organic carbon were considerably higher in the original soils eroded by the rill erosion the c mineralization ratio significantly became lower in the rill soils compared with the gully soils this can probably be explained by the impact of the interaction between the aggregate stability indicators and doc on the formation of soil aggregates that could significantly decrease the soc vulnerability to microbial mineralization the rill and gully erosion processes exhibit the different amounts of the eroded material from soil with different aggregation degrees which cause the distinguishing ratio of c mineralization rill head cut migration and sidewall expansion affected by the overland flow promote the development of rill channels into the gully causing the transportation of a larger amount of oc rich topsoil that is combined with deeper horizons poor in oc this condition degrades soil structure and weakens aggregate stability in the original soils eroded by the gully erosion by contrast the lower transport capacity of the rill erosion process causes lower losses of soc and micro aggregate the labile fractions of soc can bond with clay fractions and exchangeable cations to contribute toward the formation of soil aggregates this condition stimulates less vulnerability of doc to microbial mineralization in the rill soils compared with the gully soils our findings illustrated the impacts of the different erosion stages on variability in the relationship patterns between the c mineralization ratio and the associated edaphic variables encouraging hot spots of soil carbon reservoir and co2 flux within water erosion prone environments declaration of competing interest none declared ethical statement authors state

967,this paper aims to conduct a comparative evaluation of evapotranspiration et rates in two experimental pilot scales vertical flow subsurface constructed wetlands carried out in south east of algeria touggourt planted separately with p australis ph and t latifolia ty in two different substrate types with constant hydraulic loading rate under arid climatic conditions an estimate of crop coefficient kc for the two macrophytes based on climate conditions and the plant growth was also provided two kinds of vertical flow subsurface systems has been tested in the hottest period of the year 2018 over five months april august first with fine gravel g experiment 1 and second with sand s experiment 2 during this period the cumulative etty g etph g and etnp g in the 1st experiment were 206 276 and 125 mm whereas in the 2nd experiment the cumulative etty s etph s and etnp s were 833 968 and 635 mm respectively comparing these results with cumulative reference evapotranspiration et0 et0 value 426 mm was higher than et in the 1st experiment and lower than in the 2nd experiment cumulative et values in planted lysimeters were found to be different and higher than unplanted ones moreover the highest accumulated et value was obtained with p australis bed which was found to have higher accumulated et values than t latifolia bed regarding the crop coefficient kc the average seasonal value of kc in the 1st experiment was relatively smaller than 2nd experiment the kc ph s value was almost three times the kc ph g and kc ty s values were also almost four times the kc ty g in general this study demonstrated that et and kc are dependent on climate conditions the macrophytes growth as well as on the type of substrate in which the macrophytes are planted keywords constructed wetlands crop coefficient evapotranspiration phragmites australis typha latifolia water balance 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the process of water loss to the atmosphere from the soil surface and or open water by evaporation and from the crop by transpiration kadlec and wallace 2009 mitsch and gosselink 2007 in arid water scarce regions where the frequency and level of rainfall is low evapotranspiration is the main mechanism of groundwater loss in shallow aquifers as well as the most influential factor in water balance he and mankin 2001 sanderson and cooper 2008 water losses to the atmosphere via et can be high borin et al 2011 especially under warm and windy conditions as observed in previous studies albuquerque et al 2009 białowiec et al 2006 therefore this significant amount of water lost in the atmosphere can be undesirable el hamouri et al 2007 green et al 2006 masi and martinuzzi 2007 in a constructed wetlands cws evapotranspiration is the only means by which wetlands lose water in arid and semi arid regions given that the water basin is insulated to avoid water infiltration of the soil pedescoll et al 2013 therefore cws are hydraulically isolated and groundwater interactions are missing making the water balance simpler compared to natural or surface flow wetlands borin et al 2011 evapotranspiration is intimately related to meteorological factors air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed kumar et al 2012 biological features of crops mainly leaf area index lai and plant growth stage borin et al 2011 headley et al 2012 as well as cws design features plant species diversity and density allen et al 1998 according to various authors the vegetation is the most important factor as plants are the main elements responsible for water loss in wetlands headley et al 2012 pedescoll et al 2013 tuttolomondo et al 2015 therefore et is higher during the summer months when plants are at their vegetative and production maximum and lower in the winter months when vegetative activity slows amiri et al 2019 in addition kadlec and wallace 2009 noted that increasing evapotranspiration rates in small size wetlands comparing with large scale wetlands in the same locality is due to incoming warm water that may present increased evaporation than surrounding water at ambient conditions also to the microclimate created by the wetland many wetland plants are not able to store water as most terrestrial plants do consequently they transfer substantial amounts of water to the atmosphere especially under warm and windy conditions in these conditions the et of wetland plants may be seven to eight times higher than the evaporation without plants milani et al 2019 this means that during the dry season plants must utilize water stored in soils to supply evapotranspiration at a rate which is unlimited by water availability hodnett et al 1996 nepstad et al 1994 treatment wetlands or vegetation filters are commonly used for treatment of various types of wastewater valipour and ahn 2017 and they are generally planted with herbaceous plants like reed phragmites australis trin cattail typha latifolia l or other aquatic and semi aquatic species kadlec and wallace 2008 these macrophytes have a great potential for water loss through transpiration since they have inherently low water use efficiencies białowiec and wojnowska baryla 2007 headley et al 2012 there are various techniques have been developed to measure et rates such as lysimeter techniques bowen ratio energy balance breb or eddy covariance method lysimeters are the most reliable tool to measure the et rates directly by water balance measurements hassan et al 2008 however et could be also easily estimated by the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated with the penman monteith equation using local meteorological data by the crop coefficient kc while very few data are available on the kc for many cws plants drexler et al 2008 papaevangelou at al 2012 pedescoll et al 2013 tuttolomondo et al 2015 typically et losses are the greatest for microcosm systems less than 1 m2 where kc values were found to be 5 4 and 7 3 for cattails and reeds respectively rashed 2014 in this paper the results of two experimental pilot scales vertical flow subsurface constructed wetlands used to treat wastewater carried out in south east of algeria touggourt on the estimation of et in cws are presented the aims of this study were 1 to conduct a comparative evaluation of evapotranspiration rates in pilot scale constructed wetlands planted with p australis and t latifolia in two different substrate types sand or fine gravel under arid climatic conditions and in the hottest period of the year and 2 to provide an estimate of kc for the two macrophytes based on climate conditions and the plant growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental pilot design the experimental pilot was carried out in the open space in the scientific and technical research center on the arid regions in touggourt city south east algeria 33 04 37 94 n 6 02 29 34 e for the treatment of domestic wastewaters the climate of the site is arid with a mean annual rainfall of about 80mm the site is mainly characterized by a very high summer temperatures exceeding 40 c in july and august and winter temperatures of around 5 c in december and january the pilot scale experiment was conducted using a 0 8 m high plastic tank 0 4 m in diameter and 0 100 m3 in volume as a model of a constructed wetland with vertical flow subsurface vfss the experimental set up consisted of six lysimeters containing a valve at the base to enable bottom water sampling and piezometer 10 mm diameter tubing to control the water level fig 1 the lysimeters were filled with two superimposed layers of the substrate the lower layers were composed of a coarse gravel of 150 mm in depth particle diameter 20 mm allowed drainage of percolating water above the coarse gravel fine gravel layer of 600 mm in depth ø 10 mm was placed in three lysimeters experiment 1 and also fine sand layer of 600 mm in depth ø 0 2 mm was placed in the other three lysimeters experiment 2 two lysimeters from each experiment were planted separately in february 2018 with phragmite australis reed and typha latifolia cattail at a density of 30 rhizomes m 2 borin et al 2011 and the third was without plantation to compare it with the planted ones the measurements were conducted during five months from april to august 2018 as an example of vfss et in vfss was examined as a function of substrate type sand s or fine gravel g plante type phragmites australis or typha latifolia the lysimeters were fed periodically twice a week by 20 mm d 1 of polluted water from a storage tank 1 20 m3 which was considered as a decanting and feeding tank of the experimental pilot the storage tank was filled once a month by urban wastewater from the town of touggourt after the preliminary treatment physical treatment by the national wastewater treatment organization there was no natural rainfall or natural ground water inflow into the lysimeters the watering was made by pouring out measured amounts of wastewater after hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days through the tap at the base in the bottom of vfss the drainage water qeff gathered inside the lysimeter was collected and measured 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 weather data weather data for the entire study period including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation rainfall and wind speed were obtained for et0 estimation from sidi mahdi airport weather station latitude 33 07n longitude 06 08e altitude 85m approximately 5 km from the study site 2 2 2 physicochemical analysis the monitoring of physical and chemical characteristics of this experimental pilot influent was carried out table 1 from april to august 2018 a total of 44 samples were collected and analyzed by standard methods apha 2005 water samples were taken by opaque glass bottle 1l after a 3 days retention time in the tanks twice a week under normal conditions to monitor water quality at around 9 00 am at the influent rw and effluents of each vfss ph s ty s np s ph g ty g and np g during this period equal volume 1l was collected from all sampling outlet

evapotranspiration and crop coefficient calculations the reference evapotranspiration eto values were calculated according to a daily mm d 1 water balance by means of the standardized fao penman

the lysimeter surface to the longest leaf for each macrophyte during the growing season from april to august 2018 the plant height was measured every 10 days 2 3 statistical analysis in this experiment spss statistical software version 15 was used to calculate the maximum minimum mean and standard deviation values of physico chemical parameters of wastewater and meteorological parameters

experimental area is characterized by an arid climate with a mean annual rainfall of about 80mm and with a long dry and hot summer where the temperature exceeds 40 c in july and august trends for the main meteorological parameters during the test period are shown in fig 2 between april and august 2018 in this period cumulative daily rainfall was 11 68 mm most rainfall values were recorded in april may and august with none in june and july the air temperature presents an increase from the beginning of april to the beginning of july followed by a tendency to decrease up to the end of august the daily minimum air temperatures ranged from 9 2 to 34 c in april and the maxima from 23 to 49 5 c in july fig 2 with an average seasonal value of 30 1 c table 2 maximum daily average relative humidity was 61 in june and minimum daily average relative humidity was 11 in july maximum and minimum monthly averages relative humidity were 42 in august and 24 in july respectively with an average seasonal value of 35 8 in the test period average wind speed was 4 2 m s 1 the highest mean daily wind speed was determined in may 10 m s 1 while the lowest was zero in april 0 0 m s 1 the highest total solar radiation was recorded in july at 27 9 mj m 2 d 1 while the lowest was in april at 22 1 mj m 2 d 1 seasonally net radiation trends were very stable during the study period fig 2 table 2 3 2 plant development for all tested species except for ty g the plant heights were significantly different at the beginning and at the end of each experiment at the end of the investigation periods ty s showed the highest plant height with mean value of about 122 5 cm followed by ph s 120 cm and ph g 105 cm then ty g which showed no significantly different heights with mean value of about 48 cm table 3 during the study period the data collected indicated a variation in the plant growth rate over the season fig 3 for p australis the plant growth showed an increase in height until the end of august in both experiment with a seasonal average of 0 62 and 0 66 cm d 1 in experiment 1 and 2 respectively plant growth showed a constant rate with a maximum growth rate detected from the 1st 10 days of july to 3rd 10 days 3 25 cm d 1 in experiment 1 and from the 1st 10 days of july to the 2nd of 10 days 3 45 cm d 1 in experiment 2 for t latifolia the plant height was characterized by an approximate slow increase from 1st 10 days of april to the end of august with a seasonal average growth rate of 0 07 cm d 1 the greatest growth rate was found during the 3 rd 10 days of april 0 47 cm d 1 in experiment 1 whereas in the second experiment the plant height was characterized by height increase from the beginning of april until the 1st 10 days of may then the plant height remained relatively constant until the 1st 10 days of july after this time the plant height increased until the end of the growth period the plant reached maximum vegetative growth in the 2nd 10 days of july 2 5 cm d 1 with the season mean growth rate was 0 70 cm d 1 compared to the p australis t latifolia in the 1st experiment showed the lowest growth rate just 0 07 cm d 1 and the highest growth rate in the 2nd experiment 0 7 cm d 1 for the entire growing season during the testing period both of the species were reached maximum vegetative growth during july which coincided with high temperatures 3 3 evapotranspiration measurements 3 3 1 reference evapotranspiration et0 the trends of daily et0 showed an increase from the beginning of the test period until the end of june followed by maximum values during july and a tendency to decrease up to the end of the monitored period over the whole experiment period daily et0 values ranged from 3 08 in beginning of april to 21 71 mm d 1 in july 22th fig 4 the lowest average monthly et0 value was recorded in april spring with 6 61 mm d 1 and the highest in july summer with 15 23 mm d 1 due to the higher temperature associated with lower relative humidity the seasonal et0 average value was 9 68 mm d 1 3 3 2 plants evapotranspiration et in the 1st experiment the et values of the three individual wetlands presented generally the same tendency with lower values from the beginning of april to the 1st 10 days of may and from 1st 10 days of july to the end of the period study from 2nd 10 days of may to 1st 10 days of july et ph g and et ty g were found to be different and higher compared to et np g fig 5 et ty g was found to have average 10 days values ranging from 1 55 1st 10 days april to 8 92 mm d 1 3rd 10 days may for et ph g average maximum was recorded in 3rd 10 days of may 14 2 mm d 1 and average minimum value in 1st 10 days of april 1 78 mm d 1 seasonal trends of average et ty g and et ph g 10 days values were found to be almost similar to each other during the test period the three lysimeters were found to have a seasonal average et values 6 28 et ph g 4 67 et ty g and 2 83 mm d 1 et np g which were different and much lower compared to the et0 values 9 68 mm d 1 fig 5 the seasonal average et values of p australis and t latifolia for this experiment were not so different from values found in the literature papaevangelou et al 2012 pauliukonis and schneider 2001 for t latifolia and chazarenc et al 2003 fermor et al 2001 papaevangelou et al 2012 peacock and hess 2004 zhou and zhou 2009 for p australis while they were higher or lower than values estimated in some studies table 4 considering cumulative evapotranspiration over 5 months fig 6 the p australis bed was found to have higher rates 276 17 mm than the t latifolia bed 205 6 mm comparing cumulative et rates of planted beds with cumulative unplanted bed 124 64 mm we find that there was a substantial increase in et rates for the planted beds which highlights the effect that vegetation has on water loss in a cws when comparing cumulative evapotranspiration from the two vegetated beds with cumulative et0 an average decrease about 52 for etty g and 35 for etph g was found this indicated a substantial fall in growth activity of the macrophytes and as a result a fall in et the linear trends of average 10 days et for p australis and t latifolia versus average 10 days et0 were calculated for both experiments in the same year fig 7 regression analysis indicated that the relationship between 10 days etph g and etty g with average 10 days et0 in the 1st experiment fig 7 a and b was not significant r2 ph g 0 002 r2 ty g 0 063 lower water loss by evapotranspiration in this experiment could be explained by the water infiltration through the fine gravel and its collection at the bottom of the lysimeter which remains difficult to absorb by the plant and evaporate through the substrate in the 2nd experiment a similar tendency was observed for evapotranspiration variation among different months a seasonal average et0 value 9 68 mm d 1 was very lower than et in all planted lysimeter 22 01 mm d 1 for et ph s 18 94 mm d 1 for et ty s and unplanted 14 43 mm d 1 for et np s throughout the entire monitoring period this is in accordance with results found by pedescoll et al 2013 and tuttolomondo et al 2016 for t latifolia borin et al 2011 milani and toscano 2013 milani et al 2019 pedescoll et al 2013 and rozkosny et al 2006 for p australis whereas these results were also higher or lower than some values recorded in some studies as shown in table 4 the et of different wetlands varies greatly due to the inconsistency of climatic conditions and the methods applied anda et al 2015 the greatest et rate occurred during the 3rd of july for et ph s 34 53 mm d 1 followed by et ty s 27 02 mm d 1 in the 2nd 10 days of july then et np s 25 87 mm d 1 in the 3rd of july hence evapotranspiration rates were generally highest during the summer months while the lower average et was recorded in the 1st 10 days of april with 8 58 mm d 1 6 80 mm d 1 and 6 98 mm d 1 for et ty s et ph s and et np s respectively these results confirm that the evapotranspiration is strongly influenced by climatic conditions the higher average evapotranspiration rates in early july to mid august was probably due to the higher wind speeds and solar radiation associated with lower relative humidity comparing between the two experiments et values in planted lysimeters were higher than unplanted ones the highest accumulated et value was obtained with p australis bed 968 24 mm which was found to have higher accumulated et values than t latifolia bed 833 44 mm therefore common reed required more water to grow than cattail this is in accordance with results found by pedescoll et al 2013 comparing this result with cumulative unplanted bed 635 mm we find that there was a great increase in et rates for the planted beds the variation of evapotranspiration accumulation is higher due to consumption of transpiration water during the growing season cumulative evapotranspiration between the two vegetated beds and cumulative et0 showed an increase about 49 for etty s and 56 for etph s fig 6 the linear trends of average 10 days et for p australis and t latifolia versus average 10 days et0 calculated in the 2nd experiment fig 7 a and b showed a positive and significant correlation r2 ph s 0 403 r2 ty s 0 373 3 3 3 effects of meteorological parameters on evapotranspiration variation in order to assess the effect of meteorological parameters on the et measured from the cws the correlation coefficient was used the correlation analyses between evapotranspiration and monthly meteorological parameters are given in table 5 according to the correlation analyses between monthly measured et and mean monthly weather parameters the evapotranspiration variation of p australis and t latifolia had good relationship with air temperature in both experiments this result is similar to what has been found by mekoya 2020 and much better than reported by pauliukonis and schneider 2001 et was also significantly correlated with solar radiation in the 1st experiment with only etph g this is in accordance with results found by seo et al 2018 whereas the wind speed had little effect on evapotranspiration of p australis etph s in the 2nd experiment during the growing season this corroborates the result of wenying et al 2008 while the relative humidity had not effects on evapotranspiration variation which was similar to what obtained by pauliukonis and schneider 2001 in this study evapotranspiration reached the maximum in july and august and it constantly develops with growing of plants and increase of air temperature in arid areas air temperature is a very significant factor and it has stronger effects on evapotranspiration evapotranspiration variation is affected by air temperature to a great degree the solar radiation had also significant effects on the evapotranspiration of phragmites wenying et al 2008 3 4 crop coefficient kc kc for a given crop is variable throughout the growing season although reasonably the same under very different environmental conditions fig 8 shows 10 days kc values variation for the two species throughout the study period the crop coefficient kc of p australis and t latifolia showed a similar trend in each experiment at both experiments july and august were characterized by highest growth of both of the species when the plants in the 1st experiment were shorter than in the 2nd since the experiments were stopped at the beginning of september it was not possible to detect the eventual part of the curve of decreasing kp values associated with plant senescence in the 1st experiment kc values increased from the beginning of april until the 3 rd 10 days of may then decrease slightly to 1st 10 days of june after that the kc values increase again still the 3rd 10 days of this month thereafter the values decreased and remained almost constant until the end of the experiment kc ph g and kc ty g were minimum at the 2nd 10 days of july 0 22 and 0 17 respectively and reached the maximum of 1 47 at the 3rd 10 days of may for p australis and 1 13 at the 3rd 10 days of april for t latifolia the mean kc ph g and kc ty g values were about 0 70 and 0 55 respectively regarding both of the species in the 2nd experiment kc values for p australis were constantly found to be lower than t latifolia in april and may thereafter the values remained higher until the end of test the highest kc values were found in the 2nd 10 days of august for p australis 4 27 with average seasonal values of 2 36 and in the 2nd 10 days of april for t latifolia 2 98 with average seasonal values of 2 10 in general the highest values of kc calculated in these experiments on august are probably due to the fact that the plants were at full growth it is interesting to note the rise in crop coefficients for august as a result of the lower reference evapotranspiration rates that were measured in our study the kc values were very lower than those reported in other studies in different climate such as kadlec and wallace 2009 5 4 for t latifolia and 7 3 for p australis in microcosm system less than one square meter borin et al 2011 6 3 in sicily 6 8 in veneto for p australis pedescoll et al 2013 6 52 for p australis 9 6 for t latifolia and milani et al 2019 4 76 for p australis on the contrary the calculated crop coefficient for both species in this study was

higher compared to the typical kc for agricultural crops which in most cases are in the range 0 9 1 2 due to the high evapotranspiration rates allen et al 1998 nonetheless these results agree with those found by beebe et al 2014 2 5 for t latifolia if we take a closer look at the average 10 days kc values of the two species for each experiment we find that kc varies monthly and highest values were found during the summer months when the plants had the highest vegetative growth and lowest values were found during the initial stage in the spring months the correlation coefficients between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ph s and ph g fig 9 a r2 0 111 and between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ty s and ty g fig 9 b r2 0 218 was relatively weak and not significant this was due probably to the effect of the type of substrate sand s or gravel g on plant growth in the two experiments for both species in contrast the linear regression between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ph g and ty g fig 9 c r2 0 471 and between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ph s and ty s fig 9 d r2 0 427 indicated that the values were significantly and positively correlated we can say that the growth of the two macrophytes was affected by the same climate and soil type during the testing period in each experiment with regard to the relationship between 10 days crop coefficient kc for t latifolia and p australis with plant height fig 10 the correlation coefficient r² 0 547 showed that 10 days crop coefficient kc for ty s was significantly and positively correlated with plant height comparing with other species for both vegetated experiments which presented a weak correlation coefficients fig 10 this means that when the plants are enjoying best vegetative conditions in terms of phenological parameters like plant height stem density and leaf number et processes are more intense also due to more favorable microclimate conditions 4 conclusions in arid areas evapotranspiration is the most important component of the water loss in construction wetland two experimentations composed from pilot scales containing p australis and t latifolia on two different substrate types sand or fine gravel were used on the same site to estimate the evapotranspiration rates and crop coefficients of each macrophyte the results of the present study showed that the seasonal average et rates varied greatly between the 1st experiment and the 2nd where the average et values were much lower than et0 values in the 1st experiment and very higher compared to the et0 values in the 2nd experiment considering cumulative evapotranspiration throughout the entire monitoring period the highest accumulated et values were obtained with p australis beds which were found to have higher accumulated et values than t latifolia beds in addition in the both experiments cumulative et values in planted lysimeters were found to be different and higher than unplanted ones when comparing cumulative et from the vegetated beds in each experiment with cumulative et0 et values were lower in the first experiment and greater in the second with regard to crop coefficient kc this study highlighted that the average 10 days kc values of the two species for each experiment were varied monthly and highest values were found during the summer months when the plants had the highest vegetative growth and lowest values were found during the initial stage in the spring months the average seasonal value of kc in the 1st experiment was relatively smaller than 2nd experiment where the kc ph s value was almost three times the kc ph g and kc ty s values were almost four times the kc ty g in general this study demonstrated that et and kc are depending on climate conditions the macrophytes growth in the same period and also depending on the flow direction in cws horizontal or vertical and the type of substrate in which the macrophytes are planted it would be interesting to use the continuous flow of water in vertical flow subsurface constructed wetlands filled with gravel in addition since the variation of et is related to other factors e g vegetation type sunshine hours etc more factors should be taken into account in future research to study their impacts on et declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research work was supported by the scientific and technical research

967,this paper aims to conduct a comparative evaluation of evapotranspiration et rates in two experimental pilot scales vertical flow subsurface constructed wetlands carried out in south east of algeria touggourt planted separately with p australis ph and t latifolia ty in two different substrate types with constant hydraulic loading rate under arid climatic conditions an estimate of crop coefficient kc for the two macrophytes based on climate conditions and the plant growth was also provided two kinds of vertical flow subsurface systems has been tested in the hottest period of the year 2018 over five months april august first with fine gravel g experiment 1 and second with sand s experiment 2 during this period the cumulative etty g etph g and etnp g in the 1st experiment were 206 276 and 125 mm whereas in the 2nd experiment the cumulative etty s etph s and etnp s were 833 968 and 635 mm respectively comparing these results with cumulative reference evapotranspiration et0 et0 value 426 mm was higher than et in the 1st experiment and lower than in the 2nd experiment cumulative et values in planted lysimeters were found to be different and higher than unplanted ones moreover the highest accumulated et value was obtained with p australis bed which was found to have higher accumulated et values than t latifolia bed regarding the crop coefficient kc the average seasonal value of kc in the 1st experiment was relatively smaller than 2nd experiment the kc ph s value was almost three times the kc ph g and kc ty s values were also almost four times the kc ty g in general this study demonstrated that et and kc are dependent on climate conditions the macrophytes growth as well as on the type of substrate in which the macrophytes are planted keywords constructed wetlands crop coefficient evapotranspiration phragmites australis typha latifolia water balance 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is the process of water loss to the atmosphere from the soil surface and or open water by evaporation and from the crop by transpiration kadlec and wallace 2009 mitsch and gosselink 2007 in arid water scarce regions where the frequency and level of rainfall is low evapotranspiration is the main mechanism of groundwater loss in shallow aquifers as well as the most influential factor in water balance he and mankin 2001 sanderson and cooper 2008 water losses to the atmosphere via et can be high borin et al 2011 especially under warm and windy conditions as observed in previous studies albuquerque et al 2009 białowiec et al 2006 therefore this significant amount of water lost in the atmosphere can be undesirable el hamouri et al 2007 green et al 2006 masi and martinuzzi 2007 in a constructed wetlands cws evapotranspiration is the only means by which wetlands lose water in arid and semi arid regions given that the water basin is insulated to avoid water infiltration of the soil pedescoll et al 2013 therefore cws are hydraulically isolated and groundwater interactions are missing making the water balance simpler compared to natural or surface flow wetlands borin et al 2011 evapotranspiration is intimately related to meteorological factors air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed kumar et al 2012 biological features of crops mainly leaf area index lai and plant growth stage borin et al 2011 headley et al 2012 as well as cws design features plant species diversity and density allen et al 1998 according to various authors the vegetation is the most important factor as plants are the main elements responsible for water loss in wetlands headley et al 2012 pedescoll et al 2013 tuttolomondo et al 2015 therefore et is higher during the summer months when plants are at their vegetative and production maximum and lower in the winter months when vegetative activity slows amiri et al 2019 in addition kadlec and wallace 2009 noted that increasing evapotranspiration rates in small size wetlands comparing with large scale wetlands in the same locality is due to incoming warm water that may present increased evaporation than surrounding water at ambient conditions also to the microclimate created by the wetland many wetland plants are not able to store water as most terrestrial plants do consequently they transfer substantial amounts of water to the atmosphere especially under warm and windy conditions in these conditions the et of wetland plants may be seven to eight times higher than the evaporation without plants milani et al 2019 this means that during the dry season plants must utilize water stored in soils to supply evapotranspiration at a rate which is unlimited by water availability hodnett et al 1996 nepstad et al 1994 treatment wetlands or vegetation filters are commonly used for treatment of various types of wastewater valipour and ahn 2017 and they are generally planted with herbaceous plants like reed phragmites australis trin cattail typha latifolia l or other aquatic and semi aquatic species kadlec and wallace 2008 these macrophytes have a great potential for water loss through transpiration since they have inherently low water use efficiencies białowiec and wojnowska baryla 2007 headley et al 2012 there are various techniques have been developed to measure et rates such as lysimeter techniques bowen ratio energy balance breb or eddy covariance method lysimeters are the most reliable tool to measure the et rates directly by water balance measurements hassan et al 2008 however et could be also easily estimated by the fao 56 approach allen et al 1998 multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated with the penman monteith equation using local meteorological data by the crop coefficient kc while very few data are available on the kc for many cws plants drexler et al 2008 papaevangelou at al 2012 pedescoll et al 2013 tuttolomondo et al 2015 typically et losses are the greatest for microcosm systems less than 1 m2 where kc values were found to be 5 4 and 7 3 for cattails and reeds respectively rashed 2014 in this paper the results of two experimental pilot scales vertical flow subsurface constructed wetlands used to treat wastewater carried out in south east of algeria touggourt on the estimation of et in cws are presented the aims of this study were 1 to conduct a comparative evaluation of evapotranspiration rates in pilot scale constructed wetlands planted with p australis and t latifolia in two different substrate types sand or fine gravel under arid climatic conditions and in the hottest period of the year and 2 to provide an estimate of kc for the two macrophytes based on climate conditions and the plant growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental pilot design the experimental pilot was carried out in the open space in the scientific and technical research center on the arid regions in touggourt city south east algeria 33 04 37 94 n 6 02 29 34 e for the treatment of domestic wastewaters the climate of the site is arid with a mean annual rainfall of about 80mm the site is mainly characterized by a very high summer temperatures exceeding 40 c in july and august and winter temperatures of around 5 c in december and january the pilot scale experiment was conducted using a 0 8 m high plastic tank 0 4 m in diameter and 0 100 m3 in volume as a model of a constructed wetland with vertical flow subsurface vfss the experimental set up consisted of six lysimeters containing a valve at the base to enable bottom water sampling and piezometer 10 mm diameter tubing to control the water level fig 1 the lysimeters were filled with two superimposed layers of the substrate the lower layers were composed of a coarse gravel of 150 mm in depth particle diameter 20 mm allowed drainage of percolating water above the coarse gravel fine gravel layer of 600 mm in depth ø 10 mm was placed in three lysimeters experiment 1 and also fine sand layer of 600 mm in depth ø 0 2 mm was placed in the other three lysimeters experiment 2 two lysimeters from each experiment were planted separately in february 2018 with phragmite australis reed and typha latifolia cattail at a density of 30 rhizomes m 2 borin et al 2011 and the third was without plantation to compare it with the planted ones the measurements were conducted during five months from april to august 2018 as an example of vfss et in vfss was examined as a function of substrate type sand s or fine gravel g plante type phragmites australis or typha latifolia the lysimeters were fed periodically twice a week by 20 mm d 1 of polluted water from a storage tank 1 20 m3 which was considered as a decanting and feeding tank of the experimental pilot the storage tank was filled once a month by urban wastewater from the town of touggourt after the preliminary treatment physical treatment by the national wastewater treatment organization there was no natural rainfall or natural ground water inflow into the lysimeters the watering was made by pouring out measured amounts of wastewater after hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 days through the tap at the base in the bottom of vfss the drainage water qeff gathered inside the lysimeter was collected and measured 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 weather data weather data for the entire study period including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation rainfall and wind speed were obtained for et0 estimation from sidi mahdi airport weather station latitude 33 07n longitude 06 08e altitude 85m approximately 5 km from the study site 2 2 2 physicochemical analysis the monitoring of physical and chemical characteristics of this experimental pilot influent was carried out table 1 from april to august 2018 a total of 44 samples were collected and analyzed by standard methods apha 2005 water samples were taken by opaque glass bottle 1l after a 3 days retention time in the tanks twice a week under normal conditions to monitor water quality at around 9 00 am at the influent rw and effluents of each vfss ph s ty s np s ph g ty g and np g during this period equal volume 1l was collected from all sampling outlet samples collected were directly transported to the crstra scientific and technical research center for arid areas laboratory for immediate physicochemical and biological analysis 2 2 3 evapotranspiration and crop coefficient calculations the reference evapotranspiration eto values were calculated according to a daily mm d 1 water balance by means of the standardized fao penman

with allen et al 1998 and jensen et al 1990 using eq 3 the 10 days values of measured evapotranspiration etc and calculated reference et et0 were used to calculate 10 days crop coefficients kc for growth period of the two macrophytes 3 kc etc e t 0 2 2 4 plant height measurement plant height measurement was carried out in 0 125 m2 sampling areas in each planted lysimeter it was measured from the lysimeter surface to the longest leaf for each macrophyte during the growing season from april to august 2018 the plant height was measured every 10 days 2 3 statistical analysis in this experiment spss statistical software version 15 was used to calculate the maximum minimum mean and standard deviation values of physico chemical parameters of wastewater and meteorological parameters

experimental area is characterized by an arid climate with a mean annual rainfall of about 80mm and with a long dry and hot summer where the temperature exceeds 40 c in july and august trends for the main meteorological parameters during the test period are shown in fig 2 between april and august 2018 in this period cumulative daily rainfall was 11 68 mm most rainfall values were recorded in april may and august with none in june and july the air temperature presents an increase from the beginning of april to the beginning of july followed by a tendency to decrease up to the end of august the daily minimum air temperatures ranged from 9 2 to 34 c in april and the maxima from 23 to 49 5 c in july fig 2 with an average seasonal value of 30 1 c table 2 maximum daily average relative humidity was 61 in june and minimum daily average relative humidity was 11 in july maximum and minimum monthly averages relative humidity were 42 in august and 24 in july respectively with an average seasonal value of 35 8 in the test period average wind speed was 4 2 m s 1 the highest mean daily wind speed was determined in may 10 m s 1 while the lowest was zero in april 0 0 m s 1 the highest total solar radiation was recorded in july at 27 9 mj m 2 d 1 while the lowest was in april at 22 1 mj m 2 d 1 seasonally net radiation trends were very stable during the study period fig 2 table 2 3 2 plant development for all tested species except for ty g the plant heights were significantly different at the beginning and at the end of each experiment at the end of the investigation periods ty s showed the highest plant height with mean value of about 122 5 cm followed by ph s 120 cm and ph g 105 cm then ty g which showed no significantly different heights with mean value of about 48 cm table 3 during the study period the data collected indicated a variation in the plant growth rate over the season fig 3 for p australis the plant growth showed an increase in height until the end of august in both experiment with a seasonal average of 0 62 and 0 66 cm d 1 in experiment 1 and 2 respectively plant growth showed a constant rate with a maximum growth rate detected from the 1st 10 days of july to 3rd 10 days 3 25 cm d 1 in experiment 1 and from the 1st 10 days of july to the 2nd of 10 days 3 45 cm d 1 in experiment 2 for t latifolia the plant height was characterized by an approximate slow increase from 1st 10 days of april to the end of august with a seasonal average growth rate of 0 07 cm d 1 the greatest growth rate was found during the 3 rd 10 days of april 0 47 cm d 1 in experiment 1 whereas in the second experiment the plant height was characterized by height increase from the beginning of april until the 1st 10 days of may then the plant height remained relatively constant until the 1st 10 days of july after this time the plant height increased until the end of the growth period the plant reached maximum vegetative growth in the 2nd 10 days of july 2 5 cm d 1 with the season mean growth rate was 0 70 cm d 1 compared to the p australis t latifolia in the 1st experiment showed the lowest growth rate just 0 07 cm d 1 and the highest growth rate in the 2nd experiment 0 7 cm d 1 for the entire growing season during the testing period both of the species were reached maximum vegetative growth during july which coincided with high temperatures 3 3 evapotranspiration measurements 3 3 1 reference evapotranspiration et0 the trends of daily et0 showed an increase from the beginning of the test period until the end of june followed by maximum values during july and a tendency to decrease up to the end of the monitored period over the whole experiment period daily et0 values ranged from 3 08 in beginning of april to 21 71 mm d 1 in july 22th fig 4 the lowest average monthly et0 value was recorded in april spring with 6 61 mm d 1 and the highest in july summer with 15 23 mm d 1 due to the higher temperature associated with lower relative humidity the seasonal et0 average value was 9 68 mm d 1 3 3 2 plants evapotranspiration et in the 1st experiment the et values of the three individual wetlands presented generally the same tendency with lower values from the beginning of april to the 1st 10 days of may and from 1st 10 days of july to the end of the period study from 2nd 10 days of may to 1st 10 days of july et ph g and et ty g were found to be different and higher compared to et np g fig 5 et ty g was found to have average 10 days values ranging from 1 55 1st 10 days april to 8 92 mm d 1 3rd 10 days may for et ph g average maximum was recorded in 3rd 10 days of may 14 2 mm d 1 and average minimum value in 1st 10 days of april 1 78 mm d 1 seasonal trends of average et ty g and et ph g 10 days values were found to be almost similar to each other during the test period the three lysimeters were found to have a seasonal average et values 6 28 et ph g 4 67 et ty g and 2 83 mm d 1 et np g which were different and much lower compared to the et0 values 9 68 mm d 1 fig 5 the seasonal average et values of p australis and t latifolia for this experiment were not so different from values found in the literature papaevangelou et al 2012 pauliukonis and schneider 2001 for t latifolia and chazarenc et al 2003 fermor et al 2001 papaevangelou et al 2012 peacock and hess 2004 zhou and zhou 2009 for p australis while they were higher or lower than values estimated in some studies table 4 considering cumulative evapotranspiration over 5 months fig 6 the p australis bed was found to have higher rates 276 17 mm than the t latifolia bed 205 6 mm comparing cumulative et rates of planted beds with cumulative unplanted bed 124 64 mm we find that there was a substantial increase in et rates for the planted beds which highlights the effect that vegetation has on water loss in a cws when comparing cumulative evapotranspiration from the two vegetated beds with cumulative et0 an average decrease about 52 for etty g and 35 for etph g was found this indicated a substantial fall in growth activity of the macrophytes and as a result a fall in et the linear trends of average 10 days et for p australis and t latifolia versus average 10 days et0 were calculated for both experiments in the same year fig 7 regression analysis indicated that the relationship between 10 days etph g and etty g with average 10 days et0 in the 1st experiment fig 7 a and b was not significant r2 ph g 0 002 r2 ty g 0 063 lower water loss by evapotranspiration in this experiment could be explained by the water infiltration through the fine gravel and its collection at the bottom of the lysimeter which remains difficult to absorb by the plant and evaporate through the substrate in the 2nd experiment a similar tendency was observed for evapotranspiration variation among different months a seasonal average et0 value 9 68 mm d 1 was very lower than et in all planted lysimeter 22 01 mm d 1 for et ph s 18 94 mm d 1 for et ty s and unplanted 14 43 mm d 1 for et np s throughout the entire monitoring period this is in accordance with results found by pedescoll et al 2013 and tuttolomondo et al 2016 for t latifolia borin et al 2011 milani and toscano 2013 milani et al 2019 pedescoll et al 2013 and rozkosny et al 2006 for p australis whereas these results were also higher or lower than some values recorded in some studies as shown in table 4 the et of different wetlands varies greatly due to the inconsistency of climatic conditions and the methods applied anda et al 2015 the greatest et rate occurred during the 3rd of july for et ph s 34 53 mm d 1 followed by et ty s 27 02 mm d 1 in the 2nd 10 days of july then et np s 25 87 mm d 1 in the 3rd of july hence evapotranspiration rates were generally highest during the summer months while the lower average et was recorded in the 1st 10 days of april with 8 58 mm d 1 6 80 mm d 1 and 6 98 mm d 1 for et ty s et ph s and et np s respectively these results confirm that the evapotranspiration is strongly influenced by climatic conditions the higher average evapotranspiration rates in early july to mid august was probably due to the higher wind speeds and solar radiation associated with lower relative humidity comparing between the two experiments et values in planted lysimeters were higher than unplanted ones the highest accumulated et value was obtained with p australis bed 968 24 mm which was found to have higher accumulated et values than t latifolia bed 833 44 mm therefore common reed required more water to grow than cattail this is in accordance with results found by pedescoll et al 2013 comparing this result with cumulative unplanted bed 635 mm we find that there was a great increase in et rates for the planted beds the variation of evapotranspiration accumulation is higher due to consumption of transpiration water during the growing season cumulative evapotranspiration between the two vegetated beds and cumulative et0 showed an increase about 49 for etty s and 56 for etph s fig 6 the linear trends of average 10 days et for p australis and t latifolia versus average 10 days et0 calculated in the 2nd experiment fig 7 a and b showed a positive and significant correlation r2 ph s 0 403 r2 ty s 0 373 3 3 3 effects of meteorological parameters on evapotranspiration variation in order to assess the effect of meteorological parameters on the et measured from the cws the correlation coefficient was used the correlation analyses between evapotranspiration and monthly meteorological parameters are given in table 5 according to the correlation analyses between monthly measured et and mean monthly weather parameters the evapotranspiration variation of p australis and t latifolia had good relationship with air temperature in both experiments this result is similar to what has been found by mekoya 2020 and much better than reported by pauliukonis and schneider 2001 et was also significantly correlated with solar radiation in the 1st experiment with only etph g this is in accordance with results found by seo et al 2018 whereas the wind speed had little effect on evapotranspiration of p australis etph s in the 2nd experiment during the growing season this corroborates the result of wenying et al 2008 while the relative humidity had not effects on evapotranspiration variation which was similar to what obtained by pauliukonis and schneider 2001 in this study evapotranspiration reached the maximum in july and august and it constantly develops with growing of plants and increase of air temperature in arid areas air temperature is a very significant factor and it has stronger effects on evapotranspiration evapotranspiration variation is affected by air temperature to a great degree the solar radiation had also significant effects on the evapotranspiration of phragmites wenying et al 2008 3 4 crop coefficient kc kc for a given crop is variable throughout the growing season although reasonably the same under very different environmental conditions fig 8 shows 10 days kc values variation for the two species throughout the study period the crop coefficient kc of p australis and t latifolia showed a similar trend in each experiment at both experiments july and august were characterized by highest growth of both of the species when the plants in the 1st experiment were shorter than in the 2nd since the experiments were stopped at the beginning of september it was not possible to detect the eventual part of the curve of decreasing kp values associated with plant senescence in the 1st experiment kc values increased from the beginning of april until the 3 rd 10 days of may then decrease slightly to 1st 10 days of june after that the kc values increase again still the 3rd 10 days of this month thereafter the values decreased and remained almost constant until the end of the experiment kc ph g and kc ty g were minimum at the 2nd 10 days of july 0 22 and 0 17 respectively and reached the maximum of 1 47 at the 3rd 10 days of may for p australis and 1 13 at the 3rd 10 days of april for t latifolia the mean kc ph g and kc ty g values were about 0 70 and 0 55 respectively regarding both of the species in the 2nd experiment kc values for p australis were constantly found to be lower than t latifolia in april and may thereafter the values remained higher until the end of test the highest kc values were found in the 2nd 10 days of august for p australis 4 27 with average seasonal values of 2 36 and in the 2nd 10 days of april for t latifolia 2 98 with average seasonal values of 2 10 in general the highest values of kc calculated in these experiments on august are probably due to the fact that the plants were at full growth it is interesting to note the rise in crop coefficients for august as a result of the lower reference evapotranspiration rates that were measured in our study the kc values were very lower than those reported in other studies in different climate such as kadlec and wallace 2009 5 4 for t latifolia and 7 3 for p australis in microcosm system less than one square meter borin et al 2011 6 3 in sicily 6 8 in veneto for p australis pedescoll et al 2013 6 52 for p australis 9 6 for t latifolia and milani et al 2019 4 76 for p australis on the contrary the calculated crop coefficient for both species in this study was more greater than calculated by some researchers abtew and obeysekera 1995 kc 1 0 for a 549 ha t latifolia wetland located in south florida peacock and hess 2004 0 71 for p australis zhou and zhou 2009 0 53 for p australis and rashed 2014 0 68 right r plant sequences 0 79 left l plant sequences for t latifolia and 0 87 r and 0 76 l for p australis the kc values in the 2nd experiment were also higher compared to the typical kc for agricultural crops which in most cases are in the range 0 9 1 2 due to the high evapotranspiration rates allen et al 1998 nonetheless these results agree with those found by beebe et al 2014 2 5 for t latifolia if we take a closer look at the average 10 days kc values of the two species for each experiment we find that kc varies monthly and highest values were found during the summer months when the plants had the highest vegetative growth and lowest values were found during the initial stage in the spring months the correlation coefficients between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ph s and ph g fig 9 a r2 0 111 and between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ty s and ty g fig 9 b r2 0 218 was relatively weak and not significant this was due probably to the effect of the type of substrate sand s or gravel g on plant growth in the two experiments for both species in contrast the linear regression between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ph g and ty g fig 9 c r2 0 471 and between 10 days crop coefficients kc for ph s and ty s fig 9 d r2 0 427 indicated that the values were significantly and positively correlated we can say that the growth of the two macrophytes was affected by the same climate and soil type during the testing period in each experiment with regard to the relationship between 10 days crop coefficient kc for t latifolia and p australis with plant height fig 10 the correlation coefficient r² 0 547 showed that 10 days crop coefficient kc for ty s was significantly and positively correlated with plant height comparing with other species for both vegetated experiments which presented a weak correlation coefficients fig 10 this means that when the plants are enjoying best vegetative conditions in terms of phenological parameters like plant height stem density and leaf number et processes are more intense also due to more favorable microclimate conditions 4 conclusions in arid areas evapotranspiration is the most important component of the water loss in construction wetland two experimentations composed from pilot scales containing p australis and t latifolia on two different substrate types sand or fine gravel were used on the same site to estimate the evapotranspiration rates and crop coefficients of each macrophyte the results of the present study showed that the seasonal average et rates varied greatly between the 1st experiment and the 2nd where the average et values were much lower than et0 values in the 1st experiment and very higher compared to the et0 values in the 2nd experiment considering cumulative evapotranspiration throughout the entire monitoring period the highest accumulated et values were obtained with p australis beds which were found to have higher accumulated et values than t latifolia beds in addition in the both experiments cumulative et values in planted lysimeters were found to be different and higher than unplanted ones when comparing cumulative et from the vegetated beds in each experiment with cumulative et0 et values were lower in the first experiment and greater in the second with regard to crop coefficient kc this study highlighted that the average 10 days kc values of the two species for each experiment were varied monthly and highest values were found during the summer months when the plants had the highest vegetative growth and lowest values were found during the initial stage in the spring months the average seasonal value of kc in the 1st experiment was relatively smaller than 2nd experiment where the kc ph s value was almost three times the kc ph g and kc ty s values were almost four times the kc ty g in general this study demonstrated that et and kc are depending on climate conditions the macrophytes growth in the same period and also depending on the flow direction in cws horizontal or vertical and the type of substrate in which the macrophytes are planted it would be interesting to use the continuous flow of water in vertical flow subsurface constructed wetlands filled with gravel in addition since the variation of et is related to other factors e g vegetation type sunshine hours etc more factors should be taken into account in future research to study their impacts on et declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research work was supported by the scientific and technical research

968,for mexican temperate forests mtfs understood as mountain forest ecosystems formed by pine oak and fir forests the water forest nexus is unknown because of their range of climatic topographic and overall ecological particularities estimates for other temperate forests may not be transferred a systematic literature review has been carried out to compile information on hydrologic variables in mtfs existing knowledge specific for mtfs remains scarce as the limited amount of studies 20 shows but suggests a water forest nexus higher infiltration offsets evapotranspiration losses compared to other ecosystems in central mexico and some evidence exists for such a nexus in the transition zones to semi arid environments for which it is generally assumed that they spend more water in evapotranspiration than they capture for mtfs infiltration is statistically significantly larger and faster than in other vegetation types and is associated with the presence of litter in the upper soil layers the water forest nexus cannot be expected in tropical dry forests and shrubs as interception and evapotranspiration are much higher in semi arid climates and don t leave enough water for deep infiltration mtfs play a special role compared to other vegetation types because of their structure especially the presence of litter composition and function and their geographic setting mtfs are located in high elevation areas so that they receive larger amounts of precipitation but at the same time show a decreased potential evapotranspiration because of a decrease in temperature with elevation key words water yield temperate forests mexico forest management nexus 1 introduction it has long been known that forests and water share an intimate relationship and changes in the hydrological system have been observed as a consequence of forest loss or degradation since centuries hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 grant et al 2013 today the crucial role forests play in the hydrological cycle or also called the forest water nexus is being increasingly recognized e g forests and water agenda fao expert panel on forests and water of the international union of forest research organizations iufro world water council wwc green vs blue ecosystem services etc and promoted to establish synergies between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem conservation and management fao 2013 gartner et al 2013 upstream forests play a critical role in supplying water downstream since they intercept atmospheric moisture contributing to cloud and rain formation they regulate water flow to mitigate droughts and floods purify water and stabilize soil among others fao 2013 grant et al 2013 macdonald and stednick 2003 and thus have been coined as natural infrastructure for ecosystem services gartner et al 2013 forests cover 6 of the terrestrial surface but can retain up to 50 of rainfall myers 1997 about 75 of the world s freshwater for agriculture industry and human settlements come from forests and demand for water will increase in the future fao 2013 other vegetation types also share some of the hydrological features of forests but the latter possess a range of structural and functional characteristics that are closely related to the composition of woody plants trees are large plants that form a dense canopy and together with other plants form multiple layers of vegetation so that falling rain is slowed down and its erosive force reduced especially the thick layer of litter of the forest floor is an important component for both erosion control and infiltration trees have sturdy roots that help to retain soil as well as providing deep ranging pathways for infiltration this maximizes soil water content and minimizes overland flow so that most rainfall moves to streams by subsurface flow where nutrient uptake cycling and contaminant sorption processes are fast galicia and zarco arista 2014 forest soils also play an important role in the water forest nexus since their biological chemical and physical characteristics determine its structure with a high porosity low bulk density and highly saturated hydraulic conductivities and infiltration rates this means that forests provide a triple effect to enhance infiltration and soil moisture root structure of trees and soil characteristics increase infiltration while canopy density stemflow and throughfall lead to a rain lag the results are high quality water delivery to streams peak flow moderation and base flow regulation neary et al 2009 galicia and zarco arista 2014 preventing nutrient and contaminant delivery to streams fao 2013 but forests are also considered major water users which consume most of the precipitation through evapotranspiration grant et al 2013 the relationship between forest and water is influenced by a large array of factors primarily climate topography soil forest structure and composition as well as forest management fao 2013 brown et al 2005 despite of the general recognition of the importance of forests for the water cycle the relationships between forests and water in a particular context are little known van dijk and keenan 2007 there are claims that this forest water nexus should not be assumed without testing this assumption with data chomitz and kumari 1998 water yield understood as the average amount of fresh water that runs off superficially has been reported to decrease in reforested basins because trees require more water as they grow brown et al 2005 gonzález montiel 2013 but for tropical regions reforestation has also been shown to be beneficial for infiltration ilstedt et al 2007 a major obstacle to understanding this forest water nexus is the natural variability of water resources across and within watersheds of a given land cover type or management practice nevertheless in the last years scientific evidence that afforestation of agricultural land reduces stream flow has been found van dijk and keenan 2007 mexican temperate forests mtfs understood as mountain forest ecosystems formed mainly by pine oak and fir forests are one of those cases where the water forest nexus is unknown and no estimates of their role in the hydrological cycle are available muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 mtfs have received little attention in empirical studies and theoretical reviews of forest ecology ecosystem services and climate change galicia and zarco arista 2014 and many aspects of forest hydrology are unknown cantú silva y gonzález rodríguez 2001 because of their range of climatic topographic and overall ecological particularities estimates for other temperate forests like e g in the us may not be transferred to the mexican counterparts mtfs are the world s center of diversity of pine and oak species with 50 and 140 species respectively halffter et al 2008 the in situ evolution of both genus is such that around 50 of pine and 33 of oak species worldwide are found in mexico challenger and soberón 2008 among which 24 pine species and 109 oak species are endemic to mexico galicia et al 2016 these ecosystems show a high floristic richness that constitute roughly 7000 species or 24 of the total plant species of mexico rzedowski et al 2006 some of this diversity may represent direct modifications of hydrological flows compared to extra tropical temperate forests as in the case of tropical plants that inhabit mtfs as epiphytes they do not only modify throughfall and stemflow pattern carlyle moses et al 2004 but also interception besides one major difference in tropical climate that affects the hydrological role of vegetation is the much higher precipitation intensity in mtfs on a yearly basis precipitation events with 50 mm are common návar 2011 mtfs cover a large magnitude of altitude and tropical mountain climate with a pronounced seasonal drought as well as a large array of soils types galicia et al 2016 so not only the biological topographic and climatic diversity contrasts with extra tropical temperate forests but also soil diversity since the latter are concentrated on molisols and aridisols on a global level palm et al 2007 in this study we review the existing primary research and compile and synthetize studies reporting ecohydrological evidence to evaluate the effect of mtfs characteristics on the forest water nexus a forest water nexus for mtfs would exist if larger infiltration offsets evapotranspiration losses emphasizing the role of mtfs to provide crucial hydrological ecosystem services over a longer period of time based on this state of the art review we identify knowledge gaps and biases 2 study area mtf consist of single species or mixed forests of pine pinus spp oak quercus spp and many other genera such as abies pseudotsuga picea cupressus and juniperus and endemic species arbutus xalapensis alnus firmifolia prunus capuli crataegus mexicana or restricted distribution pinus hartwegii galicia et al 2016 mexican temperate forests also harbor 656 species of amphibians 1300 species of birds 1586 species of reptiles and 146 species of mammals challenger 1998 ceballos et al 2002 mtfs cover a large magnitude of altitude and tropical mountain climate as well as a large array of soils types mainly leptosols regosols luvisols phaeosems cambisols umbrisols and andosols formed from volcanic material in central mexico sedimentary rocks in the sierra madre oriental and a large variety of substrates in the sierra madre occidental figure 1 dominant soil types are shallow young soils like leptosols and regosols which account for almost 60 of the mtfs the tropical mountain climates show hot summers and cooler winters with an average annual precipitation between 600 and 1200 mm and a mean annual temperature ranging from 10 to 26 c galicia et al 2016 fao 2021 3 methods mtfs were defined based on the official mexican vegetation classification scheme velázquez et al 2002 and included broad leaved and coniferous forests montane cloud forests were not considered as their attribution to temperate or tropical associations is not clear in many cases muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 a systematic literature review following standard review methods pullin and stewart 2006 has been carried out to compile information on hydrologic variables in mtfs in order test the forest water nexus in mexico to identify peer reviewed experimental studies literature was searched in scientific journals using web of science scopus and google scholar and thesis in the repositories of the colegio de postgraduados colpos digital http colposdigital colpos mx 8080 jspui handle 10521 48 universidad autónoma de nuevo león colección digital uanl http cd dgb uanl mx and universidad nacional autónoma de méxico http oreon dgbiblio unam mx f rn 740445185 the key words used both in english and spanish were water or cycle or runoff or flow or precipitation or infiltration or watershed or hydrologic or water supply or hydrologic monitoring or ecohydrology temperate forest mexico furthermore key authors that were identified through those terms were used to complete the search josé návar marlín pérez suárez juan d benavides solorio julieta jujnovsky the criteria to determine if a study was relevant was if they contained information regarding the hydrological processes in mtf based on in situ measurements relevant papers were selected using title and abstract and if papers were considered relevant the complete text was reviewed we could not consider the geology topography or other climatic variables other than precipitation because the publications do not report on those aspects even though they have a strong influence in the components of the hydrological cycle once the studies to review were selected data on the reported hydrological components for different forest types were extracted to evaluate the possibility of a meta analysis the reported components were precipitation interception evapotranspiration throughfall stemflow runoff infiltration recharge and base flow the forest types were pine forest oak forest mixed forests and in the cases that reported values for the whole of the study areas these were also considered as the variables in different studies were reported in different units all values were converted to mm for standardization besides the absolute values in mm the relative proportion of those values in regard of precipitation was established as the data extraction also included the date and period of field measurements and measures of variance or elements to calculate a measure of variance like the quantity of measurements n as the primary research studies did not report the variance of their results or the information to calculate it this synthesis did not yield the necessary data for a meta analysis an alternative approach of meta analytic thinking was applied and a qualitative review is presented in order to give an overview of the broader picture of the role of mtfs in the water forest nexus also an evaluation of the completeness of published ecohydrodological studies based on the criteria for inclusion of primary research studies in meta analysis proposed by gerstner et al 2017 is presented 4 results 4 1 systematic literature review of the 20 relevant publications that complied with the selection criteria 12 contained data for old growth forests and 9 for managed forests five studies were located in the hydrologic region conagua 2006 pacific nw sub regions baja california s sonora presidio san pedro six in gulf of mexico sub region san fernando soto la mar n veracruz one in n altiplano sub region el salado five in central mexico sub regions panuco valle de méxico río tulancingo alto balsas lerma santiago one in tropical pacific sub region armeria coahuayana and one in grijalva usumacinta sub region alto grijalva figure 2 40 among the measurements reported in all publications were on broad leaved and 60 on coniferous forests interception evapotranspiration stemflow throughfall runoff and infiltration were the most commonly reported variables while recharge and base flow were only reported once based on a hydrological model validated with in situ measurements considering the type of information around half of the reviewed studies contain information about sample effort and area replicates and detailed location with coordinates in the methods table 1 results and tables only contain data to explain means independent replicates or statistical outcome in one out of five studies explained variation and p values are reported slightly more often in the figures only 5 to 7 publications report means with variation no overlapping points p values and only one study reports data for all treatments pérez suárez et al 2014 the rest only report means over several years table 2 most measurements reported in the studies were taken as part of post graduate or post doctoral studies at a single location over a short period of time 1 3 years the reported data are spatially focused figure 2 local scale and cannot be controlled for inter annual variability making findings hardly representative total rainfall during one study 974 mm in 2 6 years was only 58 of the normal mean annual precipitation due to the el niño event in 1997 and the implications of the amount of precipitation in each event on the hydrological components is not clear cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2001 in the following paragraphs thus we present a qualitative narrative review on the most reported components of the hydrological cycle in the reviewed literature as well as changes caused by forest management and fires 4 2 ecohydrological processes described in primary research studies 4 2 1 interception interception is the hydrological parameter most reported in the literature covering a wide range of results the heterogeneous composition of vegetation types in different climatic settings leads to some studies reporting that pine trees intercept more precipitation than oaks cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 díaz fernández et al 2006 and others the opposite correa 1998 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2001 in the same sense mixed forests can intercept more cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2001 or less than monospecific stands correa 1998 no significant differences between forest types have been identified in all 8 studies but interception has been recognized as a substantial part of precipitation especially in the transition zone to semi arid regions návar et al 1999 4 2 2 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is usually not measured but derived by subtracting measured hydrological components from the incoming precipitation near the transition to semi arid areas evapotranspiration can be extremely high and variable návar 2011 found in ne mexico an average of 84 of evapotranspiration table 2 and almost 100 variability for conifer forests in w mexico 59 65 of evapotranspiration have been reported benavides solorio et al 2008 villavicencio et al 2014 návar 2013 table 2 in central mexico jujnovsky et al 2012 report 38 of evapotranspiration for pinus hartwegii forest and 13 for oak forest in total four studies report on evapotranspiration 4 2 3 throughfall the three studies that report on throughfall range from 35 to 121 to cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 pérez suárez et al 2014 carlyle moses et al 2004 table 2 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 observed that mixed forests deposited significantly more mineral nutrients than single species forests a higher foliar biomass and that all vegetation types reduced the ph of rainwater but pines more than others 4 2 4 stemflow tree canopy cover oaks diameter at breast height pines and average height both have been reported to explain stemflow variations in different forest types correa 1998 návar 2011 regression models suggest that young trees with a small canopy and diameter funnel more stemflow than larger trees návar 2011 infiltration resulting from stemflow in mtfs can be twice as deep as in bare soil and 3 times the depth as compared to shrubs návar 2011 when compared to tropical trees and shrubs the variability among mtf species is less and they generate larger volumes and deeper infiltration the latter aspect being more pronounced in small precipitation events where values of 7 vs 21 cm have been measured while for large precipitation events 50 mm values of 60 vs 170 cm have been observed návar 2011 the six studies reporting on stemflow show that it plays an important role in the ecohydrology of mtfs as despite the small fractions of precipitation that are represented by stemflow this process seems important for replenishing soil moisture also the amount of stemflow increases threefold from tree to plot level and it is suggested that it could be a relevant pathway for aquifer recharge návar 2011 pérez suárez et al 2014 mixed forests have been seen to be more effective in funneling stemflow to the forest floor pérez suárez et al 2014 up to three times more than oaks or seven times than pines návar 2011 but other authors do not confirm this finding and report values equivalent to oak forests correa 1998 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 some studies mention that pine forests show significantly lower stemflow volumes than oak forests and stemflow occurs with higher precipitation correa 1998 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 pérez suárez et al 2014 návar 2011 even though the values reported do not support this finding table 2 the studies mention that an important feature for the reduced stemflow of pines is their rugose bark that stores a big portion of stemflow water pérez suárez et al 2014 while the smooth bark of oaks facilitates stemflow correa 1998 significant intra species differences were also found for pinus pseudostrobus and quercus sp correa 1998 4 2 5 surface runoff the 10 studies with data on surface runoff show that there is less runoff in mature than in managed forest with ranges of 0 25 of precipitation for the former table 1 several studies conclude that oak forests generate less runoff jujnovsky et al 2012 pérez suárez et al 2014 because of higher litter production and differences in litter structure depth and hydrophilic properties pérez suárez et al 2014 beside oak forests being located on less steep terrain and in lower altitude jujnovsky et al 2012 quercus potosina has been reported to need 21 times more net precipitation than pinus cembroides to generate runoff pérez suárez et al 2014 4 2 6 infiltration despite only 5 studies reporting on the amount of water infiltrated in different forest types there are several other studies in mtf that cover other aspects of infiltration like infiltration speed since those latter experiments are not comparable with the amount of infiltration they are not included in table 2 altogether there is evidence that infiltration is statistically significantly larger and faster in mtf than in other vegetation types e g tropical dry forests shrubs and grassland from experiments involving the manipulation of upper soil substrates the presence and characteristics of litter are crucial to promote infiltration díaz fernández et al 2006 garcía hernández et al 2007 návar 2013 pérez suárez et al 2014 villavicencio garcía et al 2014 infiltration is mediated by the water storage capacity for litter garcía hernández et al 2007 pérez suárez et al 2014 and infiltration speed is determined by the presence and depth of litter and the amount of organic material in the upper soil layer besides distance to water bodies and age of the ecosystem garcía hernández et al 2007 the reported amounts range from 0 to 53 of precipitation table 1 with the highest values for central mexico 33 53 and lower values for n and w mexico overall because of tree and stand characteristics that influence interception throughfall and stemflow pine forests provide less water on the forest floor for infiltration as do oak forests cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 and oak litter has been reported to have a higher field capacity further enhancing infiltration pérez suárez et al 2014 some studies also compare the infiltration rates of forests with adjacent pasture areas and find that mtf infiltrate more water than pastures díaz fernández et al 2006 pérez suárez et al 2014 even though some pastures may show localized elevated infiltration rates where livestock spend more time and leave more excrements to be incorporated as organic material into the soil such as water holes garcía hernández et al 2007 4 2 7 recharge there are no empirical data on recharge for mtf but one study based on modelling calibrated with in situ data in central mexico suggests that only natural pine forests without grassland mosaics recharged the aquifer 2 of infiltration 0 43 of precipitation and are the main contributors to lateral and base flow jujnovsky et al 2012 forests in nw mexico apparently play an important role for recharge as for a study area that was mainly covered by semi arid shrubs the marginal cover of mtf enhanced recharge significantly cordero gonzález 2014 4 2 8 base flow it is important to notice that from november to march there is no runoff in mexico due to the dry season and baseflow contributed 85 and runoff only 15 to water overall water availability for central mexico jujnosvky et al 2012 baseflow comprises almost 50 of precipitation and allows the magdalena river to provide water year round for mexico city natural high mountain grasslands contributed substantially to base flow but less than pine forests jujnovsky et al 2012 4 3 ecohydrological processes reported for managed forests forest management intensive silviculture method mds for its spanish acronym aimed at high levels of production leads to a decrease in infiltration higher runoff and soil erosion in all forest management stages and interventions dueñez alanis et al 2006 dueñez alanis 2007 erosion is highest after the second forest thinning process while infiltration is lower and runoff higher in the third thinning and regeneration cut up to 93 for runoff table 1 a year after the interventions the values of the different forest plots show a recovery except in areas that were converted into cattle pasture and maintain high levels of runoff and soil erosion dueñez alanis et al 2006 there was no difference in infiltration or runoff between sites with or without canopy cover in a commercially used forest so litter is determined as the main factor deemed more important than other soil characteristics as density texture and organic matter other factors enhancing infiltration are the existence of shrubs and regrowth in the understory dueñez alanis 2007 dragging logs over the forest floor disturbing the soil cover could be related to the observed hydrological disturbances and higher sediment rates dueñez alanis 2006 gonzález 2013 report 47 96 lower infiltration in managed forests pinus patula plantation under mds regime as compared to old growth forest at 10 cm depth infiltration did not show any significant difference on the surface and was overall lower than in other managed forests dueñez alanis 2006 this could be due to the also lower hydraulic conductivity of the soil in pine plantations as hydraulic conductivity is important for infiltration and is reduced in manged forests only to recover after 30 years castro 2009 this has been attributed to the fact that andosols exposed to dehydration after clear cutting leads to a degradation of water binding compounds as imogolite ferrihydrite allophane and opal ángeles 2010 soil moisture was also lower for one of the managed forests 9 vs 25 for old growth forests but was equivalent to old growth forests for the rest as well as soil density hydrophobia and nutrients gonzález 2013 in many places in mexico oak forests get replaced with pine forests to increase wood production or by chronic human disturbances in secondary forests that favour growth of pines gonzález espinosa et al 2009 díaz fernández et al 2012 report that interception was higher in oak than in pine forests in w mexico not significant interception was negatively correlated to precipitation in both cases throughfall was not different between oak and pine forest but stemflow was higher for oaks the authors conclude that pinus michoacana captures a higher percentage of precipitation to recharge the aquifer than quercus obtusata benavides solorio et al 2008 conclude that there are ways to increase the water yield of watersheds by forest management stand thinning the problem is that it is not clear which method or amount of vegetation removal would lead to the desired outcome as there have been no catchment studies in mexico based on measuring interception losses for individual trees in a pine plantation in e mexico zavaleta et al 2012 conclude that pine plantations not reforestation should be implemented to increase aquifer recharge 4 3 1 fire for forest management or wildfires fires increase hydrophobic properties of litter and soil resulting in reduced infiltration and increased runoff morales et al 2000 report a 3 fold increase in runoff this increase was associated with a reduction in litter depth and effects are still measurable one year after the burning and are stronger in areas which receive burns over 2 consecutive years burning enhances not only hydrophobic properties of litter but also generates organic distillates below the soil surface by heating infiltrating and condensing processes and destroys soil aggregates morales et al 2000 temperature soil texture and burning materials are important factors controlling the amount of distilled substances and their depth morales et al 2000 castro 2009 found a 90 reduction in infiltration because of wildfires in central mexico prescribed burns buffer the potential negative effects of wildfires enhance regeneration of desirable plant species and create temporary forest openings but impacts the hydrologic dynamic of forests morales et al 2000 to mitigate negative hydrologic impacts litter should not be reduced to less than 2 cm as the potential runoff without any litter gets reduced to 30 burns should be applied with a frequency 3 years to allow the soil to revert hydrophobic compounds and aggregate destruction morales et al 2000 5 discussion 5 1 existing knowledge base and knowledge gaps this review is the first intent to gather information on mtfs and their ecohydrological characteristics to elucidate the main biotic influences of rainfall interception and redistribution by the heterogeneous composition of vegetation patches and their diverse combination of species traits it identifies existing ecohydrological studies for mtf makes major knowledge gaps evident and qualitatively integrates the existing information for mexico no watershed scale study exists while neary et al 2009 report 441 experimental watersheds in the usa between 1934 and 2002 and 5 for canada 1970 2001 this highlights the need of watershed scale studies in mft to gather information about the hydrological role of forests in mexico currently the size of effect of several types of mtfs the mixture of species and canopy structure trunk and root or soil type on interception throughfall stemflow infiltration runoff and recharge is still unknown because of the small number of studies and observations n 20 and because the publications except one do not report on variance of their results making any analysis inviable around half of the publication do not even report basic methodological information like the exact study area location or the number of replicates the review of the bibliography gives an overview of the state of the art and lays the basis for an experimentally strong project to further investigate spatial and thematic knowledge gaps and omissions clearly visible in figure 1 and table 2 the results make it clear that it is necessary to improve the technical content of ecohydrological publications for mtfs through clear and transparent information about the methods and results especially adequate metadata describing data characteristics and collection protocols gerstner et al 2017 studies need to consider explicitly the geology topography and other climatic variables than precipitation because of their strong influence on the components of the hydrological cycle a major aspect resulting from the interplay of those factors is a precipitation distribution with high elevation so that mtfs receive larger amounts of precipitation than other vegetation types e g ranges of maximum precipitation in mtfs with important implications for the role of those forests in the provision of hydrologic ecosystem services elevation is also important for a decreased potential evapotranspiration because of a decrease in temperature with elevation this plays an important role given the long dry period of the tropical mountain climate with almost no effective winter precipitation in large parts of the distribution range of mtfs and their capacity for aquifer recharge 5 2 ecohydrological processes in mexican temperate forests even without quantitative data effect size thinking has been recognized as a valuable tool to report primary research study results because it emphasizes outcome magnitude and direction in contrast to p values which indicate neither gerstner et al 2017 in this sense the main finding is that the existing knowledge for mtfs in the water cycle remains scarce and it is not sufficient to confirm a water forest nexus higher infiltration offsets evapotranspiration losses compared to other ecosystems nevertheless the results reveal some evidence to suggest a forest water nexus for mtfs despite the low density of this type of studies in the country and the great latitudinal extension of mtfs the reviewed studies verify empirically the importance of litter in mtfs as has been shown for other temperate forests hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 grant et al 2013 li et al 2014 litter characteristics like water storage capacity of litter being higher for oak than for pine forests in mexico in line with studies from other regions walsh and voigt 1977 li et al 2014 determines runoff being higher for pine than for oak forests in mexico and infiltration besides the total amount of infiltration infiltration speed too is determined by the presence and depth of litter and the amount of organic material in the upper soil layer this dominant role of litter for infiltration is emphasized by a study that did not find any influence of canopy cover or other ecohydrological features of trees dueñez alanis 2007 besides the synthesis of empirical evidence using a chain of causal mechanisms linking the components of the hydrological cycle to water yield makes it possible to gather more evidence for a forest water nexus evapotranspiration as the second variable in the forest water nexus is very variable and seems to be well over 50 in the drier northern and some western parts of the country while in central mexico the available evidence suggests less than 40 of precipitation this makes is plausible to suggest a forest water nexus at least for central mexico but even for the transition zones to semi arid environments for which it is generally assumed that they spend more water in evapotranspiration than they capture návar 2013 ilstedt et al 2016 a forest water nexus seems possible the review shows that in those transition zones despite the elevated water vapor pressure mtfs show less variability and larger volumes of stemflow and deeper infiltration especially with small precipitation events than tropical vegetation correa 1998 for stemflow the different forest types are a little better represented and is found to be very important ecohydrological process for soil humidity in mtfs but to establish a proper effect size of mtfs and their management on the hydrological cycle the amount of research needs to be multiplied and consider a variety of experiments as mtfs are extremely diverse in species and environmental settings that should be represented to be able to understand factors associated with the heterogeneity of the outcomes the results would be of great relevance for decision making for hydrological ecosystem services and conservation of ecosystems in general the encountered studies on mtf management confirm findings and tendencies reported for a variety of international contexts like elevated soil erosion and runoff in managed forests hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 grant et al 2013 in north america harvesting of forests has been used to augment municipal water supplies because of the resulting increases in water yield for a certain period of time depending on several factors neary 2016 soil properties seem to be the most important factors impacted by mtfs management especially hydraulic conductivity which could explain the depth pattern of changes in infiltration reduced at 10 cm depth without apparent changes on the surface in the case of mtf the andosols on which they commonly occur show drought damage after dehydration of water binding compounds following clear cutting ángeles 2010 this effect is enhanced by forest fires that increase hydrophobic properties of litter and soil resulting in reduced infiltration up to 90 and increased runoff morales et al 2000 castro 2009 5 3 implications for hydrological ecosystem services regarding hydrological ecosystem services even if forests intercept more water because of the high leaf area and transpire more than other vegetation types the interaction between soil and vegetation types leads to greater water storage over longer periods of time as has been reported for other temperate forests macdonald and stednick 2003 neary et al 2009 this aspect is especially important as from november to march there is no runoff in mexico due to the dry season and baseflow is more important than runoff in mtf reaching almost 50 of precipitation in central mexico jujnovsky et al 2012 enhanced infiltration is the function of mtf that contribute most to regulating services like run off and flow regulation because of the tropical mountain climate consisting of summer rains and winter spring droughts subsurface flows contribute to stabilize base flow in the long term and enhances water filtering neary et al 2009 but the same characteristics of forests responsible for infiltration lateral flow and base flow stabilization also constitute the ability to decrease erosive force of rainfall as litter makes the water stay on the same surface for longer benavides solorio et al 2008 díaz fernández et al 2012 and provides high water quality demand for hydrological ecosystem services from these forests is increasing and the major urban areas already face water supply problems today with climate change most water stressed areas will likely get less water and water flows will become less predictable and more subject to extreme events mayers et al 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 increasing demands for water by agricultural industrial and urban users and water for the environment will intensify competition mayers et al 2009 murray et al 2012 climate change also affects forests itself by wildfires drought and mortality water security will get worse by poor management which first will come apparent in mega cities like mexico city water management in mexico has been recognized as one of the primary environmental concerns with two thirds of aquifers overexploited and water demand about two times higher than annual aquifer recharges benavides solorio et al 2008 knowledge of the forest water nexus in mexico is critical to improve water management and develop strategies in the face of not only large swaths of semi arid and arid lands but also considering the tropical mountain climate in mtf which means a yearly recurring water scarcity for most of mtf regions during the dry season the need to generate useful ecohydrological information for the management of water and forests in mexico is urgent since the central highlands concentrate the main portion of human population and population growth is ongoing 35 million people including mexico city representing near of 30 of the total population inegi 2019 it is urgent to recognize the challenges and opportunities for investigating the forest water nexus in mexico so that different aspects of hydrological functions can be used to devise better management strategies and invest in funding researchers and facilitate systematization of experiments and results by governmental agencies declaration of

968,for mexican temperate forests mtfs understood as mountain forest ecosystems formed by pine oak and fir forests the water forest nexus is unknown because of their range of climatic topographic and overall ecological particularities estimates for other temperate forests may not be transferred a systematic literature review has been carried out to compile information on hydrologic variables in mtfs existing knowledge specific for mtfs remains scarce as the limited amount of studies 20 shows but suggests a water forest nexus higher infiltration offsets evapotranspiration losses compared to other ecosystems in central mexico and some evidence exists for such a nexus in the transition zones to semi arid environments for which it is generally assumed that they spend more water in evapotranspiration than they capture for mtfs infiltration is statistically significantly larger and faster than in other vegetation types and is associated with the presence of litter in the upper soil layers the water forest nexus cannot be expected in tropical dry forests and shrubs as interception and evapotranspiration are much higher in semi arid climates and don t leave enough water for deep infiltration mtfs play a special role compared to other vegetation types because of their structure especially the presence of litter composition and function and their geographic setting mtfs are located in high elevation areas so that they receive larger amounts of precipitation but at the same time show a decreased potential evapotranspiration because of a decrease in temperature with elevation key words water yield temperate forests mexico forest management nexus 1 introduction it has long been known that forests and water share an intimate relationship and changes in the hydrological system have been observed as a consequence of forest loss or degradation since centuries hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 grant et al 2013 today the crucial role forests play in the hydrological cycle or also called the forest water nexus is being increasingly recognized e g forests and water agenda fao expert panel on forests and water of the international union of forest research organizations iufro world water council wwc green vs blue ecosystem services etc and promoted to establish synergies between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem conservation and management fao 2013 gartner et al 2013 upstream forests play a critical role in supplying water downstream since they intercept atmospheric moisture contributing to cloud and rain formation they regulate water flow to mitigate droughts and floods purify water and stabilize soil among others fao 2013 grant et al 2013 macdonald and stednick 2003 and thus have been coined as natural infrastructure for ecosystem services gartner et al 2013 forests cover 6 of the terrestrial surface but can retain up to 50 of rainfall myers 1997 about 75 of the world s freshwater for agriculture industry and human settlements come from forests and demand for water will increase in the future fao 2013 other vegetation types also share some of the hydrological features of forests but the latter possess a range of structural and functional characteristics that are closely related to the composition of woody plants trees are large plants that form a dense canopy and together with other plants form multiple layers of vegetation so that falling rain is slowed down and its erosive force reduced especially the thick layer of litter of the forest floor is an important component for both erosion control and infiltration trees have sturdy roots that help to retain soil as well as providing deep ranging pathways for infiltration this maximizes soil water content and minimizes overland flow so that most rainfall moves to streams by subsurface flow where nutrient uptake cycling and contaminant sorption processes are fast galicia and zarco arista 2014 forest soils also play an important role in the water forest nexus since their biological chemical and physical characteristics determine its structure with a high porosity low bulk density and highly saturated hydraulic conductivities and infiltration rates this means that forests provide a triple effect to enhance infiltration and soil moisture root structure of trees and soil characteristics increase infiltration while canopy density stemflow and throughfall lead to a rain lag the results are high quality water delivery to streams peak flow moderation and base flow regulation neary et al 2009 galicia and zarco arista 2014 preventing nutrient and contaminant delivery to streams fao 2013 but forests are also considered major water users which consume most of the precipitation through evapotranspiration grant et al 2013 the relationship between forest and water is influenced by a large array of factors primarily climate topography soil forest structure and composition as well as forest management fao 2013 brown et al 2005 despite of the general recognition of the importance of forests for the water cycle the relationships between forests and water in a particular context are little known van dijk and keenan 2007 there are claims that this forest water nexus should not be assumed without testing this assumption with data chomitz and kumari 1998 water yield understood as the average amount of fresh water that runs off superficially has been reported to decrease in reforested basins because trees require more water as they grow brown et al 2005 gonzález montiel 2013 but for tropical regions reforestation has also been shown to be beneficial for infiltration ilstedt et al 2007 a major obstacle to understanding this forest water nexus is the natural variability of water resources across and within watersheds of a given land cover type or management practice nevertheless in the last years scientific evidence that afforestation of agricultural land reduces stream flow has been found van dijk and keenan 2007 mexican temperate forests mtfs understood as mountain forest ecosystems formed mainly by pine oak and fir forests are one of those cases where the water forest nexus is unknown and no estimates of their role in the hydrological cycle are available muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 mtfs have received little attention in empirical studies and theoretical reviews of forest ecology ecosystem services and climate change galicia and zarco arista 2014 and many aspects of forest hydrology are unknown cantú silva y gonzález rodríguez 2001 because of their range of climatic topographic and overall ecological particularities estimates for other temperate forests like e g in the us may not be transferred to the mexican counterparts mtfs are the world s center of diversity of pine and oak species with 50 and 140 species respectively halffter et al 2008 the in situ evolution of both genus is such that around 50 of pine and 33 of oak species worldwide are found in mexico challenger and soberón 2008 among which 24 pine species and 109 oak species are endemic to mexico galicia et al 2016 these ecosystems show a high floristic richness that constitute roughly 7000 species or 24 of the total plant species of mexico rzedowski et al 2006 some of this diversity may represent direct modifications of hydrological flows compared to extra tropical temperate forests as in the case of tropical plants that inhabit mtfs as epiphytes they do not only modify throughfall and stemflow pattern carlyle moses et al 2004 but also interception besides one major difference in tropical climate that affects the hydrological role of vegetation is the much higher precipitation intensity in mtfs on a yearly basis precipitation events with 50 mm are common návar 2011 mtfs cover a large magnitude of altitude and tropical mountain climate with a pronounced seasonal drought as well as a large array of soils types galicia et al 2016 so not only the biological topographic and climatic diversity contrasts with extra tropical temperate forests but also soil diversity since the latter are concentrated on molisols and aridisols on a global level palm et al 2007 in this study we review the existing primary research and compile and synthetize studies reporting ecohydrological evidence to evaluate the effect of mtfs characteristics on the forest water nexus a forest water nexus for mtfs would exist if larger infiltration offsets evapotranspiration losses emphasizing the role of mtfs to provide crucial hydrological ecosystem services over a longer period of time based on this state of the art review we identify knowledge gaps and biases 2 study area mtf consist of single species or mixed forests of pine pinus spp oak quercus spp and many other genera such as abies pseudotsuga picea cupressus and juniperus and endemic species arbutus xalapensis alnus firmifolia prunus capuli crataegus mexicana or restricted distribution pinus hartwegii galicia et al 2016 mexican temperate forests also harbor 656 species of amphibians 1300 species of birds 1586 species of reptiles and 146 species of mammals challenger 1998 ceballos et al 2002 mtfs cover a large magnitude of altitude and tropical mountain climate as well as a large array of soils types mainly leptosols regosols luvisols phaeosems cambisols umbrisols and andosols formed from volcanic material in central mexico sedimentary rocks in the sierra madre oriental and a large variety of substrates in the sierra madre occidental figure 1 dominant soil types are shallow young soils like leptosols and regosols which account for almost 60 of the mtfs the tropical mountain climates show hot summers and cooler winters with an average annual precipitation between 600 and 1200 mm and a mean annual temperature ranging from 10 to 26 c galicia et al 2016 fao 2021 3 methods mtfs were defined based on the official mexican vegetation classification scheme velázquez et al 2002 and included broad leaved and coniferous forests montane cloud forests were not considered as their attribution to temperate or tropical associations is not clear in many cases muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 a systematic literature review following standard review methods pullin and stewart 2006 has been carried out to compile information on hydrologic variables in mtfs in order test the forest water nexus in mexico to identify peer reviewed experimental studies literature was searched in scientific journals using web of science scopus and google scholar and thesis in the repositories of the colegio de postgraduados colpos digital http colposdigital colpos mx 8080 jspui handle 10521 48 universidad autónoma de nuevo león colección digital uanl http cd dgb uanl mx and universidad nacional autónoma de méxico http oreon dgbiblio unam mx f rn 740445185 the key words used both in english and spanish were water or cycle or runoff or flow or precipitation or infiltration or watershed or hydrologic or water supply or hydrologic monitoring or ecohydrology temperate forest mexico furthermore key authors that were identified through those terms were used to complete the search josé návar marlín pérez suárez juan d benavides solorio julieta jujnovsky the criteria to determine if a study was relevant was if they contained information regarding the hydrological processes in mtf based on in situ measurements relevant papers were selected using title and abstract and if papers were considered relevant the complete text was reviewed we could not consider the geology topography or other climatic variables other than precipitation because the publications do not report on those aspects even though they have a strong influence in the components of the hydrological cycle once the studies to review were selected data on the reported hydrological components for different forest types were extracted to evaluate the possibility of a meta analysis the reported components were precipitation interception evapotranspiration throughfall stemflow runoff infiltration recharge and base flow the forest types were pine forest oak forest mixed forests and in the cases that reported values for the whole of the study areas these were also considered as the variables in different studies were reported in different units all values were converted to mm for standardization besides the absolute values in mm the relative proportion of those values in regard of precipitation was established as the data extraction also included the date and period of field measurements and measures of variance or elements to calculate a measure of variance like the quantity of measurements n as the primary research studies did not report the variance of their results or the information to calculate it this synthesis did not yield the necessary data for a meta analysis an alternative approach of meta analytic thinking was applied and a qualitative review is presented in order to give an overview of the broader picture of the role of mtfs in the water forest nexus also an evaluation of the completeness of published ecohydrodological studies based on the criteria for inclusion of primary research studies in meta analysis proposed by gerstner et al 2017 is presented 4 results 4 1 systematic literature review of the 20 relevant publications that complied with the selection criteria 12 contained data for old growth forests and 9 for managed forests five studies were located in the hydrologic region conagua 2006 pacific nw sub regions baja california s sonora presidio san pedro six in gulf of mexico sub region san fernando soto la mar n veracruz one in n altiplano sub region el salado five in central mexico sub regions panuco valle de méxico río tulancingo alto balsas lerma santiago one in tropical pacific sub region armeria coahuayana and one in grijalva usumacinta sub region alto grijalva figure 2 40 among the measurements reported in all publications were on broad leaved and 60 on coniferous forests interception evapotranspiration stemflow throughfall runoff and infiltration were the most commonly reported variables while recharge and base flow were only reported once based on a hydrological model validated with in situ measurements considering the type of information around half of the reviewed studies contain information about sample effort and area replicates and detailed location with coordinates in the methods table 1 results and tables only contain data to explain means independent replicates or statistical outcome in one out of five studies explained variation and p values are reported slightly more often in the figures only 5 to 7 publications report means with variation no overlapping points p values and only one study reports data for all treatments pérez suárez et al 2014 the rest only report means over several years table 2 most measurements reported in the studies were taken as part of post graduate or post doctoral studies at a single location over a short period of time 1 3 years the reported data are spatially focused figure 2 local scale and cannot be controlled for inter annual variability making findings hardly representative total rainfall during one study 974 mm in 2 6 years was only 58 of the normal mean annual precipitation due to the el niño event in 1997 and the implications of the amount of precipitation in each event on the hydrological components is not clear cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2001 in the following paragraphs thus we present a qualitative narrative review on the most reported components of the hydrological cycle in the reviewed literature as well as changes caused by forest management and fires 4 2 ecohydrological processes described in primary research studies 4 2 1 interception interception is the hydrological parameter most reported in the literature covering a wide range of results the heterogeneous composition of vegetation types in different climatic settings leads to some studies reporting that pine trees intercept more precipitation than oaks cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 díaz fernández et al 2006 and others the opposite correa 1998 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2001 in the same sense mixed forests can intercept more cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2001 or less than monospecific stands correa 1998 no significant differences between forest types have been identified in all 8 studies but interception has been recognized as a substantial part of precipitation especially in the transition zone to semi arid regions návar et al 1999 4 2 2 evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is usually not measured but derived by subtracting measured hydrological components from the incoming precipitation near the transition to semi arid areas evapotranspiration can be extremely high and variable návar 2011 found in ne mexico an average of 84 of evapotranspiration table 2 and almost 100 variability for conifer forests in w mexico 59 65 of evapotranspiration have been reported benavides solorio et al 2008 villavicencio et al 2014 návar 2013 table 2 in central mexico jujnovsky et al 2012 report 38 of evapotranspiration for pinus hartwegii forest and 13 for oak forest in total four studies report on evapotranspiration 4 2 3 throughfall the three studies that report on throughfall range from 35 to 121 to cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 pérez suárez et al 2014 carlyle moses et al 2004 table 2 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 observed that mixed forests deposited significantly more mineral nutrients than single species forests a higher foliar biomass and that all vegetation types reduced the ph of rainwater but pines more than others 4 2 4 stemflow tree canopy cover oaks diameter at breast height pines and average height both have been reported to explain stemflow variations in different forest types correa 1998 návar 2011 regression models suggest that young trees with a small canopy and diameter funnel more stemflow than larger trees návar 2011 infiltration resulting from stemflow in mtfs can be twice as deep as in bare soil and 3 times the depth as compared to shrubs návar 2011 when compared to tropical trees and shrubs the variability among mtf species is less and they generate larger volumes and deeper infiltration the latter aspect being more pronounced in small precipitation events where values of 7 vs 21 cm have been measured while for large precipitation events 50 mm values of 60 vs 170 cm have been observed návar 2011 the six studies reporting on stemflow show that it plays an important role in the ecohydrology of mtfs as despite the small fractions of precipitation that are represented by stemflow this process seems important for replenishing soil moisture also the amount of stemflow increases threefold from tree to plot level and it is suggested that it could be a relevant pathway for aquifer recharge návar 2011 pérez suárez et al 2014 mixed forests have been seen to be more effective in funneling stemflow to the forest floor pérez suárez et al 2014 up to three times more than oaks or seven times than pines návar 2011 but other authors do not confirm this finding and report values equivalent to oak forests correa 1998 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 some studies mention that pine forests show significantly lower stemflow volumes than oak forests and stemflow occurs with higher precipitation correa 1998 cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 pérez suárez et al 2014 návar 2011 even though the values reported do not support this finding table 2 the studies mention that an important feature for the reduced stemflow of pines is their rugose bark that stores a big portion of stemflow water pérez suárez et al 2014 while the smooth bark of oaks facilitates stemflow correa 1998 significant intra species differences were also found for pinus pseudostrobus and quercus sp correa 1998 4 2 5 surface runoff the 10 studies with data on surface runoff show that there is less runoff in mature than in managed forest with ranges of 0 25 of precipitation for the former table 1 several studies conclude that oak forests generate less runoff jujnovsky et al 2012 pérez suárez et al 2014 because of higher litter production and differences in litter structure depth and hydrophilic properties pérez suárez et al 2014 beside oak forests being located on less steep terrain and in lower altitude jujnovsky et al 2012 quercus potosina has been reported to need 21 times more net precipitation than pinus cembroides to generate runoff pérez suárez et al 2014 4 2 6 infiltration despite only 5 studies reporting on the amount of water infiltrated in different forest types there are several other studies in mtf that cover other aspects of infiltration like infiltration speed since those latter experiments are not comparable with the amount of infiltration they are not included in table 2 altogether there is evidence that infiltration is statistically significantly larger and faster in mtf than in other vegetation types e g tropical dry forests shrubs and grassland from experiments involving the manipulation of upper soil substrates the presence and characteristics of litter are crucial to promote infiltration díaz fernández et al 2006 garcía hernández et al 2007 návar 2013 pérez suárez et al 2014 villavicencio garcía et al 2014 infiltration is mediated by the water storage capacity for litter garcía hernández et al 2007 pérez suárez et al 2014 and infiltration speed is determined by the presence and depth of litter and the amount of organic material in the upper soil layer besides distance to water bodies and age of the ecosystem garcía hernández et al 2007 the reported amounts range from 0 to 53 of precipitation table 1 with the highest values for central mexico 33 53 and lower values for n and w mexico overall because of tree and stand characteristics that influence interception throughfall and stemflow pine forests provide less water on the forest floor for infiltration as do oak forests cantú silva and gonzález rodríguez 2002 and oak litter has been reported to have a higher field capacity further enhancing infiltration pérez suárez et al 2014 some studies also compare the infiltration rates of forests with adjacent pasture areas and find that mtf infiltrate more water than pastures díaz fernández et al 2006 pérez suárez et al 2014 even though some pastures may show localized elevated infiltration rates where livestock spend more time and leave more excrements to be incorporated as organic material into the soil such as water holes garcía hernández et al 2007 4 2 7 recharge there are no empirical data on recharge for mtf but one study based on modelling calibrated with in situ data in central mexico suggests that only natural pine forests without grassland mosaics recharged the aquifer 2 of infiltration 0 43 of precipitation and are the main contributors to lateral and base flow jujnovsky et al 2012 forests in nw mexico apparently play an important role for recharge as for a study area that was mainly covered by semi arid shrubs the marginal cover of mtf enhanced recharge significantly cordero gonzález 2014 4 2 8 base flow it is important to notice that from november to march there is no runoff in mexico due to the dry season and baseflow contributed 85 and runoff only 15 to water overall water availability for central mexico jujnosvky et al 2012 baseflow comprises almost 50 of precipitation and allows the magdalena river to provide water year round for mexico city natural high mountain grasslands contributed substantially to base flow but less than pine forests jujnovsky et al 2012 4 3 ecohydrological processes reported for managed forests forest management intensive silviculture method mds for its spanish acronym aimed at high levels of production leads to a decrease in infiltration higher runoff and soil erosion in all forest management stages and interventions dueñez alanis et al 2006 dueñez alanis 2007 erosion is highest after the second forest thinning process while infiltration is lower and runoff higher in the third thinning and regeneration cut up to 93 for runoff table 1 a year after the interventions the values of the different forest plots show a recovery except in areas that were converted into cattle pasture and maintain high levels of runoff and soil erosion dueñez alanis et al 2006 there was no difference in infiltration or runoff between sites with or without canopy cover in a commercially used forest so litter is determined as the main factor deemed more important than other soil characteristics as density texture and organic matter other factors enhancing infiltration are the existence of shrubs and regrowth in the understory dueñez alanis 2007 dragging logs over the forest floor disturbing the soil cover could be related to the observed hydrological disturbances and higher sediment rates dueñez alanis 2006 gonzález 2013 report 47 96 lower infiltration in managed forests pinus patula plantation under mds regime as compared to old growth forest at 10 cm depth infiltration did not show any significant difference on the surface and was overall lower than in other managed forests dueñez alanis 2006 this could be due to the also lower hydraulic conductivity of the soil in pine plantations as hydraulic conductivity is important for infiltration and is reduced in manged forests only to recover after 30 years castro 2009 this has been attributed to the fact that andosols exposed to dehydration after clear cutting leads to a degradation of water binding compounds as imogolite ferrihydrite allophane and opal ángeles 2010 soil moisture was also lower for one of the managed forests 9 vs 25 for old growth forests but was equivalent to old growth forests for the rest as well as soil density hydrophobia and nutrients gonzález 2013 in many places in mexico oak forests get replaced with pine forests to increase wood production or by chronic human disturbances in secondary forests that favour growth of pines gonzález espinosa et al 2009 díaz fernández et al 2012 report that interception was higher in oak than in pine forests in w mexico not significant interception was negatively correlated to precipitation in both cases throughfall was not different between oak and pine forest but stemflow was higher for oaks the authors conclude that pinus michoacana captures a higher percentage of precipitation to recharge the aquifer than quercus obtusata benavides solorio et al 2008 conclude that there are ways to increase the water yield of watersheds by forest management stand thinning the problem is that it is not clear which method or amount of vegetation removal would lead to the desired outcome as there have been no catchment studies in mexico based on measuring interception losses for individual trees in a pine plantation in e mexico zavaleta et al 2012 conclude that pine plantations not reforestation should be implemented to increase aquifer recharge 4 3 1 fire for forest management or wildfires fires increase hydrophobic properties of litter and soil resulting in reduced infiltration and increased runoff morales et al 2000 report a 3 fold increase in runoff this increase was associated with a reduction in litter depth and effects are still measurable one year after the burning and are stronger in areas which receive burns over 2 consecutive years burning enhances not only hydrophobic properties of litter but also generates organic distillates below the soil surface by heating infiltrating and condensing processes and destroys soil aggregates morales et al 2000 temperature soil texture and burning materials are important factors controlling the amount of distilled substances and their depth morales et al 2000 castro 2009 found a 90 reduction in infiltration because of wildfires in central mexico prescribed burns buffer the potential negative effects of wildfires enhance regeneration of desirable plant species and create temporary forest openings but impacts the hydrologic dynamic of forests morales et al 2000 to mitigate negative hydrologic impacts litter should not be reduced to less than 2 cm as the potential runoff without any litter gets reduced to 30 burns should be applied with a frequency 3 years to allow the soil to revert hydrophobic compounds and aggregate destruction morales et al 2000 5 discussion 5 1 existing knowledge base and knowledge gaps this review is the first intent to gather information on mtfs and their ecohydrological characteristics to elucidate the main biotic influences of rainfall interception and redistribution by the heterogeneous composition of vegetation patches and their diverse combination of species traits it identifies existing ecohydrological studies for mtf makes major knowledge gaps evident and qualitatively integrates the existing information for mexico no watershed scale study exists while neary et al 2009 report 441 experimental watersheds in the usa between 1934 and 2002 and 5 for canada 1970 2001 this highlights the need of watershed scale studies in mft to gather information about the hydrological role of forests in mexico currently the size of effect of several types of mtfs the mixture of species and canopy structure trunk and root or soil type on interception throughfall stemflow infiltration runoff and recharge is still unknown because of the small number of studies and observations n 20 and because the publications except one do not report on variance of their results making any analysis inviable around half of the publication do not even report basic methodological information like the exact study area location or the number of replicates the review of the bibliography gives an overview of the state of the art and lays the basis for an experimentally strong project to further investigate spatial and thematic knowledge gaps and omissions clearly visible in figure 1 and table 2 the results make it clear that it is necessary to improve the technical content of ecohydrological publications for mtfs through clear and transparent information about the methods and results especially adequate metadata describing data characteristics and collection protocols gerstner et al 2017 studies need to consider explicitly the geology topography and other climatic variables than precipitation because of their strong influence on the components of the hydrological cycle a major aspect resulting from the interplay of those factors is a precipitation distribution with high elevation so that mtfs receive larger amounts of precipitation than other vegetation types e g ranges of maximum precipitation in mtfs with important implications for the role of those forests in the provision of hydrologic ecosystem services elevation is also important for a decreased potential evapotranspiration because of a decrease in temperature with elevation this plays an important role given the long dry period of the tropical mountain climate with almost no effective winter precipitation in large parts of the distribution range of mtfs and their capacity for aquifer recharge 5 2 ecohydrological processes in mexican temperate forests even without quantitative data effect size thinking has been recognized as a valuable tool to report primary research study results because it emphasizes outcome magnitude and direction in contrast to p values which indicate neither gerstner et al 2017 in this sense the main finding is that the existing knowledge for mtfs in the water cycle remains scarce and it is not sufficient to confirm a water forest nexus higher infiltration offsets evapotranspiration losses compared to other ecosystems nevertheless the results reveal some evidence to suggest a forest water nexus for mtfs despite the low density of this type of studies in the country and the great latitudinal extension of mtfs the reviewed studies verify empirically the importance of litter in mtfs as has been shown for other temperate forests hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 grant et al 2013 li et al 2014 litter characteristics like water storage capacity of litter being higher for oak than for pine forests in mexico in line with studies from other regions walsh and voigt 1977 li et al 2014 determines runoff being higher for pine than for oak forests in mexico and infiltration besides the total amount of infiltration infiltration speed too is determined by the presence and depth of litter and the amount of organic material in the upper soil layer this dominant role of litter for infiltration is emphasized by a study that did not find any influence of canopy cover or other ecohydrological features of trees dueñez alanis 2007 besides the synthesis of empirical evidence using a chain of causal mechanisms linking the components of the hydrological cycle to water yield makes it possible to gather more evidence for a forest water nexus evapotranspiration as the second variable in the forest water nexus is very variable and seems to be well over 50 in the drier northern and some western parts of the country while in central mexico the available evidence suggests less than 40 of precipitation this makes is plausible to suggest a forest water nexus at least for central mexico but even for the transition zones to semi arid environments for which it is generally assumed that they spend more water in evapotranspiration than they capture návar 2013 ilstedt et al 2016 a forest water nexus seems possible the review shows that in those transition zones despite the elevated water vapor pressure mtfs show less variability and larger volumes of stemflow and deeper infiltration especially with small precipitation events than tropical vegetation correa 1998 for stemflow the different forest types are a little better represented and is found to be very important ecohydrological process for soil humidity in mtfs but to establish a proper effect size of mtfs and their management on the hydrological cycle the amount of research needs to be multiplied and consider a variety of experiments as mtfs are extremely diverse in species and environmental settings that should be represented to be able to understand factors associated with the heterogeneity of the outcomes the results would be of great relevance for decision making for hydrological ecosystem services and conservation of ecosystems in general the encountered studies on mtf management confirm findings and tendencies reported for a variety of international contexts like elevated soil erosion and runoff in managed forests hibbert 1967 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 van dijk and keenan 2007 grant et al 2013 in north america harvesting of forests has been used to augment municipal water supplies because of the resulting increases in water yield for a certain period of time depending on several factors neary 2016 soil properties seem to be the most important factors impacted by mtfs management especially hydraulic conductivity which could explain the depth pattern of changes in infiltration reduced at 10 cm depth without apparent changes on the surface in the case of mtf the andosols on which they commonly occur show drought damage after dehydration of water binding compounds following clear cutting ángeles 2010 this effect is enhanced by forest fires that increase hydrophobic properties of litter and soil resulting in reduced infiltration up to 90 and increased runoff morales et al 2000 castro 2009 5 3 implications for hydrological ecosystem services regarding hydrological ecosystem services even if forests intercept more water because of the high leaf area and transpire more than other vegetation types the interaction between soil and vegetation types leads to greater water storage over longer periods of time as has been reported for other temperate forests macdonald and stednick 2003 neary et al 2009 this aspect is especially important as from november to march there is no runoff in mexico due to the dry season and baseflow is more important than runoff in mtf reaching almost 50 of precipitation in central mexico jujnovsky et al 2012 enhanced infiltration is the function of mtf that contribute most to regulating services like run off and flow regulation because of the tropical mountain climate consisting of summer rains and winter spring droughts subsurface flows contribute to stabilize base flow in the long term and enhances water filtering neary et al 2009 but the same characteristics of forests responsible for infiltration lateral flow and base flow stabilization also constitute the ability to decrease erosive force of rainfall as litter makes the water stay on the same surface for longer benavides solorio et al 2008 díaz fernández et al 2012 and provides high water quality demand for hydrological ecosystem services from these forests is increasing and the major urban areas already face water supply problems today with climate change most water stressed areas will likely get less water and water flows will become less predictable and more subject to extreme events mayers et al 2009 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 increasing demands for water by agricultural industrial and urban users and water for the environment will intensify competition mayers et al 2009 murray et al 2012 climate change also affects forests itself by wildfires drought and mortality water security will get worse by poor management which first will come apparent in mega cities like mexico city water management in mexico has been recognized as one of the primary environmental concerns with two thirds of aquifers overexploited and water demand about two times higher than annual aquifer recharges benavides solorio et al 2008 knowledge of the forest water nexus in mexico is critical to improve water management and develop strategies in the face of not only large swaths of semi arid and arid lands but also considering the tropical

969,phosphorus like nitrogen belongs to crucial bioelements limiting the biomass multiplication while surplus of phosphorous in soil is beneficial for agriculture and forestry its excess in surficial waters causes increased eutrophication which is devastating for water quality and for ecological balance anthropogenic eutrophication is one of the biggest environmental problems of last decades therefore studies which can improve the assessment of water quality are very important in the case of phosphates the most abundant form of phosphorus in lithosphere and hydrosphere isotopic composition of oxygen δ18o po4 could be used as a tracer of phosphorus cycling between the biomass soils waters and sediments here we present a short review of methods that allow to determine the oxygen isotopic composition in phosphates extracted from different water solutions we also provide examples of usefulness of this research in the environmental studies with some limitations measurements of δ18o po4 could be an usefull tool to recognize the sources of phosphates and broaden understanding of processes occurring in phosphorus cycle this knowledge is necessary to protect our drinking water resources and their revitalization keywords phosphate phosphorus cycle stable isotopes geochemistry hydrogeology water quality 1 introduction phosphorus is a very important element necessary for living and proper growth of every organisms highly reactive p is a component of many biologically important compounds such as dna rna atp and phospholipids phosphorus could occur in one of several oxidation states but in most mineral and organic compounds p occurs at 5 oxidation mainly in the form of phosphate po4 3 the phosphorus bioreactivity increases from mineral to occluded to organic form fillipelli 2008 inorganic phosphates include orthophosphates and condensed phosphates pyro poly and metaphosphates in waters and sewage orthophosphates occur mainly in a form of h2po4 and hpo4 2 ions orthophosphate minerals such as apatites hydroxy fluor and chlor and orthophosphate rich rocks such as phosphorites are widely widespread in environment apatites ca5 po4 3 f cl oh are the most common p minerals in the earth s crust over 95 of p ie smil 2000 paytan mclaughlin 2007 although several hundred minerals that contain phosphate po4 3 have been described among this group of minerals the most abundant is fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f whereas hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh is much less common and chlorapatite ca5 po4 3cl is very rare www mindat org according to hughes and rakovan 2015 apatites are geologically ubiquitous they are formed in igneous metamorphic sedimentary and hydrothermal environments in soils we can find also other pi minerals like as variscite alpo4 2h2o strengite fepo4 2h2o or vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o kruse et al 2015 phosphorites the sedimentary rocks contain more than 18 20 p205 nathan 1984 are usually of marine origin among these francolite carbonate fluorapatite is the main phosphate mineral in litosphere we can find also rare p containing minerals for example monazite ce la y th po4 xenotime ypo4 or wavellite al3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o among the phosphorus isotopes only one is stable 31p the others are not stable with half life not exceeding 26 days therefore research of the phosphorus isotope composition is only possible in freshly originated materials for example radioactive p isotopes are used as markers 32p and 33p e g benitez nelson karl 2002 sapek 2012 however in most compounds phosphorus is strongly bonded with oxygen the element with 3 stable isotopes with mass numbers 16 17 and 18 the breakage of o p bond can be executed by biological activity but in non biological conditions the bond is usually stable and isotopic fractionation associated with abiotic processes is not greater than 1 mclaughlin et al 2013 therefore δ18o po4 could be measure as an indicator of p source nowadays development of analytical techniques allows us to measure δ18o value in samples with µm oxygen content so isotopic analysis of phosphates extracted from water was been gaining popularity in recent years ie mclaughlin et al 2004 gruau et al 2005 paytan et al 2007 mclaughlin et al 2013 in recent years δ18o po4 studies are increasingly conducted in both freshwater and marine systems but also in plant soil system see next sections the po4 3 ions can be easily absorbed by organisms therefore their excessive amount is dangerous to quality of water resources therefore isotopic analyzes of po4 3 could be useful to identify the origin of p compounds which is extremely important in the context of actions taken to revitalize and protect of endangered waters on the other hand the depleting phosphorus deposits incline us to optimize the p dosing in agriculture and search for renewable sources of this element it is therefore necessary to properly recognize processes and determine the rate of them in the complex water soil plant system in this paper we are focusing on a critical review of practical and methodical aspects of the use of oxygen isotope composition studies of phosphates in aquatic systems 2 global p cycle phosphorus global cycle includes few major components i tectonic uplift of phosphorus bearing rocks ii physical and chemical weathering and erosion of rocks producing soils and supplying p to rivers iii riverine transport of phosphorus to lakes and oceans and iv sedimentation of p associated with organic and mineral matter and burial in sediments see figure 1 ruttenberg 2003 and references therein between iv and i could occur one more element i e the melting of rocks and crystallization of primary phosphorus minerals from magma when sediments are uplifted into the weathering system the cycle begins anew in table 1 the major reservoirs of p in the global phosphorus cycle and associated residence times are shown in table 2 fluxes between the major phosphorus reservoirs are presented phosphorus minerals are found as accessory minerals in many rocks of acidic or alkaline character this p pool is not directly available for organisms during geochemical and biochemical processes p is converted to dissolved orthophosphate which can be directly assimilated production of biomass fueled by p bioavailability results in the deposition of organic matter in soils and sediments where it acts as a source of fuel and nutrients to microbial communities microbial activity in soils and sediments in turn strongly influences the concentration and chemical form of p incorporated into the geological record organic p participates in almost every biological process is dominate in soil and water systems but is still the most barely understood in the global p cycle delgado scalenge 2008 two organic cycles water and land overlap the inorganic p cycle in the terrestrial phosphorus cycle p is transferred from the soil to the biosphere then back to the soil in the water cycle organic phosphorus circulates among creatures living in rivers lakes and oceans the land cycle lasts in average one year the water cycle only few weeks liu et al 2008 currently a large amount of phosphorus comes from artificial fertilizers according to smil 2000 around 15 mt p are applied annually in inorganic fertilizers people generate smaller but also significant amounts of p in communal waste about 3 mt p year domestic animals excrete more than 16 mt p in their urine and feces unlike other most significant elements there is basically no atmospheric component in the phosphorus cycle reeburgh 1997 however a small amount of p in atmosphere is present and returns to circulation with dry or wet precipitation p in this case could derived from aeolian dust fossil fuel burning or modern biomass resources sapek sapek 2011 this precipitation plays a significant role in places poor in p stimulates further development of vegetation phosphorus present in the atmosphere does not affect air quality but could lead to eutrophication of stagnant waters 2 1 p cycle in aquatic environment continental weathering is the primary source of phosphorus for oceanic p cycle paytan mclaughlin 2007 2011 most of this p is delivered via rivers with a smaller portion delivered via dust deposition the primary sink for phosphorus in the marine environment is sediments the particulate flux from rivers is lost mainly to sediments on the continental shelves less amount to deep sea sediments phosphorus in rivers largely associated with particulate inorganic matter especially as p occurring in apatite and other minerals grains and p adsorbed to iron manganese oxide oxyhydroxides is quickly deposited in estuarine and coastal shelf and it is not directly available to marine biota however clay particles with fe and al oxyhydroxides on their surface can adsorb phosphates from freshwater solutions and these phosphates are transported into estuaries and can then be released into the sea once salinity increases in turn the part of riverine dop may be trapped in the estuaries via flocculation or may be photohydrolyzed and recycled within the estuaries paytan mclaughlin 2007 and references therein as authors indicate only about 10 30 of the total riverine p flux is potentially reactive the nonreactive p is mainly deposited on continental shelves and removed from the oceanic p cycle in the marine system biological productivity is limited by availability of dissolved phosphorus perhaps dissolved p is also the ultimate limiter of ocean productivity on geologic timescales fillipelli 2008 and references therein phosphorus incorporated into organic matter follows a similar biogeochemical pathway as the organic matter itself undergoing recycling in the water column and at the sediment water interface in figure 2 are shown transformations of given phosphorus compounds in the oceanic reservoir paytan mclaughlin 2007 the apatite especially hydroxyapatite is one of the most abundant phosphate minerals it occurs in hard tissues in mammals and other vertebrates and can be found also in other biological organisms such as brachiopods according to smil 2000 hydroxyapatite makes up about 60 of bone and 70 of vertebrates teeth the reactive phosphorus in the water column occurs as particulate organic phosphorus pop associated with live marine biomass or biogenic detritus biogenic calcium phosphate contained in hard parts of fish fish p or reactive soluble phosphorus rsp including both organic and inorganic dissolved forms of phosphorus slomp van cappellen 2007 the marine reactive p cycle is affected by river inflow primary production biomass mineralization production and dissolution of fish p and transfer between individual tanks in the water column and removal from sediments the sediments contain buried p in the form of degraded pop and fish p bonded with iron oxides fep or precipitated as carbonate fluorapatites cap in rivers a large amount of phosphorus is bonded to particles of inorganic material pip mainly p in minerals but also adsorbed by oxides and hydroxides of fe and mn paytan mclaughlin 2007 this charge of phosphorus usually quickly accumulates in the coastal area and its contribution to the reservoir of dissolved inorganic p dip available for organisms is inconsiderable the redox potential change of orthophosphates associated with metals such as fe and mn allows to released the phosphates into solution released phosphates could be now afresh by organisms reynolds davies 2001 phosphorus in rivers can derived from natural sources like as natural weathering of soil parent materials the atmosphere riparian vegetation and river bank erosion withers jarvie 2008 and refernces therein or anthropogenic one fluxes of p associated with human activity entering to freshwater may derived from fertilizers wastewater treatment plant effluent soil leachate waste from agriculture or septic tank discharge davies et al 2014 according to withers jarvie 2008 the balance between physico chemical and biological processes and their relative importance in terms of p flux modification the timing of downstream p flux delivery p fractionation in stream concentrations and ecological impacts can be vary for different conditions specific studies eg bukaveckas et al 2005 némery garnier 2007 examined the longitudinal variations in nutrient retention and cycling along river continua from source to basin outlet according to withers jarvie 2008 small headwater streams have lower water volume to bed sediment benthic area ratio and greater potential for both physico chemical and biological p exchange processes at the benthic interface and within sub surface sediments in larger river in which water volume to bed sediment benthic ratio is higher more significance for p cycling are processes linked to suspended sediments and uptake by phytoplankton 2 2 soil plant p cycle a soil solution which is a reservoir for p uptake by plants and microorganisms is of key importance in plant soil p cycle in terrestrial systems phosphorus could be present in bedrock soil and biomass see table 1 soil sorption desorption precipitation dissolution or immobilization or mineralization processes take place in the soil solution kruse et al 2015 the phosphorus cycle in soil plant system is presented in figure 3 the phosphorus concentration in soil has a wide range for example the soils in poland generally have a quite high content of p from 0 2 to 5 0 mg p kg of soil but only about 0 1 of this element is used by plants sawicka et al 2015 that is why phosphate fertilizers have found wide application in agriculture in the case of n fertilizer about 45 of the applied n is converted into biomass and the remaining 55 contributes to the disturbance of the n cycle this part remaining in soil may be next transported to the coastal zone stored in soil may escape into the atmosphere or leach into groundwater smil 1991 especially nitrate fertilizers very soluble in water applied in excess can be easy leached into groundwater the long term tracer study with 15n labeled fertilizer described by sebilo et al 2013 revealed that three decades after application of the labeled fertilizer to agricultural soils about 12 15 of the fertilizer derived n was still residing in the soil organic matter while 8 12 of the fertilizer n had already leaked toward the groundwater unlike n fertilizers p containing fertilizers introduced into the pedosphere are usually very quickly precipitated in the soil both in acid and alkaline soils figure 4 by fe al or ca aluminum is most active to phosphate precipitation at a ph of 5 0 to 5 5 whereas iron at ph below 4 calcium is primarily responsible for phosphate precipitation in alkaline soils especially at ph around 8 ludwick 1998 as the author pointed p is relatively more available to crops when it is precipitated by ca therefore losses of phosphate through precipitation are actually of less concern in alkaline than in acid soils soluble p forms usually do not migrate further than a few cm from the fertilizer granule o neill 1993 2 3 anthropogenic impact on the global phosphorus cycle the current terrestrial p cycle in anthropogenically altered landscapes is dominated by agriculture and human activities the most important processes associated with human activity disrupting the natural cycle of phosphorus i e ruttenberg 2003 filippelli 2008 are i deforestation and related losses of p due to soil erosion ii production of artificial fertilizers containing p and iii municipal and industrial wastewater nowadays total amount of p delivered to the oceans is a doubling of pre human input fluxes which causes coastal areas eutrophication and probably also contributes to increased biological production in the whole ocean fillipelli 2008 the global p flows both natural and associated with various human activities are presented in figure 5 through deforestation usually by burning after selective trees slashing plant matter is converted to ash phosphorus in ash is quickly dissolved leached from ash and transported to rivers within 1 2 years schlesinger 1997 as a result of long term use of agricultural land soils have become depleted of phosphorus its deficiency could be compensated by introducing artificially produced phosphate fertilizers for example consumption of phosphate fertilizers was 17 million tons p year in 1989 nowadays over 90 of phosphorus obtained from fossil rocks containing p is used to produce artificial fertilizers sapek 2009 but this amount is much higher than human demand due to significant losses at the stage of fertilizer production about 35 or food processing and distribution up to 60 industrial sewage and wastes are minor but also important anthropogenic p source the polyphosphates contained in detergents are more soluble than the phosphate group po4 3 and its derivatives in a wide range of conditions o neill 1993 however only ca 30 of soluble phosphates can be removed from the raw wastewater in the second stage of purification process therefore currently the amount of polyphosphates in detergents is limited fillipelli 2008 currently known p resources becoming depleted but probably will be replaced by others however progressive depletion of sources will have limited contribution of new anthropogenic p to the system see figure 6 3 oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate in most of the compounds phosphorus is strongly bound to oxygen which allows measurement of oxygen isotopic composition in phosphate ions the isotopic composition of oxygen expressed in delta notation is calculated as eq 1 1 δ 18 o r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r mean 18o 16o ratio in sample and standard respectively the oxygen isotopic composition is expressed relative to the international standard vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow fractionation factor α given as eq 2 2 α a b r a r b expresses enrichment or depletion in heavy 18o isotope between two substances a and b where ra and rb mean the 18o 16o ratio in samples a and b respectively the fractionation factor is close to 1 therefore in isotope studies is more often expressed by ɛ eq 3 3 ε α 1 1000 3 1 oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate sources in aquatic ecosystems the p sources could be separated into point such as sewage discharge sites and non point sources like soil leaching and agricultural run off mclaughlin et al 2013 their identification is critical for proper resource management and caring for aquatic ecosystems state in recent years isotopic studies of oxygen in p compounds are more often used for researchers and our dataset is extended but still the amount of available data is slight the δ18o po4 values measured for potential natural and anthropogenic sources of p which could be delivered to the waters are shown in figure 7 recent research ie mclaughlin et al 2004 2013 gruau et al 2005 paytan and mclaughlin 2007 goody et al 2015 mainly from usa and europe showed a wide range of δ18o po4 of various primary anthropogenic phosphate sources to aquatic ecosystems indicating the usefulness of δ18o po4 studies for distinguishing phosphate sources in some systems 3 2 global data of δ18o po4 from aquatic ecosystems in this paper only several examples of applications of δ18o po4 studies in various aquatic systems are presented the more information could be find ie paytan and mclaughlin 2007 mclaughlin et al 2013 davis et al 2014 tamburini et al 2014 in figure 8 ranges for global δ18o po4 data derived from different aquatic ecosystems are shown after davies et al 2014 as mentioned above isotopic analysis of oxygen in different p sources improves our knowledge about p cycling and could be helpful to recognize the source of p compounds in aquatic but also in soil plant systems the research using isotope analysis of phosphates oxygen is increasingly widespread but it also has some limitations several aspects related to this topic are briefly described below 3 3 isotope fractionation associated with biogeochemical processes over two decades ago the isotopic composition of oxygen in phosphates was found as a helpful tool for a broaden understanding the processes occuring in the p cycle i e blake et al 2005 paytan mclaughlin 2011 mclaughlin et al 2013 von sperber et al 2015 below we presented shortly summarized data about various processes could modified o isotopic composition of p compounds see table 3 in abiotic systems isotope exchange of oxygen between phosphate and water or other solutions is slow and can be considered negligible for most environmental applications i e blake et al 2005 mclaughlin et al 2013 likewise adsorption desorption processes and precipitation dissolution of p bearing minerals see table 3 however microbiological processes could be associated with large isotopic effects generally microorganisms prefer lighter isotopes therefore substrates are enriched with heavy isotopes in the case of phosphates this effect was observed under laboratory conditions for escherichia coli fractionation factor ɛ 3 blake et al 2005 both intracellular and extracellular enzymatic processes may lead to significant modification of δ18o value in producing p compounds the main enzymatic process controlling δ18o po4 in the environment is the intracellular activity of pyrophosphatase ppase which involves equilibrium isotopic exchange mclaughlin et al 2013 after tamburini et al 2014 pyrophosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate p2o7 during this reaction one o atom from the surrounding water is incorporated into the p2o7 molecule in result two inorganic orthophosphate molecules are formed and subsequently released the exchange of o isotopes in this case is subject to a thermodynamic isotopic fractionation leading to a temperature dependent equilibrium between water and phosphate described by the longinelli and nuti 1973 empirical equation eq 4 4 t 111 4 4 3 δ 18 o p δ 18 o h 2 o where t temperature c δ 18 o p and δ 18 o h 2 o mean oxygen isotopic composition of phosphates and ambient water respectively vs vsmow the enzymatic hydrolysis e g by phosphatases of phosphoesters release phosphates which have changed isotopic composition tamburini et al 2014 hydrolysis of phosphoesters by phosphomonoesterase leads to break one p o bond in released phosphate three oxygen atoms derived from original compound and one oxygen atom is incorporated from h2o molecule hydrolysis of phosphoesters by phosphodiesterase leads to break two p o bonds in released phosphate two o atoms derived from original compound and two from water molecules these processes are associated with an enzyme dependent fractionation see table 3 for most phosphatase enzymes e g alkaline and acid phosphatase and phytase the released phosphates have depleted δ18o po4 pistocchi et al 2020 and references therein the o isotopic fractionation is also present in the case of uptake and utilization assimilation of phosphate by aquatic plants algae and microorganisms in this case phosphate with 16o is preferentially utilized the residual solution will be enriched with phosphate with heavy oxygen isotope 18o blake et al 2005 3 4 short review of extraction method of dip from water for δ18o isotopic analysis a brief overview of the methods that allow testing of the o isotope composition of phosphates in various types of waters and soils is presented extraction procedures are constantly improved to ensure possibly 100 recovery of phosphates from the tested solution and removal of compounds which may interfere with δ18o po4 measurements the tc ea cf irms thermal conversion elemental analyzer continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry techniques enabling routine δ18o po4 analysis of about 0 2 mg of ag3po4 samples are also improved to increase the efficiency of co conversion and analytical precision due to this analysis of δ18o po4 despite various difficulties are increasingly successfully used in environmental research 3 5 oxygen isotopic analysis in phosphates historical background the oxygen isotopic analysis in phosphates began in the 1960s when tudge 1960 described the procedure of extraction of po4 3 from natural apatites this procedure involves several stages of wet chemistry and slow precipitation of bipo4 which is subsequently fluorinated under vacuum eq 5 5 b i p o 4 8 3 b r f 3 b i f 3 p f 5 4 3 b r 2 2 o 2 the method refined by kolodny et al 1983 whilst preferred to use bromine pentafluoride to bismuth phosphate decomposition was used widely for many years lécuyer 2004 as alternative to this procedure firsching 1961 proposed a method to precipitate the phosphate as non hygroscopic ag3po4 which is stable in contrast to bipo4 besides fluorination also bromination method was used to obtain o2 from ag3po4 for oxygen isotopic analysis eq 6 6 2 a g 3 p o 4 b r 2 a g 4 p 2 o 7 1 2 o 2 2 a g b r the fluorination and bromination methods require a large amount of sample 10 mg for ag3po4 are time consuming few days the efficiency of o2 obtain is rather low especially the bromination reaction and hazardous products such as brf5 were obtained during reaction i e lécuyer 2004 mclaughlin et al 2004 davies et al 2014 another method allows measurement of δ18o po4 values was described by o neil and co workers o neil et al 1994 modified by lécuyer et al 1998 in this case graphite reagent is used to obtain co2 for δ18o analysis briefly the co2 is obtained during reaction of ag3po4 with c carried out at 1200 c the oxygen yield is still low about 25 but allows to obtain reproducible results nevertheless the measured δ18o values compared with the results obtained by the bipo4 method were slightly different ca 1 o neil et al 1994 the problem is also oxygen fractionation between sample and silica tube observed in high temperature révész and böhlke 2002 these methods with further modifications focusing mainly on increasing the efficiency and saving preparation time i e vennemann et al 2002 lécuyer 2004 pelc hałas 2010 were routinely used to analyze apatites in the case of dip its concentration in water is usually very low ie in ocean do not exceed 3 µm dm3 ruttenberg 2003 wherein even below 0 2 µm dm3 in the surface layer mclaughlin et al 2004 in rivers lakes or other freshwater reservoirs the phosphate concentration could be various but generally higher than marine and ocean waters it is therefore difficult to obtain the sufficient amount of phosphates precipitated as ag3po4 for dip isotopic analysis and methods described above could not be satisfactory the second significant problem is extraction of phosphates dissolved in waters the protocols must allow the po4 3 extraction efficiency possible close to 100 simultaneously avoiding contamination with other compounds that may interfere with δ18o measurements such as silicates and multivalent ions davies et al 2014 the measurement of δ18o po4 has also been developed by another ms techniques such as negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry ntims techniques holmden et al 1997 or laser based analysis wenzel et al 2000 these methods are not often used for dip analysis and are not discussed in detail in this paper 3 6 on line measurement of δ18o in ag3po4 the problem associated with the amount of sample required to analysis has been solved by tc ea cf irms techniques on line methods for isotope analysis of oxygen in phosphates ag3po4 have been developed by micromass the developed method is a high temperature pyrolysis technique for δ18o measurements of phosphates see lécuyer 2004 the application is described shortly in a technical note published by j morrison 1999 and in more detail in kornexl et al 1999 in this method ag3po4 is decomposed at 1400 c in glassy carbon reactor filled with glassy carbon grit with small amount of nickelized carbon in an elemental analyzer schematic diagram is shown in figure 9 the produced co high co yield about 90 is transported by a continuous flow gas chromatograph to irms by using this technique phosphate samples containing as less as 50 100 µg of o can be analyzed for their δ18o values usually with 1σ 0 5 kornexl et al 1999 this method was next modified by researchers to increasing the efficiency of ag3po4 to co conversion to obtain more reproducible precise results of δ18o po4 measurements i e venneman et al 2002 mclaughlin et al 2004 lécuyer et al 2007 laporte et al 2009 nowadays tc ea cf irms technique is routinely used to determine 18o 16o ratios in very small samples ca 400 µg of ag3po4 which enables to conduct dip isotopic studies 3 7 important factors during dip extraction procedure samples required for isotopic analysis using tc ea cf irms systems should be first converted from dissolved to solid form during this stage is very important to make sure that the original isotopic composition of oxygen from dip is retained reactions carried out during extraction procedures should be completed without fractionation effects during the procedure new inorganic p source is not introduced to the sample or other o bearing compounds such as nitrates sulphates caco3 or dissolved organic carbon i e davies et al 2014 several protocols for phosphate extraction from water including seawater and freshwater are shortly presented below 3 8 dip extraction protocol from seawater in 2004 mclaughlin and co workers described a method for dip extraction from seawater and next precipitation to ag3po4 for isotopic analysis mclaughlin et al 2004 see figure 10 in this procedure dip was stripped via magic magnesium induced coprecipitation karl and tien 1992 the authors used 150 ml of 1 m sodium hydroxide solution for 8 l of seawater with phosphate concentration 0 8 µm next deposits with adsorbed dip was transferred to a 250 ml bottle the samples were next centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded in the next step the precipitate was dissolved in ch3cooh and nh3 ph 5 5 buffered with ch3cook subsequently cerium phosphate was precipitated by adding cerium nitrate solution and next was transferred into a 50 ml tube and centrifuged after removal of cl ions the retained precipitate was dissolved in nitric acid solution mixed with 4 ml of cation exchange resin biorad ag 50 8 and shaken to remove cerium ions from solution the resin was subsequently separated from the solution which was collected in a 50 m centrifuge tubes in the next step bromothymol blue indicator was added for each samples next 1 ml ammonium hydroxide and 1 ml of 3 m nh4no3 was added ph was adapted to 7 with nh3 finally silver phosphate was precipitated by adding agno3 solution separated on polycarbonate filter ag3po4 precipitate rinsed with deionized water was then dried at 50 c overnight the samples converted to ag3po4 were then pyrolyzed and analyzed by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry about 0 6 mg of ag3po4 was weighted with 1 mg of 50 nickelized carbon into ag capsules and placed into an autosampler oxygen from sample was converted to co in the glassy carbon tube filled with glassy carbon chips at temperature 1270 c which was next purified in a gas chromatograph and injected into an irms for δ18o isotopic analysis using this method phosphate samples contain 3 5 µmol oxygen could be analyzed routinely with an average standard deviation of about 0 3 3 9 extraction protocol of dip from water with high dip concentration another method was presented by gruau et al 2005 the paper presents precipitation of dip with iron hydroxide and purification as ag3po4 see figure 11 the authors used this method for wastewater treatment plants water wtpw due to high phosphate concentration about 300 500 ml of water was sufficient to analysis after pre filtration and dissolved organic carbon doc removal 0 1 m feso4 was added to the solution to precipitate the phosphate after supernatant removed the precipitate was dried at 30 c and placed in polypropylene tubes next 10 ml of 2 m koh was added to each of them after few hours shaking the iron hydroxide was separated by centrifugation subsequently the phosphate was purified using anion exchange resin amberlite ira 400 and finally isolated as ag3po4 crystals using procedure adapted from lécuyer et al 1993 to isotopic analysis gruau and co workers used fluorination method 3 10 extraction protocol of dissolved inorganic phosphate from freshwater with very low dip concentration a new technique allows to determine δ18o po4 in freshwater samples with very low dip concentration was described by tcaci et al 2019 using the protocol called by the authors as twist spinning mode tsm is enable to process about 1000 l of sample with an initially p concentration 0 016 mg p dm3 within the field in approximately 24 h phosphate with other oxyanions are binding on the anion exchange resin when sampling is complete the resin is recovered by decanting the overlying water and packed into a separate column next phosphates are eluted with 0 3 m kcl and collected for further processing following the protocol described in gooddy et al 2015 see figure 12 3 11 dip extraction protocols from drinking water a modified version of mclaughlin et al 2004 method described in details in gooddy et al 2015 was used to isolate phosphate from drinking water samples see figure 13 in brief dissolved organic matter was removed using a dax 8 organic exchange resin subsequently phosphate was isolated from the remaining matrix by adsorption onto an anion exchange resin and next were eluted and separated from other oxyanions no3 and so4 2 using a 0 3 m kcl the phosphates from eluted fractions were then processed step by step as shown in figure 12 using modified version of mclaughlin et al 2004 method 3 12 extraction protocols of phosphate from soil recently phosphate extraction procedures from soil samples were also developed tamburini et al 2010 presented the protocol of soil phosphate extraction optimized for organic rich soil samples extraction using this method was done by hcl and phosphates were purified with multiple mineral precipitations extreme ph adjustments of the solutions is not required in this case using the method contaminant free ag3po4 could be produced from fertilizers and different types of soils the results of their investigation confirm that differences in phosphorus status and availability in soils are expressed by oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate ions and could be use as a tracer to better understand p dynamics in soil systems in 2011 weiner and co workers presented another procedure for soil phosphates weiner et al 2011 which is modified procedure described by sibessen 1983 and mclaughlin et al 2004 the method is based on the inorganic phosphate extraction on anion exchange membranes bdh 551642s vwr saturated with hco3 2 the results showed no artifacts and good reproducibility 0 3 of δ18o po4 measurements for obtained ag3po4 precipitate 4 case studies of δ18o po4 analysis application in recognizing phosphate sources and cycling recently the δ18o po4 analysis are widely used for identifying different phosphate sources and better understanding p cycling in marine and freshwater research ie markel et al 1994 blake et al 2001 mclaughlin et al 2004 gruau et al 2005 young et al 2009 elsbury et al 2009 mclaughlin et al 2013 pistocchi et al 2017 paytan et al 2017 gooddy et al 2018 tcaci et al 2019 analysis of the oxygen isotopic composition in p compounds could be also helpful in explaining the dynamics of p circulation in soil and could be useful in areas where use of radioactive p isotopes is limited melby et al 2013 however it should be noted that identification based on the δ18o po4 values are usually difficult the range of δ18o po4 values of different phosphate sources could be wide and in some cases various p sources could have similar 18o 16o ratio see figure 7 for example δ18o po4 20 could be simultaneously assigned to several p sources as was mentioned above the p o bond in phosphate is resistant to inorganic hydrolysis and at the temperature and ph of most natural systems phosphate does not exchange oxygen with water without biological activity see table 3 therefore observed variability in δ18o po4 values will either reflect mixing of isotopically distinct sources of phosphate or the alteration of the phosphate δ 18o signature as a result of o exchange during the cycling of phosphate through living cells afterwards each time a phosphate molecule is cycled taken up by organisms and processed by enzymes phosphate oxygen will be exchanged with cellular water resulting in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding water at the temperature of reaction usually the phosphates studied in water were not in an isotope equilibrium with the surrounding h2o which indicated that the complete intracellular biological cycle of the orthophosphate did not take place and the isotope record of the source could be preserved paytan mclaughlin 2013 therefore in water reservoirs it is assumed that δ18o po4 values in equilibrium with the surrounding h2o see eq 4 increase linearly with increasing salinity of the reservoir and deviations from the equilibrium line are associated with the mixing of waters with phosphates from natural or anthropogenic sources see also figure 13 mclaughlin et al 2013 several examples of use of δ18o po4 analysis to recognize phosphate sources and better understanding p cycling in different aquatic systems was presented below 4 1 lake kinneret israel markel et al 1994 used δ18o of phosphate as a tracer to determine p sources and cycling in lake kinneret israel the results of δ18o po4 analysis of sediment samples from the lake and its catchment indicated that i three different fractions of lake sediments have a significant different δ18o po4 sand 12 silt samples δ18o po4 12 15 and 15 for clay samples ii δ18o of phosphate for clay samples increased or decreased at individual stations in relation to jordan inlet max 1 5 similar situation was observed for silts iii samples from meshushim stream had the lowest δ18o po4 value 8 6 for silt 12 7 for clay while the highest was measured for amud stream 16 5 for silt 19 8 for clay the authors summarized that major fraction of p in the lake sediments was linked to ca as apatite or as a surface complex on calcite crystals the minor fraction was adsorbed on clays and on iron hydroxides the research has shown also that 70 of the particulate inorganic phosphate entering to lake kinneret derived from basaltic source δ18o po4 6 only 40 of phosphate in studied silts and clays derived from basaltic source the rest could be sedimentary and anthropogenic origin δ18o po4 18 to 25 the isotopic data was useful to creating model describing recycling of pip in lake kinneret 4 2 san francisco bay usa mclaughlin et al 2006 used analysis of δ18o po4 as a tracer for sources and cycling of phosphate in north san francisco bay research were used for estimate mixing of dip sources along an estuarine flow path the values of δ18o of river and ocean waters are meaningly different and also different should be the 18o 16o ratios in phosphate recycled in these waters as a consequence of equilibrium fractionation therefore δ18o po4 studies could be used to characterize mixing processes of water phosphates or to determine their cycling as authors indicate the north san francisco bay could be characterized by a two end member mixing model between pacific ocean waters and the san joaquin and sacramento rivers freshwaters based on salinity and δ18o h2o the oxygen phosphate isotopic signature was used to characterize mixing between oceanic and riverine phosphate with various point and non point locations such as the discharge points of tributaries and wastewater treatment plants the authors note that the lack of isotopic equilibrium in the dip throughout the bay indicates that the phosphate input is faster than phosphate cycling and that source phosphate δ18o contributes to observed δ18o po4 at most stations see figure 14 4 3 drinking water supplies england wales gooddy et al 2015 presented the first assessment of 18o 16o ratio in phosphates within drinking water supplies the authors indicate that in many developed countries legacy lead piping is a source of lead contamination in drinking water which increase risk e g coronary heart disease or stroke because of increased blood pressure pocock et al 1988 gordon hutchinson 1994 therefore as authors indicate public water utilities in u k in parts of europe and north america routinely dose drinking water supplies with phosphate to prevent pipe corrosion and the dissolution of lead gooddy et al 2015 analyzed 40 samples from phosphate dosed distribution networks from england and wales and the samples of the source orthophosphoric acid used for dosing the research shown two significantly different isotopic signatures of oxygen phosphates for analyzed drinking water average 13 2 or 19 7 primarily determined by δ18o po4 of the source acid average 12 4 or 19 7 see figure 15 depending on the source acid used δ18o po4 of drinking water appears isotopically distinct from another p sources with isotopic offsets for studied by gooddy and co workers waters from the source acid ranging from 0 9 to 2 8 as the authors suggest given the widespread use of phosphate dosing in drinking water in association with evidence of isotopic differentiation between drinking water supplies and other sources of p in environment the application of δ18o of phosphate analyses in this area deserves further attention the authors also point out that in other countries where dosing with phosphate occurs similar research should be made gooddy et al 2015 suggest also that isotope fractionation or abiotic isotope effects influenced for δ18o po4 within the drinking water distribution network require further analysis 4 4 lake erie usa paytan et al 2017 investigated the p cycle in lake erie usa using δ18o po4 analysis to understand p cycling in the lake and to recognize the p fluxes the authors used pore water p concentration profiles the results of sediment cores incubation experiments and δ18o po4 data to estimate the isotopic signature of sedimentary phosphate input relative to the isotopic signature of phosphate in lake water based on obtained results the authors noted that the total p sediment flux estimates amount to 8 20 of the total external input of p to lake erie the relatively large internal loading flux of p from sediments to the water column in the central basin of lake erie paytan et al 2017 which is consistent with recent reports from the western basin matisoff et al 2016 and higher δ18o po4 values than determined equilibrium values in the lake elsbury et al 2009 the authors noted that this fact has considerable implications for management and protective measures of the lake because this p source is hard to control and direct measures to reduce this input like as sediment dredging capping are not realizable in such a large system according to the authors if this sediment flux of available p has mainly historic origin from fertilizers and detergents may be expect decrease of this flux with time if the external inflow of p from these sources will be reduced 4 5 the river taw united kingdom the analysis of δ18o of phosphate was used by granger et al 2017 to recognize potential sources of phosphate in the upper river taw catchment united kingdom the results of δ18o po4 for river water were similar 17 1 do 18 8 likewise in the tributaries deviation from the expected equilibrium line was 1 the results of analysis δ18o po4 of several potential phosphate sources within the catchment generally were similar to equilibrium value of δ18o po4 the authors noted that discharge from two wwtp had significantly different δ18o po4 16 4 and 19 6 mains tap water were 18 1 0 3 and phosphate extracted from river channel bed sediment were close to 17 the widest range of δ18o po4 was observed for inorganic fertilizers 13 3 to 25 9 while stored animal wastes were consistently lower 12 0 to 15 0 than most other sources and equilibrium δ18o po4 as the authors indicate the distinct signals from the wwtp were lost over a short distance within the river that suggests that rapid microbial cycling of phosphate was occurring shifts towards equilibrium δ18o po4 based on the results obtained it was not possible to draw definitive conclusions using the δ18o po4 signature of p sources better source and spatial characterization this approach was applied in a one off survey is needed in this case a brief summary of the case studies presented above is shown in table 4 4 6 brief guide to recognize p sources from δ18o po4 analysis the main enzymatic process controlling δ18o po4 in the environment is the intracellular activity of pyrophosphatase which involves equilibrium isotopic exchange mclaughlin et al 2013 according to davies et al 2014 the reaction catalyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase proceeds very rapidly minutes and lead to a complete o exchange between water and phosphate thus the δ18o po4 value of a molecule staying in equilibrium with surrounding h2o can be predicted based on the measured δ18o and temperature of the surrounding water eq 4 longinelli nuti 1973 isotopic fractionation of dip oxygen occurs only due to enzyme mediated biological reactions therefore if phospate demand is low relative to input and phosphate is not intensively cycled in the ecosystem the δ18o po4 will reflect the isotopic composition of the source of phosphate in studied system mclaughlin et al 2006 various processes are associated with different fractionation effects therefore the δ18o po4 tracer can be also used to determine the degree of phosphorous cycling within the biomass and processes imprinting the isotopic signatures ie mclaghlin et al 2013 gooddy et al 2018 for water reservoirs it is assumed that equilibrium value of δ18o po4 increase linearly with increasing reservoir salinity mclaghlin et al 2013 any deviations from the equilibrium line indicate an input of phosphates from external natural or anthropogenic sources end member mixing model or bayesian statistics could be used the different p sources may have similar range of δ18o po4 values therefore all potential end member p sources such as e g phosphorite rocks fertilizers wwtp effluents or detergents for studied waters should be regarded local sources of phosphate may vary seasonally ie mclaughlin et al 2006 therefore the research should be also done in seasonal cycle the extraction procedure should be adapted to the type of samples collected not always it is possible to obtaining a source bedrock sample or applied mineral fertilizer for isotopic analysis in these cases the data collected by smith et al 2021 for global variability of phosphate oxygen isotopic composition in bedrocks can be very useful for researchers the authors compiled δ18o po4 data from a wide range of bedrocks from previously existing literature and their own studies mostly of marine sedimentary origin but also for bedrocks associated with guano and igneous deposits the δ18o po4 values range for sedimentary bedrock is from 24 8 to 10 1 with distinctive trend with younger samples having higher isotope values than older ones phosphorus rich guano deposits associated with large colonies of birds or bats 19 5 to 15 and igneous p rich deposits 12 to 0 8 due to different formation mechanisms of each group the δ18o po4 signatures are different 4 7 limitations recommendations and future aspects of oxygen phosphate isotopic analysis recently analyzes of δ18o in phosphates are widely used in various environmental studies and both extraction procedures and measurement methods are constantly developed however it should be noted that there are several significant difficulties associated with this type of analysis and work to minimize or completely eliminate them should still be carried out the phosphate content in various aquatic systems is usually very low therefore large sample volumes are usually needed for δ18o po4 isotopic analysis the phosphate sample should be converted to stable non hygroscopic silver phosphate during extraction particular attention should be given to 1 the completeness of dip extraction and 2 pureness of the precipitated ag3po4 in the first step of extraction phosphate precipitation usually via magic is necessary during this step it is very important to bond all phosphate ions from a sample in the concentrated solution each stage of extraction procedures must be carried out with particular attention to maintaining proper ph as well as removal of other oxygen bearing compounds in the other case oxygen fractionation could occur or final ag3po4 could be contaminated by oxygen derived from other compounds which may lead to incorrect results and in a consequence false conclusions nowadays analytical procedures allow to determine phosphate oxygen isotopic composition in approx 200 µg of ag3po4 in recent years tc ea cf irms technique has been routinely used to δ18o po4 measure shortly dried ag3po4 usually 400 µg within silver capsules are introduced to autosampler the conversion of silver phosphate to co is achieved through pyrolysis usually at 1400 1450 c in the presence of c water vapour is removed through a water trap purified co separated from other gaseous impurities on gc column is transferred in he flow to irms where mass signals of 28 12c16o and 30 12c18o 13c17o are measured and compared to an independently introduced pure co reference gas to calculate 18o 16o ratio subsequently these ratios are calibrated to the vsmow scale using international reference standards using this method we could obtain the results of δ18o measurement form initial ag3po4 sample after few minutes however the measurement precision is generally not better than 0 3 therefore minor differences in the isotope composition of some phosphate sources may be not determined and very slight isotope effects will not be observed the fluorination and bromination methods mentioned in one of the previous section generally require significantly larger sample size than in the case of tc ea cf irms are more time consuming and also use hazardous materials therefore they are not recommend by us for routine analysis however it should be used in interlaboratory comparisons of calibration quality with international standards a very important problem associated with δ18o po4 analysis is the lack of various available certified ag3po4 standards such as b2207 distributed by elemental microanalysis ltd which is limited despite that δ18o po4 analysis have a long history therefore other compounds are used for calibration such as barium sulfate and benzoic acid laporte et al 2009 hałas et al 2011 differences in chemical composition between reference materials and samples could influence the analysis for example through different temperatures of pyrolysis lécuyer et al 2007 therefore some laboratories have produced synthetic ag3po4 internal standards davies et al 2014 from either internationally recognized δ18o standards such as nbs120c phosphate rock distributed by nist or kh2po4 solutions equilibrated with 18o enriched water i e lécuyer et al 2007 hałas et al 2011 these synthetic standards are stable over long periods at least 8 years which is required for any international reference material lécuyer et al 2007 the inter laboratory comparison of these new reference materials was undertaken lécuyer et al 2007 halas et al 2011 and their availability is also very limited problem associated with the lack of ag3po4 standards of variable δ18o signatures which would be commonly available in large quantities was reported ie during the conference isophos 2012 development of isotopic tracers for a better understanding of the phosphorus cycle a wide program of interlaboratory calibrations of those new reference materials is needed likewise for new certified standards ie usgs 80 and usgs 81 recently distributed by united states geological survey during this conference also a necessity of a set of sediment and soil standards prepared for interlaboratory calibrations was pointed out another problem is lack of comparison between the thermal conversion method currently used in most laboratories and classic fluorination and bromination methods detail comparison of results achieved by these methods is crucial to ensure compatibility of recent studies with the earlier literature even though a large number of studies using δ18o po4 is increasing in the last years we still have relatively little global data for different phosphates sources the ranges of δ18o po4 values in some phosphate sources are similar for the part of them and partly overlap a wide database of oxygen isotope compositions of different phosphate sources fertilizers manure sewage detergents and plant residues etc is needed especially as davies et al 2014 noted which practically have not been included in the global database such as potable water supplies and septic tank discharges the δ18o po4 value can be used for a better understanding of p cycle in the environment but also more studies of isotope fractionation induced by biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and organic compound synthesis are needed ie paytan and mclaughlin 2007 tamburini et al 2012 davies et al 2014 widely discussed of the validity of the longinelli and nuti equation eq 4 which describes the relation between water and phosphate oxygen isotope composition and temperature the equation is still valid but always should be determined the way of phosphate extraction and purification which analytical technique was used and how many and which standards were used for calibration isophosp 2012 so far few dip extraction protocols from water were developed and optimized for various aquatic systems ie mclaughlin et al 2004 for marine samples gooddy et al 2015 for drinking water samples tcaci et al 2019 for freshwater with very low dip concentration and these methods have been successfully used in environmental studies 5 conclusions the critical aspect of eutrophication studies is to identify the source of nutrients and recognize their pathways in studied geo ecosystem which allows for successful management protection and revitalizing of water reservoirs phosphorus is crucial element in eutrophication phosphates are easily available for microorganisms and are widely present in environment the isotopic composition of phosphate oxygen could be an indicator of phosphate origin and could be used for better understanding how p is cycling in geo ecosystem also due to exhausting resources of phosphate deposits and loss of large amounts of p contained in fertilizers studies focused on recognizing the mechanisms of phosphorus absorption by plants and optimization of p fertilization conditions are welcome nowadays the development of isotope techniques and elaborated analytical procedures allow performing reliable precise analysis of δ18o in dissolved inorganic phosphates and also in other p forms this information can be extremely valuable in the case of eutrophic waters and reservoirs exposed to anthropogenic eutrophication where p is a limiting factor for biomass development on the other hand the relationship between phosphate ions concentration and their δ18o values studied in seasonal cycles allows to expand our knowledge about processes occurring in the p cycle in studied ecosystem and could be useful for better management of p compounds in industry in this paper we present a review of the analytical procedures developed in recent years enabling the extraction of phosphates from various sources furthermore we address to several examples of environmental studies in which the results of δ18o phosphate analysis were used and evaluate the importance and limits of particular methodological approaches we indicate the methods which could provide the most informative results in terms of environmental studies focused on water eutrophication currently the eutrophication in particular anthropogenic one is a global problem many aquatic reservoirs especially in an intensively agriculturally used areas struggle with the problem of eutrophication wider implementation of δ18o po4 analysis in the studies of waters in europe also in poland can help to recognize phosphate origin and further to indicate and manage its main sources responsible for eutrophication broadening our knowledge about the phosphorus cycle will allow to identify the origin of main pollution which will contribute to effective revitalization management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by internal project for young scientific of institute of geological sciences polish academy of sciences 
969,phosphorus like nitrogen belongs to crucial bioelements limiting the biomass multiplication while surplus of phosphorous in soil is beneficial for agriculture and forestry its excess in surficial waters causes increased eutrophication which is devastating for water quality and for ecological balance anthropogenic eutrophication is one of the biggest environmental problems of last decades therefore studies which can improve the assessment of water quality are very important in the case of phosphates the most abundant form of phosphorus in lithosphere and hydrosphere isotopic composition of oxygen δ18o po4 could be used as a tracer of phosphorus cycling between the biomass soils waters and sediments here we present a short review of methods that allow to determine the oxygen isotopic composition in phosphates extracted from different water solutions we also provide examples of usefulness of this research in the environmental studies with some limitations measurements of δ18o po4 could be an usefull tool to recognize the sources of phosphates and broaden understanding of processes occurring in phosphorus cycle this knowledge is necessary to protect our drinking water resources and their revitalization keywords phosphate phosphorus cycle stable isotopes geochemistry hydrogeology water quality 1 introduction phosphorus is a very important element necessary for living and proper growth of every organisms highly reactive p is a component of many biologically important compounds such as dna rna atp and phospholipids phosphorus could occur in one of several oxidation states but in most mineral and organic compounds p occurs at 5 oxidation mainly in the form of phosphate po4 3 the phosphorus bioreactivity increases from mineral to occluded to organic form fillipelli 2008 inorganic phosphates include orthophosphates and condensed phosphates pyro poly and metaphosphates in waters and sewage orthophosphates occur mainly in a form of h2po4 and hpo4 2 ions orthophosphate minerals such as apatites hydroxy fluor and chlor and orthophosphate rich rocks such as phosphorites are widely widespread in environment apatites ca5 po4 3 f cl oh are the most common p minerals in the earth s crust over 95 of p ie smil 2000 paytan mclaughlin 2007 although several hundred minerals that contain phosphate po4 3 have been described among this group of minerals the most abundant is fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f whereas hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3oh is much less common and chlorapatite ca5 po4 3cl is very rare www mindat org according to hughes and rakovan 2015 apatites are geologically ubiquitous they are formed in igneous metamorphic sedimentary and hydrothermal environments in soils we can find also other pi minerals like as variscite alpo4 2h2o strengite fepo4 2h2o or vivianite fe3 po4 2 8h2o kruse et al 2015 phosphorites the sedimentary rocks contain more than 18 20 p205 nathan 1984 are usually of marine origin among these francolite carbonate fluorapatite is the main phosphate mineral in litosphere we can find also rare p containing minerals for example monazite ce la y th po4 xenotime ypo4 or wavellite al3 po4 2 oh 3 5h2o among the phosphorus isotopes only one is stable 31p the others are not stable with half life not exceeding 26 days therefore research of the phosphorus isotope composition is only possible in freshly originated materials for example radioactive p isotopes are used as markers 32p and 33p e g benitez nelson karl 2002 sapek 2012 however in most compounds phosphorus is strongly bonded with oxygen the element with 3 stable isotopes with mass numbers 16 17 and 18 the breakage of o p bond can be executed by biological activity but in non biological conditions the bond is usually stable and isotopic fractionation associated with abiotic processes is not greater than 1 mclaughlin et al 2013 therefore δ18o po4 could be measure as an indicator of p source nowadays development of analytical techniques allows us to measure δ18o value in samples with µm oxygen content so isotopic analysis of phosphates extracted from water was been gaining popularity in recent years ie mclaughlin et al 2004 gruau et al 2005 paytan et al 2007 mclaughlin et al 2013 in recent years δ18o po4 studies are increasingly conducted in both freshwater and marine systems but also in plant soil system see next sections the po4 3 ions can be easily absorbed by organisms therefore their excessive amount is dangerous to quality of water resources therefore isotopic analyzes of po4 3 could be useful to identify the origin of p compounds which is extremely important in the context of actions taken to revitalize and protect of endangered waters on the other hand the depleting phosphorus deposits incline us to optimize the p dosing in agriculture and search for renewable sources of this element it is therefore necessary to properly recognize processes and determine the rate of them in the complex water soil plant system in this paper we are focusing on a critical review of practical and methodical aspects of the use of oxygen isotope composition studies of phosphates in aquatic systems 2 global p cycle phosphorus global cycle includes few major components i tectonic uplift of phosphorus bearing rocks ii physical and chemical weathering and erosion of rocks producing soils and supplying p to rivers iii riverine transport of phosphorus to lakes and oceans and iv sedimentation of p associated with organic and mineral matter and burial in sediments see figure 1 ruttenberg 2003 and references therein between iv and i could occur one more element i e the melting of rocks and crystallization of primary phosphorus minerals from magma when sediments are uplifted into the weathering system the cycle begins anew in table 1 the major reservoirs of p in the global phosphorus cycle and associated residence times are shown in table 2 fluxes between the major phosphorus reservoirs are presented phosphorus minerals are found as accessory minerals in many rocks of acidic or alkaline character this p pool is not directly available for organisms during geochemical and biochemical processes p is converted to dissolved orthophosphate which can be directly assimilated production of biomass fueled by p bioavailability results in the deposition of organic matter in soils and sediments where it acts as a source of fuel and nutrients to microbial communities microbial activity in soils and sediments in turn strongly influences the concentration and chemical form of p incorporated into the geological record organic p participates in almost every biological process is dominate in soil and water systems but is still the most barely understood in the global p cycle delgado scalenge 2008 two organic cycles water and land overlap the inorganic p cycle in the terrestrial phosphorus cycle p is transferred from the soil to the biosphere then back to the soil in the water cycle organic phosphorus circulates among creatures living in rivers lakes and oceans the land cycle lasts in average one year the water cycle only few weeks liu et al 2008 currently a large amount of phosphorus comes from artificial fertilizers according to smil 2000 around 15 mt p are applied annually in inorganic fertilizers people generate smaller but also significant amounts of p in communal waste about 3 mt p year domestic animals excrete more than 16 mt p in their urine and feces unlike other most significant elements there is basically no atmospheric component in the phosphorus cycle reeburgh 1997 however a small amount of p in atmosphere is present and returns to circulation with dry or wet precipitation p in this case could derived from aeolian dust fossil fuel burning or modern biomass resources sapek sapek 2011 this precipitation plays a significant role in places poor in p stimulates further development of vegetation phosphorus present in the atmosphere does not affect air quality but could lead to eutrophication of stagnant waters 2 1 p cycle in aquatic environment continental weathering is the primary source of phosphorus for oceanic p cycle paytan mclaughlin 2007 2011 most of this p is delivered via rivers with a smaller portion delivered via dust deposition the primary sink for phosphorus in the marine environment is sediments the particulate flux from rivers is lost mainly to sediments on the continental shelves less amount to deep sea sediments phosphorus in rivers largely associated with particulate inorganic matter especially as p occurring in apatite and other minerals grains and p adsorbed to iron manganese oxide oxyhydroxides is quickly deposited in estuarine and coastal shelf and it is not directly available to marine biota however clay particles with fe and al oxyhydroxides on their surface can adsorb phosphates from freshwater solutions and these phosphates are transported into estuaries and can then be released into the sea once salinity increases in turn the part of riverine dop may be trapped in the estuaries via flocculation or may be photohydrolyzed and recycled within the estuaries paytan mclaughlin 2007 and references therein as authors indicate only about 10 30 of the total riverine p flux is potentially reactive the nonreactive p is mainly deposited on continental shelves and removed from the oceanic p cycle in the marine system biological productivity is limited by availability of dissolved phosphorus perhaps dissolved p is also the ultimate limiter of ocean productivity on geologic timescales fillipelli 2008 and references therein phosphorus incorporated into organic matter follows a similar biogeochemical pathway as the organic matter itself undergoing recycling in the water column and at the sediment water interface in figure 2 are shown transformations of given phosphorus compounds in the oceanic reservoir paytan mclaughlin 2007 the apatite especially hydroxyapatite is one of the most abundant phosphate minerals it occurs in hard tissues in mammals and other vertebrates and can be found also in other biological organisms such as brachiopods according to smil 2000 hydroxyapatite makes up about 60 of bone and 70 of vertebrates teeth the reactive phosphorus in the water column occurs as particulate organic phosphorus pop associated with live marine biomass or biogenic detritus biogenic calcium phosphate contained in hard parts of fish fish p or reactive soluble phosphorus rsp including both organic and inorganic dissolved forms of phosphorus slomp van cappellen 2007 the marine reactive p cycle is affected by river inflow primary production biomass mineralization production and dissolution of fish p and transfer between individual tanks in the water column and removal from sediments the sediments contain buried p in the form of degraded pop and fish p bonded with iron oxides fep or precipitated as carbonate fluorapatites cap in rivers a large amount of phosphorus is bonded to particles of inorganic material pip mainly p in minerals but also adsorbed by oxides and hydroxides of fe and mn paytan mclaughlin 2007 this charge of phosphorus usually quickly accumulates in the coastal area and its contribution to the reservoir of dissolved inorganic p dip available for organisms is inconsiderable the redox potential change of orthophosphates associated with metals such as fe and mn allows to released the phosphates into solution released phosphates could be now afresh by organisms reynolds davies 2001 phosphorus in rivers can derived from natural sources like as natural weathering of soil parent materials the atmosphere riparian vegetation and river bank erosion withers jarvie 2008 and refernces therein or anthropogenic one fluxes of p associated with human activity entering to freshwater may derived from fertilizers wastewater treatment plant effluent soil leachate waste from agriculture or septic tank discharge davies et al 2014 according to withers jarvie 2008 the balance between physico chemical and biological processes and their relative importance in terms of p flux modification the timing of downstream p flux delivery p fractionation in stream concentrations and ecological impacts can be vary for different conditions specific studies eg bukaveckas et al 2005 némery garnier 2007 examined the longitudinal variations in nutrient retention and cycling along river continua from source to basin outlet according to withers jarvie 2008 small headwater streams have lower water volume to bed sediment benthic area ratio and greater potential for both physico chemical and biological p exchange processes at the benthic interface and within sub surface sediments in larger river in which water volume to bed sediment benthic ratio is higher more significance for p cycling are processes linked to suspended sediments and uptake by phytoplankton 2 2 soil plant p cycle a soil solution which is a reservoir for p uptake by plants and microorganisms is of key importance in plant soil p cycle in terrestrial systems phosphorus could be present in bedrock soil and biomass see table 1 soil sorption desorption precipitation dissolution or immobilization or mineralization processes take place in the soil solution kruse et al 2015 the phosphorus cycle in soil plant system is presented in figure 3 the phosphorus concentration in soil has a wide range for example the soils in poland generally have a quite high content of p from 0 2 to 5 0 mg p kg of soil but only about 0 1 of this element is used by plants sawicka et al 2015 that is why phosphate fertilizers have found wide application in agriculture in the case of n fertilizer about 45 of the applied n is converted into biomass and the remaining 55 contributes to the disturbance of the n cycle this part remaining in soil may be next transported to the coastal zone stored in soil may escape into the atmosphere or leach into groundwater smil 1991 especially nitrate fertilizers very soluble in water applied in excess can be easy leached into groundwater the long term tracer study with 15n labeled fertilizer described by sebilo et al 2013 revealed that three decades after application of the labeled fertilizer to agricultural soils about 12 15 of the fertilizer derived n was still residing in the soil organic matter while 8 12 of the fertilizer n had already leaked toward the groundwater unlike n fertilizers p containing fertilizers introduced into the pedosphere are usually very quickly precipitated in the soil both in acid and alkaline soils figure 4 by fe al or ca aluminum is most active to phosphate precipitation at a ph of 5 0 to 5 5 whereas iron at ph below 4 calcium is primarily responsible for phosphate precipitation in alkaline soils especially at ph around 8 ludwick 1998 as the author pointed p is relatively more available to crops when it is precipitated by ca therefore losses of phosphate through precipitation are actually of less concern in alkaline than in acid soils soluble p forms usually do not migrate further than a few cm from the fertilizer granule o neill 1993 2 3 anthropogenic impact on the global phosphorus cycle the current terrestrial p cycle in anthropogenically altered landscapes is dominated by agriculture and human activities the most important processes associated with human activity disrupting the natural cycle of phosphorus i e ruttenberg 2003 filippelli 2008 are i deforestation and related losses of p due to soil erosion ii production of artificial fertilizers containing p and iii municipal and industrial wastewater nowadays total amount of p delivered to the oceans is a doubling of pre human input fluxes which causes coastal areas eutrophication and probably also contributes to increased biological production in the whole ocean fillipelli 2008 the global p flows both natural and associated with various human activities are presented in figure 5 through deforestation usually by burning after selective trees slashing plant matter is converted to ash phosphorus in ash is quickly dissolved leached from ash and transported to rivers within 1 2 years schlesinger 1997 as a result of long term use of agricultural land soils have become depleted of phosphorus its deficiency could be compensated by introducing artificially produced phosphate fertilizers for example consumption of phosphate fertilizers was 17 million tons p year in 1989 nowadays over 90 of phosphorus obtained from fossil rocks containing p is used to produce artificial fertilizers sapek 2009 but this amount is much higher than human demand due to significant losses at the stage of fertilizer production about 35 or food processing and distribution up to 60 industrial sewage and wastes are minor but also important anthropogenic p source the polyphosphates contained in detergents are more soluble than the phosphate group po4 3 and its derivatives in a wide range of conditions o neill 1993 however only ca 30 of soluble phosphates can be removed from the raw wastewater in the second stage of purification process therefore currently the amount of polyphosphates in detergents is limited fillipelli 2008 currently known p resources becoming depleted but probably will be replaced by others however progressive depletion of sources will have limited contribution of new anthropogenic p to the system see figure 6 3 oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate in most of the compounds phosphorus is strongly bound to oxygen which allows measurement of oxygen isotopic composition in phosphate ions the isotopic composition of oxygen expressed in delta notation is calculated as eq 1 1 δ 18 o r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r mean 18o 16o ratio in sample and standard respectively the oxygen isotopic composition is expressed relative to the international standard vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow fractionation factor α given as eq 2 2 α a b r a r b expresses enrichment or depletion in heavy 18o isotope between two substances a and b where ra and rb mean the 18o 16o ratio in samples a and b respectively the fractionation factor is close to 1 therefore in isotope studies is more often expressed by ɛ eq 3 3 ε α 1 1000 3 1 oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate sources in aquatic ecosystems the p sources could be separated into point such as sewage discharge sites and non point sources like soil leaching and agricultural run off mclaughlin et al 2013 their identification is critical for proper resource management and caring for aquatic ecosystems state in recent years isotopic studies of oxygen in p compounds are more often used for researchers and our dataset is extended but still the amount of available data is slight the δ18o po4 values measured for potential natural and anthropogenic sources of p which could be delivered to the waters are shown in figure 7 recent research ie mclaughlin et al 2004 2013 gruau et al 2005 paytan and mclaughlin 2007 goody et al 2015 mainly from usa and europe showed a wide range of δ18o po4 of various primary anthropogenic phosphate sources to aquatic ecosystems indicating the usefulness of δ18o po4 studies for distinguishing phosphate sources in some systems 3 2 global data of δ18o po4 from aquatic ecosystems in this paper only several examples of applications of δ18o po4 studies in various aquatic systems are presented the more information could be find ie paytan and mclaughlin 2007 mclaughlin et al 2013 davis et al 2014 tamburini et al 2014 in figure 8 ranges for global δ18o po4 data derived from different aquatic ecosystems are shown after davies et al 2014 as mentioned above isotopic analysis of oxygen in different p sources improves our knowledge about p cycling and could be helpful to recognize the source of p compounds in aquatic but also in soil plant systems the research using isotope analysis of phosphates oxygen is increasingly widespread but it also has some limitations several aspects related to this topic are briefly described below 3 3 isotope fractionation associated with biogeochemical processes over two decades ago the isotopic composition of oxygen in phosphates was found as a helpful tool for a broaden understanding the processes occuring in the p cycle i e blake et al 2005 paytan mclaughlin 2011 mclaughlin et al 2013 von sperber et al 2015 below we presented shortly summarized data about various processes could modified o isotopic composition of p compounds see table 3 in abiotic systems isotope exchange of oxygen between phosphate and water or other solutions is slow and can be considered negligible for most environmental applications i e blake et al 2005 mclaughlin et al 2013 likewise adsorption desorption processes and precipitation dissolution of p bearing minerals see table 3 however microbiological processes could be associated with large isotopic effects generally microorganisms prefer lighter isotopes therefore substrates are enriched with heavy isotopes in the case of phosphates this effect was observed under laboratory conditions for escherichia coli fractionation factor ɛ 3 blake et al 2005 both intracellular and extracellular enzymatic processes may lead to significant modification of δ18o value in producing p compounds the main enzymatic process controlling δ18o po4 in the environment is the intracellular activity of pyrophosphatase ppase which involves equilibrium isotopic exchange mclaughlin et al 2013 after tamburini et al 2014 pyrophosphatase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate p2o7 during this reaction one o atom from the surrounding water is incorporated into the p2o7 molecule in result two inorganic orthophosphate molecules are formed and subsequently released the exchange of o isotopes in this case is subject to a thermodynamic isotopic fractionation leading to a temperature dependent equilibrium between water and phosphate described by the longinelli and nuti 1973 empirical equation eq 4 4 t 111 4 4 3 δ 18 o p δ 18 o h 2 o where t temperature c δ 18 o p and δ 18 o h 2 o mean oxygen isotopic composition of phosphates and ambient water respectively vs vsmow the enzymatic hydrolysis e g by phosphatases of phosphoesters release phosphates which have changed isotopic composition tamburini et al 2014 hydrolysis of phosphoesters by phosphomonoesterase leads to break one p o bond in released phosphate three oxygen atoms derived from original compound and one oxygen atom is incorporated from h2o molecule hydrolysis of phosphoesters by phosphodiesterase leads to break two p o bonds in released phosphate two o atoms derived from original compound and two from water molecules these processes are associated with an enzyme dependent fractionation see table 3 for most phosphatase enzymes e g alkaline and acid phosphatase and phytase the released phosphates have depleted δ18o po4 pistocchi et al 2020 and references therein the o isotopic fractionation is also present in the case of uptake and utilization assimilation of phosphate by aquatic plants algae and microorganisms in this case phosphate with 16o is preferentially utilized the residual solution will be enriched with phosphate with heavy oxygen isotope 18o blake et al 2005 3 4 short review of extraction method of dip from water for δ18o isotopic analysis a brief overview of the methods that allow testing of the o isotope composition of phosphates in various types of waters and soils is presented extraction procedures are constantly improved to ensure possibly 100 recovery of phosphates from the tested solution and removal of compounds which may interfere with δ18o po4 measurements the tc ea cf irms thermal conversion elemental analyzer continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry techniques enabling routine δ18o po4 analysis of about 0 2 mg of ag3po4 samples are also improved to increase the efficiency of co conversion and analytical precision due to this analysis of δ18o po4 despite various difficulties are increasingly successfully used in environmental research 3 5 oxygen isotopic analysis in phosphates historical background the oxygen isotopic analysis in phosphates began in the 1960s when tudge 1960 described the procedure of extraction of po4 3 from natural apatites this procedure involves several stages of wet chemistry and slow precipitation of bipo4 which is subsequently fluorinated under vacuum eq 5 5 b i p o 4 8 3 b r f 3 b i f 3 p f 5 4 3 b r 2 2 o 2 the method refined by kolodny et al 1983 whilst preferred to use bromine pentafluoride to bismuth phosphate decomposition was used widely for many years lécuyer 2004 as alternative to this procedure firsching 1961 proposed a method to precipitate the phosphate as non hygroscopic ag3po4 which is stable in contrast to bipo4 besides fluorination also bromination method was used to obtain o2 from ag3po4 for oxygen isotopic analysis eq 6 6 2 a g 3 p o 4 b r 2 a g 4 p 2 o 7 1 2 o 2 2 a g b r the fluorination and bromination methods require a large amount of sample 10 mg for ag3po4 are time consuming few days the efficiency of o2 obtain is rather low especially the bromination reaction and hazardous products such as brf5 were obtained during reaction i e lécuyer 2004 mclaughlin et al 2004 davies et al 2014 another method allows measurement of δ18o po4 values was described by o neil and co workers o neil et al 1994 modified by lécuyer et al 1998 in this case graphite reagent is used to obtain co2 for δ18o analysis briefly the co2 is obtained during reaction of ag3po4 with c carried out at 1200 c the oxygen yield is still low about 25 but allows to obtain reproducible results nevertheless the measured δ18o values compared with the results obtained by the bipo4 method were slightly different ca 1 o neil et al 1994 the problem is also oxygen fractionation between sample and silica tube observed in high temperature révész and böhlke 2002 these methods with further modifications focusing mainly on increasing the efficiency and saving preparation time i e vennemann et al 2002 lécuyer 2004 pelc hałas 2010 were routinely used to analyze apatites in the case of dip its concentration in water is usually very low ie in ocean do not exceed 3 µm dm3 ruttenberg 2003 wherein even below 0 2 µm dm3 in the surface layer mclaughlin et al 2004 in rivers lakes or other freshwater reservoirs the phosphate concentration could be various but generally higher than marine and ocean waters it is therefore difficult to obtain the sufficient amount of phosphates precipitated as ag3po4 for dip isotopic analysis and methods described above could not be satisfactory the second significant problem is extraction of phosphates dissolved in waters the protocols must allow the po4 3 extraction efficiency possible close to 100 simultaneously avoiding contamination with other compounds that may interfere with δ18o measurements such as silicates and multivalent ions davies et al 2014 the measurement of δ18o po4 has also been developed by another ms techniques such as negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry ntims techniques holmden et al 1997 or laser based analysis wenzel et al 2000 these methods are not often used for dip analysis and are not discussed in detail in this paper 3 6 on line measurement of δ18o in ag3po4 the problem associated with the amount of sample required to analysis has been solved by tc ea cf irms techniques on line methods for isotope analysis of oxygen in phosphates ag3po4 have been developed by micromass the developed method is a high temperature pyrolysis technique for δ18o measurements of phosphates see lécuyer 2004 the application is described shortly in a technical note published by j morrison 1999 and in more detail in kornexl et al 1999 in this method ag3po4 is decomposed at 1400 c in glassy carbon reactor filled with glassy carbon grit with small amount of nickelized carbon in an elemental analyzer schematic diagram is shown in figure 9 the produced co high co yield about 90 is transported by a continuous flow gas chromatograph to irms by using this technique phosphate samples containing as less as 50 100 µg of o can be analyzed for their δ18o values usually with 1σ 0 5 kornexl et al 1999 this method was next modified by researchers to increasing the efficiency of ag3po4 to co conversion to obtain more reproducible precise results of δ18o po4 measurements i e venneman et al 2002 mclaughlin et al 2004 lécuyer et al 2007 laporte et al 2009 nowadays tc ea cf irms technique is routinely used to determine 18o 16o ratios in very small samples ca 400 µg of ag3po4 which enables to conduct dip isotopic studies 3 7 important factors during dip extraction procedure samples required for isotopic analysis using tc ea cf irms systems should be first converted from dissolved to solid form during this stage is very important to make sure that the original isotopic composition of oxygen from dip is retained reactions carried out during extraction procedures should be completed without fractionation effects during the procedure new inorganic p source is not introduced to the sample or other o bearing compounds such as nitrates sulphates caco3 or dissolved organic carbon i e davies et al 2014 several protocols for phosphate extraction from water including seawater and freshwater are shortly presented below 3 8 dip extraction protocol from seawater in 2004 mclaughlin and co workers described a method for dip extraction from seawater and next precipitation to ag3po4 for isotopic analysis mclaughlin et al 2004 see figure 10 in this procedure dip was stripped via magic magnesium induced coprecipitation karl and tien 1992 the authors used 150 ml of 1 m sodium hydroxide solution for 8 l of seawater with phosphate concentration 0 8 µm next deposits with adsorbed dip was transferred to a 250 ml bottle the samples were next centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded in the next step the precipitate was dissolved in ch3cooh and nh3 ph 5 5 buffered with ch3cook subsequently cerium phosphate was precipitated by adding cerium nitrate solution and next was transferred into a 50 ml tube and centrifuged after removal of cl ions the retained precipitate was dissolved in nitric acid solution mixed with 4 ml of cation exchange resin biorad ag 50 8 and shaken to remove cerium ions from solution the resin was subsequently separated from the solution which was collected in a 50 m centrifuge tubes in the next step bromothymol blue indicator was added for each samples next 1 ml ammonium hydroxide and 1 ml of 3 m nh4no3 was added ph was adapted to 7 with nh3 finally silver phosphate was precipitated by adding agno3 solution separated on polycarbonate filter ag3po4 precipitate rinsed with deionized water was then dried at 50 c overnight the samples converted to ag3po4 were then pyrolyzed and analyzed by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry about 0 6 mg of ag3po4 was weighted with 1 mg of 50 nickelized carbon into ag capsules and placed into an autosampler oxygen from sample was converted to co in the glassy carbon tube filled with glassy carbon chips at temperature 1270 c which was next purified in a gas chromatograph and injected into an irms for δ18o isotopic analysis using this method phosphate samples contain 3 5 µmol oxygen could be analyzed routinely with an average standard deviation of about 0 3 3 9 extraction protocol of dip from water with high dip concentration another method was presented by gruau et al 2005 the paper presents precipitation of dip with iron hydroxide and purification as ag3po4 see figure 11 the authors used this method for wastewater treatment plants water wtpw due to high phosphate concentration about 300 500 ml of water was sufficient to analysis after pre filtration and dissolved organic carbon doc removal 0 1 m feso4 was added to the solution to precipitate the phosphate after supernatant removed the precipitate was dried at 30 c and placed in polypropylene tubes next 10 ml of 2 m koh was added to each of them after few hours shaking the iron hydroxide was separated by centrifugation subsequently the phosphate was purified using anion exchange resin amberlite ira 400 and finally isolated as ag3po4 crystals using procedure adapted from lécuyer et al 1993 to isotopic analysis gruau and co workers used fluorination method 3 10 extraction protocol of dissolved inorganic phosphate from freshwater with very low dip concentration a new technique allows to determine δ18o po4 in freshwater samples with very low dip concentration was described by tcaci et al 2019 using the protocol called by the authors as twist spinning mode tsm is enable to process about 1000 l of sample with an initially p concentration 0 016 mg p dm3 within the field in approximately 24 h phosphate with other oxyanions are binding on the anion exchange resin when sampling is complete the resin is recovered by decanting the overlying water and packed into a separate column next phosphates are eluted with 0 3 m kcl and collected for further processing following the protocol described in gooddy et al 2015 see figure 12 3 11 dip extraction protocols from drinking water a modified version of mclaughlin et al 2004 method described in details in gooddy et al 2015 was used to isolate phosphate from drinking water samples see figure 13 in brief dissolved organic matter was removed using a dax 8 organic exchange resin subsequently phosphate was isolated from the remaining matrix by adsorption onto an anion exchange resin and next were eluted and separated from other oxyanions no3 and so4 2 using a 0 3 m kcl the phosphates from eluted fractions were then processed step by step as shown in figure 12 using modified version of mclaughlin et al 2004 method 3 12 extraction protocols of phosphate from soil recently phosphate extraction procedures from soil samples were also developed tamburini et al 2010 presented the protocol of soil phosphate extraction optimized for organic rich soil samples extraction using this method was done by hcl and phosphates were purified with multiple mineral precipitations extreme ph adjustments of the solutions is not required in this case using the method contaminant free ag3po4 could be produced from fertilizers and different types of soils the results of their investigation confirm that differences in phosphorus status and availability in soils are expressed by oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate ions and could be use as a tracer to better understand p dynamics in soil systems in 2011 weiner and co workers presented another procedure for soil phosphates weiner et al 2011 which is modified procedure described by sibessen 1983 and mclaughlin et al 2004 the method is based on the inorganic phosphate extraction on anion exchange membranes bdh 551642s vwr saturated with hco3 2 the results showed no artifacts and good reproducibility 0 3 of δ18o po4 measurements for obtained ag3po4 precipitate 4 case studies of δ18o po4 analysis application in recognizing phosphate sources and cycling recently the δ18o po4 analysis are widely used for identifying different phosphate sources and better understanding p cycling in marine and freshwater research ie markel et al 1994 blake et al 2001 mclaughlin et al 2004 gruau et al 2005 young et al 2009 elsbury et al 2009 mclaughlin et al 2013 pistocchi et al 2017 paytan et al 2017 gooddy et al 2018 tcaci et al 2019 analysis of the oxygen isotopic composition in p compounds could be also helpful in explaining the dynamics of p circulation in soil and could be useful in areas where use of radioactive p isotopes is limited melby et al 2013 however it should be noted that identification based on the δ18o po4 values are usually difficult the range of δ18o po4 values of different phosphate sources could be wide and in some cases various p sources could have similar 18o 16o ratio see figure 7 for example δ18o po4 20 could be simultaneously assigned to several p sources as was mentioned above the p o bond in phosphate is resistant to inorganic hydrolysis and at the temperature and ph of most natural systems phosphate does not exchange oxygen with water without biological activity see table 3 therefore observed variability in δ18o po4 values will either reflect mixing of isotopically distinct sources of phosphate or the alteration of the phosphate δ 18o signature as a result of o exchange during the cycling of phosphate through living cells afterwards each time a phosphate molecule is cycled taken up by organisms and processed by enzymes phosphate oxygen will be exchanged with cellular water resulting in isotopic equilibrium with the surrounding water at the temperature of reaction usually the phosphates studied in water were not in an isotope equilibrium with the surrounding h2o which indicated that the complete intracellular biological cycle of the orthophosphate did not take place and the isotope record of the source could be preserved paytan mclaughlin 2013 therefore in water reservoirs it is assumed that δ18o po4 values in equilibrium with the surrounding h2o see eq 4 increase linearly with increasing salinity of the reservoir and deviations from the equilibrium line are associated with the mixing of waters with phosphates from natural or anthropogenic sources see also figure 13 mclaughlin et al 2013 several examples of use of δ18o po4 analysis to recognize phosphate sources and better understanding p cycling in different aquatic systems was presented below 4 1 lake kinneret israel markel et al 1994 used δ18o of phosphate as a tracer to determine p sources and cycling in lake kinneret israel the results of δ18o po4 analysis of sediment samples from the lake and its catchment indicated that i three different fractions of lake sediments have a significant different δ18o po4 sand 12 silt samples δ18o po4 12 15 and 15 for clay samples ii δ18o of phosphate for clay samples increased or decreased at individual stations in relation to jordan inlet max 1 5 similar situation was observed for silts iii samples from meshushim stream had the lowest δ18o po4 value 8 6 for silt 12 7 for clay while the highest was measured for amud stream 16 5 for silt 19 8 for clay the authors summarized that major fraction of p in the lake sediments was linked to ca as apatite or as a surface complex on calcite crystals the minor fraction was adsorbed on clays and on iron hydroxides the research has shown also that 70 of the particulate inorganic phosphate entering to lake kinneret derived from basaltic source δ18o po4 6 only 40 of phosphate in studied silts and clays derived from basaltic source the rest could be sedimentary and anthropogenic origin δ18o po4 18 to 25 the isotopic data was useful to creating model describing recycling of pip in lake kinneret 4 2 san francisco bay usa mclaughlin et al 2006 used analysis of δ18o po4 as a tracer for sources and cycling of phosphate in north san francisco bay research were used for estimate mixing of dip sources along an estuarine flow path the values of δ18o of river and ocean waters are meaningly different and also different should be the 18o 16o ratios in phosphate recycled in these waters as a consequence of equilibrium fractionation therefore δ18o po4 studies could be used to characterize mixing processes of water phosphates or to determine their cycling as authors indicate the north san francisco bay could be characterized by a two end member mixing model between pacific ocean waters and the san joaquin and sacramento rivers freshwaters based on salinity and δ18o h2o the oxygen phosphate isotopic signature was used to characterize mixing between oceanic and riverine phosphate with various point and non point locations such as the discharge points of tributaries and wastewater treatment plants the authors note that the lack of isotopic equilibrium in the dip throughout the bay indicates that the phosphate input is faster than phosphate cycling and that source phosphate δ18o contributes to observed δ18o po4 at most stations see figure 14 4 3 drinking water supplies england wales gooddy et al 2015 presented the first assessment of 18o 16o ratio in phosphates within drinking water supplies the authors indicate that in many developed countries legacy lead piping is a source of lead contamination in drinking water which increase risk e g coronary heart disease or stroke because of increased blood pressure pocock et al 1988 gordon hutchinson 1994 therefore as authors indicate public water utilities in u k in parts of europe and north america routinely dose drinking water supplies with phosphate to prevent pipe corrosion and the dissolution of lead gooddy et al 2015 analyzed 40 samples from phosphate dosed distribution networks from england and wales and the samples of the source orthophosphoric acid used for dosing the research shown two significantly different isotopic signatures of oxygen phosphates for analyzed drinking water average 13 2 or 19 7 primarily determined by δ18o po4 of the source acid average 12 4 or 19 7 see figure 15 depending on the source acid used δ18o po4 of drinking water appears isotopically distinct from another p sources with isotopic offsets for studied by gooddy and co workers waters from the source acid ranging from 0 9 to 2 8 as the authors suggest given the widespread use of phosphate dosing in drinking water in association with evidence of isotopic differentiation between drinking water supplies and other sources of p in environment the application of δ18o of phosphate analyses in this area deserves further attention the authors also point out that in other countries where dosing with phosphate occurs similar research should be made gooddy et al 2015 suggest also that isotope fractionation or abiotic isotope effects influenced for δ18o po4 within the drinking water distribution network require further analysis 4 4 lake erie usa paytan et al 2017 investigated the p cycle in lake erie usa using δ18o po4 analysis to understand p cycling in the lake and to recognize the p fluxes the authors used pore water p concentration profiles the results of sediment cores incubation experiments and δ18o po4 data to estimate the isotopic signature of sedimentary phosphate input relative to the isotopic signature of phosphate in lake water based on obtained results the authors noted that the total p sediment flux estimates amount to 8 20 of the total external input of p to lake erie the relatively large internal loading flux of p from sediments to the water column in the central basin of lake erie paytan et al 2017 which is consistent with recent reports from the western basin matisoff et al 2016 and higher δ18o po4 values than determined equilibrium values in the lake elsbury et al 2009 the authors noted that this fact has considerable implications for management and protective measures of the lake because this p source is hard to control and direct measures to reduce this input like as sediment dredging capping are not realizable in such a large system according to the authors if this sediment flux of available p has mainly historic origin from fertilizers and detergents may be expect decrease of this flux with time if the external inflow of p from these sources will be reduced 4 5 the river taw united kingdom the analysis of δ18o of phosphate was used by granger et al 2017 to recognize potential sources of phosphate in the upper river taw catchment united kingdom the results of δ18o po4 for river water were similar 17 1 do 18 8 likewise in the tributaries deviation from the expected equilibrium line was 1 the results of analysis δ18o po4 of several potential phosphate sources within the catchment generally were similar to equilibrium value of δ18o po4 the authors noted that discharge from two wwtp had significantly different δ18o po4 16 4 and 19 6 mains tap water were 18 1 0 3 and phosphate extracted from river channel bed sediment were close to 17 the widest range of δ18o po4 was observed for inorganic fertilizers 13 3 to 25 9 while stored animal wastes were consistently lower 12 0 to 15 0 than most other sources and equilibrium δ18o po4 as the authors indicate the distinct signals from the wwtp were lost over a short distance within the river that suggests that rapid microbial cycling of phosphate was occurring shifts towards equilibrium δ18o po4 based on the results obtained it was not possible to draw definitive conclusions using the δ18o po4 signature of p sources better source and spatial characterization this approach was applied in a one off survey is needed in this case a brief summary of the case studies presented above is shown in table 4 4 6 brief guide to recognize p sources from δ18o po4 analysis the main enzymatic process controlling δ18o po4 in the environment is the intracellular activity of pyrophosphatase which involves equilibrium isotopic exchange mclaughlin et al 2013 according to davies et al 2014 the reaction catalyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase proceeds very rapidly minutes and lead to a complete o exchange between water and phosphate thus the δ18o po4 value of a molecule staying in equilibrium with surrounding h2o can be predicted based on the measured δ18o and temperature of the surrounding water eq 4 longinelli nuti 1973 isotopic fractionation of dip oxygen occurs only due to enzyme mediated biological reactions therefore if phospate demand is low relative to input and phosphate is not intensively cycled in the ecosystem the δ18o po4 will reflect the isotopic composition of the source of phosphate in studied system mclaughlin et al 2006 various processes are associated with different fractionation effects therefore the δ18o po4 tracer can be also used to determine the degree of phosphorous cycling within the biomass and processes imprinting the isotopic signatures ie mclaghlin et al 2013 gooddy et al 2018 for water reservoirs it is assumed that equilibrium value of δ18o po4 increase linearly with increasing reservoir salinity mclaghlin et al 2013 any deviations from the equilibrium line indicate an input of phosphates from external natural or anthropogenic sources end member mixing model or bayesian statistics could be used the different p sources may have similar range of δ18o po4 values therefore all potential end member p sources such as e g phosphorite rocks fertilizers wwtp effluents or detergents for studied waters should be regarded local sources of phosphate may vary seasonally ie mclaughlin et al 2006 therefore the research should be also done in seasonal cycle the extraction procedure should be adapted to the type of samples collected not always it is possible to obtaining a source bedrock sample or applied mineral fertilizer for isotopic analysis in these cases the data collected by smith et al 2021 for global variability of phosphate oxygen isotopic composition in bedrocks can be very useful for researchers the authors compiled δ18o po4 data from a wide range of bedrocks from previously existing literature and their own studies mostly of marine sedimentary origin but also for bedrocks associated with guano and igneous deposits the δ18o po4 values range for sedimentary bedrock is from 24 8 to 10 1 with distinctive trend with younger samples having higher isotope values than older ones phosphorus rich guano deposits associated with large colonies of birds or bats 19 5 to 15 and igneous p rich deposits 12 to 0 8 due to different formation mechanisms of each group the δ18o po4 signatures are different 4 7 limitations recommendations and future aspects of oxygen phosphate isotopic analysis recently analyzes of δ18o in phosphates are widely used in various environmental studies and both extraction procedures and measurement methods are constantly developed however it should be noted that there are several significant difficulties associated with this type of analysis and work to minimize or completely eliminate them should still be carried out the phosphate content in various aquatic systems is usually very low therefore large sample volumes are usually needed for δ18o po4 isotopic analysis the phosphate sample should be converted to stable non hygroscopic silver phosphate during extraction particular attention should be given to 1 the completeness of dip extraction and 2 pureness of the precipitated ag3po4 in the first step of extraction phosphate precipitation usually via magic is necessary during this step it is very important to bond all phosphate ions from a sample in the concentrated solution each stage of extraction procedures must be carried out with particular attention to maintaining proper ph as well as removal of other oxygen bearing compounds in the other case oxygen fractionation could occur or final ag3po4 could be contaminated by oxygen derived from other compounds which may lead to incorrect results and in a consequence false conclusions nowadays analytical procedures allow to determine phosphate oxygen isotopic composition in approx 200 µg of ag3po4 in recent years tc ea cf irms technique has been routinely used to δ18o po4 measure shortly dried ag3po4 usually 400 µg within silver capsules are introduced to autosampler the conversion of silver phosphate to co is achieved through pyrolysis usually at 1400 1450 c in the presence of c water vapour is removed through a water trap purified co separated from other gaseous impurities on gc column is transferred in he flow to irms where mass signals of 28 12c16o and 30 12c18o 13c17o are measured and compared to an independently introduced pure co reference gas to calculate 18o 16o ratio subsequently these ratios are calibrated to the vsmow scale using international reference standards using this method we could obtain the results of δ18o measurement form initial ag3po4 sample after few minutes however the measurement precision is generally not better than 0 3 therefore minor differences in the isotope composition of some phosphate sources may be not determined and very slight isotope effects will not be observed the fluorination and bromination methods mentioned in one of the previous section generally require significantly larger sample size than in the case of tc ea cf irms are more time consuming and also use hazardous materials therefore they are not recommend by us for routine analysis however it should be used in interlaboratory comparisons of calibration quality with international standards a very important problem associated with δ18o po4 analysis is the lack of various available certified ag3po4 standards such as b2207 distributed by elemental microanalysis ltd which is limited despite that δ18o po4 analysis have a long history therefore other compounds are used for calibration such as barium sulfate and benzoic acid laporte et al 2009 hałas et al 2011 differences in chemical composition between reference materials and samples could influence the analysis for example through different temperatures of pyrolysis lécuyer et al 2007 therefore some laboratories have produced synthetic ag3po4 internal standards davies et al 2014 from either internationally recognized δ18o standards such as nbs120c phosphate rock distributed by nist or kh2po4 solutions equilibrated with 18o enriched water i e lécuyer et al 2007 hałas et al 2011 these synthetic standards are stable over long periods at least 8 years which is required for any international reference material lécuyer et al 2007 the inter laboratory comparison of these new reference materials was undertaken lécuyer et al 2007 halas et al 2011 and their availability is also very limited problem associated with the lack of ag3po4 standards of variable δ18o signatures which would be commonly available in large quantities was reported ie during the conference isophos 2012 development of isotopic tracers for a better understanding of the phosphorus cycle a wide program of interlaboratory calibrations of those new reference materials is needed likewise for new certified standards ie usgs 80 and usgs 81 recently distributed by united states geological survey during this conference also a necessity of a set of sediment and soil standards prepared for interlaboratory calibrations was pointed out another problem is lack of comparison between the thermal conversion method currently used in most laboratories and classic fluorination and bromination methods detail comparison of results achieved by these methods is crucial to ensure compatibility of recent studies with the earlier literature even though a large number of studies using δ18o po4 is increasing in the last years we still have relatively little global data for different phosphates sources the ranges of δ18o po4 values in some phosphate sources are similar for the part of them and partly overlap a wide database of oxygen isotope compositions of different phosphate sources fertilizers manure sewage detergents and plant residues etc is needed especially as davies et al 2014 noted which practically have not been included in the global database such as potable water supplies and septic tank discharges the δ18o po4 value can be used for a better understanding of p cycle in the environment but also more studies of isotope fractionation induced by biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and organic compound synthesis are needed ie paytan and mclaughlin 2007 tamburini et al 2012 davies et al 2014 widely discussed of the validity of the longinelli and nuti equation eq 4 which describes the relation between water and phosphate oxygen isotope composition and temperature the equation is still valid but always should be determined the way of phosphate extraction and purification which analytical technique was used and how many and which standards were used for calibration isophosp 2012 so far few dip extraction protocols from water were developed and optimized for various aquatic systems ie mclaughlin et al 2004 for marine samples gooddy et al 2015 for drinking water samples tcaci et al 2019 for freshwater with very low dip concentration and these methods have been successfully used in environmental studies 5 conclusions the critical aspect of eutrophication studies is to identify the source of nutrients and recognize their pathways in studied geo ecosystem which allows for successful management protection and revitalizing of water reservoirs phosphorus is crucial element in eutrophication phosphates are easily available for microorganisms and are widely present in environment the isotopic composition of phosphate oxygen could be an indicator of phosphate origin and could be used for better understanding how p is cycling in geo ecosystem also due to exhausting resources of phosphate deposits and loss of large amounts of p contained in fertilizers studies focused on recognizing the mechanisms of phosphorus absorption by plants and optimization of p fertilization conditions are welcome nowadays the development of isotope techniques and elaborated analytical procedures allow performing reliable precise analysis of δ18o in dissolved inorganic phosphates and also in other p forms this information can be extremely valuable in the case of eutrophic waters and reservoirs exposed to anthropogenic eutrophication where p is a limiting factor for biomass development on the other hand the relationship between phosphate ions concentration and their δ18o values studied in seasonal cycles allows to expand our knowledge about processes occurring in the p cycle in studied ecosystem and could be useful for better management of p compounds in industry in this paper we present a review of the analytical procedures developed in recent years enabling the extraction of phosphates from various sources furthermore we address to several examples of environmental studies in which the results of δ18o phosphate analysis were used and evaluate the importance and limits of particular methodological approaches we indicate the methods which could provide the most informative results in terms of environmental studies focused on water eutrophication currently the eutrophication in particular anthropogenic one is a global problem many aquatic reservoirs especially in an intensively agriculturally used areas struggle with the problem of eutrophication wider implementation of δ18o po4 analysis in the studies of waters in europe also in poland can help to recognize phosphate origin and further to indicate and manage its main sources responsible for eutrophication broadening our knowledge about the phosphorus cycle will allow to identify the origin of main pollution which will contribute to effective revitalization management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
