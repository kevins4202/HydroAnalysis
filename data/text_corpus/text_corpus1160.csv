5800,the growing complexity of geometric models for the simulation of subsurface flows leads to the necessity of using the fully implicit method due to its unconditionally stability with the relaxation of the time step size in the paper we introduce and study a parallel and scalable fully implicit solver for the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows in the proposed approach the flow problem is discretized in space and time based on a fully implicit cell centered finite volume scheme where several different limiters are applied to guarantee the accuracy of the spatial discretization and an adaptive time stepping technique for the temporal integration is designed to accelerate the simulation progress and then the resultant nonlinear algebraic system arising from the discretization of the variably saturated soil water flows is solved by a family of newton krylov methods under the domain decomposition framework numerical experiments on several standard benchmark tests are used to validate the stability of the fully implicit scheme with large time steps and to examine the performance of the proposed domain decomposition solver on a parallel computer platform keywords richard equation fully implicit scheme domain decomposition additive schwarz preconditioner parallel computing 1 introduction prediction of water movements in variably saturated soil is currently of critical importance for many applications of sciences and engineering such as water resources petroleum reservoirs multiphase flow models bioenvironmental processes and so on chen et al 2006 drever 2005 firoozabadi 1999 hajibeygi and jenny 2009 oleson et al 2013 zadeh 2006 the extensive growing demand on describing understanding and predicting the dynamics of the systems with varying degree of complexity has produced persistent requirements on developing state of the art process based mathematical models and simulators with enhanced prediction capabilities chen 2007 falgout et al 2006 hundsdorfer and verwer 2013 leveque 2002 sobol 2015 wesseling 2009 mathematical modeling of variably saturated soil water flows usually results in systems of time dependent nonlinear partial dierential equations pdes due to its highly nonlinear behaviour arising from the complexity of relevant physical chemical and biological flow processes in the geological media high resolution simulations with advanced numerical methods are crucial to improve the representation of this intricate problem in the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows many attentions have been paid by using explicit or semi implicit methods to overcome the highly nonlinearity of the flow problem berardi et al 2018 kirkland et al 1992 lai and ogden 2015 misiats and lipnikov 2013 ogden et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 in which the original nonlinear problem is transformed into a linear system under the framework of semi implicit approaches or a pure iterative system with the use of explicit methods these schemes are easy to implement and shown to be efficient and reliable for the solution of this mathematical model however in virtue of the natural endowment of its explicitly the explicit or semi implicit method follows the stability restriction imposed by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and often requires the use of a small time step size to obtain a physical meaningful solution as the high computational complexity for accurate predictions of costly projects when very fine spatial meshes are used in the high resolution simulation the time step size has to be very small in order to satisfy the cfl condition which in turn makes the solution very time consuming and therefore severely constrains application of these approaches to large scale simulations compared with explicit and semi implicit schemes the fully implicit algorithm depends only on the accuracy requirement of the simulation and can relax the stability requirement on the time step size which provides a consistent and robust way to solve the large scale nonlinear problem for long term simulations in the recent years fully implicit methods have recently been successfully applied to several classes of important applications hwang and cai 2005 knoll and keyes 2004 kong and cai 2016 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in particular the approach can be combined with some suitable time adaptivity strategies huang et al 2015 rosam et al 2007 yang and cai 2014 yang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 to study the long term behaviour of the simulation which leads to substantial reduction of the total computing time and thus extensively widens the scope of this interesting method a key to the success of a fully implicit time stepping method is the solution of a nonlinear algebraic system at every time step which remains challenging and important to obtain robust and scalable solvers for large scale simulations in general the family of inexact newton algorithm is a potential good choice based on the face that it is general purpose and has stronger portability to transplant modify service and upgrade particularly the newton type methods have a rapid local convergence rate under certain conditions dembo et al 1982 dennis and schnabel 1996 in this work we propose and study a highly parallel solver based on the framework of newton krylov type algorithms brune et al 2015 cai et al 1998 cai and keyes 2002 kaushik et al 1999 knoll and keyes 2004 yang and cai 2011 to guarantee the nonlinear consistency in the proposed parallel framework an inexact newton method with backtracking is the basic nonlinear iteration and a krylov subspace iterative method is applied as the linear solver at each newton step the success of the overall newton krylov solver depends heavily on substantially reducing the condition number of the corresponding linear system which signifies the urgent demand of preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of nonlinear and linear iterations hence the main focus of this work is on the design of some efficient overlapping additive schwarz type domain decomposition methods to build the preconditioner smith et al 1996 toselli and widlund 2005 the domain decomposition method which follows the nature of divide and conquer techniques is to transform the original problem into more sub problems of the same or related type and hence can perfectly match the fundamental characteristic of the massively parallel computing it has been applied successfully to solve difficult nonlinear problems in a variety of applications on high performance computing platforms brune et al 2015 hwang and cai 2005 knoll and keyes 2004 liu et al 2018 prudencio and cai 2007 yang and cai 2011 in particular with the appearance of the restricted version of domain decomposition methods proposed by cai and sarkis in cai et al 2003 cai and sarkis 1999 it can take evasive action on the communication among the sub problems and result in less overall convergence time and further improve the performance of the domain decomposition preconditioner in this work to take advantage of modern supercomputers for large scale simulations we propose and develop the overlapping restricted additive schwarz preconditioner for solving discrete systems that come from fully implicit discretizations by using these strategies our experiments show that the proposed fully implicit solver based on the newton krylov algorithm and the domain decomposition technique is efficient robust and scalable on a supercomputer platform for high fidelity simulations on supercomputers the accuracy robustness and scalability of the parallel solver with respect to the number of processors are critically important there are several issues we address in this paper including a the accuracy determined mainly by the fully implicit discretization b the independent robustness characterized mainly in terms of linear and nonlinear iterations by the newton krylov method and c the strong and weak scalabilities of the solver by means of the total compute time with the use of the domain decomposition technique we would like to point out that without the condition a it is usually meaningless to obtain the condition b or c moreover even though the condition a holds the other two conditions may still not possible since both b and c depend on the algorithms and the software implementation among other factors as a result although the three basic elements are all well understood individually the construction of the parallel solver framework to obtain the best combination remains a challenge hence for a given class of problems and computing platform a special combination is necessarily studied in order to obtain the best performance which is the main goal of this paper in addition to that as far as we known limited research has been conducted to apply the restricted schwarz preconditioning technique for the fully implicit simulation of variably saturated soil water flow problems the outline of the paper is as follows in section 2 we introduce the governing equation of variably saturated soil water flows both the finite volume method with different limiters and the fully implicit scheme with an adaptive time stepping strategy are provided for the spatial and temporal discretizations respectively in section 3 we present a class of inexact newton solvers with domain decomposition preconditioners to solve the resultant nonlinear systems we show numerical results for some benchmark problems in section 4 to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the proposed method the paper is concluded in section 5 2 mathematical model and discretizations with the combination of the darcy s law and the mass conservation the flow of fluids in variably saturated soil water where the gravity and the fluid pressure gradient produce the motion can be described by the richards equation re chen et al 2006 chen 2007 firoozabadi 1999 leveque 2002 zadeh et al 2007 1 θ t k h h k h z s where θ is the volumetric water content l 3 l 3 h is the pressure head l k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 s is the soil moisture sink term l 3 l 3 t 1 z is the depth assumed positive downward l and t is the time t the eq 1 is known as the mixed form of the richards equation lai and ogden 2015 zadeh 2011 with the help of the specific capacity function 2 c h θ h which denotes the rate of change of the fluid content of the medium the fluid pressure head based h based form caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 celia et al 1990 zadeh 2011 of 1 can be defined as follows 3 c h h t k h h k h z s for the solution of the richards equation the relationships of the hydraulic properties are needed to describe the hydraulic conductivity and fluid content versus fluid pressure head in this study the van genuchten mualem model genuchten 1980 is used to represent these properties the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is given as k h k s k r h with 4 k r s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 μ μ 2 where the parameter k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and k r is the relative permeability the effective saturation s e 0 s e 1 is defined as 5 s e θ θ θ r θ s θ r θ θ r θ s θ r 1 τ h ν μ where θ r is the residual water content l 3 l 3 of the media θ s is the saturated water content l 3 l 3 τ is the inverse of the air entry value l 1 and μ ν are empirical constants that relate to pore size distribution with μ 1 1 ν substituting 5 into the specific capacity function 2 then we have 6 c h τ μ ν θ s θ r τ h ν 1 1 τ h ν μ 1 let ω be the computational domain with the lipschitz boundary γ suppose the boundary of the computational domain ω is composed of two parts γ γ d γ n with γ d γ n then the boundary conditions associated to 3 are 7 h h d on γ d v n h n on γ n where v k h h z 1 is the soil water flux the system 3 and 7 is closed by the initial condition for the pressure solution as follows 8 h t 0 h 0 in ω in this study we employ a cell centered finite volume method caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 eymard et al 1999 leveque 2002 to discretize the model equation for the spatial terms and the implicit first order scheme backward euler celia et al 1990 with an adaptive time stepping technique rosam et al 2007 is used for the temporal integration here we take the numerical solution based on the one dimensional domain for example let the computational domain ω be covered with the mesh cell ω i z i 1 2 z i 1 2 i 1 2 n in the numerical simulation the unknown pressure head h i and the specific moisture capacity c h i are placed in the central point of mesh z i z i 1 2 z i 1 2 while the unknown soil water hydraulic conductivity k h i 1 2 is defined at the interface of two adjacent cells as shown in fig 1 taking the integral over the cell ω i for the eq 3 we obtain 9 ω i c h h t dz ω i z k h h z k h dz ω i s dz we define the cell averaged pressure h i at time t as h i 1 ω i ω i hdz and use the first order approximation for the specific capacity function c h c h i then the semi discrete system can be obtained by applying green s theorem as follows 10 c h i h t z i k h h z k h i 1 2 k h h z k h i 1 2 s i z i where the mesh sizes z i 1 2 z i 1 z i and z i 1 2 z i z i 1 to get a fully discretized system we adopt the implicit backward euler scheme with adaptive time stepping for the temporal integration for a given time stepping sequence 0 t 0 t 1 t 2 define the time step size δ t l t l 1 t l and use superscript l to denote the discretized evaluation at time level t t l then the fully implicit finite volume scheme for 3 reads 11 c h i l 1 h i l 1 h i l t l z i k h h z k h i 1 2 l 1 k h h z k h i 1 2 l 1 s i l 1 z i k h i 1 2 l 1 h i 1 l 1 h i l 1 z i 1 2 1 k h i 1 2 l 1 h i l 1 h i 1 l 1 z i 1 2 1 s i l 1 z i when a fully implicit scheme is use for the temporal discretization its time step size is no longer constrained by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability condition and therefore a larger time step size can reduce the computing time whereas the use of larger time step sizes may cause more truncation error and thus damage the accuracy of simulations to fix this issue we adaptively control the time step size t l by using a switched evolution relaxation method kaushik et al 1999 mulder 1985 to handle the nonlinearity of simulations and meanwhile reduce the computational cost in the proposed adaptively approach we start with a relatively small time step size t 0 and then replace its value with the following strategy 12 t l max 1 α min α β t l 1 l 1 2 where α 1 is used to avoid excessive change of the time step size between any two immediate time steps and the another parameter β is defined by 13 β res l 1 res l γ where 0 γ 1 is a parameter to control the adjustment of the time step size and res l is the euclidean norm of the function arising from the discretization of 11 in the eq 11 when the cell centered approach is applied the hydraulic conductivity function k h is needed to be evaluated half way between adjacent node points in this study for comparisons we apply the following limiters to build the reconstructed states of k h i 1 2 and k h i 1 2 chen et al 2006 chen 2007 lai and ogden 2015 arithmetic limiter 14 k h i 1 2 k h i k h i 1 2 geometric limiter 15 k h i 1 2 k h i k h i 1 harmonic limiter 16 k h i 1 2 2 k h i k h i 1 k h i k h i 1 note that the use of appropriate limiters is crucial to guarantee the stability of the finite volume discretization which can usually be achieved by reconstructing the states at the cell wall some comparison results among using these different limiters will be also shown later in the paper remark 1 although the mathematical model and its fully implicit discretizations as mentioned above are introduced to solve the one dimensional flow problem the general methodology is applicable to the two and three dimensional variably saturated soil water flows in a similar way hence several numerical results pertaining to the problems in one two and three dimensions are presented to illustrate the overall performance of the fully implicit method in section 4 3 inexact newton solver with domain decomposition preconditioners after the fully implicit discretizations of the richards eq 3 in space and time at each time step we obtain a nonlinear system 17 f x 0 where f r n r n is a given nonlinear vector valued function arising from the residuals function in 11 given by f f 1 f 2 f n t with f i f i x 1 x 2 x n t and x x 1 x 2 x n t r n 3 1 newton krylov solver in this study the nonlinear system 17 is solved with the inexact newton method with backtracking dembo et al 1982 dennis and schnabel 1996 where the corresponding jacobian system is approximately solved via a krylov subspace method saad 2003 saad and schultz 1986 the framework of the inexact newton method is described in algorithm1 algorithm 1 inexact newton method with backtracking choose an initial guess x 0 r n and set k 0 1 for k 0 1 2 3 until convergence do 2 construct the jacobian matrix f x k 3 compute the inexact newton direction d k such that 18 f x k d k f x k max η r f x k η a where the parameters η r 0 1 and η a 0 1 are the relative and absolute tolerances respectively 4 determine a step size λ k 0 1 by the standard cubic line search algorithm eisenstat and walker 1996 to satisfy f x k λ k d k 1 σ λ k f x k where σ is a constant to assure that the reduction of f x k is sufficient 5 compute a new approximate solution x k 1 x k λ k d k 6 end for in algorithm1 a search direction is first obtained by solving inexactly the jacobian system 18 and then followed by computing the next approximate solution along this search direction at each newton step the jacobian system is solved inexactly by using a krylov subspace method with a linear preconditioner and therefore the estimate of the jacobian matrix is needed in the study we use the multi colored finite difference mcfd method coleman and moré 1983 to calculate the matrix explicitly in the mcfd method the numerical differentiation procedure needs to evaluate f x at certain points repeatedly so that the jacobian matrix can be approximately calculated i e 19 f x i j f i x e j f i x where is a positive real number satisfying 1 and e j r n is the vector with value 1 at the j th position and value 0 at all other positions the parameters η r 0 1 and η a 0 1 in 18 are respectively the relative tolerance and absolute tolerance which are used to determine how accurately the jacobian linear system needs to be solved the newton iteration remains valid until the following convergence criterion is satisfied 20 f x k 1 max ε r f x 0 ε a where ε r ε a is the relative absolute solver tolerance for the newton iteration respectively we remark that the proposed inexact newton method is reduced to the classical exact newton method if the two parameters η r η a are sufficiently small 3 2 domain decomposition based preconditioner in the above newton method an inexact newton direction d k is calculated by approximately solving the linear system 18 when the direct linear methods are used for the solution of this linear system it is expensive in terms of the total compute time and the memory consumption and therefore iterative methods such as the family of krylov subspace methods become more attractive saad 2003 saad and schultz 1986 here the generalized minimal residual gmres method as a practical krylov subspace algorithm is adopted for solving the corresponding jacobian system 18 in the nonlinear system moreover since the system 18 is ill conditioned an unacceptably large amount of krylov linear iterations are often demanded to achieve the convergence to make matters worse the condition of convergence under some circumstances can not even be satisfied and it could lead to the failure of outer newton iterations to deal with this issue the linear preconditioners could be applied to precondition the jacobian system for the acceleration of krylov iterations to be more precise for the solution of linear systems of equations ax b the linear preconditioning technique takes the following two steps to recast the original linear problem 21 am 1 y b y mx where one uses the linear preconditioner m 1 to transform the solution of the original linear problem x and then solves for the preconditioned solution y r n with the application of the krylov method in parallel computing the family of overlapping additive schwarz as based domain decomposition preconditioners smith et al 1996 toselli and widlund 2005 is the key to the success of the linear solver since it can help to improve the convergence and meanwhile is beneficial to the scalability of the linear solver to define the domain decomposition preconditioner m 1 in 21 we first divide the computation domain ω into n p nonoverlapping subdomains ω i for i 1 2 n p then within ω each ω i is expanded by δ layers of mesh cells to an overlapping one ω i δ i e ω i 1 n p ω p δ as shown in fig 2 in each overlapping subdomain we define a local subdomain matrix a i by restricting the global matrix a to ω i δ 22 a i r i δ a r i δ t where r i δ is a restriction operator that restricts a global vector defined in ω to a local vector in ω i δ by discarding all components in ω ω i δ and r i δ t is a prolongation operator which prolongates a local vector defined in ω i δ to a global vector in ω by putting zeros at all components outside ω i δ then the classical overlapping additive schwarz as smith et al 1996 toselli and widlund 2005 preconditioner for a linear algebraic system with the global jacobian matrix a is defined as 23 m δ δ 1 i 1 n p r i δ t a i 1 r i δ where n p is the number of subdomains which is the same as the number of processors the restricted additive schwarz ras method which is a modification of the additive schwarz method proposed by cai and sarkis in cai et al 2003 cai and sarkis 1999 is proposed to further save communication and obtain better convergence the first version is the left restricted additive schwarz left ras cai and sarkis 1999 method defined as follows 24 m 0 δ 1 i 1 n p r i 0 t a i 1 r i δ and the other modification to the original method is the right restricted additive schwarz right ras cai et al 2003 25 m δ 0 1 i 1 n p r i δ t a i 1 r i 0 where r i 0 ignores all entries outside ω i when doing extension and r i 0 t puts zeros not only outside ω i δ but also ω i as shown in fig 2 in the restrict additive schwarz preconditioners 24 and 25 the operator r i δ is replaced by r i 0 as a result the corresponding part of the computation will not require any communication because the image of r i 0 does not overlap so the communication is reduced and this may result in less overall convergence time and will have some potential advantages for parallel computing some numerical results will be shown later to compare the performance of these additive schwarz preconditioners in details 4 numerical experiments in this section we implement the new fully implicit algorithm using the portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation petsc library balay et al 2019 with a variety of test cases in the numerical tests we focus on a validating the numerical accuracy of the fully implicit solver with respect to the numerical order of convergence b studying the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for both standard benchmarks and realistic problems c comparing the performance of different limiters to calculate the conductivity and the effect of using the adaptively approach and d analyzing the parallel performance of the proposed method with different parameters as shown in section 3 in the proposed parallel solver we need set the stopping conditions for the nonlinear and linear iterations for the nonlinear iteration in 20 we set ε a 10 10 and ε r 10 6 as the absolute and relative tolerances respectively for the linear iteration in 18 the linear systems are solved by the schwarz preconditioned gmres method with the absolute and relative tolerances of η r 10 10 and η a 10 6 respectively in the tables of this section the symbol n p denotes the number of processor cores that is the same as the number of subdomains n it stands for the average number of newton iterations per time step l it is the average number of the schwarz preconditioned gmres iterations per newton iteration and time is the total computing time in seconds 4 1 numerical validation we first validate the correctness of the fully implicit solver in terms of temporal and spatial discretization schemes in the test we set the functions c h 1 k h 1 and s 0 in the model problem 3 then a parabolic problem with the analytical solution denoted by case 1 can be obtained on the computational domain is ω 0 π in this case the initial condition is specified as h z 0 sin z and the boundary condition associated to this problem is h 0 then the analytical solution has the form of h z t e t sin z with z t ω 0 t since the analytical solution and the initial condition in this case test are infinitely smooth and therefore we use this property to evaluate the order of the spatial and temporal accuracies as shown in table 1 and fig 3 a comparison of the errors between the analytical solution and the numerical solution is illustrated here the spatial convergence error is obtained with a fixed time step size t 5 10 6 and the simulation is finished at t 0 1 in the test of the spatial convergence we use the following refined spatial meshes 16 32 64 to 128 we find that the numerical solution is in good agreement with the analytical solution then we further investigate the accuracy of the fully implicit solver in time in the test of the temporal convergence the simulation is performed on a 512 mesh and ends at t 0 1 with the following time step sizes 10 3 5 10 4 2 5 10 4 and 1 25 10 4 we can see that the order of the temporal accuracy is approximately consistent with the ideal first order line when the time step size becomes finer we further validate the correctness of the proposed domain decomposition method for the two dimensional test case case 2 defined on the computational domain ω 0 1 0 1 in this test case we similarly set the functions c h 1 and k h 1 in 3 and the right hand forcing function is chosen as s x y t e t 1 8 π 2 sin 2 π x sin 2 π y the boundary condition associated to this test case is h 0 and the initial condition is h x y sin 2 π x sin 2 π y then we can obtain an analytical form of the solution as h x y t e t sin 2 π x sin 2 π y fig 4 illustrates the contour of the numerical solution and the error between the exact and numerical solutions in the test the simulation ends at t 1 0 and the computation is performed on a 1024 1024 mesh with the use of 16 processors for the parallel computation which has 1024 1024 1 048 576 degrees of freedom we observe that an accurate solution can be obtained by using the parallel fully implicit solver on a relatively large computing scale 4 2 the realistic test cases in 1d in this subsection we investigate the robustness and the efficiency of the proposed fully implicit method by running several realistic test cases in 1d including a free drainage test and two field infiltration tests in very dry soil in the tests the soil moisture sink term in 3 is set to s 0 and the arithmetic limiter 14 is applied for the spatial discretization unless it is expressly stated the first realistic problem denoted by case 3 is the free drainage test under the gravity effect forsyth et al 1995 lai and ogden 2015 which is conducted by abeele et al 1003 with a 6 m deep lysimeter at the los alamos national laboratory the physical parameters in the van genuchten mualem model as introduced in section 2 are θ r 0 θ s 0 33 ν 1 506 k s 1 04 cm h 1 and τ 0 0143 cm 1 respectively the initial condition corresponding to the free drainage test is specified as h t 0 0 cm for the simulation of case 3 we provide a soil water flux condition v 0 at the top of the computational domain ω 0 600 cm and a pressure head h 0 at the bottom of the spatial domain comparisons between the numerical and experimental results of the water content and the pressure head at 1 4 20 100 days are shown in fig 5 the simulation is performed on a 100 mesh with a fixed time step size t 1 h we compare our simulation result shown as color full lines to the result published by the references caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 forsyth et al 1995 lai and ogden 2015 it is clear that our numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental results we also remark that the proposed fully implicit approach can use much bigger time sizes and meanwhile keep a similar accuracy when compared with the results from the references caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 forsyth et al 1995 lai and ogden 2015 in which a semi implicit scheme is applied for the simulation we further present the results from two large scale infiltration tests which simulate the variably saturated water flows in very dry soil the second test case of this subsection denoted by case 4 is conducted by zadeh et al 2007 in this test four time domain reflectometry tdr probes are equipped at different depths 5 10 15 and 20 cm to measure the soil water content during 24 h the van genuchten mualem model is adopted with the following physical parameters caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 zadeh 2011 θ r 0 062 θ s 0 46 τ 0 037 cm 1 ν 1 67 k s 0 44 cm h 1 respectively the initial pressure head h t 0 2 10 4 cm is used to simulate very dry soil with the initial water content θ t 0 0 063 the boundary condition for the pressure head on the upper side of the computational domain ω 0 60 cm is imposed to h 0 and on the opposite side is imposed to the draining semi infinite condition h z 0 we also use a fixed time step size to t 0 01 h and run the test on a 150 mesh the time evolution of the water content at each of the probed depths is shown in fig 6 to compare the numerical water content with the experimental results in caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 lai and ogden 2015 zadeh 2011 as shown in the figure the proposed algorithm has reasonable agreements with the experimental results and can be successfully used to simulate the unsaturated fluid flows in very dry soil note that in the above two figures the plots with the symbols are the experimental data digitized from lai and ogden 2015 rather than from its numerical results finally the third test case case 5 of this subsection is the large scale infiltration process into a very dry and semi infinite porous medium zadeh 2011 the following soil parameters of the van genuchten mualem model are employed θ r 0 05 θ s 0 33 τ 0 014 cm 1 ν 1 5 k s 12 50 cm day 1 we set the initial pressure head condition to h t 0 10 3 cm the infiltration test is carried out by assuming that the experimental conditions are the dirichlet boundary condition h 0 on the top and the neumann boundary condition h z 0 at the lower end of a semi infinite spatial domain the computational domain is ω 0 40 cm the simulation is carried on a 400 mesh with a fixed time step size t 10 5 day and stopped at different time evolution of the infiltration event the results shown in fig 7 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm perfectly resolves the rapid and abrupt evolution of the simulation while keeping the solver in robustness stability and efficiency 4 3 the realistic test cases in 2d and 3d the aim of this subsection is to show the reliability of the proposed domain decomposition method for solving the flow problems in 2d and 3d we first consider the rainfall event where the boundary condition on the soil surface changes with time by a two dimensional example belfort et al 2013 belfort et al 2013 and compare the numerical results with two realistic test cases the free drainage case and the rainfall case in the test the van genutchen mualem model is used with the parameters θ r 0 θ s 0 33 ν 1 506 k s 0 2496 m day 1 and τ 1 43 m 1 the initial condition is specified as h t 0 0 we assume that the left and right boundaries of the computational domain 0 6 m 0 6 m are h 0 and we set h 0 at the bottom boundary for the free drainage case we provide a zero flux condition on the top boundary then we get a neumann boundary condition h 1 while for the rainfall case a rainfall rate of q 0 03 m day 1 is applied on the top and then a neumann boundary associated with the time term h 1 q k h is obtained in the test the simulation is performed on a 512 512 mesh by using 8 processors the time step size is fixed to δ t 10 3 day and the computation is stopped at t 1 0 day fig 8 illustrates the numerical results of the pressure head with different boundary conditions on the soil surface i e the free drainage and the rainfall cases it is clearly seen that the pressure head is more diffused for the rainfall case moreover we compare numerical behavior of the proposed solver in terms of the nonlinear and linear iterations and the total computing time as shown in table 2 we observe that the difficulty of solving the nonlinear system for the two test cases stays at the same level from the point of view of the iterations and the execution time in the following we consider the infiltration event in sand under time dependent boundary condition with a 3d realistic test problem cockett et al 2018 tracy 2007 including the constant or variable pressure head boundary case in this 3d test the van genutchen mualem model is again used with following physical parameters θ r 0 02 θ s 0 417 ν 1 592 k s 5 03712 m day 1 and τ 13 8 m 1 the initial condition of the dry soil is h t 0 0 3 m the computational domain is 2 m long 2 m wide 2 6 m thick the boundary condition on the bottom side of the domain is imposed to h 1 for the constant pressure head case we provide the pressure head h 0 1 m at the top of the domain for the variable pressure head case the infiltration flux of q 0 03 m day 1 is applied on the top and then a neumann boundary associated with the time term h 1 q k h is obtained no flow boundary conditions are set to other boundaries of the computational domain all the simulations are carried out on a 128 128 128 mesh by using 128 processors and the time step size is fixed to δ t 0 005 day table 3 presents the history of the average number of nonlinear and linear iterations and the computing time for the proposed method at different times we can observe that changes in the number of nonlinear and linear iterations occur slowly and are constrained within relatively small bounds while the computing time increases constantly with the advance of the simulation as expected moreover in fig 9 we present the numerical results of the pressure head with different boundary conditions on the soil surface at different ending times it can be seen that the pressure head on the upper side makes the internal pressure head of the domain gradually increases hence the above numerical results demonstrate that the proposed domain decomposition solver on the parallel computer platform can successfully simulate some 2d and 3d realistic problems where the boundary condition on the soil surface changes with time 4 4 effect of adaptive time stepping in the temporal discretization for the fully implicit algorithm the time step size is no longer restricted by the courant friedrichs lewy stability condition and therefore a large step size can be applied to reduce the computing time we first analyze the behavior of the proposed fully implicit solver when the time step size t is changed by using case 3 and case 4 for the simulation of case 3 we run the test on a 100 mesh and finish it at t 10 h and in case 4 the simulation is stopped at t 5 10 3 h on a 150 mesh the results on the average numbers of nonlinear and linear iterations as well as the total computing time are summarized in table 4 the results in the table clearly indicate that the fully implicit method is unconditionally stable for these time step sizes we also observe that as the time step size t increases the average number of nonlinear and linear iterations become larger whereas the total computing time decreases the behavior is somehow expected for the fully implicit solver in many applications of science and engineering such as the references hwang and cai 2005 kong and cai 2016 wang et al 2015 yang and cai 2014 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows with the help of the adaptive time stepping technique the fully implicit solver can enable difficult time scales to follow the evolution of the dynamical system as described in 12 in the following tests we compare the performance of the proposed solver when the adaptive stepping mechanism is applied or not in our fully implicit solver the adaptivity parameters in 12 and 13 are set to γ 1 5 and α 0 9 respectively for the simulation of case 3 the mesh size is fixed to 100 and the simulation is stopped at t 20 and t 100 day respectively in the adaptive method the initial time step size is initialized t 0 1 h and then adaptively control it by using the mechanism 12 while in the standard method the time step size is fixed to t 1 h in case 4 the simulation is finished at t 7 and t 18 h on a 150 mesh respectively and we set the initial time step size of the adaptive method to be t 0 10 5 h while the time step size is t 10 4 h for the standard method as shown in table 5 the time step size for the adaptive method is far larger than that of the standard method and the total computing time of the adaptive method is also much smaller than that of the standard method we remark that the fully implicit solver with adaptive time stepping has a similar accuracy as the standard method in the proposed adaptive time stepping method the selection of the time step sizes is based on the residual of newton iterations which implies the variation of the flow field between two consecutive time steps if the residual error is large that indicates the flow field changes fast then the time step size should be accordingly reduced for sufficient accuracy and vice versa in fig 10 we show the histories of time step sizes and iterations at each time step when the adaptive time stepping technique is used we observe that as the time step size increases the nonlinear system becomes more difficult to solve which results in the increase of nonlinear and linear iterations per time step from the above tests we conclude that the adaptive time stepping method is a clear winner and shows a robust performance when compared with the classical approach in terms of time step sizes and the total computing time 4 5 effect of different limiters in the spatial discretization in the spatial discretization with the use of finite volume scheme choosing a approximate limiter to calculate the inter cell conductivity k h is also crucial to guarantee the robustness and stability of the fully implicit solver so we compare the numerical results and the performance of the fully implicit solver with different limiters for case 3 and case 4 as introduced in section 2 we use the three different types of limiters i e the arithmetic limiter 14 the geometric limiter 15 and the harmonic limiter 16 for the simulation of case 3 the mesh size is fixed to 100 and the simulation is stopped at t 20 and t 100 day with a fixed time step size t 1 h in case 4 we run the test on a 150 mesh and set the time step size to t 10 4 h the numerical results with the inter cell conductivity calculated by the arithmetic geometric and harmonic average methods are shown in table 6 figs 11 and 12 below we list the observations made from the results 2 for the simulation of case 4 the simulated evolution of the water content during 24 h is shown in fig 12 at different depths 5 10 15 and 20 cm respectively from fig 12 we observe that the performance of using the limiter of the arithmetic average is better than that of using the geometric average in terms of the discretization accuracy and both are better than the harmonic average approach since its failure of simulations we further compare the performance of the fully implicit solver by using two different limiters in table 6 and then observe that the number of nonlinear and linear iterations is insensitive to the limiters it follows that the limiter of the arithmetic average is more applicable to case 4 hence in the following tests the limiters to calculate the inter cell hydraulic conductivity is fixed to the arithmetic limiter 4 6 parallel performance the choice of the preconditioner is extremely critical to the performance of the fully implicit method hence in this subsection we focus on the parallel performance of the schwarz preconditioner by using case 3 including the choice of the preconditioner type the influence of the overlap the scalability and the parallel efficiency we first look at the influence of the selection of linear preconditioner for the solution of linear system in this test we compare our proposed additive schwarz asm preconditioner with the traditional successive over relaxation sor preconditioner and the diagonal scaling jacobi preconditioner saad 2003 moreover we also show the computed results when any preconditioner is not applied denotes by non the simulation is carried on two meshes n 2046 and n 4096 and finished at t 0 25 h with a fixed time step size t 0 01 h as shown in table 7 the performance of the additive schwarz preconditioner is the best in terms of the nonlinear and linear iterations and the total computing time we further investigate the performance of the fully implicit solver with different types of the additive schwarz preconditioners i e the basic as 23 the left ras 24 and the right ras 25 preconditioners the numbers of nonlinear and linear iterations together with the execution time are illustrated in table 8 the results in the table suggest that a suitable choice for the schwarz method is the right ras preconditioner for the compromise between the linear iteration and the total computing time which will be used for the following tests in addition to that the overlapping size δ also influences the performance of the fully implicit solver a larger overlap means more information exchange which leads to more the computing time so it is significant to select an appropriate overlap the numbers of nonlinear and linear iterations together with the execution time are illustrated in table 9 we remark that the additive schwarz preconditioner degenerates into the block jacobi preconditioner when the nonoverlapping subdomain is applied i e δ 0 finally we focus on the scalability of the fully implicit solver including the strong scalability and the weak scalability the definition of the strong scalability is speedup t 1 t 2 where t 1 and t 2 are the computing times obtained by using n p 1 and n p 2 processor cores n p 1 n p 2 respectively moreover we define the efficiency as e f n p 1 t 1 n p 2 t 2 in table 10 we present the computed results with different processor cores for the strong scalability test here the simulations are carried on two meshes n 131072 and n 262144 and finished at t 2 5 10 3 h with a fixed time step size t 10 4 h table 11 presents the results of the weak scalability when the mesh size and the number of processor are increased proportionately hence the simulation starts with a n 8192 mesh for the number of processors n p 1 and ends up with a n 131072 mesh for n p 16 this simulation is also finished at t 2 5 10 3 h with a fixed time step size t 10 4 h we observe from tables 10 and 11 that the proposed solver shows good strong and weak scalabilities in terms of the number of iterations and the computing time 5 conclusions in this paper a fully implicit finite volume scheme and a highly parallel domain decomposition algorithm have been developed for the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows the proposed fully implicit method is derived based on the cell centered approach with a couple of limiters and an adaptive time stepping strategy is successfully incorporated into the scheme to reduce the total compute time at each time step the nonlinear system arising from the discretization of the flow problem is solved by the newton krylov framework with several types of domain decomposition based preconditioners numerical results for a number of test cases have shown that the proposed algorithm obtains a good agreement with a reference solution we have also studied the robustness and scalability of the domain decomposition algorithm with respect to the number of processors the mesh size the

5800,the growing complexity of geometric models for the simulation of subsurface flows leads to the necessity of using the fully implicit method due to its unconditionally stability with the relaxation of the time step size in the paper we introduce and study a parallel and scalable fully implicit solver for the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows in the proposed approach the flow problem is discretized in space and time based on a fully implicit cell centered finite volume scheme where several different limiters are applied to guarantee the accuracy of the spatial discretization and an adaptive time stepping technique for the temporal integration is designed to accelerate the simulation progress and then the resultant nonlinear algebraic system arising from the discretization of the variably saturated soil water flows is solved by a family of newton krylov methods under the domain decomposition framework numerical experiments on several standard benchmark tests are used to validate the stability of the fully implicit scheme with large time steps and to examine the performance of the proposed domain decomposition solver on a parallel computer platform keywords richard equation fully implicit scheme domain decomposition additive schwarz preconditioner parallel computing 1 introduction prediction of water movements in variably saturated soil is currently of critical importance for many applications of sciences and engineering such as water resources petroleum reservoirs multiphase flow models bioenvironmental processes and so on chen et al 2006 drever 2005 firoozabadi 1999 hajibeygi and jenny 2009 oleson et al 2013 zadeh 2006 the extensive growing demand on describing understanding and predicting the dynamics of the systems with varying degree of complexity has produced persistent requirements on developing state of the art process based mathematical models and simulators with enhanced prediction capabilities chen 2007 falgout et al 2006 hundsdorfer and verwer 2013 leveque 2002 sobol 2015 wesseling 2009 mathematical modeling of variably saturated soil water flows usually results in systems of time dependent nonlinear partial dierential equations pdes due to its highly nonlinear behaviour arising from the complexity of relevant physical chemical and biological flow processes in the geological media high resolution simulations with advanced numerical methods are crucial to improve the representation of this intricate problem in the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows many attentions have been paid by using explicit or semi implicit methods to overcome the highly nonlinearity of the flow problem berardi et al 2018 kirkland et al 1992 lai and ogden 2015 misiats and lipnikov 2013 ogden et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 in which the original nonlinear problem is transformed into a linear system under the framework of semi implicit approaches or a pure iterative system with the use of explicit methods these schemes are easy to implement and shown to be efficient and reliable for the solution of this mathematical model however in virtue of the natural endowment of its explicitly the explicit or semi implicit method follows the stability restriction imposed by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition and often requires the use of a small time step size to obtain a physical meaningful solution as the high computational complexity for accurate predictions of costly projects when very fine spatial meshes are used in the high resolution simulation the time step size has to be very small in order to satisfy the cfl condition which in turn makes the solution very time consuming and therefore severely constrains application of these approaches to large scale simulations compared with explicit and semi implicit schemes the fully implicit algorithm depends only on the accuracy requirement of the simulation and can relax the stability requirement on the time step size which provides a consistent and robust way to solve the large scale nonlinear problem for long term simulations in the recent years fully implicit methods have recently been successfully applied to several classes of important applications hwang and cai 2005 knoll and keyes 2004 kong and cai 2016 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in particular the approach can be combined with some suitable time adaptivity strategies huang et al 2015 rosam et al 2007 yang and cai 2014 yang et al 2017 yang et al 2016 to study the long term behaviour of the simulation which leads to substantial reduction of the total computing time and thus extensively widens the scope of this interesting method a key to the success of a fully implicit time stepping method is the solution of a nonlinear algebraic system at every time step which remains challenging and important to obtain robust and scalable solvers for large scale simulations in general the family of inexact newton algorithm is a potential good choice based on the face that it is general purpose and has stronger portability to transplant modify service and upgrade particularly the newton type methods have a rapid local convergence rate under certain conditions dembo et al 1982 dennis and schnabel 1996 in this work we propose and study a highly parallel solver based on the framework of newton krylov type algorithms brune et al 2015 cai et al 1998 cai and keyes 2002 kaushik et al 1999 knoll and keyes 2004 yang and cai 2011 to guarantee the nonlinear consistency in the proposed parallel framework an inexact newton method with backtracking is the basic nonlinear iteration and a krylov subspace iterative method is applied as the linear solver at each newton step the success of the overall newton krylov solver depends heavily on substantially reducing the condition number of the corresponding linear system which signifies the urgent demand of preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of nonlinear and linear iterations hence the main focus of this work is on the design of some efficient overlapping additive schwarz type domain decomposition methods to build the preconditioner smith et al 1996 toselli and widlund 2005 the domain decomposition method which follows the nature of divide and conquer techniques is to transform the original problem into more sub problems of the same or related type and hence can perfectly match the fundamental characteristic of the massively parallel computing it has been applied successfully to solve difficult nonlinear problems in a variety of applications on high performance computing platforms brune et al 2015 hwang and cai 2005 knoll and keyes 2004 liu et al 2018 prudencio and cai 2007 yang and cai 2011 in particular with the appearance of the restricted version of domain decomposition methods proposed by cai and sarkis in cai et al 2003 cai and sarkis 1999 it can take evasive action on the communication among the sub problems and result in less overall convergence time and further improve the performance of the domain decomposition preconditioner in this work to take advantage of modern supercomputers for large scale simulations we propose and develop the overlapping restricted additive schwarz preconditioner for solving discrete systems that come from fully implicit discretizations by using these strategies our experiments show that the proposed fully implicit solver based on the newton krylov algorithm and the domain decomposition technique is efficient robust and scalable on a supercomputer platform for high fidelity simulations on supercomputers the accuracy robustness and scalability of the parallel solver with respect to the number of processors are critically important there are several issues we address in this paper including a the accuracy determined mainly by the fully implicit discretization b the independent robustness characterized mainly in terms of linear and nonlinear iterations by the newton krylov method and c the strong and weak scalabilities of the solver by means of the total compute time with the use of the domain decomposition technique we would like to point out that without the condition a it is usually meaningless to obtain the condition b or c moreover even though the condition a holds the other two conditions may still not possible since both b and c depend on the algorithms and the software implementation among other factors as a result although the three basic elements are all well understood individually the construction of the parallel solver framework to obtain the best combination remains a challenge hence for a given class of problems and computing platform a special combination is necessarily studied in order to obtain the best performance which is the main goal of this paper in addition to that as far as we known limited research has been conducted to apply the restricted schwarz preconditioning technique for the fully implicit simulation of variably saturated soil water flow problems the outline of the paper is as follows in section 2 we introduce the governing equation of variably saturated soil water flows both the finite volume method with different limiters and the fully implicit scheme with an adaptive time stepping strategy are provided for the spatial and temporal discretizations respectively in section 3 we present a class of inexact newton solvers with domain decomposition preconditioners to solve the resultant nonlinear systems we show numerical results for some benchmark problems in section 4 to demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the proposed method the paper is concluded in section 5 2 mathematical model and discretizations with the combination of the darcy s law and the mass conservation the flow of fluids in variably saturated soil water where the gravity and the fluid pressure gradient produce the motion can be described by the richards equation re chen et al 2006 chen 2007 firoozabadi 1999 leveque 2002 zadeh et al 2007 1 θ t k h h k h z s where θ is the volumetric water content l 3 l 3 h is the pressure head l k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 s is the soil moisture sink term l 3 l 3 t 1 z is the depth assumed positive downward l and t is the time t the eq 1 is known as the mixed form of the richards equation lai and ogden 2015 zadeh 2011 with the help of the specific capacity function 2 c h θ h which denotes the rate of change of the fluid content of the medium the fluid pressure head based h based form caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 celia et al 1990 zadeh 2011 of 1 can be defined as follows 3 c h h t k h h k h z s for the solution of the richards equation the relationships of the hydraulic properties are needed to describe the hydraulic conductivity and fluid content versus fluid pressure head in this study the van genuchten mualem model genuchten 1980 is used to represent these properties the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is given as k h k s k r h with 4 k r s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 μ μ 2 where the parameter k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and k r is the relative permeability the effective saturation s e 0 s e 1 is defined as 5 s e θ θ θ r θ s θ r θ θ r θ s θ r 1 τ h ν μ where θ r is the residual water content l 3 l 3 of the media θ s is the saturated water content l 3 l 3 τ is the inverse of the air entry value l 1 and μ ν are empirical constants that relate to pore size distribution with μ 1 1 ν substituting 5 into the specific capacity function 2 then we have 6 c h τ μ ν θ s θ r τ h ν 1 1 τ h ν μ 1 let ω be the computational domain with the lipschitz boundary γ suppose the boundary of the computational domain ω is composed of two parts γ γ d γ n with γ d γ n then the boundary conditions associated to 3 are 7 h h d on γ d v n h n on γ n where v k h h z 1 is the soil water flux the system 3 and 7 is closed by the initial condition for the pressure solution as follows 8 h t 0 h 0 in ω in this study we employ a cell centered finite volume method caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 eymard et al 1999 leveque 2002 to discretize the model equation for the spatial terms and the implicit first order scheme backward euler celia et al 1990 with an adaptive time stepping technique rosam et al 2007 is used for the temporal integration here we take the numerical solution based on the one dimensional domain for example let the computational domain ω be covered with the mesh cell ω i z i 1 2 z i 1 2 i 1 2 n in the numerical simulation the unknown pressure head h i and the specific moisture capacity c h i are placed in the central point of mesh z i z i 1 2 z i 1 2 while the unknown soil water hydraulic conductivity k h i 1 2 is defined at the interface of two adjacent cells as shown in fig 1 taking the integral over the cell ω i for the eq 3 we obtain 9 ω i c h h t dz ω i z k h h z k h dz ω i s dz we define the cell averaged pressure h i at time t as h i 1 ω i ω i hdz and use the first order approximation for the specific capacity function c h c h i then the semi discrete system can be obtained by applying green s theorem as follows 10 c h i h t z i k h h z k h i 1 2 k h h z k h i 1 2 s i z i where the mesh sizes z i 1 2 z i 1 z i and z i 1 2 z i z i 1 to get a fully discretized system we adopt the implicit backward euler scheme with adaptive time stepping for the temporal integration for a given time stepping sequence 0 t 0 t 1 t 2 define the time step size δ t l t l 1 t l and use superscript l to denote the discretized evaluation at time level t t l then the fully implicit finite volume scheme for 3 reads 11 c h i l 1 h i l 1 h i l t l z i k h h z k h i 1 2 l 1 k h h z k h i 1 2 l 1 s i l 1 z i k h i 1 2 l 1 h i 1 l 1 h i l 1 z i 1 2 1 k h i 1 2 l 1 h i l 1 h i 1 l 1 z i 1 2 1 s i l 1 z i when a fully implicit scheme is use for the temporal discretization its time step size is no longer constrained by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability condition and therefore a larger time step size can reduce the computing time whereas the use of larger time step sizes may cause more truncation error and thus damage the accuracy of simulations to fix this issue we adaptively control the time step size t l by using a switched evolution relaxation method kaushik et al 1999 mulder 1985 to handle the nonlinearity of simulations and meanwhile reduce the computational cost in the proposed adaptively approach we start with a relatively small time step size t 0 and then replace its value with the following strategy 12 t l max 1 α min α β t l 1 l 1 2 where α 1 is used to avoid excessive change of the time step size between any two immediate time steps and the another parameter β is defined by 13 β res l 1 res l γ where 0 γ 1 is a parameter to control the adjustment of the time step size and res l is the euclidean norm of the function arising from the discretization of 11 in the eq 11 when the cell centered approach is applied the hydraulic conductivity function k h is needed to be evaluated half way between adjacent node points in this study for comparisons we apply the following limiters to build the reconstructed states of k h i 1 2 and k h i 1 2 chen et al 2006 chen 2007 lai and ogden 2015 arithmetic limiter 14 k h i 1 2 k h i k h i 1 2 geometric limiter 15 k h i 1 2 k h i k h i 1 harmonic limiter 16 k h i 1 2 2 k h i k h i 1 k h i k h i 1 note that the use of appropriate limiters is crucial to guarantee the stability of the finite volume discretization which can usually be achieved by reconstructing the states at the cell wall some comparison results among using these different limiters will be also shown later in the paper remark 1 although the mathematical model and its fully implicit discretizations as mentioned above are introduced to solve the one dimensional flow problem the general methodology is applicable to the two and three dimensional variably saturated soil water flows in a similar way hence several numerical results pertaining to the problems in one two and three dimensions are presented to illustrate the overall performance of the fully implicit method in section 4 3 inexact newton solver with domain decomposition preconditioners after the fully implicit discretizations of the richards eq 3 in space and time at each time step we obtain a nonlinear system 17 f x 0 where f r n r n is a given nonlinear vector valued function arising from the residuals function in 11 given by f f 1 f 2 f n t with f i f i x 1 x 2 x n t and x x 1 x 2 x n t r n 3 1 newton krylov solver in this study the nonlinear system 17 is solved with the inexact newton method with backtracking dembo et al 1982 dennis and schnabel 1996 where the corresponding jacobian system is approximately solved via a krylov subspace method saad 2003 saad and schultz 1986 the framework of the inexact newton method is described in algorithm1 algorithm 1 inexact newton method with backtracking choose an initial guess x 0 r n and set k 0 1 for k 0 1 2 3 until convergence do 2 construct the jacobian matrix f x k 3 compute the inexact newton direction d k such that 18 f x k d k f x k max η r f x k η a where the parameters η r 0 1 and η a 0 1 are the relative and absolute tolerances respectively 4 determine a step size λ k 0 1 by the standard cubic line search algorithm eisenstat and walker 1996 to satisfy f x k λ k d k 1 σ λ k f x k where σ is a constant to assure that the reduction of f x k is sufficient 5 compute a new approximate solution x k 1 x k λ k d k 6 end for in algorithm1 a search direction is first obtained by solving inexactly the jacobian system 18 and then followed by computing the next approximate solution along this search direction at each newton step the jacobian system is solved inexactly by using a krylov subspace method with a linear preconditioner and therefore the estimate of the jacobian matrix is needed in the study we use the multi colored finite difference mcfd method coleman and moré 1983 to calculate the matrix explicitly in the mcfd method the numerical differentiation procedure needs to evaluate f x at certain points repeatedly so that the jacobian matrix can be approximately calculated i e 19 f x i j f i x e j f i x where is a positive real number satisfying 1 and e j r n is the vector with value 1 at the j th position and value 0 at all other positions the parameters η r 0 1 and η a 0 1 in 18 are respectively the relative tolerance and absolute tolerance which are used to determine how accurately the jacobian linear system needs to be solved the newton iteration remains valid until the following convergence criterion is satisfied 20 f x k 1 max ε r f x 0 ε a where ε r ε a is the relative absolute solver tolerance for the newton iteration respectively we remark that the proposed inexact newton method is reduced to the classical exact newton method if the two parameters η r η a are sufficiently small 3 2 domain decomposition based preconditioner in the above newton method an inexact newton direction d k is calculated by approximately solving the linear system 18 when the direct linear methods are used for the solution of this linear system it is expensive in terms of the total compute time and the memory consumption and therefore iterative methods such as the family of krylov subspace methods become more attractive saad 2003 saad and schultz 1986 here the generalized minimal residual gmres method as a practical krylov subspace algorithm is adopted for solving the corresponding jacobian system 18 in the nonlinear system moreover since the system 18 is ill conditioned an unacceptably large amount of krylov linear iterations are often demanded to achieve the convergence to make matters worse the condition of convergence under some circumstances can not even be satisfied and it could lead to the failure of outer newton iterations to deal with this issue the linear preconditioners could be applied to precondition the jacobian system for the acceleration of krylov iterations to be more precise for the solution of linear systems of equations ax b the linear preconditioning technique takes the following two steps to recast the original linear problem 21 am 1 y b y mx where one uses the linear preconditioner m 1 to transform the solution of the original linear problem x and then solves for the preconditioned solution y r n with the application of the krylov method in parallel computing the family of overlapping additive schwarz as based domain decomposition preconditioners smith et al 1996 toselli and widlund 2005 is the key to the success of the linear solver since it can help to improve the convergence and meanwhile is beneficial to the scalability of the linear solver to define the domain decomposition preconditioner m 1 in 21 we first divide the computation domain ω into n p nonoverlapping subdomains ω i for i 1 2 n p then within ω each ω i is expanded by δ layers of mesh cells to an overlapping one ω i δ i e ω i 1 n p ω p δ as shown in fig 2 in each overlapping subdomain we define a local subdomain matrix a i by restricting the global matrix a to ω i δ 22 a i r i δ a r i δ t where r i δ is a restriction operator that restricts a global vector defined in ω to a local vector in ω i δ by discarding all components in ω ω i δ and r i δ t is a prolongation operator which prolongates a local vector defined in ω i δ to a global vector in ω by putting zeros at all components outside ω i δ then the classical overlapping additive schwarz as smith et al 1996 toselli and widlund 2005 preconditioner for a linear algebraic system with the global jacobian matrix a is defined as 23 m δ δ 1 i 1 n p r i δ t a i 1 r i δ where n p is the number of subdomains which is the same as the number of processors the restricted additive schwarz ras method which is a modification of the additive schwarz method proposed by cai and sarkis in cai et al 2003 cai and sarkis 1999 is proposed to further save communication and obtain better convergence the first version is the left restricted additive schwarz left ras cai and sarkis 1999 method defined as follows 24 m 0 δ 1 i 1 n p r i 0 t a i 1 r i δ and the other modification to the original method is the right restricted additive schwarz right ras cai et al 2003 25 m δ 0 1 i 1 n p r i δ t a i 1 r i 0 where r i 0 ignores all entries outside ω i when doing extension and r i 0 t puts zeros not only outside ω i δ but also ω i as shown in fig 2 in the restrict additive schwarz preconditioners 24 and 25 the operator r i δ is replaced by r i 0 as a result the corresponding part of the computation will not require any communication because the image of r i 0 does not overlap so the communication is reduced and this may result in less overall convergence time and will have some potential advantages for parallel computing some numerical results will be shown later to compare the performance of these additive schwarz preconditioners in details 4 numerical experiments in this section we implement the new fully implicit algorithm using the portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation petsc library balay et al 2019 with a variety of test cases in the numerical tests we focus on a validating the numerical accuracy of the fully implicit solver with respect to the numerical order of convergence b studying the robustness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for both standard benchmarks and realistic problems c comparing the performance of different limiters to calculate the conductivity and the effect of using the adaptively approach and d analyzing the parallel performance of the proposed method with different parameters as shown in section 3 in the proposed parallel solver we need set the stopping conditions for the nonlinear and linear iterations for the nonlinear iteration in 20 we set ε a 10 10 and ε r 10 6 as the absolute and relative tolerances respectively for the linear iteration in 18 the linear systems are solved by the schwarz preconditioned gmres method with the absolute and relative tolerances of η r 10 10 and η a 10 6 respectively in the tables of this section the symbol n p denotes the number of processor cores that is the same as the number of subdomains n it stands for the average number of newton iterations per time step l it is the average number of the schwarz preconditioned gmres iterations per newton iteration and time is the total computing time in seconds 4 1 numerical validation we first validate the correctness of the fully implicit solver in terms of temporal and spatial discretization schemes in the test we set the functions c h 1 k h 1 and s 0 in the model problem 3 then a parabolic problem with the analytical solution denoted by case 1 can be obtained on the computational domain is ω 0 π in this case the initial condition is specified as h z 0 sin z and the boundary condition associated to this problem is h 0 then the analytical solution has the form of h z t e t sin z with z t ω 0 t since the analytical solution and the initial condition in this case test are infinitely smooth and therefore we use this property to evaluate the order of the spatial and temporal accuracies as shown in table 1 and fig 3 a comparison of the errors between the analytical solution and the numerical solution is illustrated here the spatial convergence error is obtained with a fixed time step size t 5 10 6 and the simulation is finished at t 0 1 in the test of the spatial convergence we use the following refined spatial meshes 16 32 64 to 128 we find that the numerical solution is in good agreement with the analytical solution then we further investigate the accuracy of the fully implicit solver in time in the test of the temporal convergence the simulation is performed on a 512 mesh and ends at t 0 1 with the following time step sizes 10 3 5 10 4 2 5 10 4 and 1 25 10 4 we can see that the order of the temporal accuracy is approximately consistent with the ideal first order line when the time step size becomes finer we further validate the correctness of the proposed domain decomposition method for the two dimensional test case case 2 defined on the computational domain ω 0 1 0 1 in this test case we similarly set the functions c h 1 and k h 1 in 3 and the right hand forcing function is chosen as s x y t e t 1 8 π 2 sin 2 π x sin 2 π y the boundary condition associated to this test case is h 0 and the initial condition is h x y sin 2 π x sin 2 π y then we can obtain an analytical form of the solution as h x y t e t sin 2 π x sin 2 π y fig 4 illustrates the contour of the numerical solution and the error between the exact and numerical solutions in the test the simulation ends at t 1 0 and the computation is performed on a 1024 1024 mesh with the use of 16 processors for the parallel computation which has 1024 1024 1 048 576 degrees of freedom we observe that an accurate solution can be obtained by using the parallel fully implicit solver on a relatively large computing scale 4 2 the realistic test cases in 1d in this subsection we investigate the robustness and the efficiency of the proposed fully implicit method by running several realistic test cases in 1d including a free drainage test and two field infiltration tests in very dry soil in the tests the soil moisture sink term in 3 is set to s 0 and the arithmetic limiter 14 is applied for the spatial discretization unless it is expressly stated the first realistic problem denoted by case 3 is the free drainage test under the gravity effect forsyth et al 1995 lai and ogden 2015 which is conducted by abeele et al 1003 with a 6 m deep lysimeter at the los alamos national laboratory the physical parameters in the van genuchten mualem model as introduced in section 2 are θ r 0 θ s 0 33 ν 1 506 k s 1 04 cm h 1 and τ 0 0143 cm 1 respectively the initial condition corresponding to the free drainage test is specified as h t 0 0 cm for the simulation of case 3 we provide a soil water flux condition v 0 at the top of the computational domain ω 0 600 cm and a pressure head h 0 at the bottom of the spatial domain comparisons between the numerical and experimental results of the water content and the pressure head at 1 4 20 100 days are shown in fig 5 the simulation is performed on a 100 mesh with a fixed time step size t 1 h we compare our simulation result shown as color full lines to the result published by the references caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 forsyth et al 1995 lai and ogden 2015 it is clear that our numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental results we also remark that the proposed fully implicit approach can use much bigger time sizes and meanwhile keep a similar accuracy when compared with the results from the references caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 forsyth et al 1995 lai and ogden 2015 in which a semi implicit scheme is applied for the simulation we further present the results from two large scale infiltration tests which simulate the variably saturated water flows in very dry soil the second test case of this subsection denoted by case 4 is conducted by zadeh et al 2007 in this test four time domain reflectometry tdr probes are equipped at different depths 5 10 15 and 20 cm to measure the soil water content during 24 h the van genuchten mualem model is adopted with the following physical parameters caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 zadeh 2011 θ r 0 062 θ s 0 46 τ 0 037 cm 1 ν 1 67 k s 0 44 cm h 1 respectively the initial pressure head h t 0 2 10 4 cm is used to simulate very dry soil with the initial water content θ t 0 0 063 the boundary condition for the pressure head on the upper side of the computational domain ω 0 60 cm is imposed to h 0 and on the opposite side is imposed to the draining semi infinite condition h z 0 we also use a fixed time step size to t 0 01 h and run the test on a 150 mesh the time evolution of the water content at each of the probed depths is shown in fig 6 to compare the numerical water content with the experimental results in caviedes voulliéme et al 2013 lai and ogden 2015 zadeh 2011 as shown in the figure the proposed algorithm has reasonable agreements with the experimental results and can be successfully used to simulate the unsaturated fluid flows in very dry soil note that in the above two figures the plots with the symbols are the experimental data digitized from lai and ogden 2015 rather than from its numerical results finally the third test case case 5 of this subsection is the large scale infiltration process into a very dry and semi infinite porous medium zadeh 2011 the following soil parameters of the van genuchten mualem model are employed θ r 0 05 θ s 0 33 τ 0 014 cm 1 ν 1 5 k s 12 50 cm day 1 we set the initial pressure head condition to h t 0 10 3 cm the infiltration test is carried out by assuming that the experimental conditions are the dirichlet boundary condition h 0 on the top and the neumann boundary condition h z 0 at the lower end of a semi infinite spatial domain the computational domain is ω 0 40 cm the simulation is carried on a 400 mesh with a fixed time step size t 10 5 day and stopped at different time evolution of the infiltration event the results shown in fig 7 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm perfectly resolves the rapid and abrupt evolution of the simulation while keeping the solver in robustness stability and efficiency 4 3 the realistic test cases in 2d and 3d the aim of this subsection is to show the reliability of the proposed domain decomposition method for solving the flow problems in 2d and 3d we first consider the rainfall event where the boundary condition on the soil surface changes with time by a two dimensional example belfort et al 2013 belfort et al 2013 and compare the numerical results with two realistic test cases the free drainage case and the rainfall case in the test the van genutchen mualem model is used with the parameters θ r 0 θ s 0 33 ν 1 506 k s 0 2496 m day 1 and τ 1 43 m 1 the initial condition is specified as h t 0 0 we assume that the left and right boundaries of the computational domain 0 6 m 0 6 m are h 0 and we set h 0 at the bottom boundary for the free drainage case we provide a zero flux condition on the top boundary then we get a neumann boundary condition h 1 while for the rainfall case a rainfall rate of q 0 03 m day 1 is applied on the top and then a neumann boundary associated with the time term h 1 q k h is obtained in the test the simulation is performed on a 512 512 mesh by using 8 processors the time step size is fixed to δ t 10 3 day and the computation is stopped at t 1 0 day fig 8 illustrates the numerical results of the pressure head with different boundary conditions on the soil surface i e the free drainage and the rainfall cases it is clearly seen that the pressure head is more diffused for the rainfall case moreover we compare numerical behavior of the proposed solver in terms of the nonlinear and linear iterations and the total computing time as shown in table 2 we observe that the difficulty of solving the nonlinear system for the two test cases stays at the same level from the point of view of the iterations and the execution time in the following we consider the infiltration event in sand under time dependent boundary condition with a 3d realistic test problem cockett et al 2018 tracy 2007 including the constant or variable pressure head boundary case in this 3d test the van genutchen mualem model is again used with following physical parameters θ r 0 02 θ s 0 417 ν 1 592 k s 5 03712 m day 1 and τ 13 8 m 1 the initial condition of the dry soil is h t 0 0 3 m the computational domain is 2 m long 2 m wide 2 6 m thick the boundary condition on the bottom side of the domain is imposed to h 1 for the constant pressure head case we provide the pressure head h 0 1 m at the top of the domain for the variable pressure head case the infiltration flux of q 0 03 m day 1 is applied on the top and then a neumann boundary associated with the time term h 1 q k h is obtained no flow boundary conditions are set to other boundaries of the computational domain all the simulations are carried out on a 128 128 128 mesh by using 128 processors and the time step size is fixed to δ t 0 005 day table 3 presents the history of the average number of nonlinear and linear iterations and the computing time for the proposed method at different times we can observe that changes in the number of nonlinear and linear iterations occur slowly and are constrained within relatively small bounds while the computing time increases constantly with the advance of the simulation as expected moreover in fig 9 we present the numerical results of the pressure head with different boundary conditions on the soil surface at different ending times it can be seen that the pressure head on the upper side makes the internal pressure head of the domain gradually increases hence the above numerical results demonstrate that the proposed domain decomposition solver on the parallel computer platform can successfully simulate some 2d and 3d realistic problems where the boundary condition on the soil surface changes with time 4 4 effect of adaptive time stepping in the temporal discretization for the fully implicit algorithm the time step size is no longer restricted by the courant friedrichs lewy stability condition and therefore a large step size can be applied to reduce the computing time we first analyze the behavior of the proposed fully implicit solver when the time step size t is changed by using case 3 and case 4 for the simulation of case 3 we run the test on a 100 mesh and finish it at t 10 h and in case 4 the simulation is stopped at t 5 10 3 h on a 150 mesh the results on the average numbers of nonlinear and linear iterations as well as the total computing time are summarized in table 4 the results in the table clearly indicate that the fully implicit method is unconditionally stable for these time step sizes we also observe that as the time step size t increases the average number of nonlinear and linear iterations become larger whereas the total computing time decreases the behavior is somehow expected for the fully implicit solver in many applications of science and engineering such as the references hwang and cai 2005 kong and cai 2016 wang et al 2015 yang and cai 2014 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 for the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows with the help of the adaptive time stepping technique the fully implicit solver can enable difficult time scales to follow the evolution of the dynamical system as described in 12 in the following tests we compare the performance of the proposed solver when the adaptive stepping mechanism is applied or not in our fully implicit solver the adaptivity parameters in 12 and 13 are set to γ 1 5 and α 0 9 respectively for the simulation of case 3 the mesh size is fixed to 100 and the simulation is stopped at t 20 and t 100 day respectively in the adaptive method the initial time step size is initialized t 0 1 h and then adaptively control it by using the mechanism 12 while in the standard method the time step size is fixed to t 1 h in case 4 the simulation is finished at t 7 and t 18 h on a 150 mesh respectively and we set the initial time step size of the adaptive method to be t 0 10 5 h while the time step size is t 10 4 h for the standard method as shown in table 5 the time step size for the adaptive method is far larger than that of the standard method and the total computing time of the adaptive method is also much smaller than that of the standard method we remark that the fully implicit solver with adaptive time stepping has a similar accuracy as the standard method in the proposed adaptive time stepping method the selection of the time step sizes is based on the residual of newton iterations which implies the variation of the flow field between two consecutive time steps if the residual error is large that indicates the flow field changes fast then the time step size should be accordingly reduced for sufficient accuracy and vice versa in fig 10 we show the histories of time step sizes and iterations at each time step when the adaptive time stepping technique is used we observe that as the time step size increases the nonlinear system becomes more difficult to solve which results in the increase of nonlinear and linear iterations per time step from the above tests we conclude that the adaptive time stepping method is a clear winner and shows a robust performance when compared with the classical approach in terms of time step sizes and the total computing time 4 5 effect of different limiters in the spatial discretization in the spatial discretization with the use of finite volume scheme choosing a approximate limiter to calculate the inter cell conductivity k h is also crucial to guarantee the robustness and stability of the fully implicit solver so we compare the numerical results and the performance of the fully implicit solver with different limiters for case 3 and case 4 as introduced in section 2 we use the three different types of limiters i e the arithmetic limiter 14 the geometric limiter 15 and the harmonic limiter 16 for the simulation of case 3 the mesh size is fixed to 100 and the simulation is stopped at t 20 and t 100 day with a fixed time step size t 1 h in case 4 we run the test on a 150 mesh and set the time step size to t 10 4 h the numerical results with the inter cell conductivity calculated by the arithmetic geometric and harmonic average methods are shown in table 6 figs 11 and 12 below we list the observations made from the results 2 for the simulation of case 4 the simulated evolution of the water content during 24 h is shown in fig 12 at different depths 5 10 15 and 20 cm respectively from fig 12 we observe that the performance of using the limiter of the arithmetic average is better than that of using the geometric average in terms of the discretization accuracy and both are better than the harmonic average approach since its failure of simulations we further compare the performance of the fully implicit solver by using two different limiters in table 6 and then observe that the number of nonlinear and linear iterations is insensitive to the limiters it follows that the limiter of the arithmetic average is more applicable to case 4 hence in the following tests the limiters to calculate the inter cell hydraulic conductivity is fixed to the arithmetic limiter 4 6 parallel performance the choice of the preconditioner is extremely critical to the performance of the fully implicit method hence in this subsection we focus on the parallel performance of the schwarz preconditioner by using case 3 including the choice of the preconditioner type the influence of the overlap the scalability and the parallel efficiency we first look at the influence of the selection of linear preconditioner for the solution of linear system in this test we compare our proposed additive schwarz asm preconditioner with the traditional successive over relaxation sor preconditioner and the diagonal scaling jacobi preconditioner saad 2003 moreover we also show the computed results when any preconditioner is not applied denotes by non the simulation is carried on two meshes n 2046 and n 4096 and finished at t 0 25 h with a fixed time step size t 0 01 h as shown in table 7 the performance of the additive schwarz preconditioner is the best in terms of the nonlinear and linear iterations and the total computing time we further investigate the performance of the fully implicit solver with different types of the additive schwarz preconditioners i e the basic as 23 the left ras 24 and the right ras 25 preconditioners the numbers of nonlinear and linear iterations together with the execution time are illustrated in table 8 the results in the table suggest that a suitable choice for the schwarz method is the right ras preconditioner for the compromise between the linear iteration and the total computing time which will be used for the following tests in addition to that the overlapping size δ also influences the performance of the fully implicit solver a larger overlap means more information exchange which leads to more the computing time so it is significant to select an appropriate overlap the numbers of nonlinear and linear iterations together with the execution time are illustrated in table 9 we remark that the additive schwarz preconditioner degenerates into the block jacobi preconditioner when the nonoverlapping subdomain is applied i e δ 0 finally we focus on the scalability of the fully implicit solver including the strong scalability and the weak scalability the definition of the strong scalability is speedup t 1 t 2 where t 1 and t 2 are the computing times obtained by using n p 1 and n p 2 processor cores n p 1 n p 2 respectively moreover we define the efficiency as e f n p 1 t 1 n p 2 t 2 in table 10 we present the computed results with different processor cores for the strong scalability test here the simulations are carried on two meshes n 131072 and n 262144 and finished at t 2 5 10 3 h with a fixed time step size t 10 4 h table 11 presents the results of the weak scalability when the mesh size and the number of processor are increased proportionately hence the simulation starts with a n 8192 mesh for the number of processors n p 1 and ends up with a n 131072 mesh for n p 16 this simulation is also finished at t 2 5 10 3 h with a fixed time step size t 10 4 h we observe from tables 10 and 11 that the proposed solver shows good strong and weak scalabilities in terms of the number of iterations and the computing time 5 conclusions in this paper a fully implicit finite volume scheme and a highly parallel domain decomposition algorithm have been developed for the simulation of variably saturated soil water flows the proposed fully implicit method is derived based on the cell centered approach with a couple of limiters and an adaptive time stepping strategy is successfully incorporated into the scheme to reduce the total compute time at each time step the nonlinear system arising from the discretization of the flow problem is solved by the newton krylov framework with several types of domain decomposition based preconditioners numerical results for a number of test cases have shown that the proposed algorithm obtains a good agreement with a reference solution we have also studied the robustness and scalability of the domain decomposition algorithm with respect to the number of processors the mesh size the subdomain overlap and the time step size our future research includes the extension of the schwarz methods to simulate multiphase and multidimensional flow problems declaration of competing interest

5801,this paper presents a systematic analysis of the influence of nine urban characteristics distance between buildings mean building size building coverage etc on surface flow in case of pluvial flooding time dependent stored volumes outflow discharges and mean water depths were computed for a set of 2000 synthetic urban forms considering various terrain slopes and return periods of the rainfall an efficient porosity based surface flow model was used to compute the 2d flow variables statistical analysis of the relationship between the flow and urban variables highlights that the flooding severity is mostly influenced by the building coverage keywords urban pluvial flood porosity shallow water model procedural modelling 1 introduction worldwide urban flooding induces a broad range of damage to people infrastructure and economy e g huang et al 2017 yin et al 2016 kreibich et al 2019 urban flood risk is growing as a result of rapid urbanization and increasingly frequent hydroclimatic extremes zhou et al 2012 chen et al 2015 muis et al 2015 yin et al 2015 miller and hutchins 2017 a major cause of flooding in inland urban areas is pluvial floods induced by heavy rainfall events gaines 2016 existing research on urban pluvial flooding has covered a broad range of aspects including spatio temporal precipitation data rainfall runoff modelling risk management and impact analysis of climate and land use change 1 1 existing data and models hydrological modelling of urban catchments remains particularly challenging due to i limitations in data availability ii specific flow processes such as the interactions between surface flow and urban drainage systems iii as well as the spatial heterogeneity of urban features influencing runoff leandro et al 2009 salvadore et al 2015 in early studies the urban surface water runoff originating from point sources such as manholes has been simulated with 2d surface flow routing models either based on the full 2d shallow water equations mignot et al 2006 martins et al 2017 or on simplified versions such as inertial formulation e g fewtrell et al 2011 other research applied sequentially a 1d model for the urban drainage system and a 2d model for surface flow routing the outcome of the urban drainage model consists in hydrographs of surcharged flow i e excess flow compared to the design discharge of each pipe section used as an input for the 2d surface flow routing model based on this approach and a 2d diffusive surface flow model hsu et al 2000 simulated inundation in urban areas caused by the surcharge of storm sewers and considering the influence of pumping stations nonetheless even in this approach two way interactions between the surface flow and the urban drainage system are not reproduced explicitly in contrast dual drainage modelling consists in coupling a 1d flow routing model for the urban drainage system and a 2d surface flow routing model schmitt et al 2004 djordjević et al 2005 chen et al 2007 seyoum et al 2012 löwe et al 2017 the bidirectional interactions between the two models are ensured through sink and source terms in the respective model equations these terms are evaluated from weir or orifice formulae bazin et al 2014 in so called hydro inundation models precipitation is incorporated as a source term in the 2d surface flow routing model and this model contains an explicit representation of hydrological processes such as infiltration cea et al 2010 yu and coulthard 2015 leandro et al 2016 löwe et al 2017 and evaporation yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 2019 to replace the total rainfall by the effective rainfall while in conventional approaches catchment modelling and floodplain modelling are two successive steps in hydro inundation models they are merged into a single computation in several studies dual drainage and hydro inundation features were combined hsu et al 2000 schmitt et al 2004 leandro et al 2016 in contrast others opted for a simplified description of the urban drainage system such as assuming that water is drained away at the design capacity without explicit representation of drains and manholes yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 2019 or even neglected the urban drainage system huang et al 2017 in existing dual drainage and hydro inundation models so far the surface flow was represented using non inertia 2d flow models the broad range of developed models has proved valuable to support urban flood risk management as well as for the planning and management of urban drainage systems fletcher et al 2013 they have been used in various settings including for evaluating the impact of flooding on traffic disruption yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 2019 for urban flood forecasting chen et al 2015 for assessing pluvial flood risk at the local level elboshy et al 2019 among other applications 1 2 influence of urban planning on urban pluvial flooding many recent studies have investigated the sustainable management of urban storm water based on low impact development lid techniques i e seeking to mimic a site s pre development hydrology such as tanks swale green roof or permeable pavement qin et al 2013 ahiablame and shakya 2016 chen et al 2017 others analysed the impacts of urbanization on urban pluvial flooding for instance based on a hydro inundation model huang et al 2017 and miller and hutchins 2017 highlighted that land use and land cover changes substantially contribute to increase pluvial flooding in urban areas especially for extreme rainfall events however a more limited attention has been paid so far to the specific influence of urban planning policies on urban pluvial flooding in this regard only a study carried out by löwe et al 2017 stands out for an urban catchment of 300 ha in australia they coupled a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model with an urban development model they tested nine different urban development scenarios characterized by contrasting levels of demand for housing type and location of buildings uncontrolled urban sprawl involving detached single unit houses vs more compact urban forms with multi storey buildings and apartment blocks as well as flood adaptation options buyback of properties rainwater harvesting increased stormwater pipe capacity their results suggest that compared to the increase of urban drainage capacity urban planning policies are more efficient to reduce flood risk under various climate change scenarios nonetheless even löwe et al 2017 paid only limited attention to the role paid by the urban form on the severity of urban pluvial flooding whereas geometry and arrangement of buildings alter the surface flow preferential directions as they represent obstacles to the flow leandro et al 2016 additionally existing research focused on individual real world case studies and not on more generic configurations and previous analyses remained generally at the level of the land use category e g residential industrial vs green space not at the building level therefore in this paper we aim to understand whether the geometric characteristics of the arrangement of buildings also called urban pattern influence surface flow during urban pluvial flooding more specifically using regression and correlation analyses we have been searching for possible relationships between indicators of the severity of urban flooding stored volume inundation depth outflow discharge and geometric parameters characterizing the urban patterns typical street width length curvature and orientation building size and distances between buildings to do so we performed a systematic analysis by considering 2000 synthetic but realistic urban forms obtained from a procedural urban generation model for each of them we computed the surface flow variables corresponding to three different design rainfalls 15 50 and 100 year return periods the terrain slope was also varied resulting in a total of 12 000 distinct simulations this analysis is an extension of the procedure recently developed by bruwier et al 2018 for the case of river flooding to perform the high number of necessary model runs we used an efficient hydro inundation model developed in house it is based on a validated integral porosity shallow water model solving the fully dynamic shallow water equations for surface flow bruwier et al 2017a a simplified approach is used to represent the urban drainage system which is deemed justified here since the focus is set on comparing the influence on surface flow of the geometric parameters characterizing the urban patterns the methodology detailed in section 2 includes the generation of synthetic urban forms with a procedural model section 2 1 a brief presentation of the hydro inundation model section 2 2 and the statistical approach used to determine the impact of urban parameters on pluvial flow section 2 3 computed flow variables and their relationships with the urban characteristics are presented and discussed in section 3 conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology the methodology for evaluating the influence of the urban forms on urban pluvial flooding consists of a chain of two modelling steps and one statistical analysis step as sketched in fig 1 each step is detailed in the following sections section 2 1 presents the generation of 2000 synthetic urban forms by means of procedural modelling section 2 2 describes the computation of surface flow using a porosity based shallow water model and design storms of various return periods section 2 3 details the statistical analysis developed to assess the influence of each urban parameter on the peak values of stored volume outflow discharge and mean water depth 2 1 procedural modelling synthetic urban forms were generated using a deterministic procedular modelling system presented by mustafa et al 2018 it consists of a set of rules which enable defining the street network and the arrangement of parcels and buildings based on a limited number of input parameters the outputs of this urban procedural modelling are collections of locations and footprint geometries of buildings over a predefined area in this study we considered a square area of 1 km by 1 km and we generated 2000 distinct urban forms by randomly selecting the values of the input parameters the input parameters are listed in table 1 they are identical to those used by bruwier et al 2018 the procedural model operates in three steps the network of streets is made of two perpendicular major streets and a number of minor streets the skeleton of the network of streets is controlled by parameters x 1 to x 3 parameter x 1 defines the typical distance in between street intersections the street orientation is controlled by parameter x 2 sin 2 α π 4 with α the angle between the west east direction and the alignment of one of the two main streets the curvature of the streets is given by x 3 reciprocal of the typical radius of curvature parameters x 4 to x 6 influence the number and location of the individual parcels the size and location of the buildings within each parcel are governed by the setbacks x 7 and x 8 which represent distances between buildings and the borders of the parcels the building coverage x 9 is the fraction of the total area occupied by buildings it controls the number of parcels kept without building i e open space as shown in table 1 each input parameter was restricted to a range of variation defined to ensure a sufficient degree of realism of the generated urban forms these ranges of variation were derived from a sample of real world cadastral data from belgium nonetheless the procedural model can also represent a broad range of other urban forms especially for european cities as shown by mustafa et al 2018 a complete description the flow process of the procedural model is given by bruwier et al 2018 examples of generated urban forms are shown in fig 8 hereafter as well as in bruwier et al 2017a 2018 and mustafa et al 2018 to perform flow computations the building footprints generated by procedural modelling are placed on an idealized terrain of uniform slope along the direction south west highest level to north east lowest level fig 2 two distinct slopes were tested 1 4 and 2 8 idealizing the topography as a plane is a strong assumption but it is motivated by our intention to focus here our systematic analysis on the influence of the urban forms therefore we did not want to include additional independent variables characterizing a more complex topography e g location extent depth of sinks 2 2 hydro inundation model for each of the 2000 synthetic urban forms introduced in section 2 1 surface flows occurring during urban pluvial flooding were computed under identical flow boundary conditions and hydrological forcing design storms to perform the flow computation we used an existing porosity based shallow water model such porosity based models enable using relatively coarse computational cells while preserving to some extent the detailed topographic information at a subgrid scale by means of storage and conveyance porosity parameters sanders et al 2008 this approach enables speed up factors of the order of 102 to 103 compared to standard shallow water models while keeping a similar level of accuracy guinot et al 2017 this made the systematic analysis of 2000 urban forms tractable we applied here the same porosity based model as used by bruwier et al 2018 for assessing the influence of the urban forms in the case of river flooding the model was introduced and extensively validated by bruwier et al 2017a it was also repeatedly applied for modelling urban flooding arrault et al 2016 bruwier et al 2017b 2018 an additional piece of validation against experimental observations is provided in supplementary material a for flow conditions corresponding specifically to pluvial flooding the flow computations were performed using a cartesian grid with a spacing δx 10 m a manning roughness coefficient n 0 01 sm 1 3 a drag coefficient cd 2 and a minimum threshold porosity ϕ min 0 1 the influence of these parameters particularly the grid size was tested by bruwier et al 2017a for geometric configurations urban forms identical to those considered here as sketched in fig 2 impervious upstream boundaries were prescribed along the south and west sides of the urban district while a rating curve was prescribed as a downstream boundary condition along the north and east sides this rating curve is a lumped representation of the flow conditions further downstream of the urban area under study it relates the local runoff unit discharge to the power 3 2 of the runoff depth bruwier et al 2018 the buildings are represented as impervious blocks the specific objective of the present study is not to represent a given real world flooding event but instead to conduct a comparative analysis of the influence of urban characteristics on surface flow during urban pluvial flooding therefore the selection of the rainfall input is to a great extent arbitrary provided that it remains representative of real situations we opted for three distinct design storms corresponding to return periods of 15 50 and 100 years in a belgian municipality hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 this range of return periods is consistent with that used in other similar researches yin et al 2016 huang et al 2017 more details on the design storms are given in supplementary material b the model accounts for direct rainfall input but it does not represent the urban drainage explicitly while in some studies the urban drainage system was assumed overwhelmed and therefore simply neglected mignot et al 2006 fewtrell et al 2011 we opted here for a lumped representation of the urban drainage e g yu and coulthard 2015 by subtracting a portion of the rainfall input e g skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 consistently with jba consulting 2016 we substracted from the considered design storm the design storm corresponding to a plausible return period taken into account for the sizing of urban drainage systems this return period was assumed equal to two years this simplified approach assuming that the drainage system drains at its design capacity makes the model more suitable for events strongly dominated by direct surface runoff in principle the spatially distributed effect of drains could be incorporated in the hydro inundation model but it was deemed inconsistent with the primary objective of the study which focuses solely on the influence of the geometry and arrangement of the buildings accounting for spatially distributed drains would have required additional arbitrary assumptions on their location pipe sizing network topoly which could affect our conclusions in previous studies of urban pluvial flooding infiltration was either neglected brown et al 2007 chen et al 2007 sampson et al 2013 replaced by an initial abstraction chang et al 2015 russo et al 2015 or computed explicitly by means of dedicated equations such as green ampt yu and coulthard 2015 leandro et al 2016 yin et al 2016 horton fernández pato et al 2016 löwe et al 2017 or a simplification of the former equations skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 here to avoid extra arbitrary assumptions and keep the focus on the primary aim of this exploratory study all spaces not occupied by buildings were assumed impervious the cumulative effects of the urban form and green infiltration spaces should be analysed separately note that although disregarding the infiltration in green areas is a strong assumption adding infiltration processes in the present systematic analysis of a broad range of urban forms would dramatically increase the number of independent variables spatial distribution extent and infiltration capacity of green areas which in turn would make the conclusions less focused on the effects of urban forms evapotranspiration could safely be neglected due to the urban nature of the catchment and the relatively short time scales of interest here yu and coulthard 2015 another common challenge in the modelling of urban pluvial flooding relates to the impact of the building roofs on the rainfall runoff processes mainly due to a general lack of knowledge on the roofs drainage structure by introducing a constant user defined routing velocity for shallow areas including the roofs of the buildings sampson et al 2013 conducted stable simulations of direct precipitation onto topography where buildings are present without requiring prior knowledge or roof drainage structures chang et al 2015 utilised some sub catchments feature of their model to represent the buildings rainfall runoff processes similarly leandro and martins 2016 set up a conceptual model to reproduce drainage of the rainfall falling on the buildings roofs in this study we opted for a simple conceptual approach in which we assume that at every time step the total amount of rainfall falling on the roof of a given building is drained instantaneously and transferred to the surface flow computation in the cells corresponding to the vertices of the building footprint contour the rainfall volume reaching a roof over one time step is distributed between the building contour vertices according to the sum of the lengths of the building facades

area v the outflow discharge along the downstream sides q out computed as q out i t a dv dt where a stands for the total surface of the urban area and the mean water depth h mean computed as a spatial average of the water depth v af where af is the part of the total urban area not occupied by buildings af a 1 x 9 for each of these flow variables a statistical analysis was conducted to highlight possible correlations with the nine urban parameters x 1 x 9 used as input for procedural modelling section 2 1 the dependent variables considered in the statistical analysis are defined as the variation in the peak value of v q out or h mean compared to a reference configuration without buildings 2 y 1 max t v test max t v ref 3 y 2 max t q out test max t q out ref 4 y 3 max t h mean test max t h mean ref where subscripts test and ref refer respectively to any of the 2000 tested urban configurations and to a reference configuration without buildings eq 2 ensures positive values of y 1 since the peak value is maximum in the absence of buildings section 3 2 to ensure the robustness of the conclusions we used three distinct approaches for the correlation and regression analyses first a multiple linear regression mle was applied to standardized variables 5 y j y j mean y j std a 0 j i 1 9 a ij x i x i mean x i std where ai j i 0 9 j 1 3 are the coefficients of the mlr while the subscripts mean and std denote respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the corresponding variable over the sample of 2000 urban configurations second a multiple linear regression was applied to the logarithmic transformation of normalized variables which is equivalent to 6 y j y j mean b 0 j i 1 9 x i x i mean b ij with b 0 j a coefficient and bi j the exponents of the normalized explanatory variables x 1 to x 9 third pearson correlation coefficients ρ ij were computed 3 results in the following we present the results of the flow computation section 3 1 and the outcomes of the statistical analysis section 3 2 we also discuss which are the most influential urban parameters section 3 3 3 1 flow variables we first look at the variation of the flow variables when the urban form is varied and we compare these variations to those induced by changing the return period of the considered storm or the terrain slope the envelopes of the times series of stored volume in the urban district outflow discharge and mean water depth are displayed in figs 4 6 respectively these envelopes reflect the influence of the urban forms on the flow variables the scatter plots in fig 7 summarize the influence of the urban form on the peak values of the three flow variables for the various return periods and terrain slopes the same information is presented in the form of boxplots in fig c 1 in supplementary material c the following observations can be made for the three considered flow variables stored volume outflow discharge and mean water depth the width of the envelopes of the time series are not affected by a change in the terrain slope in contrast these envelopes become wider when the considered return period is increased figs 4 6 this is also demonstrated by the scatter plots in fig 7a c which show a trend with a slope steeper than the 1 1 line corresponding hence to a wider range of variation along the y axis higher return periods than along the x axis lowest return period this confirms that the influence of the urban form is magnified in the case of more extreme rainfall events in contrast when the terrain slope is varied between 1 4 and 2 8 the range of variation of the flow variables is neither substantially widened nor narrowed fig 7d f for the three flow variables the relative influence of the urban form changes over time and it does so differently depending on the considered flow variable figs 4 6 indeed in the case of the stored volume the width of the envelopes gradually increases with time whereas for the outflow discharge and mean water depth the width of the envelope is maximum close to the peak and then it decreases during the recession limb fig 4 reveals that the influence of the urban form on the time series of the stored volume in the urban district seems relatively lower than the influence of the terrain slope and of the considered return period indeed this is shown by the fact that the envelopes corresponding to distinct terrain slopes and return periods hardly overlap over the whole rising limb and at the peak of the time series in the case of the outflow discharge fig 5 a limited overlap between the envelopes corresponding to distinct terrain slopes can be seen but there is still no overlap between the results corresponding to different return periods see also fig c 1 in supplementary material c this suggests that the influence of the urban form is slightly stronger on the outflow discharge than on the time series of stored volume for the peak values of these two flow variables fig 7a b and d e show that the ranges of variation corresponding to distinct return periods do not overlap and that the overlaps remain limited when the terrain slope is varied this highlights that the considered changes in the return period and the tested terrain slopes have a stronger effect on the peak values of stored volume and outflow discharge than variations in the urban form in contrast for the times series of mean water depths in the urban district of the order of 0 01 0 04 m considerable overlaps are found between the envelopes corresponding to distinct terrain slopes and return periods this points at a relatively stronger influence of the urban form on the mean water depth in the urban district than on the outflow discharge and stored volume similarly substantial overlaps are observed between the ranges of variation of the peaks in water depth when the terrain slope is varied and to a lesser extent when the return period is changed fig 7c and f when the return period is increased the rise in the peak outflow discharges is found twice to three times larger than the rise in the stored volume or in the mean water depth which change with a similar magnitude namely 50 between t 15 years and t 50 years in the present case fig 7a c a steeper terrain slope leads to higher peaks in the outflow discharges and conversely lower peaks in the stored volumes and mean water depths fig 7d f again the peaks in the outflow discharges vary more importantly with the terrain slope than the peaks in the stored volumes and mean water depths 10 in the present case finally as clearly visible in the scatter plots in fig 7 the results obtained for various return periods and terrain slopes are strongly correlated pearson correlation coefficients are respectively above 95 91 and 99 8 for the stored volumes the outflow discharges and the mean water depths this implies that a more in depth analysis of the influence of the urban form conducted for a given return period or terrain slope as performed in the next section will be essentially transferable to the other return periods and terrain slopes this statement would certainly not hold if infiltration processes were taken into account by the model note that here the urban forms basically do not influence the timing of the computed peak discharges however if both pervious and impervious areas were considered in the simulations delays would occur in between the peak discharges depending on where the impervious areas are located 3 2 influencing urban parameters among the 2000 considered urban forms we identified those which correspond to extreme values in the peaks of the three flow variables i e maximum or minimum values of the peaks in the stored volumes outflow discharges and mean water depths this identification was performed independently for the two terrain slopes and the three return periods but some urban forms lead to extreme peak values in more than one flow variable fig 8 in fig 9 we display the standardized values of the nine urban parameters xi section 2 1 characterising each of the urban forms leading to a minimum or a maximum in the peak values of the flow variables fig 9 shows also a boxplot representing the whole sets of values of each urban parameter among the 2000 considered urban forms fig 9 reveals that none of the urban parameters take consistently an extreme value high or low in the configurations leading to extreme peak values in the flow variables except for parameter x 6 mean parcel area and even to a greater extent for parameter x 9 building coverage for which this is almost systematically the case indeed maximum peak values of the storage volume symbols in fig 9 and minimum peak values of the outflow discharge and mean water depth symbols in fig 9 are consistently associated to low values of the building coverage x 9 conversely minimum peak values of the stored volume symbols in fig 9 and maximum peak values of the outflow discharge and mean water depths symbols in fig 9 correspond mainly to high values of the building coverage x 9 for the outflow discharge all values of x 9 corresponding to extremes in the peaks of this flow variable lie outside the 25th 75th percentiles interval at the exception of a single case for the two other flow variables there is not a single exception this hints at an overwhelming influence of the building coverage x 9 in controlling the analysed flow variables during urban pluvial flooding the influence of the nine urban parameters on the flow variables was quantified using the statistical approaches presented in section 2 3 the regression coefficients ai and bi respectively without and with logarithmic transform and the pearson correlation coefficients ρi are shown in fig 10 they were computed using all the results corresponding to the three return periods and the two terrain slopes error bars in fig 10 indicate the range of variation of the coefficients obtained when individual combinations of return period and terrain slope are considered in the analysis instead of combining all the configurations for the outflow discharge and mean water depth a positive value of a coefficient indicates that increasing the value of the corresponding urban parameter leads to a rise in the peak value of the flow variable in contrast a positive coefficient corresponds to an opposite variation in the case of the stored volume this is due to the definition of the dependent variable y 1 as detailed in section 2 3 the results disclose the following as inferred from previous results the statistical analysis confirms the dominating influence of the building coverage x 9 which shows generally the coefficient with the largest magnitude the corresponding p values are all virtually equal to zero confirming the statistical significance of this result this means that raising the value of the building coverage reduces the peak value of the stored volume consequently to a reduction in the void area and it increases the peak values of the outflow discharges and mean water depths this result is also highlighted by the scatter plots displayed in supplementary material d all coefficients associated to the urban parameters x 1 to x 5 and to x 7 remain consistently low in magnitude revealing a limited influence of these urban parameters on the studied flow variables the variations in the coefficients associated to x 6 mean parcel area when the statistical approach is varied are explained by the existing positive correlation between parameters x 6 and x 9 as detailed in bruwier et al 2018 indeed when a statistical approach leads to a relatively lower resp higher coefficient for x 6 it is compensated by a higher resp lower value of the coefficient associated to x 9 besides the building coverage the second most influential urban parameter seems to be the lateral setback x 8 which is closely related to the distance between adjacent buildings this is particularly true for the stored volume and the outflow discharge indeed increasing the side setback enhances the connectivity between various parts of the urban area hence enabling more effective storage over the duration of the storm the corresponding p values are generally very close to zero and at most of the order of 9 10 3 overall these results are to a great extent consistent with those obtained by bruwier et al 2018 for river flooding the main difference is that the dominating influence of the building coverage on the flow variables is more severe for pluvial flooding than for river flooding since the analysis above is based on the mean water depth it does not reflect explicitly the effect of urban forms on the spatial distribution of water depths to address this supplementary material e looks at the effect of choosing alternate representative water depths such as various percentiles the results of the statistical analysis performed based on these alternate representative water depths reveal that the relative influence of the urban parameters remains essentially similar in all cases so that the above conclusions still apply particularly as regards the overwhelming influence of the building coverage x 9 3 3 number of urban variables used in the statistical analysis the statistical analysis presented in section 3 2 highlighted the dominant influence of the building coverage on the peak values of the flow variables compared to a configuration without buildings here we compare the predictive capacity of regression models involving either the nine urban parameters x 1 to x 9 or a subset of them either the building side setback x 8 and the building coverage x 9 or only the building coverage x 9 the capacity of each regression model to predict the peak value of flow variable j is evaluated through the error ej computed as follows 7 e j i 1 n y ij y ij n y j mean where y ij is the predicted value of the peak flow variable y ij corresponding to urban form i as shown in table 2 the errors are minimum when all urban parameters are taken into account but the errors increase only marginally if all parameters but x 9 or x 8 and x 9 are disregarded particularly for peaks in mean water depths the error hardly changes when the regression model accounts only for x 9 or x 8 and x 9 increase in ej by maximum 0 2 percentage points this strengthens the claim that the considered flow variables are essentially controlled by the building coverage and to a lower extent by the lateral setbacks the results in table 2 also highlight that for the three flow variables the error on the predicted peak values is lower with the logarithmic transform than without this is consistent with the formulation of eq 5 which appears more physically sound than eq 6 also the peaks in mean water depths are predicted with a better accuracy ej 5 than the peaks in stored volumes ej 12 13 and in outflow discharges ej 16 17 note that the errors are evaluated in the untransformed space table 3 shows the coefficients derived from a multiple linear regression model with logarithmic transform based on urban parameters x 8 and x 9 the results emphasize the relatively lower influence of the lateral setback x 8 on the peak flow variables the building coverage has a weight about one to two orders of magnitude larger than the lateral setback for the prediction of the peaks in stored volume outflow discharge and mean water depth from the perspective of urban planning this considerable difference in the weights hampers the compensation of an increased building coverage i e urban development by a flood sensitive arrangement of the buildings e g with higher lateral setbacks since the latter effect remains by far smaller than the former one this contrasts with the case of river flooding bruwier et al 2018 where the relative influence of the building coverage and another composite indicator of the buildings arrangement differs only by a factor three so that the detrimental impact of an increase in the building coverage i e new developments can be effectively mitigated by a suitable location of the buildings bruwier et al 2018 4 conclusion in this study previous research on the influence of the urban form on river flooding bruwier et al 2018 was extended to the case of urban pluvial flooding we have considered 2000 synthetic arrangements of buildings characterized by nine urban parameters typical street orientation curvature length and width mean parcel area building setbacks and two different terrain slopes for each of them we computed surface flow variables using a validated hydro inundation model forced by uniform rainfall input corresponding to design storms of various return periods our results show the following variations in the urban forms has generally a more limited effect on the peak values of stored volume in the urban district and on the outflow discharge compared to changes in the storm return period or in the terrain slope in contrast a strong influence of the urban form was found on the mean water depths in the urban area the influence of the urban form is magnified in the case of more extreme rainfall events which hints at a growing importance of flood sensitive urban planning as an adaptation to climate change based on statistical analysis we highlighted the overwhelming influence of the building coverage compared to other urban parameters the distance between adjacent buildings is another influencing parameter but to a lesser extent from the perspective of urban planning the strongly dominating influence of the building coverage seems to hamper the compensation of an increasing building coverage i e urban development by means of a more flood sensitive arrangement of the buildings e g with higher lateral setbacks since the latter effect remains by far smaller than the former one this result obtained here for pluvial flooding differs from earlier results obtained in the context of river flooding bruwier et al 2018 moreover these conclusions appear robust with respect to changes in the terrain slope or in the rainfall intensity this study is the first one to date to analyse systematically the influence of the urban form on urban pluvial flooding nonetheless given the high complexity of the actual interactions between urban systems and flow processes our work presents a number of limitations which should be further analysed in future research to pave the way for more flood resilient urban planning this includes an improved representation of urban drainage systems

5801,this paper presents a systematic analysis of the influence of nine urban characteristics distance between buildings mean building size building coverage etc on surface flow in case of pluvial flooding time dependent stored volumes outflow discharges and mean water depths were computed for a set of 2000 synthetic urban forms considering various terrain slopes and return periods of the rainfall an efficient porosity based surface flow model was used to compute the 2d flow variables statistical analysis of the relationship between the flow and urban variables highlights that the flooding severity is mostly influenced by the building coverage keywords urban pluvial flood porosity shallow water model procedural modelling 1 introduction worldwide urban flooding induces a broad range of damage to people infrastructure and economy e g huang et al 2017 yin et al 2016 kreibich et al 2019 urban flood risk is growing as a result of rapid urbanization and increasingly frequent hydroclimatic extremes zhou et al 2012 chen et al 2015 muis et al 2015 yin et al 2015 miller and hutchins 2017 a major cause of flooding in inland urban areas is pluvial floods induced by heavy rainfall events gaines 2016 existing research on urban pluvial flooding has covered a broad range of aspects including spatio temporal precipitation data rainfall runoff modelling risk management and impact analysis of climate and land use change 1 1 existing data and models hydrological modelling of urban catchments remains particularly challenging due to i limitations in data availability ii specific flow processes such as the interactions between surface flow and urban drainage systems iii as well as the spatial heterogeneity of urban features influencing runoff leandro et al 2009 salvadore et al 2015 in early studies the urban surface water runoff originating from point sources such as manholes has been simulated with 2d surface flow routing models either based on the full 2d shallow water equations mignot et al 2006 martins et al 2017 or on simplified versions such as inertial formulation e g fewtrell et al 2011 other research applied sequentially a 1d model for the urban drainage system and a 2d model for surface flow routing the outcome of the urban drainage model consists in hydrographs of surcharged flow i e excess flow compared to the design discharge of each pipe section used as an input for the 2d surface flow routing model based on this approach and a 2d diffusive surface flow model hsu et al 2000 simulated inundation in urban areas caused by the surcharge of storm sewers and considering the influence of pumping stations nonetheless even in this approach two way interactions between the surface flow and the urban drainage system are not reproduced explicitly in contrast dual drainage modelling consists in coupling a 1d flow routing model for the urban drainage system and a 2d surface flow routing model schmitt et al 2004 djordjević et al 2005 chen et al 2007 seyoum et al 2012 löwe et al 2017 the bidirectional interactions between the two models are ensured through sink and source terms in the respective model equations these terms are evaluated from weir or orifice formulae bazin et al 2014 in so called hydro inundation models precipitation is incorporated as a source term in the 2d surface flow routing model and this model contains an explicit representation of hydrological processes such as infiltration cea et al 2010 yu and coulthard 2015 leandro et al 2016 löwe et al 2017 and evaporation yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 2019 to replace the total rainfall by the effective rainfall while in conventional approaches catchment modelling and floodplain modelling are two successive steps in hydro inundation models they are merged into a single computation in several studies dual drainage and hydro inundation features were combined hsu et al 2000 schmitt et al 2004 leandro et al 2016 in contrast others opted for a simplified description of the urban drainage system such as assuming that water is drained away at the design capacity without explicit representation of drains and manholes yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 2019 or even neglected the urban drainage system huang et al 2017 in existing dual drainage and hydro inundation models so far the surface flow was represented using non inertia 2d flow models the broad range of developed models has proved valuable to support urban flood risk management as well as for the planning and management of urban drainage systems fletcher et al 2013 they have been used in various settings including for evaluating the impact of flooding on traffic disruption yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 2019 for urban flood forecasting chen et al 2015 for assessing pluvial flood risk at the local level elboshy et al 2019 among other applications 1 2 influence of urban planning on urban pluvial flooding many recent studies have investigated the sustainable management of urban storm water based on low impact development lid techniques i e seeking to mimic a site s pre development hydrology such as tanks swale green roof or permeable pavement qin et al 2013 ahiablame and shakya 2016 chen et al 2017 others analysed the impacts of urbanization on urban pluvial flooding for instance based on a hydro inundation model huang et al 2017 and miller and hutchins 2017 highlighted that land use and land cover changes substantially contribute to increase pluvial flooding in urban areas especially for extreme rainfall events however a more limited attention has been paid so far to the specific influence of urban planning policies on urban pluvial flooding in this regard only a study carried out by löwe et al 2017 stands out for an urban catchment of 300 ha in australia they coupled a 1d 2d hydrodynamic model with an urban development model they tested nine different urban development scenarios characterized by contrasting levels of demand for housing type and location of buildings uncontrolled urban sprawl involving detached single unit houses vs more compact urban forms with multi storey buildings and apartment blocks as well as flood adaptation options buyback of properties rainwater harvesting increased stormwater pipe capacity their results suggest that compared to the increase of urban drainage capacity urban planning policies are more efficient to reduce flood risk under various climate change scenarios nonetheless even löwe et al 2017 paid only limited attention to the role paid by the urban form on the severity of urban pluvial flooding whereas geometry and arrangement of buildings alter the surface flow preferential directions as they represent obstacles to the flow leandro et al 2016 additionally existing research focused on individual real world case studies and not on more generic configurations and previous analyses remained generally at the level of the land use category e g residential industrial vs green space not at the building level therefore in this paper we aim to understand whether the geometric characteristics of the arrangement of buildings also called urban pattern influence surface flow during urban pluvial flooding more specifically using regression and correlation analyses we have been searching for possible relationships between indicators of the severity of urban flooding stored volume inundation depth outflow discharge and geometric parameters characterizing the urban patterns typical street width length curvature and orientation building size and distances between buildings to do so we performed a systematic analysis by considering 2000 synthetic but realistic urban forms obtained from a procedural urban generation model for each of them we computed the surface flow variables corresponding to three different design rainfalls 15 50 and 100 year return periods the terrain slope was also varied resulting in a total of 12 000 distinct simulations this analysis is an extension of the procedure recently developed by bruwier et al 2018 for the case of river flooding to perform the high number of necessary model runs we used an efficient hydro inundation model developed in house it is based on a validated integral porosity shallow water model solving the fully dynamic shallow water equations for surface flow bruwier et al 2017a a simplified approach is used to represent the urban drainage system which is deemed justified here since the focus is set on comparing the influence on surface flow of the geometric parameters characterizing the urban patterns the methodology detailed in section 2 includes the generation of synthetic urban forms with a procedural model section 2 1 a brief presentation of the hydro inundation model section 2 2 and the statistical approach used to determine the impact of urban parameters on pluvial flow section 2 3 computed flow variables and their relationships with the urban characteristics are presented and discussed in section 3 conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology the methodology for evaluating the influence of the urban forms on urban pluvial flooding consists of a chain of two modelling steps and one statistical analysis step as sketched in fig 1 each step is detailed in the following sections section 2 1 presents the generation of 2000 synthetic urban forms by means of procedural modelling section 2 2 describes the computation of surface flow using a porosity based shallow water model and design storms of various return periods section 2 3 details the statistical analysis developed to assess the influence of each urban parameter on the peak values of stored volume outflow discharge and mean water depth 2 1 procedural modelling synthetic urban forms were generated using a deterministic procedular modelling system presented by mustafa et al 2018 it consists of a set of rules which enable defining the street network and the arrangement of parcels and buildings based on a limited number of input parameters the outputs of this urban procedural modelling are collections of locations and footprint geometries of buildings over a predefined area in this study we considered a square area of 1 km by 1 km and we generated 2000 distinct urban forms by randomly selecting the values of the input parameters the input parameters are listed in table 1 they are identical to those used by bruwier et al 2018 the procedural model operates in three steps the network of streets is made of two perpendicular major streets and a number of minor streets the skeleton of the network of streets is controlled by parameters x 1 to x 3 parameter x 1 defines the typical distance in between street intersections the street orientation is controlled by parameter x 2 sin 2 α π 4 with α the angle between the west east direction and the alignment of one of the two main streets the curvature of the streets is given by x 3 reciprocal of the typical radius of curvature parameters x 4 to x 6 influence the number and location of the individual parcels the size and location of the buildings within each parcel are governed by the setbacks x 7 and x 8 which represent distances between buildings and the borders of the parcels the building coverage x 9 is the fraction of the total area occupied by buildings it controls the number of parcels kept without building i e open space as shown in table 1 each input parameter was restricted to a range of variation defined to ensure a sufficient degree of realism of the generated urban forms these ranges of variation were derived from a sample of real world cadastral data from belgium nonetheless the procedural model can also represent a broad range of other urban forms especially for european cities as shown by mustafa et al 2018 a complete description the flow process of the procedural model is given by bruwier et al 2018 examples of generated urban forms are shown in fig 8 hereafter as well as in bruwier et al 2017a 2018 and mustafa et al 2018 to perform flow computations the building footprints generated by procedural modelling are placed on an idealized terrain of uniform slope along the direction south west highest level to north east lowest level fig 2 two distinct slopes were tested 1 4 and 2 8 idealizing the topography as a plane is a strong assumption but it is motivated by our intention to focus here our systematic analysis on the influence of the urban forms therefore we did not want to include additional independent variables characterizing a more complex topography e g location extent depth of sinks 2 2 hydro inundation model for each of the 2000 synthetic urban forms introduced in section 2 1 surface flows occurring during urban pluvial flooding were computed under identical flow boundary conditions and hydrological forcing design storms to perform the flow computation we used an existing porosity based shallow water model such porosity based models enable using relatively coarse computational cells while preserving to some extent the detailed topographic information at a subgrid scale by means of storage and conveyance porosity parameters sanders et al 2008 this approach enables speed up factors of the order of 102 to 103 compared to standard shallow water models while keeping a similar level of accuracy guinot et al 2017 this made the systematic analysis of 2000 urban forms tractable we applied here the same porosity based model as used by bruwier et al 2018 for assessing the influence of the urban forms in the case of river flooding the model was introduced and extensively validated by bruwier et al 2017a it was also repeatedly applied for modelling urban flooding arrault et al 2016 bruwier et al 2017b 2018 an additional piece of validation against experimental observations is provided in supplementary material a for flow conditions corresponding specifically to pluvial flooding the flow computations were performed using a cartesian grid with a spacing δx 10 m a manning roughness coefficient n 0 01 sm 1 3 a drag coefficient cd 2 and a minimum threshold porosity ϕ min 0 1 the influence of these parameters particularly the grid size was tested by bruwier et al 2017a for geometric configurations urban forms identical to those considered here as sketched in fig 2 impervious upstream boundaries were prescribed along the south and west sides of the urban district while a rating curve was prescribed as a downstream boundary condition along the north and east sides this rating curve is a lumped representation of the flow conditions further downstream of the urban area under study it relates the local runoff unit discharge to the power 3 2 of the runoff depth bruwier et al 2018 the buildings are represented as impervious blocks the specific objective of the present study is not to represent a given real world flooding event but instead to conduct a comparative analysis of the influence of urban characteristics on surface flow during urban pluvial flooding therefore the selection of the rainfall input is to a great extent arbitrary provided that it remains representative of real situations we opted for three distinct design storms corresponding to return periods of 15 50 and 100 years in a belgian municipality hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 this range of return periods is consistent with that used in other similar researches yin et al 2016 huang et al 2017 more details on the design storms are given in supplementary material b the model accounts for direct rainfall input but it does not represent the urban drainage explicitly while in some studies the urban drainage system was assumed overwhelmed and therefore simply neglected mignot et al 2006 fewtrell et al 2011 we opted here for a lumped representation of the urban drainage e g yu and coulthard 2015 by subtracting a portion of the rainfall input e g skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 consistently with jba consulting 2016 we substracted from the considered design storm the design storm corresponding to a plausible return period taken into account for the sizing of urban drainage systems this return period was assumed equal to two years this simplified approach assuming that the drainage system drains at its design capacity makes the model more suitable for events strongly dominated by direct surface runoff in principle the spatially distributed effect of drains could be incorporated in the hydro inundation model but it was deemed inconsistent with the primary objective of the study which focuses solely on the influence of the geometry and arrangement of the buildings accounting for spatially distributed drains would have required additional arbitrary assumptions on their location pipe sizing network topoly which could affect our conclusions in previous studies of urban pluvial flooding infiltration was either neglected brown et al 2007 chen et al 2007 sampson et al 2013 replaced by an initial abstraction chang et al 2015 russo et al 2015 or computed explicitly by means of dedicated equations such as green ampt yu and coulthard 2015 leandro et al 2016 yin et al 2016 horton fernández pato et al 2016 löwe et al 2017 or a simplification of the former equations skougaard kaspersen et al 2017 here to avoid extra arbitrary assumptions and keep the focus on the primary aim of this exploratory study all spaces not occupied by buildings were assumed impervious the cumulative effects of the urban form and green infiltration spaces should be analysed separately note that although disregarding the infiltration in green areas is a strong assumption adding infiltration processes in the present systematic analysis of a broad range of urban forms would dramatically increase the number of independent variables spatial distribution extent and infiltration capacity of green areas which in turn would make the conclusions less focused on the effects of urban forms evapotranspiration could safely be neglected due to the urban nature of the catchment and the relatively short time scales of interest here yu and coulthard 2015 another common challenge in the modelling of urban pluvial flooding relates to the impact of the building roofs on the rainfall runoff processes mainly due to a general lack of knowledge on the roofs drainage structure by introducing a constant user defined routing velocity for shallow areas including the roofs of the buildings sampson et al 2013 conducted stable simulations of direct precipitation onto topography where buildings are present without requiring prior knowledge or roof drainage structures chang et al 2015 utilised some sub catchments feature of their model to represent the buildings rainfall runoff processes similarly leandro and martins 2016 set up a conceptual model to reproduce drainage of the rainfall falling on the buildings roofs in this study we opted for a simple conceptual approach in which we assume that at every time step the total amount of rainfall falling on the roof of a given building is drained instantaneously and transferred to the surface flow computation in the cells corresponding to the vertices of the building footprint contour the rainfall volume reaching a roof over one time step is distributed between the building contour vertices according to the sum of the lengths of the building facades connected to each corner fig 3 1 d i j t i t ω l k l k 1 2 m 1 m l m 1 with di j the contribution to the source term in the flow continuity equation due to vertex k of the considered building i t the

area v the outflow discharge along the downstream sides q out computed as q out i t a dv dt where a stands for the total surface of the urban area and the mean water depth h mean computed as a spatial average of the water depth v af where af is the part of the total urban area not occupied by buildings af a 1 x 9 for each of these flow variables a statistical analysis was conducted to highlight possible correlations with the nine urban parameters x 1 x 9 used as input for procedural modelling section 2 1 the dependent variables considered in the statistical analysis are defined as the variation in the peak value of v q out or h mean compared to a reference configuration without buildings 2 y 1 max t v test max t v ref 3 y 2 max t q out test max t q out ref 4 y 3 max t h mean test max t h mean ref where subscripts test and ref refer respectively to any of the 2000 tested urban configurations and to a reference configuration without buildings eq 2 ensures positive values of y 1 since the peak value is maximum in the absence of buildings section 3 2 to ensure the robustness of the conclusions we used three distinct approaches for the correlation and regression analyses first a multiple linear regression mle was applied to standardized variables 5 y j y j mean y j std a 0 j i 1 9 a ij x i x i mean x i std where ai j i 0 9 j 1 3 are the coefficients of the mlr while the subscripts mean and std denote respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the corresponding variable over the sample of 2000 urban configurations second a multiple linear regression was applied to the logarithmic transformation of normalized variables which is equivalent to 6 y j y j mean b 0 j i 1 9 x i x i mean b ij with b 0 j a coefficient and bi j the exponents of the normalized explanatory variables x 1 to x 9 third pearson correlation coefficients ρ ij were computed 3 results in the following we present the results of the flow computation section 3 1 and the outcomes of the statistical analysis section 3 2 we also discuss which are the most influential urban parameters section 3 3 3 1 flow variables we first look at the variation of the flow variables when the urban form is varied and we compare these variations to those induced by changing the return period of the considered storm or the terrain slope the envelopes of the times series of stored volume in the urban district outflow discharge and mean water depth are displayed in figs 4 6 respectively these envelopes reflect the influence of the urban forms on the flow variables the scatter plots in fig 7 summarize the influence of the urban form on the peak values of the three flow variables for the various return periods and terrain slopes the same information is presented in the form of boxplots in fig c 1 in supplementary material c the following observations can be made for the three considered flow variables stored volume outflow discharge and mean water depth the width of the envelopes of the time series are not affected by a change in the terrain slope in contrast these envelopes become wider when the considered return period is increased figs 4 6 this is also demonstrated by the scatter plots in fig 7a c which show a trend with a slope steeper than the 1 1 line corresponding hence to a wider range of variation along the y axis higher return periods than along the x axis lowest return period this confirms that the influence of the urban form is magnified in the case of more extreme rainfall events in contrast when the terrain slope is varied between 1 4 and 2 8 the range of variation of the flow variables is neither substantially widened nor narrowed fig 7d f for the three flow variables the relative influence of the urban form changes over time and it does so differently depending on the considered flow variable figs 4 6 indeed in the case of the stored volume the width of the envelopes gradually increases with time whereas for the outflow discharge and mean water depth the width of the envelope is maximum close to the peak and then it decreases during the recession limb fig 4 reveals that the influence of the urban form on the time series of the stored volume in the urban district seems relatively lower than the influence of the terrain slope and of the considered return period indeed this is shown by the fact that the envelopes corresponding to distinct terrain slopes and return periods hardly overlap over the whole rising limb and at the peak of the time series in the case of the outflow discharge fig 5 a limited overlap between the envelopes corresponding to distinct terrain slopes can be seen but there is still no overlap between the results corresponding to different return periods see also fig c 1 in supplementary material c this suggests that the influence of the urban form is slightly stronger on the outflow discharge than on the time series of stored volume for the peak values of these two flow variables fig 7a b and d e show that the ranges of variation corresponding to distinct return periods do not overlap and that the overlaps remain limited when the terrain slope is varied this highlights that the considered changes in the return period and the tested terrain slopes have a stronger effect on the peak values of stored volume and outflow discharge than variations in the urban form in contrast for the times series of mean water depths in the urban district of the order of 0 01 0 04 m considerable overlaps are found between the envelopes corresponding to distinct terrain slopes and return periods this points at a relatively stronger influence of the urban form on the mean water depth in the urban district than on the outflow discharge and stored volume similarly substantial overlaps are observed between the ranges of variation of the peaks in water depth when the terrain slope is varied and to a lesser extent when the return period is changed fig 7c and f when the return period is increased the rise in the peak outflow discharges is found twice to three times larger than the rise in the stored volume or in the mean water depth which change with a similar magnitude namely 50 between t 15 years and t 50 years in the present case fig 7a c a steeper terrain slope leads to higher peaks in the outflow discharges and conversely lower peaks in the stored volumes and mean water depths fig 7d f again the peaks in the outflow discharges vary more importantly with the terrain slope than the peaks in the stored volumes and mean water depths 10 in the present case finally as clearly visible in the scatter plots in fig 7 the results obtained for various return periods and terrain slopes are strongly correlated pearson correlation coefficients are respectively above 95 91 and 99 8 for the stored volumes the outflow discharges and the mean water depths this implies that a more in depth analysis of the influence of the urban form conducted for a given return period or terrain slope as performed in the next section will be essentially transferable to the other return periods and terrain slopes this statement would certainly not hold if infiltration processes were taken into account by the model note that here the urban forms basically do not influence the timing of the computed peak discharges however if both pervious and impervious areas were considered in the simulations delays would occur in between the peak discharges depending on where the impervious areas are located 3 2 influencing urban parameters among the 2000 considered urban forms we identified those which correspond to extreme values in the peaks of the three flow variables i e maximum or minimum values of the peaks in the stored volumes outflow discharges and mean water depths this identification was performed independently for the two terrain slopes and the three return periods but some urban forms lead to extreme peak values in more than one flow variable fig 8 in fig 9 we display the standardized values of the nine urban parameters xi section 2 1 characterising each of the urban forms leading to a minimum or a maximum in the peak values of the flow variables fig 9 shows also a boxplot representing the whole sets of values of each urban parameter among the 2000 considered urban forms fig 9 reveals that none of the urban parameters take consistently an extreme value high or low in the configurations leading to extreme peak values in the flow variables except for parameter x 6 mean parcel area and even to a greater extent for parameter x 9 building coverage for which this is almost systematically the case indeed maximum peak values of the storage volume symbols in fig 9 and minimum peak values of the outflow discharge and mean water depth symbols in fig 9 are consistently associated to low values of the building coverage x 9 conversely minimum peak values of the stored volume symbols in fig 9 and maximum peak values of the outflow discharge and mean water depths symbols in fig 9 correspond mainly to high values of the building coverage x 9 for the outflow discharge all values of x 9 corresponding to extremes in the peaks of this flow variable lie outside the 25th 75th percentiles interval at the exception of a single case for the two other flow variables there is not a single exception this hints at an overwhelming influence of the building coverage x 9 in controlling the analysed flow variables during urban pluvial flooding the influence of the nine urban parameters on the flow variables was quantified using the statistical approaches presented in section 2 3 the regression coefficients ai and bi respectively without and with logarithmic transform and the pearson correlation coefficients ρi are shown in fig 10 they were computed using all the results corresponding to the three return periods and the two terrain slopes error bars in fig 10 indicate the range of variation of the coefficients obtained when individual combinations of return period and terrain slope are considered in the analysis instead of combining all the configurations for the outflow discharge and mean water depth a positive value of a coefficient indicates that increasing the value of the corresponding urban parameter leads to a rise in the peak value of the flow variable in contrast a positive coefficient corresponds to an opposite variation in the case of the stored volume this is due to the definition of the dependent variable y 1 as detailed in section 2 3 the results disclose the following as inferred from previous results the statistical analysis confirms the dominating influence of the building coverage x 9 which shows generally the coefficient with the largest magnitude the corresponding p values are all virtually equal to zero confirming the statistical significance of this result this means that raising the value of the building coverage reduces the peak value of the stored volume consequently to a reduction in the void area and it increases the peak values of the outflow discharges and mean water depths this result is also highlighted by the scatter plots displayed in supplementary material d all coefficients associated to the urban parameters x 1 to x 5 and to x 7 remain consistently low in magnitude revealing a limited influence of these urban parameters on the studied flow variables the variations in the coefficients associated to x 6 mean parcel area when the statistical approach is varied are explained by the existing positive correlation between parameters x 6 and x 9 as detailed in bruwier et al 2018 indeed when a statistical approach leads to a relatively lower resp higher coefficient for x 6 it is compensated by a higher resp lower value of the coefficient associated to x 9 besides the building coverage the second most influential urban parameter seems to be the lateral setback x 8 which is closely related to the distance between adjacent buildings this is particularly true for the stored volume and the outflow discharge indeed increasing the side setback enhances the connectivity between various parts of the urban area hence enabling more effective storage over the duration of the storm the corresponding p values are generally very close to zero and at most of the order of 9 10 3 overall these results are to a great extent consistent with those obtained by bruwier et al 2018 for river flooding the main difference is that the dominating influence of the building coverage on the flow variables is more severe for pluvial flooding than for river flooding since the analysis above is based on the mean water depth it does not reflect explicitly the effect of urban forms on the spatial distribution of water depths to address this supplementary material e looks at the effect of choosing alternate representative water depths such as various percentiles the results of the statistical analysis performed based on these alternate representative water depths reveal that the relative influence of the urban parameters remains essentially similar in all cases so that the above conclusions still apply particularly as regards the overwhelming influence of the building coverage x 9 3 3 number of urban variables used in the statistical analysis the statistical analysis presented in section 3 2 highlighted the dominant influence of the building coverage on the peak values of the flow variables compared to a configuration without buildings here we compare the predictive capacity of regression models involving either the nine urban parameters x 1 to x 9 or a subset of them either the building side setback x 8 and the building coverage x 9 or only the building coverage x 9 the capacity of each regression model to predict the peak value of flow variable j is evaluated through the error ej computed as follows 7 e j i 1 n y ij y ij n y j mean where y ij is the predicted value of the peak flow variable y ij corresponding to urban form i as shown in table 2 the errors are minimum when all urban parameters are taken into account but the errors increase only marginally if all parameters but x 9 or x 8 and x 9 are disregarded particularly for peaks in mean water depths the error hardly changes when the regression model accounts only for x 9 or x 8 and x 9 increase in ej by maximum 0 2 percentage points this strengthens the claim that the considered flow variables are essentially controlled by the building coverage and to a lower extent by the lateral setbacks the results in table 2 also highlight that for the three flow variables the error on the predicted peak values is lower with the logarithmic transform than without this is consistent with the formulation of eq 5 which appears more physically sound than eq 6 also the peaks in mean water depths are predicted with a better accuracy ej 5 than the peaks in stored volumes ej 12 13 and in outflow discharges ej 16 17 note that the errors are evaluated in the untransformed space table 3 shows the coefficients derived from a multiple linear regression model with logarithmic transform based on urban parameters x 8 and x 9 the results emphasize the relatively lower influence of the lateral setback x 8 on the peak flow variables the building coverage has a weight about one to two orders of magnitude larger than the lateral setback for the prediction of the peaks in stored volume outflow discharge and mean water depth from the perspective of urban planning this considerable difference in the weights hampers the compensation of an increased building coverage i e urban development by a flood sensitive arrangement of the buildings e g with higher lateral setbacks since the latter effect remains by far smaller than the former one this contrasts with the case of river flooding bruwier et al 2018 where the relative influence of the building coverage and another composite indicator of the buildings arrangement differs only by a factor three so that the detrimental impact of an increase in the building coverage i e new developments can be effectively mitigated by a suitable location of the buildings bruwier et al 2018 4 conclusion in this study previous research on the influence of the urban form on river flooding bruwier et al 2018 was extended to the case of urban pluvial flooding we have considered 2000 synthetic arrangements of buildings characterized by nine urban parameters typical street orientation curvature length and width mean parcel area building setbacks and two different terrain slopes for each of them we computed surface flow variables using a validated hydro inundation model forced by uniform rainfall input corresponding to design storms of various return periods our results show the following variations in the urban forms has generally a more limited effect on the peak values of stored volume in the urban district and on the outflow discharge compared to changes in the storm return period or in the terrain slope in contrast a strong influence of the urban form was found on the mean water depths in the urban area the influence of the urban form is magnified in the case of more extreme rainfall events which hints at a growing importance of flood sensitive urban planning as an adaptation to climate change based on statistical analysis we highlighted the overwhelming influence of the building coverage compared to other urban parameters the distance between adjacent buildings is another influencing parameter but to a lesser extent from the perspective of urban planning the strongly dominating influence of the building coverage seems to hamper the compensation of an increasing building coverage i e urban development by means of a more flood sensitive arrangement of the buildings e g with higher lateral setbacks since the latter effect remains by far smaller than the former one this result obtained here for pluvial flooding differs from earlier results obtained in the context of river flooding bruwier et al 2018 moreover these conclusions appear robust with respect to changes in the terrain slope or in the rainfall intensity this study is the first one to date to analyse systematically the influence of the urban form on urban pluvial flooding nonetheless given the high complexity of the actual interactions between urban systems and flow processes our work presents a number of limitations which should be further analysed in future research to pave the way for more flood resilient urban planning this includes an improved representation of urban drainage systems

100875 china corresponding author this manuscript was handled by huaming guo editor in chief with the assistance of federico maggi associate editor impacts of climatic variations and human activities on water discharge in the lower streams of dammed rivers have been widely studied due to the rich water resources and hydropower potential however the effects of climate variations in upper streams on the whole river system are always ignored therefore integrated methods of hydrological modelling and numerical analysis were employed to identify runoff characteristics in response to climatic variations in conjunction with hydroelectric exploitation in the jinsha river in the asian water tower region while there was no significant rise in annual precipitation for most areas from 1970 to 2017 highly significant upward trends in temperature were observed in areas along the mainstream snowmelt periods varied between upper and middle streams due to constantly varying geographic conditions peaking runoff of 56 67 m3 s 1 1350 12 m3 s 1 175 63 m3 s 1 2343 89 m3 s 1 1855 02 m3 s 1 3285 61 m3 s 1 and 10 922 65 m3 s 1 occurred during july in tuotuohe qingshuihe jinsha qingshuihe yalong batang kangding xianggelila and yibin respectively along the jinsha river during snowmelt periods runoff in the upper stream was greatly influenced by temperature changes however during recent periods runoff in the middle stream has also become sensitive to rising temperatures as indicated by change points the contribution of runoff from upper streams to the outlet increased from 10 57 naturalised river period to 13 01 individual reservoir period followed by a further increase of 13 37 cascade reservoirs period seasonal differences were observed up to the middle streams where more runoff occurred at the outlet during flood seasons due to hydroelectric exploitation after 1999 annually runoff contribution in different areas increased in response to climatic variations during 1999 2017 this study highlights the vulnerability of runoff variations in upper streams to climate change watershed management rather than river regulation alone is needed which could help water resources management for the entire river system keywords hydrological process climate variations snowmelt hydropower reservoir watershed modelling 1 introduction during recent decades global climate change has led to rapid changes in the hydrological cycle and sediment yield at local and regional levels in middle high altitude areas dominated by both snow and rainfall barnett et al 2005 wu et al 2018a two types of flood scenarios exist in such areas summer floods due to extreme rainfall and spring floods due to large scale melting of snow therefore the hydrological regime is vulnerable to climatic variations as snowmelt at higher elevations is integral to the overall hydrological cycle of a basin bajracharya et al 2018 thus it has become difficult to accurately predict the hydrological process hence sustainable development and management of the watershed in middle high altitude regions particularly for catchments with abundant snowfall require a deeper understanding of runoff under the combined impacts of climate change and human activities such as dams irrigation and land utilization construction and regulation of large reservoirs have modified river discharge sediment transport and contaminant migration characteristics fang et al 2012 imposing significant threats to river ecosystems an increasing number of hydropower plants have been built to meet the demands of water and energy zarfl et al 2015 such as on the lancang mekong river wang et al 2017 the amazon river winemiller et al 2016 and the yangtze river fang and rodi 2003 which shape the hydrological ecosystems across the basin the cumulative effects of cascade reservoirs are of greater concern than those of the individual reservoirs due to the larger scale of impacts the effects of cascade reservoirs can be additive or incremental with significant uncertainty habets et al 2018 ouyang et al 2009 though numerous studies have been conducted on estimating the river flow under hydropower regulations it is difficult to identify the impacts of climatic variations on hydrological processes in a watershed just from monitoring river flow data before and after reservoir regulations bin ashraf et al 2016 as compared to limited observation data the modelling approach can comprehensively assess spatio temporal hydrological changes over a large basin changes in surface runoff and river flood associated with rainstorm or snowmelt under reservoir regulations have been studied previously however the effects are unclear when taking both rainfall and snowmelt into account over a large basin globally there are approximately 2 200 major hydropower stations regulating river flow in snow dominated areas lehner et al 2011 assessment of climate change in the hydrological balance of high altitude watersheds requires modelling complex watershed processes at high spatial and temporal scales fang et al 2016 viviroli et al 2011 however not enough knowledge is available on the relationship between runoff reservoir regulation and climate change as hydroelectric plants are usually designed in stationary climatic and hydrological conditions rouhani and leconte 2018 precipitation is known to be a key factor governing runoff regimes nonetheless regulation of water based systems such as reservoirs is more closely associated with variations in temperature than with precipitation in snowmelt dominated catchments barnett et al 2005 this is because snowpack along with accumulating or melting of snow cover can also act as a reservoir for water storage nijssen et al 2001 the jinsha river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau also known as water tower of asia the impact of global warming on glacier retreat and permafrost degradation in this area is significant lutz et al 2014 and will cause large scale and possibly irreparable regional hydrological disturbance the cascade reservoirs in the lower jinsha river have a hydropower production capacity of 40 million kw which is twice the capacity of the three gorges reservoir tgr huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 the cumulative impacts of cascade dams are more pronounced than that of an individual dam lacerda dos santos et al 2018 altering seasonal flow and sediment regimes and influencing the operation of tgr runoff generation and regime governed by climatic changes particularly snowmelt and cascade reservoir operations have therefore become a significant issue for watershed management numerous studies have been conducted on climatic variations associated with cascade reservoirs however most studies have focused on reservoir constructed in middle to downstream regions neglecting snowmelt effects in upper stream headwater regions hence hydrological modelling and numerical statistical analysis were integrated in this study and the objectives were 1 to reveal climate and runoff feature in the jinsha river basin characterized by constantly varying geographic conditions 2 to assess spatio temporal effects of climatic variations on runoff during snowmelt and rainy periods and 3 to estimate the contribution of upper stream runoff to the outlet with changing climate and hydroelectric exploitation 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the jinsha river is located in the upper reach of the yangtze river in china with a total length of 3 481 km the jinsha river originates from the southern glacier at the geladandong snowy mountain which is the highest peak of the tanggula mountains characterized by complex terrain the jinsha river basin has an elevation of up to 5 142 m fig 1 precipitation distribution shows great heterogeneity li et al 2018 ranging from around 300 mm in the upstream to 1 300 mm in the downstream area the annual minimum temperature occurs in the upstream region 5 6 c and the maximum temperature occurs in the downstream region 21 9 c flood in the jinsha river is governed by melting snow ice and rainstorm the flooding season lasts from june to october when 75 85 of the annual rainfall occurs zhang et al 2019 the average annual runoff of the jinsha river is 145 billion m3 providing approximately 38 of discharge to the upper yangtze river the mainstream of the jinsha river has a high hydropower potential wang et al 2015 and has a potential capacity of about 83 2 million kw with an annual power generation of 361 7 billion kwh six hydropower stations liyuan ahai jinanqiao longkaikou ludila and guanyinyan have been built in the middle stream with the total installed capacity of 13 8 million kw and two hydropower stations xiluodu and xiangjiaba have been built with the total installed capacity of 20 3 million kw in the lower stream moreover yalong river is the biggest tributary of the jinsha river capable of an installed capacity of about 29 0 million kw cascade reservoirs jinpingyiji jinpingerji guandi ertan and tongzilin in the downstream yalong river have been completed with the total installed capacity of 14 7 million kw fig 1 in this study operations of these 13 hydropower stations in the mainstream and tributary of the jinsha river were considered for runoff assessment 2 2 runoff modelling the physically based soil water assessment tool swat was used to obtain the runoff over the basin swat is an effective tool for assessing the hydrological processes of a watershed and has been frequently applied in agricultural areas naturally vegetated areas and cold regions zabaleta et al 2014 ouyang et al 2017 the basic equations for water flow calculation are scs curve number scs 1956 and manning s equation manning 1891 this model takes soil moisture conditions in the early stage flow retention slope peak flow and transmission loss into account to simulate flows in a river channel snowmelt was specifically taken into account for estimating percolation and runoff snowmelt factor maximum air temperature snowpack temperature fraction of areas covered by snow and optimum temperature for snowmelt on a daily scale were included in the modelling process data on terrain soil land use meteorology and agricultural practice are required as input to the swat model terrain data 90 m 90 m were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn soil data 1 1 000 000 were obtained from the china soil scientific database land use data were interpreted from landsat images http glovis usgs gov and updated according to field investigation based on the national landuse database scheme ouyang et al 2018 in order to improve simulation performance data on precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar information at a daily step were obtained from 29 local meteorological stations which were uniformly distributed in and around the basin fig 1 the limitation of reservoir control levels of the original model for small reservoirs was modified to the levels suitable for large reservoirs small reservoirs and medium reservoirs were integrated into one large reservoir in a sub basin zhang et al 2012 reservoir parameters and operation data were provided by the china renewable energy engineering institute and the changjiang institute of survey planning design and research 2 3 model calibration and validation rigorous calibration and validation were conducted after sensitivity analysis of the model a total of 25 parameters were identified as the most sensitive parameters that greatly influenced the reliability of model simulation for surface runoff soil water and groundwater calculation the most sensitive parameters affecting the modelling of freeze thaw processes were particularly calibrated which included snowmelt rate factor smfmx and smfmn snowfall temperature factor sftmp snowmelt base temperature smtmp snowpack temperature lag factor timp and snow water content factor snocovmx the high efficiency method suitable for large watersheds sufi 2 method in swat cup 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 faramarzi et al 2009 was used to calibrate and validate the model sufi 2 method specified the range and absolute sensitivity and offered the updated parameter range after calculation of the objective function evaluation standards and evaluation index of uncertainty shen et al 2014 the data for calibration and validation were observed from 4 hydrological stations zhimenda shigu luning pingshan fig 1 from upstream to downstream on a daily basis provided by changjiang water resources commission of china cwrc the data for warm up calibration and validation were during the period of 2005 2006 the period of 2007 2009 and the period of 2010 2012 respectively pingshan calibration period 2007 2008 validation period 2010 2011 swat model performance was evaluated through statistical methods which employed coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 yan et al 2018 as the evaluation indexes it is usually considered that a satisfactory result a good result and a very good result is achieved when nse is within the ranges of 0 5 0 65 within the ranges of 0 65 0 75 and higher than 0 75 respectively moriasi et al 2015 calibration and validation results for the jinsha river are shown in fig 2 all four hydrologic stations showed good performance during both the calibration and validation periods the values of r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 88 during calibration and ranged from 0 83 to 0 89 during validation besides nse values varied between 0 75 and 0 80 during calibration and 0 68 to 0 83 during validation indicating similarity between observation and simulation calibration and validation on a daily scale may achieve more accurate results as compared to a monthly or annual scale lin et al 2015 overall the results showed that this model can simulate runoff with relatively high accuracy for the jinsha river basin 2 4 data analysis the areas of tuotuohe tth qingshuihe qsh batang bt kangding kd and xianggelila xgll along the mainstream fig 1 were selected to detect the effects of climatic changes particularly snowmelt on runoff variations and runoff contributions of the upper stream to the outlet area yinbin yb these five areas were characterized by different terrain elevation and climatic conditions but were all coupled with freeze thaw processes the variation in meteorological data and runoff discharge were assessed by calculating the sen s slope sen 1968 the sen s slope evaluation method is a non parametric calculation method based on the average slope of the series to assess the linear change trend of values in one column donat et al 2016 this method has been widely applied in evaluating hydrological trends and can mitigate the influence of outliers on the evaluation results meanwhile the mann kendall test method 1975 was used to investigate the temporal trends of meteorological data and runoff discharge the non parametric statistical method mann kendall test is one of the most commonly used methods to test the trend of time series in the fields of hydrology and meteorology yan et al 2017 the method has no special requirement for the distribution of the whole series and its test statistics are defined as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i in which sgn θ 1 when θ 0 sgn θ 1 when θ 0 and sgn θ 0 when θ 0 when s 0 the standardized test statistic is 2 z s 1 n n 1 2 n 5 18 when s 0 the standardized test statistic is 3 z 0 3 when s 0 the standardized test statistic is 4 z s 1 n n 1 2 n 5 18 when z z 1 α 2 it can be considered that the variables in this group showed no significant trend the p value was set to 0 05 for this study the widely used double mass curve method was employed to study variations in the hydrological variables under the combined impacts of natural and anthropogenic changes especially for large scale watersheds walling 2006 li et al 2018 yaghmaei et al 2018 a double mass curve is a set of the cumulated values of one variable the test variable against another related variable the reference variable during an observation period a straight regression line was drawn between these two cumulated variables and a break or inflection of the curve indicates the occurrence of a change between these two variables the detailed calculation was described by wang et al 2019 in this study the method was used to investigate the role of snowmelt rainfall and hydropower exploitation on flow discharge along the mainstream of the jinsha river considering the difference in the orders of magnitude between the upstream flow and downstream flow the dimensionless cumulated coefficients the cumulated flow coefficient cfc and the cumulated precipitation coefficient cpc were used to represent cumulated flow and precipitation the coefficient of a point in the dataset was defined as the ratio of the value of this point to the mean value of this dataset multiple linear regression model is usually an empirical model or approximating function as reported by lee et al 2019 which has been commonly used for prediction and assessment of flow discharge in areas where dams have been constructed zhao et al 2012 hence a multiple linear regression model was utilized to reveal the impacts of individual and cascade reservoirs on variations in runoff 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal feature of precipitation and temperature the smoothed 5 year means of yearly precipitation in five typical areas did not show a similar changing trend fig 3 the mann kendall trend test showed that significant upward trends existed only in tth and kd with p values lower than 0 05 and 0 005 respectively the value of p was approximately 0 25 for the downward precipitation trend in xgll the results of sen s slope estimation on yearly precipitation also showed that precipitation in kd had the most striking upward trend slope value 3 22 among the five areas in contrast a negative value of sen s slope 0 74 was observed for precipitation in xgll indicating a downward trend there was a clear rise in temperature from upstream to middle stream along the jinsha river basin fig 4 the p values of the mann kendall trend test for both daily maximum temperature tmax and daily minimum temperature tmin were lower than 0 005 indicating a highly significant upward trend for all the freeze thaw areas for tmax the value of sen s slope was the highest for qsh 0 053 and the lowest for xgll 0 021 the average value of the slope for tmax was 0 031 for tmin the value of sen s slope was the highest for xgll 0 063 and the lowest for kd 0 021 the average value of the slope for tmin 0 046 was higher than that for tmax 0 031 3 2 spatio temporal feature of runoff spatio temporal feature of runoff discharge in areas along the jinsha river also showed a growing trend fig 5 snowfall accounted for 10 17 and 21 41 of the total yearly precipitation in headwater regions of tth and qsh respectively in the middle reach the proportion of snow was about 5 and no snowfall was observed in yb the average yearly flow over the 46 year period was approximately 15 02 m3 s 1 460 69 m3 s 1 54 66 m3 s 1 834 60 m3 s 1 639 70 m3 s 1 and 1 133 84 m3 s 1 for tth qsh j qingshuihe area in the jinsha river course qsh y qingshuihe area in the yalong river course bt kd and xgll respectively from upstream to downstream the flow in qsh y was much lower than that in qsh j fig 5 meanwhile runoff discharge generally increased from 1972 to 2017 especially for areas in qsh bt kd and xgll variations in seasonal climate and flow discharge from 1972 to 2017 have been shown in fig 6 tmin plays a key role in freezing and thawing processes hence snowmelt periods usually occurred during may and june in tth and qsh and between march and april or may in kd and xgll in contrast snowmelt periods started in february and ended in march in bt a clear snowmelt period was not found in yb notably runoff flow increased sharply since june and then peaked in july in all areas the peaking value in july was 56 67 m3 s 1 1 350 12 m3 s 1 175 63 m3 s 1 2 343 89 m3 s 1 1 855 02 m3 s 1 3 285 61 m3 s 1 and 10 922 65 m3 s 1 in tth qsh j qsh y bt kd xgll and yb respectively melt and rainfall water contributed significantly to the peaking river discharge in tth and qsh in the middle reach the highest precipitation and highest flow occurred at the same time in july except in kd where precipitation and flow were unevenly distributed during rainy periods moreover fv flow variability was used to identify the influence of seasonal changes on flows fv is equal to the ratio of the peak flow to the mean flow for the corresponding month hu et al 2019 the highest fluctuation in runoff was observed in tth and the fv in qsh and bt was also higher than those of other areas it is interesting to note that fv in kd and yb did not vary much throughout the year 3 3 changes in runoff in snowmelt periods two types of runoff scenarios were present in the jinsha river rainfall induced flow in summer and snowmelt induced flow in the warming snowmelt period the trends of flow discharge along the jinsha river during snowmelt periods were detected with the mann kendall test and the sen s slope all the areas showed an upward trend during snowmelt periods from 1972 to 2017 tth p 0 001 qsh j p 0 006 qsh y p 0 009 bt p 0 001 kd p 0 001 and xgll p 0 003 sen s slope in these areas varied from 0 216 to 2 932 with the highest value in qsh j and the lowest value in tth double mass curves between average annual runoff flow cfc and precipitation cpc demonstrated that change points always occurred during snowmelt periods fig 7 the correlations between runoff and precipitation were not stable especially for areas in middle stream during the recent decade there was no reservoir in the upstream and middle stream of the river and the regulation of river flow can be ignored the results revealed that temperature changes have become increasingly vital for runoff discharge throughout the jinsha river 3 4 changes in runoff in rainy periods the upward trends of runoff during rainy periods from 1972 to 2017 in the upper stream of yb tth p 0 018 qsh j p 0 001 qsh y p 0 001 bt p 0 001 kd p 0 002 and xgll p 0 001 were more significant than those during the snowmelt periods sen s slope in rainy periods ranged from 0 377 to 17 211 with the highest value occurring in xgll similar to the results in the snowmelt period the lowest slope was found in tth results of double mass curves between average annual runoff flow cfc and precipitation cpc in rainy periods showed that less abrupt change points were observed than those in snowmelt periods fig 8 this may indicate that precipitation was the dominated factor influencing runoff discharge in rainy periods however most of the change points occurred in recent years in yb there was a very slight change of slope around 1998 and 2012 when construction and operation of individual and cascade dams started overall correlations between runoff and precipitation in rainy periods were more stationary than those in snowmelt periods 3 5 impacts of climatic variations on runoff correlations between precipitation and runoff discharge in snowmelt periods and rainy periods differed with climatic variations in the study area fig 9 in a given month during snowmelt periods the linear fit suggested that strong relationships between snowfall and runoff of that month only existed in qsh y r2 0 73 p 0 05 table 1 further analysis was conducted to investigate correlations between cumulative snowfall for the month of the corresponding winter and snowmelt runoff stronger relationships were found between cumulative snowfall and flow discharge and linear fit r2 values were higher than 0 50 in most areas the strongest correlations also occurred in qsh y r2 0 81 p 0 05 coupled with a little snowfall and freeze thaw processes bt had the least significant correlation r2 0 10 the impacts of snowmelt from changing temperature on runoff were pronounced for the upstream areas tth qsh j and qsh y as the flow difference in snowmelt and rainy periods was not very large fig 9 particularly in qsh y the average rainfall discharge was 129 45 m3 s 1 approximately 2 5 times higher than the snow fed discharge 49 15 m3 s 1 as for rainy periods the relationships between precipitation and runoff discharge were not significant with the highest r2 of 0 69 in qsh y the average r2 was 0 42 for the seven areas in rainy periods but the r2 values were generally higher in the upstream tth qsh j and qsh y with an average value of 0 53 3 6 impacts of hydroelectric cascade exploitation on runoff the past 46 years were divided into three periods based on hydroelectric exploitation characteristics 1972 to 1998 under natural river flow 1999 to 2010 under the operation of individual hydropower station ertan hydropower station j in fig 1 and 2011 to 2017 under the operation of cascade hydropower stations fig 1 runoff contribution analysis of runoff discharge from the upper stream tth to xgll dominated by snowfall and rainfall to the outlet yb discharge was conducted fig 10 the results showed an increase of runoff contribution from 10 57 on average during 1972 1998 to 13 01 on average during 1999 2010 and further up to 13 37 during 2011 2017 contribution of runoff to yb did not differ much in tth and qsh y during different periods on seasonal and annual scales however seasonal differences gradually occurred in the middle reaches qsh j bt kd and xgll as they gradually contributed more runoff to yb in the flood season june july and august with an increase in cascade hydroelectric stations after 1999 on the annual scale runoff contribution increased in response to climatic variations as indicated by the enlarged circles during 1999 2017 streamflow from upper reaches became increasingly important for hydroelectric exploitation in lower reaches due to the changing precipitation and the rise in temperature results of the multiple linear regression model revealed the impacts of individual and cascade reservoirs on variations in runoff the strength of runoff relationships between upper streams and the outlet was clear as r2 was 0 76 p 0 01 for the naturalised river period table 2 however this relationship became much less significant p 0 14 during 1999 2010 and p 0 22 during 2011 2017 after hydroelectric expansion besides runoff variables of bt had insignificant relationships with outlet discharge and were eliminated in the regression model notably the absolute value of the coefficient of qt and qqy was 11 03 and 4 94 during 1972 1998 and 42 66 and 20 37 during 1998 2010 respectively which were higher than coefficients in other areas the absolute value of the coefficient of qt however had dropped to the value approximately equal to values in other areas since the development of cascade dams this also emphasized the contribution of highland upstream runoff to the jinsha river as well as the disruption in runoff due to reservoir operation 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal feature of runoff variations climate variability displayed spatial heterogeneities as upward trends in precipitation were only significant in tth and kd no significant patterns were found in precipitation variations in qsh bt and xgll from upstream to middle stream however sen s slope values of these areas were greater than or approximately equal to 1 implying that the increase in precipitation may play an important role in runoff changes in contrast the rise in temperature from upstream to middle stream along the river was very pronounced over the five decades fig 4 the increasing temperature may exert huge influences on the variability of seasonal snowpack as compared to precipitation under a changing climatic environment adam et al 2009 hence prediction of rainfall induced and snowmelt runoff discharge from coordinated variations of precipitation and temperature has become challenging due to the complex topographical and climatic features in this region gao et al 2019 since climate in the jinsha river basin ranges from plateau climate to subtropical climate the law of changing runoff should be investigated comprehensively precipitation was not high in tth and qsh and started to increase from may and june melt runoff increased during these two months and in july when melt and rainfall water together contributed to the peaking discharge snow or ice induced discharge still dominated a large proportion of the total runoff in summer and precipitation became the main source for runoff yield in august and september zhu et al 2019 as for the middle reach of the river runoff discharge generally increased from 1972 to 2017 the runoff may have experienced a sharp increase since june and peaked in july followed by august and september during rainy periods zhao et al 2019 reported that the rise in flow was due to the increased rainfall water flow in the tibetan plateau as a result of climate change upper reaches characterised by lower temperature and less precipitation showed higher fluctuations than those in lower reaches in seasonal flow discharge governed by aridity moisture during the current year and energy imbalance petersen et al 2012 4 2 implication for runoff changes with climatic variations a warming climate and uneven changes in precipitation across the jinsha river basin altered both annual runoff discharge and seasonal runoff variability in snowmelt periods from 1972 to 2017 all areas in the upper stream of yb showed a significant upward trend meltwater snow and glacier contributed about 12 of the total flow in upstream headwater regions tth and qsh over the last decade which was crucial for water security in downstream areas and further on tgr han et al 2019 the correlations between runoff and precipitation were not stable during this period as indicated by the double mass curves fig 7 variability in snowmelt rates at micro and local scale was always pronounced spatially merio et al 2018 therefore abrupt changes were usually unpredictable these unstable correlations were more common in the middle reach of the river with more abrupt change points detected than those in the upstream due to different snow or glacier melt conditions wu et al 2018b in addition the differences in soil frozen layers in the upper and middle reach also impacted snowmelt runoff generation iwata et al 2018 flow change trends were mainly controlled by climatic changes during snowmelt periods as no reservoir was constructed from tth to xgll in rainy periods from 1972 to 2017 more significant upward trends as compared to those during snowmelt periods were found in runoff although correlations between runoff and precipitation were stable in rainy seasons fig 8 it is difficult to generalise the influences of hydrological process changes caused by climatic changes in high altitude areas on downstream ragettli et al 2016 unlike snowmelt periods when runoff depended largely on cumulative snowfall relationships between precipitation and runoff were not very significant in rainy periods the difference of flow in upstream headwater regions was not very significant between snowmelt and rainy periods but it calls for better estimates of flood frequencies based on snowmelt combined with rainfall frequencies fassnacht and records 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 ultimately the impacts of climatic variations on runoff feature displayed great spatial and temporal heterogeneities 4 3 implication for runoff changes with hydroelectric cascade exploitation runoff changes by hydroelectric exploitation were detected by integrating methods of trend analysis double mass curves and multiple linear regression model seasonal differences showed in up to middle reaches qsh j bt kd and xgll as they contributed more runoff to yb in flood season due to hydroelectric exploitation meanwhile enlarged circles in the latter two periods 1999 2010 and 2011 2017 implied that runoff contribution basically increased on the annual scale under climatic impacts however reservoir regulation effects were not very marked which was in accordance with recent studies huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 investigation of hydrological processes aimed at improving the trade offs related to hydroelectric exploitation should take flow indicators to benefit ecosystems and livelihoods into account hecht et al 2019 moreover reservoir operation in individual and cumulative ways altered the contribution of discharge from upper streams to the outlet in varying degrees fig 10 construction of dams or reservoirs contributed to the degradation of river connectivity grill et al 2019 as a result seasonal differences gradually appeared in the upper stream since the hydroelectric exploitation in 1999 the regularity of runoff relationships between upper streams and the outlet became unpredictable after construction of dams the r2 was higher after damming but the p values decreased which indicated that although the regression results were good reservoir operation modified the influences of flow in upstream headwater regions on the outlet discharge the rise in temperature from upstream regions had huge impacts on hydrological changes regionally oygarden et al 2014 accumulated snowpack had the power to melt with abrupt changes in temperature and snowmelt intensity may become larger than rainfall intensity harpold and kohler 2017 a further analysis was conducted where river flow was regulated to some extent and the result showed that the variations in flow contribution induced by climate change from highland upstream headwater regions cannot be ignored unlike sediment loads controlled by reservoirs li et al 2018 flow variations were predominantly contributed by spatio temporal changes in climate however climate adaptation for environmental sustainability could be realised by river regulation arheimer et al 2017 it is important to investigate runoff laws of the source in headwater areas rather than the sink in middle to downstream areas in the jinsha river which will help improve water resources management systematically across the basin 5 conclusions the results of this study revealed the increased contribution of runoff from upper streams to the outlet in response to climate variations and highlighted the importance of watershed management to cope with the changing climate and hydroelectric exploitation swat model involving optimized snowmelt processes and reservoir operations performed well achieving nse of 0 76 and r2 of 0 85 on average from 1970 to 2017 annual precipitation showed significantly increasing trends in tuotuohe and kangding but a slight downward trend in xianggelila in contrast highly significant upward trends in temperature were observed in all areas peaking runoff occurred in july for all areas with the value of 56 67 m3 s 1 1 350 12 m3 s 1 175 63 m3 s 1 2 343 89 m3 s 1 1 855 02 m3 s 1 3 285 61 m3 s 1 and 10 922 65 m3 s 1 for tuotuohe qingshuihe jinsha qingshuihe yalong batang kangding xianggelila and yibin respectively for headwater regions tuotuohe and qingshuihe snowmelt and rainfall water together contributed to peaking discharge during snowmelt periods runoff in the upper stream was significantly influenced by temperature changes but runoff in the middle stream has become more sensitive to rising temperature lately an increase of runoff contribution to the outlet occurred from 10 57 during naturalised river period to 13 01 during individual reservoir regulation period and further up to 13 37 during cascade reservoir regulation period seasonal differences presented in up to middle reaches where more runoff were gradually contributed in flood seasons due to hydroelectric exploitation after 1999 annual runoff contribution in different areas basically increased in response to climate variations during 1999 2017 results from this study provide a foundation for water resources management in the event of changing climate and will be helpful for regulatory agencies managing dammed rivers better understanding sediment yield processes at a watershed scale as well as cascade reservoir regulation of flow and sediment under the impacts of increasing melting snow ice events are important subjects for future research declaration of competing interest the

100875 china corresponding author this manuscript was handled by huaming guo editor in chief with the assistance of federico maggi associate editor impacts of climatic variations and human activities on water discharge in the lower streams of dammed rivers have been widely studied due to the rich water resources and hydropower potential however the effects of climate variations in upper streams on the whole river system are always ignored therefore integrated methods of hydrological modelling and numerical analysis were employed to identify runoff characteristics in response to climatic variations in conjunction with hydroelectric exploitation in the jinsha river in the asian water tower region while there was no significant rise in annual precipitation for most areas from 1970 to 2017 highly significant upward trends in temperature were observed in areas along the mainstream snowmelt periods varied between upper and middle streams due to constantly varying geographic conditions peaking runoff of 56 67 m3 s 1 1350 12 m3 s 1 175 63 m3 s 1 2343 89 m3 s 1 1855 02 m3 s 1 3285 61 m3 s 1 and 10 922 65 m3 s 1 occurred during july in tuotuohe qingshuihe jinsha qingshuihe yalong batang kangding xianggelila and yibin respectively along the jinsha river during snowmelt periods runoff in the upper stream was greatly influenced by temperature changes however during recent periods runoff in the middle stream has also become sensitive to rising temperatures as indicated by change points the contribution of runoff from upper streams to the outlet increased from 10 57 naturalised river period to 13 01 individual reservoir period followed by a further increase of 13 37 cascade reservoirs period seasonal differences were observed up to the middle streams where more runoff occurred at the outlet during flood seasons due to hydroelectric exploitation after 1999 annually runoff contribution in different areas increased in response to climatic variations during 1999 2017 this study highlights the vulnerability of runoff variations in upper streams to climate change watershed management rather than river regulation alone is needed which could help water resources management for the entire river system keywords hydrological process climate variations snowmelt hydropower reservoir watershed modelling 1 introduction during recent decades global climate change has led to rapid changes in the hydrological cycle and sediment yield at local and regional levels in middle high altitude areas dominated by both snow and rainfall barnett et al 2005 wu et al 2018a two types of flood scenarios exist in such areas summer floods due to extreme rainfall and spring floods due to large scale melting of snow therefore the hydrological regime is vulnerable to climatic variations as snowmelt at higher elevations is integral to the overall hydrological cycle of a basin bajracharya et al 2018 thus it has become difficult to accurately predict the hydrological process hence sustainable development and management of the watershed in middle high altitude regions particularly for catchments with abundant snowfall require a deeper understanding of runoff under the combined impacts of climate change and human activities such as dams irrigation and land utilization construction and regulation of large reservoirs have modified river discharge sediment transport and contaminant migration characteristics fang et al 2012 imposing significant threats to river ecosystems an increasing number of hydropower plants have been built to meet the demands of water and energy zarfl et al 2015 such as on the lancang mekong river wang et al 2017 the amazon river winemiller et al 2016 and the yangtze river fang and rodi 2003 which shape the hydrological ecosystems across the basin the cumulative effects of cascade reservoirs are of greater concern than those of the individual reservoirs due to the larger scale of impacts the effects of cascade reservoirs can be additive or incremental with significant uncertainty habets et al 2018 ouyang et al 2009 though numerous studies have been conducted on estimating the river flow under hydropower regulations it is difficult to identify the impacts of climatic variations on hydrological processes in a watershed just from monitoring river flow data before and after reservoir regulations bin ashraf et al 2016 as compared to limited observation data the modelling approach can comprehensively assess spatio temporal hydrological changes over a large basin changes in surface runoff and river flood associated with rainstorm or snowmelt under reservoir regulations have been studied previously however the effects are unclear when taking both rainfall and snowmelt into account over a large basin globally there are approximately 2 200 major hydropower stations regulating river flow in snow dominated areas lehner et al 2011 assessment of climate change in the hydrological balance of high altitude watersheds requires modelling complex watershed processes at high spatial and temporal scales fang et al 2016 viviroli et al 2011 however not enough knowledge is available on the relationship between runoff reservoir regulation and climate change as hydroelectric plants are usually designed in stationary climatic and hydrological conditions rouhani and leconte 2018 precipitation is known to be a key factor governing runoff regimes nonetheless regulation of water based systems such as reservoirs is more closely associated with variations in temperature than with precipitation in snowmelt dominated catchments barnett et al 2005 this is because snowpack along with accumulating or melting of snow cover can also act as a reservoir for water storage nijssen et al 2001 the jinsha river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau also known as water tower of asia the impact of global warming on glacier retreat and permafrost degradation in this area is significant lutz et al 2014 and will cause large scale and possibly irreparable regional hydrological disturbance the cascade reservoirs in the lower jinsha river have a hydropower production capacity of 40 million kw which is twice the capacity of the three gorges reservoir tgr huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 the cumulative impacts of cascade dams are more pronounced than that of an individual dam lacerda dos santos et al 2018 altering seasonal flow and sediment regimes and influencing the operation of tgr runoff generation and regime governed by climatic changes particularly snowmelt and cascade reservoir operations have therefore become a significant issue for watershed management numerous studies have been conducted on climatic variations associated with cascade reservoirs however most studies have focused on reservoir constructed in middle to downstream regions neglecting snowmelt effects in upper stream headwater regions hence hydrological modelling and numerical statistical analysis were integrated in this study and the objectives were 1 to reveal climate and runoff feature in the jinsha river basin characterized by constantly varying geographic conditions 2 to assess spatio temporal effects of climatic variations on runoff during snowmelt and rainy periods and 3 to estimate the contribution of upper stream runoff to the outlet with changing climate and hydroelectric exploitation 2 methodology 2 1 study area description the jinsha river is located in the upper reach of the yangtze river in china with a total length of 3 481 km the jinsha river originates from the southern glacier at the geladandong snowy mountain which is the highest peak of the tanggula mountains characterized by complex terrain the jinsha river basin has an elevation of up to 5 142 m fig 1 precipitation distribution shows great heterogeneity li et al 2018 ranging from around 300 mm in the upstream to 1 300 mm in the downstream area the annual minimum temperature occurs in the upstream region 5 6 c and the maximum temperature occurs in the downstream region 21 9 c flood in the jinsha river is governed by melting snow ice and rainstorm the flooding season lasts from june to october when 75 85 of the annual rainfall occurs zhang et al 2019 the average annual runoff of the jinsha river is 145 billion m3 providing approximately 38 of discharge to the upper yangtze river the mainstream of the jinsha river has a high hydropower potential wang et al 2015 and has a potential capacity of about 83 2 million kw with an annual power generation of 361 7 billion kwh six hydropower stations liyuan ahai jinanqiao longkaikou ludila and guanyinyan have been built in the middle stream with the total installed capacity of 13 8 million kw and two hydropower stations xiluodu and xiangjiaba have been built with the total installed capacity of 20 3 million kw in the lower stream moreover yalong river is the biggest tributary of the jinsha river capable of an installed capacity of about 29 0 million kw cascade reservoirs jinpingyiji jinpingerji guandi ertan and tongzilin in the downstream yalong river have been completed with the total installed capacity of 14 7 million kw fig 1 in this study operations of these 13 hydropower stations in the mainstream and tributary of the jinsha river were considered for runoff assessment 2 2 runoff modelling the physically based soil water assessment tool swat was used to obtain the runoff over the basin swat is an effective tool for assessing the hydrological processes of a watershed and has been frequently applied in agricultural areas naturally vegetated areas and cold regions zabaleta et al 2014 ouyang et al 2017 the basic equations for water flow calculation are scs curve number scs 1956 and manning s equation manning 1891 this model takes soil moisture conditions in the early stage flow retention slope peak flow and transmission loss into account to simulate flows in a river channel snowmelt was specifically taken into account for estimating percolation and runoff snowmelt factor maximum air temperature snowpack temperature fraction of areas covered by snow and optimum temperature for snowmelt on a daily scale were included in the modelling process data on terrain soil land use meteorology and agricultural practice are required as input to the swat model terrain data 90 m 90 m were downloaded from the geospatial data cloud http www gscloud cn soil data 1 1 000 000 were obtained from the china soil scientific database land use data were interpreted from landsat images http glovis usgs gov and updated according to field investigation based on the national landuse database scheme ouyang et al 2018 in order to improve simulation performance data on precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar information at a daily step were obtained from 29 local meteorological stations which were uniformly distributed in and around the basin fig 1 the limitation of reservoir control levels of the original model for small reservoirs was modified to the levels suitable for large reservoirs small reservoirs and medium reservoirs were integrated into one large reservoir in a sub basin zhang et al 2012 reservoir parameters and operation data were provided by the china renewable energy engineering institute and the changjiang institute of survey planning design and research 2 3 model calibration and validation rigorous calibration and validation were conducted after sensitivity analysis of the model a total of 25 parameters were identified as the most sensitive parameters that greatly influenced the reliability of model simulation for surface runoff soil water and groundwater calculation the most sensitive parameters affecting the modelling of freeze thaw processes were particularly calibrated which included snowmelt rate factor smfmx and smfmn snowfall temperature factor sftmp snowmelt base temperature smtmp snowpack temperature lag factor timp and snow water content factor snocovmx the high efficiency method suitable for large watersheds sufi 2 method in swat cup 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 faramarzi et al 2009 was used to calibrate and validate the model sufi 2 method specified the range and absolute sensitivity and offered the updated parameter range after calculation of the objective function evaluation standards and evaluation index of uncertainty shen et al 2014 the data for calibration and validation were observed from 4 hydrological stations zhimenda shigu luning pingshan fig 1 from upstream to downstream on a daily basis provided by changjiang water resources commission of china cwrc the data for warm up calibration and validation were during the period of 2005 2006 the period of 2007 2009 and the period of 2010 2012 respectively pingshan calibration period 2007 2008 validation period 2010 2011 swat model performance was evaluated through statistical methods which employed coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 yan et al 2018 as the evaluation indexes it is usually considered that a satisfactory result a good result and a very good result is achieved when nse is within the ranges of 0 5 0 65 within the ranges of 0 65 0 75 and higher than 0 75 respectively moriasi et al 2015 calibration and validation results for the jinsha river are shown in fig 2 all four hydrologic stations showed good performance during both the calibration and validation periods the values of r2 ranged from 0 81 to 0 88 during calibration and ranged from 0 83 to 0 89 during validation besides nse values varied between 0 75 and 0 80 during calibration and 0 68 to 0 83 during validation indicating similarity between observation and simulation calibration and validation on a daily scale may achieve more accurate results as compared to a monthly or annual scale lin et al 2015 overall the results showed that this model can simulate runoff with relatively high accuracy for the jinsha river basin 2 4 data analysis the areas of tuotuohe tth qingshuihe qsh batang bt kangding kd and xianggelila xgll along the mainstream fig 1 were selected to detect the effects of climatic changes particularly snowmelt on runoff variations and runoff contributions of the upper stream to the outlet area yinbin yb these five areas were characterized by different terrain elevation and climatic conditions but were all coupled with freeze thaw processes the variation in meteorological data and runoff discharge were assessed by calculating the sen s slope sen 1968 the sen s slope evaluation method is a non parametric calculation method based on the average slope of the series to assess the linear change trend of values in one column donat et al 2016 this method has been widely applied in evaluating hydrological trends and can mitigate the influence of outliers on the evaluation results meanwhile the mann kendall test method 1975 was used to investigate the temporal trends of meteorological data and runoff discharge the non parametric statistical method mann kendall test is one of the most commonly used methods to test the trend of time series in the fields of hydrology and meteorology yan et al 2017 the method has no special requirement for the distribution of the whole series and its test statistics are defined as 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i in which sgn θ 1 when θ 0 sgn θ 1 when θ 0 and sgn θ 0 when θ 0 when s 0 the standardized test statistic is 2 z s 1 n n 1 2 n 5 18 when s 0 the standardized test statistic is 3 z 0 3 when s 0 the standardized test statistic is 4 z s 1 n n 1 2 n 5 18 when z z 1 α 2 it can be considered that the variables in this group showed no significant trend the p value was set to 0 05 for this study the widely used double mass curve method was employed to study variations in the hydrological variables under the combined impacts of natural and anthropogenic changes especially for large scale watersheds walling 2006 li et al 2018 yaghmaei et al 2018 a double mass curve is a set of the cumulated values of one variable the test variable against another related variable the reference variable during an observation period a straight regression line was drawn between these two cumulated variables and a break or inflection of the curve indicates the occurrence of a change between these two variables the detailed calculation was described by wang et al 2019 in this study the method was used to investigate the role of snowmelt rainfall and hydropower exploitation on flow discharge along the mainstream of the jinsha river considering the difference in the orders of magnitude between the upstream flow and downstream flow the dimensionless cumulated coefficients the cumulated flow coefficient cfc and the cumulated precipitation coefficient cpc were used to represent cumulated flow and precipitation the coefficient of a point in the dataset was defined as the ratio of the value of this point to the mean value of this dataset multiple linear regression model is usually an empirical model or approximating function as reported by lee et al 2019 which has been commonly used for prediction and assessment of flow discharge in areas where dams have been constructed zhao et al 2012 hence a multiple linear regression model was utilized to reveal the impacts of individual and cascade reservoirs on variations in runoff 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal feature of precipitation and temperature the smoothed 5 year means of yearly precipitation in five typical areas did not show a similar changing trend fig 3 the mann kendall trend test showed that significant upward trends existed only in tth and kd with p values lower than 0 05 and 0 005 respectively the value of p was approximately 0 25 for the downward precipitation trend in xgll the results of sen s slope estimation on yearly precipitation also showed that precipitation in kd had the most striking upward trend slope value 3 22 among the five areas in contrast a negative value of sen s slope 0 74 was observed for precipitation in xgll indicating a downward trend there was a clear rise in temperature from upstream to middle stream along the jinsha river basin fig 4 the p values of the mann kendall trend test for both daily maximum temperature tmax and daily minimum temperature tmin were lower than 0 005 indicating a highly significant upward trend for all the freeze thaw areas for tmax the value of sen s slope was the highest for qsh 0 053 and the lowest for xgll 0 021 the average value of the slope for tmax was 0 031 for tmin the value of sen s slope was the highest for xgll 0 063 and the lowest for kd 0 021 the average value of the slope for tmin 0 046 was higher than that for tmax 0 031 3 2 spatio temporal feature of runoff spatio temporal feature of runoff discharge in areas along the jinsha river also showed a growing trend fig 5 snowfall accounted for 10 17 and 21 41 of the total yearly precipitation in headwater regions of tth and qsh respectively in the middle reach the proportion of snow was about 5 and no snowfall was observed in yb the average yearly flow over the 46 year period was approximately 15 02 m3 s 1 460 69 m3 s 1 54 66 m3 s 1 834 60 m3 s 1 639 70 m3 s 1 and 1 133 84 m3 s 1 for tth qsh j qingshuihe area in the jinsha river course qsh y qingshuihe area in the yalong river course bt kd and xgll respectively from upstream to downstream the flow in qsh y was much lower than that in qsh j fig 5 meanwhile runoff discharge generally increased from 1972 to 2017 especially for areas in qsh bt kd and xgll variations in seasonal climate and flow discharge from 1972 to 2017 have been shown in fig 6 tmin plays a key role in freezing and thawing processes hence snowmelt periods usually occurred during may and june in tth and qsh and between march and april or may in kd and xgll in contrast snowmelt periods started in february and ended in march in bt a clear snowmelt period was not found in yb notably runoff flow increased sharply since june and then peaked in july in all areas the peaking value in july was 56 67 m3 s 1 1 350 12 m3 s 1 175 63 m3 s 1 2 343 89 m3 s 1 1 855 02 m3 s 1 3 285 61 m3 s 1 and 10 922 65 m3 s 1 in tth qsh j qsh y bt kd xgll and yb respectively melt and rainfall water contributed significantly to the peaking river discharge in tth and qsh in the middle reach the highest precipitation and highest flow occurred at the same time in july except in kd where precipitation and flow were unevenly distributed during rainy periods moreover fv flow variability was used to identify the influence of seasonal changes on flows fv is equal to the ratio of the peak flow to the mean flow for the corresponding month hu et al 2019 the highest fluctuation in runoff was observed in tth and the fv in qsh and bt was also higher than those of other areas it is interesting to note that fv in kd and yb did not vary much throughout the year 3 3 changes in runoff in snowmelt periods two types of runoff scenarios were present in the jinsha river rainfall induced flow in summer and snowmelt induced flow in the warming snowmelt period the trends of flow discharge along the jinsha river during snowmelt periods were detected with the mann kendall test and the sen s slope all the areas showed an upward trend during snowmelt periods from 1972 to 2017 tth p 0 001 qsh j p 0 006 qsh y p 0 009 bt p 0 001 kd p 0 001 and xgll p 0 003 sen s slope in these areas varied from 0 216 to 2 932 with the highest value in qsh j and the lowest value in tth double mass curves between average annual runoff flow cfc and precipitation cpc demonstrated that change points always occurred during snowmelt periods fig 7 the correlations between runoff and precipitation were not stable especially for areas in middle stream during the recent decade there was no reservoir in the upstream and middle stream of the river and the regulation of river flow can be ignored the results revealed that temperature changes have become increasingly vital for runoff discharge throughout the jinsha river 3 4 changes in runoff in rainy periods the upward trends of runoff during rainy periods from 1972 to 2017 in the upper stream of yb tth p 0 018 qsh j p 0 001 qsh y p 0 001 bt p 0 001 kd p 0 002 and xgll p 0 001 were more significant than those during the snowmelt periods sen s slope in rainy periods ranged from 0 377 to 17 211 with the highest value occurring in xgll similar to the results in the snowmelt period the lowest slope was found in tth results of double mass curves between average annual runoff flow cfc and precipitation cpc in rainy periods showed that less abrupt change points were observed than those in snowmelt periods fig 8 this may indicate that precipitation was the dominated factor influencing runoff discharge in rainy periods however most of the change points occurred in recent years in yb there was a very slight change of slope around 1998 and 2012 when construction and operation of individual and cascade dams started overall correlations between runoff and precipitation in rainy periods were more stationary than those in snowmelt periods 3 5 impacts of climatic variations on runoff correlations between precipitation and runoff discharge in snowmelt periods and rainy periods differed with climatic variations in the study area fig 9 in a given month during snowmelt periods the linear fit suggested that strong relationships between snowfall and runoff of that month only existed in qsh y r2 0 73 p 0 05 table 1 further analysis was conducted to investigate correlations between cumulative snowfall for the month of the corresponding winter and snowmelt runoff stronger relationships were found between cumulative snowfall and flow discharge and linear fit r2 values were higher than 0 50 in most areas the strongest correlations also occurred in qsh y r2 0 81 p 0 05 coupled with a little snowfall and freeze thaw processes bt had the least significant correlation r2 0 10 the impacts of snowmelt from changing temperature on runoff were pronounced for the upstream areas tth qsh j and qsh y as the flow difference in snowmelt and rainy periods was not very large fig 9 particularly in qsh y the average rainfall discharge was 129 45 m3 s 1 approximately 2 5 times higher than the snow fed discharge 49 15 m3 s 1 as for rainy periods the relationships between precipitation and runoff discharge were not significant with the highest r2 of 0 69 in qsh y the average r2 was 0 42 for the seven areas in rainy periods but the r2 values were generally higher in the upstream tth qsh j and qsh y with an average value of 0 53 3 6 impacts of hydroelectric cascade exploitation on runoff the past 46 years were divided into three periods based on hydroelectric exploitation characteristics 1972 to 1998 under natural river flow 1999 to 2010 under the operation of individual hydropower station ertan hydropower station j in fig 1 and 2011 to 2017 under the operation of cascade hydropower stations fig 1 runoff contribution analysis of runoff discharge from the upper stream tth to xgll dominated by snowfall and rainfall to the outlet yb discharge was conducted fig 10 the results showed an increase of runoff contribution from 10 57 on average during 1972 1998 to 13 01 on average during 1999 2010 and further up to 13 37 during 2011 2017 contribution of runoff to yb did not differ much in tth and qsh y during different periods on seasonal and annual scales however seasonal differences gradually occurred in the middle reaches qsh j bt kd and xgll as they gradually contributed more runoff to yb in the flood season june july and august with an increase in cascade hydroelectric stations after 1999 on the annual scale runoff contribution increased in response to climatic variations as indicated by the enlarged circles during 1999 2017 streamflow from upper reaches became increasingly important for hydroelectric exploitation in lower reaches due to the changing precipitation and the rise in temperature results of the multiple linear regression model revealed the impacts of individual and cascade reservoirs on variations in runoff the strength of runoff relationships between upper streams and the outlet was clear as r2 was 0 76 p 0 01 for the naturalised river period table 2 however this relationship became much less significant p 0 14 during 1999 2010 and p 0 22 during 2011 2017 after hydroelectric expansion besides runoff variables of bt had insignificant relationships with outlet discharge and were eliminated in the regression model notably the absolute value of the coefficient of qt and qqy was 11 03 and 4 94 during 1972 1998 and 42 66 and 20 37 during 1998 2010 respectively which were higher than coefficients in other areas the absolute value of the coefficient of qt however had dropped to the value approximately equal to values in other areas since the development of cascade dams this also emphasized the contribution of highland upstream runoff to the jinsha river as well as the disruption in runoff due to reservoir operation 4 discussion 4 1 spatio temporal feature of runoff variations climate variability displayed spatial heterogeneities as upward trends in precipitation were only significant in tth and kd no significant patterns were found in precipitation variations in qsh bt and xgll from upstream to middle stream however sen s slope values of these areas were greater than or approximately equal to 1 implying that the increase in precipitation may play an important role in runoff changes in contrast the rise in temperature from upstream to middle stream along the river was very pronounced over the five decades fig 4 the increasing temperature may exert huge influences on the variability of seasonal snowpack as compared to precipitation under a changing climatic environment adam et al 2009 hence prediction of rainfall induced and snowmelt runoff discharge from coordinated variations of precipitation and temperature has become challenging due to the complex topographical and climatic features in this region gao et al 2019 since climate in the jinsha river basin ranges from plateau climate to subtropical climate the law of changing runoff should be investigated comprehensively precipitation was not high in tth and qsh and started to increase from may and june melt runoff increased during these two months and in july when melt and rainfall water together contributed to the peaking discharge snow or ice induced discharge still dominated a large proportion of the total runoff in summer and precipitation became the main source for runoff yield in august and september zhu et al 2019 as for the middle reach of the river runoff discharge generally increased from 1972 to 2017 the runoff may have experienced a sharp increase since june and peaked in july followed by august and september during rainy periods zhao et al 2019 reported that the rise in flow was due to the increased rainfall water flow in the tibetan plateau as a result of climate change upper reaches characterised by lower temperature and less precipitation showed higher fluctuations than those in lower reaches in seasonal flow discharge governed by aridity moisture during the current year and energy imbalance petersen et al 2012 4 2 implication for runoff changes with climatic variations a warming climate and uneven changes in precipitation across the jinsha river basin altered both annual runoff discharge and seasonal runoff variability in snowmelt periods from 1972 to 2017 all areas in the upper stream of yb showed a significant upward trend meltwater snow and glacier contributed about 12 of the total flow in upstream headwater regions tth and qsh over the last decade which was crucial for water security in downstream areas and further on tgr han et al 2019 the correlations between runoff and precipitation were not stable during this period as indicated by the double mass curves fig 7 variability in snowmelt rates at micro and local scale was always pronounced spatially merio et al 2018 therefore abrupt changes were usually unpredictable these unstable correlations were more common in the middle reach of the river with more abrupt change points detected than those in the upstream due to different snow or glacier melt conditions wu et al 2018b in addition the differences in soil frozen layers in the upper and middle reach also impacted snowmelt runoff generation iwata et al 2018 flow change trends were mainly controlled by climatic changes during snowmelt periods as no reservoir was constructed from tth to xgll in rainy periods from 1972 to 2017 more significant upward trends as compared to those during snowmelt periods were found in runoff although correlations between runoff and precipitation were stable in rainy seasons fig 8 it is difficult to generalise the influences of hydrological process changes caused by climatic changes in high altitude areas on downstream ragettli et al 2016 unlike snowmelt periods when runoff depended largely on cumulative snowfall relationships between precipitation and runoff were not very significant in rainy periods the difference of flow in upstream headwater regions was not very significant between snowmelt and rainy periods but it calls for better estimates of flood frequencies based on snowmelt combined with rainfall frequencies fassnacht and records 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 ultimately the impacts of climatic variations on runoff feature displayed great spatial and temporal heterogeneities 4 3 implication for runoff changes with hydroelectric cascade exploitation runoff changes by hydroelectric exploitation were detected by integrating methods of trend analysis double mass curves and multiple linear regression model seasonal differences showed in up to middle reaches qsh j bt kd and xgll as they contributed more runoff to yb in flood season due to hydroelectric exploitation meanwhile enlarged circles in the latter two periods 1999 2010 and 2011 2017 implied that runoff contribution basically increased on the annual scale under climatic impacts however reservoir regulation effects were not very marked which was in accordance with recent studies huang et al 2018 li et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 investigation of hydrological processes aimed at improving the trade offs related to hydroelectric exploitation should take flow indicators to benefit ecosystems and livelihoods into account hecht et al 2019 moreover reservoir operation in individual and cumulative ways altered the contribution of discharge from upper streams to the outlet in varying degrees fig 10 construction of dams or reservoirs contributed to the degradation of river connectivity grill et al 2019 as a result seasonal differences gradually appeared in the upper stream since the hydroelectric exploitation in 1999 the regularity of runoff relationships between upper streams and the outlet became unpredictable after construction of dams the r2 was higher after damming but the p values decreased which indicated that although the regression results were good reservoir operation modified the influences of flow in upstream headwater regions on the outlet discharge the rise in temperature from upstream regions had huge impacts on hydrological changes regionally oygarden et al 2014 accumulated snowpack had the power to melt with abrupt changes in temperature and snowmelt intensity may become larger than rainfall intensity harpold and kohler 2017 a further analysis was conducted where river flow was regulated to some extent and the result showed that the variations in flow contribution induced by climate change from highland upstream headwater regions cannot be ignored unlike sediment loads controlled by reservoirs li et al 2018 flow variations were predominantly contributed by spatio temporal changes in climate however climate adaptation for environmental sustainability could be realised by river regulation arheimer et al 2017 it is important to investigate runoff laws of the source in headwater areas rather than the sink in middle to downstream areas in the jinsha river which will help improve water resources management systematically across the basin 5 conclusions the results of this study revealed the increased contribution of runoff from upper streams to the outlet in response to climate variations and highlighted the importance of watershed management to cope with the changing climate and hydroelectric exploitation swat model involving optimized snowmelt processes and reservoir operations performed well achieving nse of 0 76 and r2 of 0 85 on average from 1970 to 2017 annual precipitation showed significantly increasing trends in tuotuohe and kangding but a slight downward trend in xianggelila in contrast highly significant upward trends in temperature were observed in all areas peaking runoff occurred in july for all areas with the value of 56 67 m3 s 1 1 350 12 m3 s 1 175 63 m3 s 1 2 343 89 m3 s 1 1 855 02 m3 s 1 3 285 61 m3 s 1 and 10 922 65 m3 s 1 for tuotuohe qingshuihe jinsha qingshuihe yalong batang kangding xianggelila and yibin respectively for headwater regions tuotuohe and qingshuihe snowmelt and rainfall water together contributed to peaking discharge during snowmelt periods runoff in the upper stream was significantly influenced by temperature changes but runoff in the middle stream has become more sensitive to rising temperature lately an increase of runoff contribution to the outlet occurred from 10 57 during naturalised river period to 13 01 during individual reservoir regulation period and further up to 13 37 during cascade reservoir regulation period seasonal differences presented in up to middle reaches where more runoff were gradually contributed in flood seasons due to hydroelectric exploitation after 1999 annual runoff contribution in different areas basically increased in response to climate variations during 1999 2017 results from this study provide a foundation for water resources management in the event of changing climate and will be helpful for regulatory agencies managing dammed rivers better understanding sediment yield processes at a watershed scale as

5803,accelerating multiphase water transformation affects runoff processes and components greatly and have changed the spatiotemporal patterns of water resources in the third polar region the source region of the yangtze river is one location where accelerated warming has resulted in the gradual extension of the ablation period since 1990 this has caused the acceleration of multiphase water transformation characterized by increases in the rate of glacial retreat maximum freezing depth and annual actual evapotranspiration and by decreased snowfall in response the total runoff increased by 53 at the tuotuohe national hydrological station tth and 6 at the zhimenda national hydrological station zmd during the periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2017 respectively under these conditions runoff components were being determined based on stable isotope tracing substantial seasonal differences in δ18o δd among precipitation river water supra permafrost water and glaciers snow meltwater indicate that the runoff has been replenished by multiple components and that these first infiltrate the ground becoming part of the groundwater and then recharge river water supra permafrost water rather than precipitation now dominates river water based on the end member mixing analysis model supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of river water at the tth station from june 2016 to may 2018 the corresponding values at the zmd station were 49 34 and 17 additionally there are also differences in the seasonal contributions of runoff components to river water seasonal variations in the freezing and thawing of the active layer directly trigger the runoff process future research should be focused on determining the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of precipitation supra permafrost water runoff which will aid the assessment of the impacts of an unstable asian water tower on water resources keywords runoff permafrost stable isotope accelerating multiphase water transformation yangtze river 1 introduction multiphase water transformation mwt refers to the frequent conversion of bodies of water between the solid liquid and gaseous states which is a crucial link in the water cycle that greatly affects the spatiotemporal patterns of water resources additionally mwt serves an important hydrological function in safeguarding freshwater supplies and maintaining the ecological security of the watershed these transformations are also characterized by substantial cryosphere retreat on the tibetan plateau yao et al 2012 for example the latest report from the second tibetan plateau examination http www xinhuanet com tech 2018 09 10 c 1123404302 htm states that the glacial area has declined by 15 and the permafrost area has decreased by 16 whereas the lake area has increased from 40000 km2 to 47400 km2 over the past 50 years in the qilian mountains the acceleration of the mwt was quantified by three facts the glacier area retreat rate accelerated by 50 after 1990 the percentage of snowfall in precipitation decreased by 7 after 1990 and the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation increased by 60 since 1990 which has increased runoff and changed seasonal runoff patterns and runoff components permafrost regions occupy approximately 53 of the land area on the tibetan plateau the highest and most extensive high altitude permafrost on earth zhou et al 2000 these regions are highly sensitive to climate change the cryosphere provides an important source of water in alpine regions and melting rates have increased under warming climatic conditions although warmer temperatures initially accelerated the cryosphere melting this contribution is expected to decrease as the cryosphere diminishes pu et al 2017 runoff components local water resources hydrological processes and ecological evolution will also undergo changes accordingly however our understanding of the hydrological function of these cryosphere regions remains limited owing to the limited observations of permafrost rivers and the difficulty in distinguishing between the influence of glaciers snow melting and permafrost thawing pu et al 2017 therefore it is essential to identify the relevant hydrological processes and evaluate the contribution of cryosphere meltwater to local water resources thereby providing a reference for the effective use of water resources and predictions of how they may change such information will also provide the insights needed to develop tourism agriculture and animal husbandry and ensure ecological protection sorg et al 2012 noted that there is a need for more integrative studies to address changes in all runoff components i e precipitation groundwater and meltwater from snow glaciers and permafrost to better appraise the degree of cryosphere depletion and subsequent changes in fluvial runoff in alpine regions to predict future changes in regional water resources it is necessary to develop a holistic understanding of the contributions of different types of cryosphere meltwater including those from glacial snow and permafrost to mountain discharge and to assess the magnitude and variability of hydrologic responses to fluctuating cryosphere conditions owing to the range of spatiotemporal scales available the δ18o and δd in various bodies of water have become effective means for investigating hydrologic systems kong and pang 2012 craig 1961 established the first global metrological water line gmwl which provided the coordinate system for isotopic hydrology hughes and crawford 2012 proposed a new precipitation weighted method for determining the meteoric water line for hydrological applications when stable isotope δ18o δd and d excess values in water are examined at the basinal or regional scale important information on hydrological processes is readily discernible therefore isotopic values have been widely used in hydrology pu et al 2017 they can be used to clarify the mechanisms controlling stream water behavior and to delineate flow paths and flow systems at the catchment scale eckhardt 2008 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 confirmed the sources of groundwater by stable isotope tracing it can be also applied in confirming groundwater process in arid region or inland basins guo et al 2016 2018 aggarwal et al 2016 founded that stable isotope ratios can used to monitor changes in the character of precipitation in response to periodic variability or changes in climate furthermore isotopic tracers have been employed to investigate biogeochemical cycling gibson et al 2005 to identify the residence time of stream water and to investigate the mechanisms affecting stream water chemistry kling and nachtnebel 2009 the contributions of different components to runoff can be identified via hydrograph separation using stable isotopes kortatsi 2006 such results have shown that cryosphere meltwater is an important end member of river water in cold regions these studies have confirmed the importance of cryosphere meltwater to water resources under global warming which have also been helpful for establishing and redefining hydrological models in tibetan plateau the source region of yangtze river sryr located in the hinterland of the tibetan plateau has a concentrated distribution of glaciers and an area of 1215 53 km2 the study region is also within the continuous permafrost zone fig 1 permafrost and glaciers are very important for maintaining surface water resources and ecological balance moreover the study region is central to the formation evolution distribution conservation and regulation of water resources and the ecological security of the yangtze river basin li et al 2013 at the same time glaciers and snow precipitation and permafrost are the main sources of the water supply in the region and affect the inter annual fluctuations and long term evolutionary trends of surface water resources when these effects spread to the mid stream and down stream regions the sustainable utilization of water resources throughout the yangtze river basin will be affected zhu et al 2011 in recent years much research has been conducted on the water resources and ecological and environmental evolution of the sryr yang et al 2003 analyzed the effects of glacial changes on fluvial runoff using two sets of remote sensing image data they also analyzed the influence of climate vegetation permafrost system factors on fluvial runoff wang et al 2003 the variations in runoff and driving mechanisms have also been explored cao et al 2007 yu et al 2008 zhu et al 2011 qian et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 studied the causes of runoff from precipitation and potential evaporation by means of computational modeling meanwhile lv and zheng 2006 discussed the impacts of global climate change on the alpine meadow ecosystem in the sryr and zhang 2004 analyzed regional evaporation characteristics and their variations finally zhang et al 2015 also explored the variations in alpine meadow soil temperatures and moisture contents previous studies have focused on the statistical analysis of runoff and its associated influencing factors but the quantification on the impacts of cryosphere meltwater to runoff in the sryr remains ambiguous only minimal information is available regarding the importance of cryosphere meltwater and hydrological processes however this information is critical for research on the hydrological process and for water resource management the question of how to develop a holistic understanding of the importance of cryosphere meltwater and its hydrological effects has become an increasingly important issue in cold hydrology therefore it is necessary to understand the contribution of cryosphere meltwater including glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water to outlet runoff and to assess the magnitude and variability of hydrologic responses to mwt such information will provide an adequate basis for predicting future trends in runoff variability to clearly assess the influence of active thawing on runoff processes in permafrost regions of the third polar region the sryr where the influences of glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water are substantial was selected and observed the hydrological processes and climatic changes monitored from 1961 to 2018 and the analysis of water isotopes across multiple spatiotemporal scales from 2016 to 2018 in the sryr were used to 1 confirm mwt in the study region climate warming and cryosphere retreat 2 document the spatiotemporal patterns of δ18o and δ2h in different water bodies 3 evaluate the contribution of glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water to river water and its hydrological functions and 4 describe the runoff process in the cryosphere region during mwt achieving these aims is expected to improve of understanding of the effects of variation in soil freezing and thawing on runoff processes in permafrost regions and to provide insights into the hydrological function of mwt in the third polar region 2 study region the tibetan plateau and its adjacent mountains referred to by scientists as the third pole qiu 2008 is geomorphologically the largest and highest mountain region on earth the sryr is located in the hinterland of the tibetan plateau between 90 43 96 45 e and 32 30 35 35 n which is defined here as the area north of zmd station fig 1 it is an important ecological barrier and water conservation region in china the sryr and the hoh xil inland water basins were separated from the hoh xil mountains and the wulan wula mountains the southern boundaries are the tanggula mountains and sederi peak which contain the watersheds of the nujiang river and the lancangjiang river respectively the yellow river basin and the inland qaidam basin were separated from the kunlun mountains and their mountain branch the bayan hara mountains the mean altitude reaches 4000 m above sea level with a decreasing elevation from west to east yu et al 2013 that covers an area of approximately 138 000 km2 7 8 of the total area of the yangtze river basin most tributaries start from glaciers and form very dense drainage networks such as those of the chumaer river in the north tuotuohe river in the central regions and dangqu river in the south pu 1994 the glaciers in the sryr are mainly distributed along the north oriented slopes of the tanggula mountains and sedir mountains and the south oriented slopes of the kunlun mountains with a total area of 1496 04 km2 a reserve of 1496 04 108 m3 and annual ablation of 11 87 108 m3 yao et al 2014 the region is not only one of the main wetland ecosystem areas on the tibetan plateau but it also covers the most concentrated areas of the permafrost the permafrost has a thickness of 10 120 m which accounts for 77 of the total basin area and most surface soils are frozen during winter and thaw in summer and active layer thicknesses range from 1 to 4 m gao et al 2012 the climate of the sryr is a typical cold plateau climate characterized by low temperatures strong radiation and two seasons dry and wet with rainfall and high temperatures occurring during the same period hayashi et al 2015 from the southeast to the northwest the differences in the temperature and precipitation gradients are substantial annual average temperatures range from 3 to 5 5 c the warmest month is july during which the average temperature ranges from 3 to 17 3 c the maximum temperatures of some areas are below 10 c there is no absolutely frost free period and the annual precipitation ranges from 221 5 to 515 mm yu et al 2014 the mean annual precipitation varies considerably over the reserve and 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during summer with the highest precipitation occurring in august the geology consists of quaternary fluvial deposits mesozoic clastic rocks carbonates evaporites and volcanic rocks the mineral compositions of deposits contain large amounts of reactive quartz and a lower percentage of plagioclase potash feldspar calcite illite kaolinite chlorite montmorillonite hematite and gypsum the tuotuohe river basin located on the northern slope of the tanggula mountains in the northwestern geladandong glaciated area is one of the primary glacial areas in the sryr it occupies an area of approximately 15000 km2 above the tuotuohe national hydrological tth station fig 1 according to the chinese glacier inventory cgi for the yangtze river there are 92 glaciers within the tuotuohe river basin and these glaciers have a total area and volume of 389 09 km2 and 42 15 km3 respectively and account for 12 1 30 5 and 42 of the total number area and volume respectively of all glaciers in the sryr shi 2005 3 data 3 1 water samples collection and preparation we have collected a total of 813 samples of precipitation river water supra permafrost water and glaciers snow meltwater in the sryr table 1 the samples were collected within three hydrological years during from june 2016 to may 2018 it is very difficult to observe the hydrological process because of the harsh natural conditions in the tibetan plateau therefore the dominant contributor to water resources remains largely unknown therefore various water body samples were collected systematically for the first time in the study region precipitation river water supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater samples were collected across the whole region with continuously spatial and temporal pattern the sampling details for specific water types are described in the following sections 3 1 1 precipitation samples a total of 385 event scale samples were collected within three hydrological years during from june 2016 to may 2018 at different altitudes for two stations zmd 92 26 e 34 14 n 3540 m and tth 34 22 n 92 24 e 4533 m in the sryr fig 1 during sample collection precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at the corresponding national meteorological stations to avoid contamination from pollutant sources the sample collectors were placed on a rooftop 8 m above the ground and 1 m above the roof rainfall or snow was sampled manually using a wet collector which was fitted with a 5 l polyethylene collecting flask at the bottom and a polyethylene funnel of 26 cm in diameter before installation of collectors the funnels and flasks were carefully cleaned and dried the collected rainwater or snow was loaded into pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles after each precipitation event 3 1 2 river water in order to explore the temporal variability of stable isotopes in river water samples were collected weekly within three hydrological years from two national hydrological observation stations at the outlets of tuotuohe river and the source region of the yangtze river leading to a total of 200 samples table 1 zmd national hydrological observation station is located in the outlet of the source region of the yangtze river and tth national hydrological observation station is located in the outlet of tuotuohe river fig 1 samples were collected at the zmd and tth hydrological observation stations only throughout the ablation period may october owing to the freezing of rivers in winter and spring 3 1 3 supra permafrost water samples supra permafrost water is the most widely distributed groundwater type in the sryr and it is mainly stored in the permafrost active layer fig 2 the supra permafrost water is affected by permafrost and seasonally frozen soils the hydrogeological characteristics are complex and changeable and the aquifer is mainly composed of a quaternary loose layer and a weathered and fractured zone of bedrock in the mountainous area as a relatively impermeable layer permafrost not only stores a large amount of solid water but also maintains the surface water and groundwater levels of rivers lakes and swamps on the tibetan plateau cheng and jin 2013 moreover supra permafrost water is the main runoff component and the higher the elevation the greater its contribution in recent years climate warming has accelerated the speed of groundwater circulation and shortened the cycle periods in permafrost regions wang et al 2007a b to study the spatiotemporal patterns of stable isotopes in supra permafrost water 114 samples were collected approximately once every 10 days in this study by comprehensive sampling in the ablation periods may october during from june 2016 to may 2018 sampling was performed manually the samples were collected continuously from sites at geladandong 91 38 e 33 95 n 5397 m tanggula 91 96 e 33 0 n 5056 m and yuzhufeng 94 16 e 35 62 n 4954 m approximately once every 10 days fig 1 firstly a 2 m deep profile of the permafrost active layer was dug at each of the sampling points secondly the collected water samples were then immediately filtered with a 0 45 µm millipore filtration membrane at the bottom of each profile 3 1 4 glaciers snow meltwater one hundred fourteen samples were collected from streams flowing out of the glacier front at a sampling interval of approximately once every 10 days during the ablation period from june 2016 to may 2018 the samples were continuously collected at jianggudiru glacier 91 e 33 45 n 5281 m dongkemadi glacier 92 e 33 n 5423 m and yuzhufeng glacier 94 22 e 35 63 n 5180 m fig 1 the geladandong region is extremely remote and so data from the continuous sampling at the hoh xil ecological protection station in qinghai province is very precious there are also observation stations of the chinese academy of sciences cas at dongkemadi glacier and yuzhufeng glacier so these were convenient for sample collection jianggudiru glacier is located on mt geladandong in the tanggula mountains which covers an area of 13 13 km2 and a length of 12 8 km it is the source of the tuotuohe river and the western source region of the yangtze river dongkemadi glacier is located in the central tanggula mountains fig 1 it covers an area of 15 89 km2 and has a terminal altitude of 5275 m with a gentle slope and a clean surface absent of moraines this glacier supplies an increasing amount of meltwater to the dangqu river and is the southern source region of the yangtze river yuzhufeng glacier is located in the eastern kunlun mountains covering an area of 6 75 km2 with a length of 5 7 km the chumaerhe river originated from this glacier which serves as the northern source region of the yangtze river 3 2

previously been applied in a study of annual temperature and precipitation change in southwestern china 4 methods 4 1 hydrograph separation hooper et al 1990 and hooper 2003 introduced end member mixing analysis emma using chemical isotopic compositions in waters the techniques involve graphical analyses in which chemical and isotopic parameters are used to represent the designated end members tracers are assumed to be constant in time and space essentially the changing composition of the water can be considered a result of intersections during its passage through each landscape tracers can be used to determine both sources and flow paths the emma tracer approach has become a common method for analyzing potential water sources contributing to stream flow gibson et al 2005 peng et al 2010 both the two and three component method can be described as a uniform equation 1 q t m 1 n q m q t c t j m 1 n q m c m j j l k where qt is total runoff discharge qm is the discharge of component m and cm j is the tracer j incorporated in the component m as refer to isotope hydrograph separation one of the tracers should be a kind of isotope if there is more than 4 end members it must be to consider using a calculation software such as e g isosource phillips and gregg 2003 herein a three end member mass balance mixing model such as the following was employed to calculate the contribution of up to three water sources in stream water 2a x s f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 2b y s f 1 y 1 f 2 y 2 f 3 y 3 in eq 2 x and y represent concentrations of two types of different tracers δ18o and d excess were chosen for comparison in this study the subscripts represent stream water sample and 1 2 and 3 represent water from the respective contribution of three respective source waters end members to s stream water the fraction of each end source is denoted by f the solutions for f1 f2 and f3 in regards to tracer concentrations in eq 2 can be expressed as follows 3a f 1 x 3 x s x 3 x 2 y 3 y s y 3 y 2 y 1 y 3 y 3 y 2 x 1 x 3 x 3 x 2 3b f 2 x 3 x s x 3 x 1 y 3 y s y 3 y 1 y 2 y 3 y 3 y 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 1 3c f 3 1 f 1 f 2 eq 3 can be modified to be a two end member mass balance mixing equation when stream water derives just from two end sources if so only one chemical trace can be considered in eq 1 4 x s f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 and the solution for f1 and f2in terms of tracer concentrations in eq 1 can be expressed as follows peng et al 2012a b 5a f 1 x s x 2 x 1 x 2 5b f 2 1 f 1 4 2 uncertainty of hydrograph separation the uncertainty of tracer based hydrograph separations can be calculated using the error propagation technique genereux 1998 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 pu et al 2017 this approach considers errors of all separation equation variables assuming that the contribution of a specific streamflow component to streamflow is a function of several variables c1 c2 cn and the uncertainty in each variable is independent of the uncertainty in the others the uncertainty in the target variable e g the contribution of a specific streamflow component is estimated using the following equation uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 6 wfx z c 1 w c 1 2 z c 2 w c 2 2 z c n w c n 2 where w represents the uncertainty in the variable specified in the ubscript fx is the contribution of a specific streamflow component o streamflow the software package matlab is used to apply eq 3 to the different hydrograph separations in this study 5 results 5 1 change of climate cryosphere and runoff in sryr 5 1 1 climate climate warming in the sryr can be proved by two facts the annual average temperature which is 0 4 c decade and the 0 1 c decade reduction in the dtr from 1961 to 2017 fig 3 in these conditions the gradual extension of the ablation period can be confirmed by the decreased id 5 5 d decade and fd 4 3 d decade although gsl increased 2 7 d decade from 1961 to 2017 fig 3 all five meteorological observation stations exhibited notable increases in temperature including greater degrees of warming with increases in altitude furthermore the warming and the lengthening of the ablation period have accelerated since 1990 fig 3 for precipitation it also increased from 35 2 mm decade in 1961 2017 fig 4 and the r10 mm r20 mm and r25 mm increased by 0 5 d decade 0 1 d decade and 0 03 d decade fig 4 respectively these changes indicate an increasingly humid climate in study region however the rate of precipitation increase declined by 21 5 mm decade since 1990 fig 4 the rate of increase for r10 mm r20 mm and r25 mm also decreased after 1990 fig 4 these results suggest that the mwt has mainly been driven by accelerated warming in the sryr especially the lengthening of the ablation period and accelerating warming after 1990 5 1 2 cryosphere glacial shrinkage has become more serious and exhibited accelerated retreat rates since 1990 consistent with global climatic warming during 1969 1971 1999 2002 it was found that the most glaciers in the sryr were in a stage of retreat and the mean glacier length had retreated by 108 3 m and an area of 68 13 km2 was lost fig 5 xu et al 2013 and the meteorological data revealed that the retreat of glaciers was mainly caused by increasing temperatures the total glacial area in the basin was 1060 2 km2 in 2009 yao et al 2014 and it has retreated by 155 33 km2 from 1969 1971 2009 in the sryr meanwhile the total glacial area has decreased by 45 75 km2 between 1964 and 2010 in geladandong fig 5 wang et al 2013 moreover the rate of glacial retreat has accelerated in sryr and geladandong fig 5 table 2 field measurements have also demonstrated the heavy ablation of dongkemadi glacier between 2008 and 2012 the glacial terminus has retreated by 19 7 m zhang et al 2013a b the equilibrium line altitude was 120 m higher than in the early 1990 s the mass balance was 1584 mm and the increasing summer temperature was the controlling factor on glacial ablation zhang et al 2013a b snowfall increased form 1961 1990 and decreased from 1991 to 2017 fig 5 table 2 additionally snow cover in the study region exhibited a slight decrease overall between 2005 and 2014 permafrost degradation has also been substantial in the study area based on observation data table 3 the maximum freezing depth has decreased from 1961 to 1970 to 1990 2001 in sryr wang et al 2005 as shown in fig 5 the depth of the permafrost active layer has also increased in the sryr between 2006 and 2011 table 3 the mean rising rates of permafrost temperatures at 15 m depth and at the permafrost table were 0 018 c a and 0 015 c a from 2006 to 2011 respectively liu et al 2014 from 1960 to 2012 the annual actual evapotranspiration increased markedly with an increasing rate of 6 27 mm decade qiang et al 2018 as mentioned previously the rates of glacial ablation permafrost degradation decreasing snowfall and increasing actual evapotranspiration are accelerating which reflects the accelerative nature of mwt this will cause the meltwater to increase each year leading to changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and the water cycle notably causing changes to the hydrological environment of rivers lakes swamps and wetlands these changes will no doubt have a profound impact on the runoff components and process in the sryr 5 1 3 runoff in the study region the hydrological process is mainly concentrated between may and october under cold environmental conditions fig 6 during the sampling period june 2016 may 2018 the mean runoff values were significantly high at zmd station than that in tth station table 0 4 and the runoff increased by 40 34 3 m3 s and 61 356 5 m3 s from 2016 17 to 2017 18 for the tth and zmd stations respectively therefore the means include one high flow year and one low flow year at each station during mwt as rainfall increases glacial ablation and permafrost degradation and outlet runoff also increase in the study region table 4 the patterns also exhibited variation between 1961 and 1990 and 1991 2017 the runoff depth decreased from 1961 to 1990 and then increased between 1991 and 2017 at the tth station table 4 and the runoff increase was significantly higher in 1961 1990 than between 1991 and 2017 at the zmd station fig 6 compared to the period between 1961 and 1990 the total runoff increased by 6 8 108 m3 and 53 4 2 108 m3 at the zmd and tth station between 1991 and 2017 fig 6 table 4 these variations show that the acceleration of runoff increased after 1990 in the sryr additionally most of the lakes in the sryr were shrinking between 1976 and 1992 however the areas of the lakes increased from 801 6 km2 in 1992 to 927 5 km2 in 2010 and the lake area had increased by 15 7 in 2010 compared to 1976 because of abundant precipitation and runoff duan et al 2015 5 2 runoff components 5 2 1 isotope geochemistry 5 2 1 1 river water table 5 shows that it is evident that the δ18o and δ2h values between the zmd and tth stations 3540 m and 4533 m were close and that there is no altitude effect it is also clear that the d excess values of the two stations were higher than 10 fig 7 which agrees well with the surface water from high elevations in the himalayas such as those in the tajik pamir 12 5 the western himalayas 11 15 and the northern slope of the qilian mountains 11 17 which are related to the westerly moisture transport and cold temperatures during precipitation yang et al 2019 determined that river samples with high d excess may represent the isotopic signature of spring summer precipitation while intermediate d excess values indicate the recharge of supra permafrost water active layer water for interannual variation there was no obviously seasonal variation in the δ18o of outlet fluvial runoff at the zmd station and relatively higher values were found in june of 2016 stable variations occurred from july october of 2016 and also from may october of 2017 excluding august which had relatively negative values and relatively higher values were found in may of 2018 fig 7 although the seasonal variation of δ18o in river water at the tth station was also not obvious it displayed a decreasing trend between june and august 2016 and an increasing trend during august october 2016 similar variations were also exhibited from may october 2017 and may 2018 comparing with the zmd station the higher values of the standard deviations variances coefficients of variation and biases of δ18o in river water at the tth station also confirmed the relatively obvious seasonal variation table 6 additionally the reversal between δ18o and d excess was substantial at two stations fig 7 these variations suggested that the generality and individuality of runoff processes between the zmd and tth stations are mainly derived from multiple components and these components firstly infiltrated the ground and turned into groundwater before recharging the river water in the sryr this has the effect of smoothing seasonal fluctuations in δ18o and d excess meanwhile the individuality of these stations is due to the fact that the mixing level of multiple components is stronger at the zmd than at the tth station the isotopic regression line for surface water or groundwater in a region is called the local evaporation line lel the slope and intercept of the lel of river water at the tth are lower than those at zmd this indicates that it experienced evaporation when it flowed from the source region to river outlet fig 7 however this also suggests that runoff is mainly replenished by supra permafrost water under the influence of strong evaporation two reasons can be interpreted for the differences between the tth and zmd stations 1 the source region and upper reaches of the basin tth basin has lower runoff discharge and is strongly influenced by evaporation while some river water mainly originated from supra permafrost water with an enriched isotopic composition and 2 the water yields of the stations increased from higher to lower altitudes because the contribution from precipitation to fluvial runoff also increased whereas precipitation caused the relatively negative δ18o 5 2 1 2 supra permafrost water supra permafrost water samples were collected in the geladandong region gldd yuzhufeng region yzf and dongkemadi region dkmd during the same period as river water sampling the mean δ18o and δ2h values of supra permafrost water were 11 0 and 89 2 in study region there were also obvious differences in stable isotope values among the three sampling sites table 5 the interannual variation in the gldd increased from may to october with maxima in september 2016 and october 2017 fig 8 it also increased during the sampling period with the maximum in september in the yzf whiles the dkmd displayed decreasing fluctuations during the sampling period fig 8 in addition the lower slope and intercept of lels reflected the strong influence of evaporation table 5 and this influence was stronger in the gldd than in the yzf or dkmd the seasonal variation in δ18o varied at the three sampling sites fig 8 which can be also confirmed by the higher standard deviations variances coefficients of variation and biased of δ18o table 6 two reasons can account for this pattern 1 supra permafrost water is mainly stored in permafrost active layer and the stable isotopic compositions can be influenced by major imbalances in the isotopic dynamic fractionation caused by strong soil evaporation and vegetative transpiration and 2 the supra permafrost water has been recharged by rainfall water snow meltwater and ground ice meltwater which causes the variations in the stable isotopic composition for the lgl of all supra permafrost water samples the slope and intercept were close to those of river water table 5 these findings are indicative of tight hydraulic connectivity between river water and super permafrost water in the study region it is also evident that the d excess values of the three stations were close to 10 fig 8 which indicates that the supra permafrost water was also from high elevation and may have been sourced from glaciers snow meltwater and precipitation under cold temperatures 5 2 1 3 glaciers snow meltwater glaciers snow meltwater samples were regularly collected in the gldd yzf and dkmd during the same period as river water sampling the mean δ18o δ2h and d excess values of glaciers snow meltwater were 13 42 89 67 and 17 7 respectively these values reflect the cold environments of higher altitudes table 5 differences were also observed among the three sampling sites table 5 δ18o and δ2h values as well as lel for glaciers snow meltwater at yuzhufeng glacier were higher than those at jianggudiru glacier and dongkemadi glacier fig 9 the location of the glaciers might be the reason for their observed compositional differences yuzhufeng glacier is located on a sunny slope and experiences relatively strong evaporative conditions whereas the other two glaciers are located on shady slopes interannual variations showed different patterns during the ablation periods in 2016 and 2017 fig 9 but exhibited no seasonal trends table 6 these observations can be attributed to two reasons the stable isotopes in glaciers snow meltwater can be influenced by ablation intensity ablation duration and newly deposited snow meltwaters resulting in the residual snow and glacial ice becoming gradually enriched in δ18o isotopic exchange likely exists between meltwaters and the residual snow and glacial ice moreover glaciers snow meltwater is also recharged by rainfall or snowfall and thereby exhibits more negative values than glaciers snow meltwater especially the confluence rainfall newly deposited snow meltwater residual snow meltwater and glacier ice meltwater is random under different weather conditions for all glaciers snow meltwater samples the slope and intercept of lel are close to those of the lwml table 5 5 2 2 hydrograph separation 5 2 2 1 confirmation of runoff components in the study region the lmwl was established by the δ18o and δ2h of event based precipitation from two stations at different altitudes δ2h 8 03δ18o 11 34 r 2 0 97 fig 10 both the slope and intercept of the lmwl were slightly higher than those of the gmwl craig 1961 compared with previous results on the tibetan plateau the slope and intercept were lower than those of delingha δ2h 8 47δ18o 15 2 r 2 0 97 and hulugou δ2h 8 21δ18o 17 46 r 2 0 97 li et al 2014 and were significantly higher than those from lhasa δ2h 7 9δ18o 6 29 r 2 0 97 this is suggestive of different moisture sources of precipitation in these regions according to the division of circulation zones on the tibetan plateau yao et al 2013 delingha and hulugou are included within the northern transition zone they are greatly influenced by continentally recycled moisture and the westerlies and thus generate higher slopes and intercepts however lhasa belongs to the southern monsoonal zone and it receives more oceanic moisture which results in lower slopes and intercepts the sryr is located along the transition region whose moisture source is mainly dominated by monsoons continentally recycled moisture and the westerlies as shown in fig 10 glaciers snow meltwater is located in or above the lwml because it experiences weak evaporation under cold environmental conditions which were less negative in δ18o and δ2h when compared with other bodies of water in the study region supra permafrost water plotted below the lwml owing to relatively strong evaporation and the similar research in qilian mountains and the source area of the yellow river yang et al 2019 also confirmed this in addition changes in precipitation signatures over time and thawing and freezing processes maybe have a significant influence on stable isotope composition of supra permafrost water but the mechanism still need the further study the isotopic compositions of river water from the two stations were close to the lmwl and the δ18o and δ2h values fluctuated among precipitation glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water moreover these values clustered together between supra permafrost water and river water the clustering of the data for river water and other water bodies indicates that a hydraulic relationship of recharge and discharge exists among them fig 10 these characteristics suggest that river water is recharged from multiple sources including glaciers snow meltwater supra permafrost water and precipitation in the region during the sampling period the river water from two stations showed similar monthly δ18o trends and exhibited no significantly seasonal variation fig 11 this is suggestive of the same replenishment sources for river water at the tth and zmd stations although they are located at different altitudes however compared with precipitation the δ18o of the two rivers varied across a relatively narrow range fig 11 which is markedly different from the obvious seasonal fluctuations of precipitation this indicates that precipitation does not directly replenish surface runoff which is attributed to the precipitation first transforming into supra permafrost water that is stored in the permafrost active layer and which influences the runoff process the same findings were confirmed in the qilian mountains and may reflect the unique hydrological processes of cold regions smith et al 1998 natalie et al 2005 dery et al 2009 ala aho et al 2018 meanwhile the same seasonal patterns were observed between river water and supra permafrost water and the ranges of monthly mean δ18o values were also similar which indicates that the river water is mainly dominated and replenished by supra permafrost water fig 11 relative to the violent seasonal fluctuations in the monthly mean δ18o value for glaciers snow meltwater stable trends were observed for river water fig 11 in the study region the intersection of the lel for river water with the lmwl is 11 39 for δ18o and 80 15 for δ2h there are also differences between the intersections of the lel for the tth δ18o 10 9 δ2h 76 22 and zmd δ18o 11 88 δ2h 84 04 stations it is clear that the isotopic composition of the intersection of river water closely corresponds to the values of supra permafrost water δ18o 11 δ2h 77 especially for the tth station and it is enriched in comparison to the glaciers snow meltwater δ18o 13 42 δ2h 89 67 these results demonstrate that the river water in the study area is mainly sourced from supra permafrost water and that the runoff components are first mix and then replenish the runoff 5 2 2 2 hydrograph separation the emma model was used to identify variable source areas and mixing processes and to quantify the contribution of each end member there were significant differences in the concentrations of d excess and δ18o for glaciers snow meltwater supra permafrost water precipitation and river water at the tth and zmd stations during the sampling period fig 12 accordingly the concentrations of δ18o and d excess were selected for analysis because this combination provides the best separation of sources there were large spatiotemporal variations in the concentrations of these solutes and the river water was located within the triangle spanning the three end members suggesting that runoff is a mixture of them fig 12 therefore supra permafrost water can be treated as the first end member and precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater as the second and third end members respectively firstly the daily runoff was separated during the sampling period fig 13 at the tth station the contribution from precipitation increased from june to july and then decreased until october in 2016 17 the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater increased from june to august in 2016 17 and then decreased until october and the contribution of supra permafrost water decreased from june to july and then increased until october in 2016 17 additionally the contributions from precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater were obviously higher than in june during 2017 18 the contribution from precipitation increased from may to august and then decreased until october while the contribution of glaciers snow meltwater was higher in may increased from june to july and then decreased until october for the supra permafrost water the contribution to runoff increased from may to june and then increased from july to october seasonal patterns also showed some differences and the maximum contributions of precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater were in july and august for the outlet fluvial runoff i e at the zmd station the contribution from precipitation increased from may to july and then decreased until october and that of glaciers snow meltwater decreased from may to july and reached its maximum in august before decreasing until october meanwhile the contribution of supra permafrost water decreased from may to august and then increased until the maximum was reached in october of 2016 17 during 2017 18 the contribution of precipitation increased from may to august and then decreased until october while the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater was higher in may increased from june to july and then decreased until october finally the contribution from supra permafrost water decreased from may to july and then increased between august and october with respect to seasonal patterns although the contribution from precipitation was relatively higher the cryosphere meltwater including glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water dominated the runoff components and then the monthly runoff was also separated based on daily values during the sampling period fig 14 for the tth station supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of river water from june of 2016 to may of 2018 respectively for the zmd station calculations indicated that 49 of the recharge was contributed by supra permafrost water with precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater contributing by 34 and 17 from june of 2016 to may of 2018 respectively this suggests that the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater to runoff displayed a decreasing trend from the source region to the river outlet in the study region while the contribution of precipitation increased and that of supra permafrost water was nearly stable upon further analysis there were differences in the contributions of runoff components to river water during two hydrological years at the tth station fig 14 the contributions of supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater to fluvial runoff were 50 22 and 28 during the 2016 2017 year and 51 25 and 24 during the 2017 2018 year during the 2016 2017 year the contributions of supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater to fluvial runoff were 48 33 and 19 at the zmd station fig 14 and 50 36 and 14 during the 2017 2018 year based on observations at the tth station the mean temperature from may october of 2016 was 0 3 c higher than in 2017 while the amount of precipitation was 20 mm greater in 2017 than in 2016 thus the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater decreased from 2016 17 to 2017 18 while the contribution of precipitation increased at both of the two hydrological stations however runoff was mainly dominated by supra permafrost water which accounted for 50 of the outlet runoff 5 2 3 uncertainty analysis calculation of uncertainty in hydrograph separations requires tracer concentrations and an estimate of the uncertainty in each pu et al 2013 the uncertainty can originate from measurement methods field data or the expert knowledge of the investigators uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 those uncertainties generally included two aspects one is the emma method error due to the measurement of end member concentrations and the other is from the spatial and temporal variations of the tracer of components which could be calculated separately using the approach shown in eq 6 according to the calculations made using eq 6 the uncertainty was estimated to be 0 06 for the three component mixing model in the study region however the uncertainty terms of supra permafrost water and glacial snow meltwater accounted for the 75 of the total uncertainty because they were influenced by multiple factors and are sensitive to environmental change it indicated that the uncertainty in the emma method was less important than that in the temporal and spatial variations of tracer concentrations as for the relative proportions of supra permafrost water precipitation and glacial snow meltwater based on the three component separation model the uncertainties were 0 55 0 39 and 0 43 respectively the δ18o and δd variations of supra permafrost water accounted for more than 50 0 of the total uncertainty as mentioned above the stable isotopic compositions in supra permafrost water can be influenced by strong soil evaporation and vegetative transpiration and by rainfall water snow meltwater and ground ice meltwater which causes the random inter annual variations in addition the stable isotopes in glaciers snow meltwater can be also influenced by multiple factors with random variations most of the uncertainty in this study can be attributed to the variations in and the differences among tracer concentrations for runoff components the uncertainty for hydrograph separation should become more sensitive when the tracer concentrations of runoff components show greater variations and minor differences pu et al 2013 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 although there is some uncertainty for hydrograph separation isotope based hydrograph separations are still valuable tools for evaluating the contribution of meltwater to water resources and they are particularly helpful for improving our understanding of hydrological processes in cold regions where there is a lack of observational data also it should be noted that sampling with high temporal and spatial precision should be used in further studies to overcome the uncertainties originating from the variability of tracer concentrations 6 discussion 6 1 factors influencing runoff precipitation in the study region is mainly concentrated between may and october and accounts for 92 of the total annual precipitation runoff during this period also accounted for 96 and 87 of total annual runoff at the tth and zmd stations with maximum runoff levels recorded in august and july respectively liang et al 2011 the runoff at the zmd station showed a markedly increasing trend from 1956 to 2016 and precipitation was the leading driver of runoff variability with the other factors being surface evaporation and air temperature li 2018 the results of hbv models suggest that runoff is likely to increase over the next 20 years because of the increasing precipitation and meltwater in study region li et al 2013 for the increase in flow within the study region precipitation was the most significant factor evaporation was the second most important and glaciers snow meltwater was the least important li et al 2013 after 2005 the annual and seasonal precipitation in the region have increased notably but the annual and seasonal evaporation have decreased significantly zhou et al 2016 the meltwater from snow and glaciers has also increased due to increases in temperature and all of changes caused runoff levels to increase sharply in the sryr qi et al 2015 the cold region hydrological model also revealed that runoff are mainly influenced by precipitation in this region han et al 2017 which is also indicated that annual runoff are mainly driven by changes in annual precipitation 62 96 and are only weakly linked to changes in air temperature 7 38 qian et al 2014 li et al 2017 these results indicate the hydrological process is complicated and volatile in sryr especially under the increasing precipitation and the serious changes in the cryosphere glacial melting permafrost degradation glaciers have become shorter narrower and thinner under the effects of atmospheric warming increased stream flow has also been recorded in the study region in response to the increased melting of glaciers and permafrost which showed close but variable linkages among climate change glacial melting and water resources in the sryr models and observations have been used to evaluate the contributions from glaciers snow meltwater to runoff but only in small scale basins selecting the dongkemadi river basin with an area of 39 06 km2 in the sryr gao et al 2011 found that the runoff depth had increased by a rate of 56 mm decade and the glacier mass balance lose rate was 1360 mm decade furthermore the aggravation of glacial ablation accounted for about 66 of the increased runoff based on an hbv model and the glaciers snow meltwater had an important role in the discharge of the whole basin accounting for 49 based on measurements from may september of 1993 zhang et al 1997 according to a hydrological model the contribution of glaciers snow meltwater at the zmd station was 9 2 of the total discharge in the sryr in the 1970 s wu et al 2013 in the tuotuohe and buquhe river basins glaciers snow meltwater can supply 2 56 109 m3 a and 1 24 109 m3 a of meltwater to the stream flow in the two basins which accounts for 33 5 and 15 8 of the total runoff respectively wu et al 2013 additionally under the influence of permafrost degradation the recharge from melting ice is also important as these rivers exported a mean of 13 2 16 7 to the surface stream in the sryr yang et al 2019 additionally recent lake expansion is also linked to the increasing precipitation controlled supra permafrost discharge in the sryr and a precipitation runoff function was preliminarily identified in which the supra permafrost discharge nonlinearly increased with increasing precipitation pan et al 2017 6 2 runoff processes observations of these processes were made in the fenghuoshan watershed a permafrost catchment 92 48 e 93 03 e 34 39 n 34 48 n in 2004 2007 it is a sub basin in the sryr and its altitude ranges from 4720 m to 5392 m covering an area of 112 5 km2 furthermore the hydrological process mainly dominated by permafrost in addition 85 of the total annual runoff occurs between may and september during the spring and summer floods the peak of the summer flood is greater than that of the spring flood and soil temperature and moisture above 65 cm play leading roles in the spring flood whereas temperature and precipitation play leading roles in the summer flood li et al 2009 based on meteorological observations at the tth station fig 15 the monthly mean temperature is above 0 c from may september with a maximum in july or august whereas it is below 0 c after october in the study region precipitation is also mainly concentrated between may and september with the maximum in july or august and which accounts for 92 of the total annual precipitation the basin is frozen until may and runoff processes are mainly concentrated during the period from may october as the runoff process is influenced by a combination of several factors including glacial snow melting precipitation and freeze thaw processes the seasonal runoff process can be described based on stable isotope tracering in may fig 16 a the snow cover and permafrost active layer are gradually melting as temperatures rise rainfall increases but snowfall decreases which causes the soil moisture content to rise sharply but the melting depth of the permafrost active layer is only 40 50 cm and most of the supra permafrost water converges into the river therefore runoff is mainly replenished by supra permafrost water snow meltwater and rainfall and their contribution rates are 56 20 and 24 respectively when the soil thawing depth is less than 50 cm runoff increases sharply with increased thawing depth based on field observations wang et al 2007a b wang et al 2009 found that surface runoff increased as the temperature of the active soil layer was elevated and a weak exponential relationship existed between the air temperature and runoff the snowmelt runoff also increased with the elevation of air temperatures and was the main reason for the spring flood period the initial thawing including thawing of the surface active soil layer and melting of snow formed the spring flood flow through the generation of runoff from excess soil moisture which enhanced the increase in the runoff coefficient the surface soil temperature dynamics controlled the spring runoff processes by changing the runoff generation area in the permafrost region wang et al 2012 as the temperature and precipitation rise in june fig 16b glaciers gradually melt and snow cover melts rapidly the melting depth of the permafrost active layer is approximately 60 cm and most of the supra permafrost water also converges into the river precipitation is mainly dominated by rainfall so the contribution from precipitation to runoff increases to 29 whiles it decreases to 16 and 55 for glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water respectively in june with the thawing of the active top soil soil saturation induced runoff and interflow discharge increase and eventually become the dominant runoff components wang et al 2009 based on observations there is no clear relationship between precipitation and total runoff suggesting that precipitation has a weaker influence on runoff during this period while the soil moisture and temperature more directly cause runoff during the spring flood period most of the snowmelt runoff caused by increased air temperatures is likely one of the main contributors to the surface runoff in may and june li et al 2009 therefore active soil thawing processes including the soil temperature and moisture and air temperature were the primary factors driving surface runoff wang et al 2012 under the high temperature and precipitation conditions in july fig 16c the strong melting of glaciers occurs and the snow cover melts away rainfall is normal and the melting depth of the permafrost active layer is approximately 80 cm as the water reservoir so precipitation dominates runoff with a contribution rate of 49 meanwhile the supra permafrost water is in a state of overdraft owing to the continuous replenishment of runoff from may june and evapotranspiration with a contribution rate of 31 and the remaining 20 is replenished by glaciers snow meltwater the plentiful rainfall during the summer could increase the recharge of supra permafrost water which would increase the discharge of groundwater to surface river flow wang et al 2017 in early july the soil moisture from the surface to the depth of 40 cm quickly decreases under the continual enhancement of evapotranspiration and little precipitation wang et al 2007a b there is no clear relationship between soil water and total runoff suggesting that supra permafrost water has a weaker influence on runoff during this period this is mainly because an increase in the thawing depth due to the increased soil temperatures allows soil water to be transported to deeper layers or toward the freezing front at depth zhou et al 2000 with the maximum temperature and precipitation occurring in august fig 16d precipitation also dominates and accounts for 48 of runoff and glaciers snow meltwater also contributes 19 of runoff under heavy melting the thawing depth of the active layer reaches to 120 cm or more as the water reservoir whereas supra permafrost water is deposited with the thickening permafrost active layer and the supra permafrost water accounts of 33 of runoff which is also consumed by strong evaporation and transpiration li et al 2009 also confirmed that precipitation dominated surface runoff in a permafrost catchment during the summer flood period during this stage the recharge of groundwater by precipitation was enhanced because of the relatively high permeability of the active layer of the soil and the movement of groundwater and precipitation recharge to runoff gradually became a major contributor wang et al 2017 although there is no clear relationship between rainfall and total runoff the direct runoff of the summer flood period displays a strong linear relationship with precipitation indicating that the precipitation in summer is still more influential on the direct runoff recharge during the summer flood period than during the other periods wang et al 2009 additionally the active soil layer temperature air temperature and deeper soil layer moisture also have similar degrees of influence on runoff wang et al 2009 with decreasing temperatures in september fig 16e glaciers snow meltwater only contributes 14 of the total runoff precipitation accounts for 44 of runoff with decreasing rainfall and the contribution from supra permafrost water obviously increases to 42 under the reduced effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration as temperatures decrease the surface soil layer gradually begins to freeze between late september and earlier october while the bottom of the active layer is also near freezing zhou et al 2000 wang et al 2007a b underground water discharge gradually decreases due to the freezing processes of the aquifer in the meantime direct runoff from precipitation is limited during this period the influence of soil freezing on autumn runoff is similar to the spring season runoff where a significant correlation exists between the frozen depth of the active layer and runoff wang et al 2017 in october fig 16f the glaciers and permafrost active layer gradually freeze with decreasing temperatures and glaciers snow meltwater only accounts for 9 of runoff snowfall increases and rainfall decreases while precipitation only accounts for 12 of the runoff owing to the overall decreased precipitation although the runoff is mainly sourced from supra permafrost water 79 runoff decreases sharply because of the transformation from supra permafrost water to ground water in the permafrost region nearly all of the river base flow and most of the total river flow in the autumn and winter seasons are contributed by groundwater discharge liu et al 2012 wang et al 2017 found that the contribution from groundwater discharge ranged from approximately 83 0 of the total fluvial runoff in september to 90 8 in october in 2014 the supra permafrost water discharge decreases exponentially when the active layer is frozen during autumn the bidirectional freezing of the active layer controls and changes the autumn runoff processes and runoff composition wang et al 2009 more succinctly cryosphere meltwater dominates runoff in the study region especially the supra permafrost water the precipitation supra permafrost water runoff process dominates the surface runoff in the sryr but the underlying mechanism requires further exploration in the future 6 3 implications of permafrost degradation on water resources the tibetan plateau is the most concentrated cryosphere region in the middle and low latitudes of the earth it is also the glaciation center in china and high asia yao et al 2013 under the influence of global warming glacial ablation is accelerating and glaciers snow meltwater has been increasing each year leading to changes in spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and water cycle this has profound impacts on social and economic development permafrost thawing owing to rising temperatures is one of the main factors that have led to changes in water cycle and the hydrological environments of rivers lakes swamps and wetlands have been closely related to permafrost degradation in the last several decades permafrost is a water barrier and hinders the movement and recharge of groundwater in the lateral and vertical directions tan et al 2016 it exhibits two primary hydrological functions 1 it functions as an impermeable layer and obstructs groundwater and the liquid water infiltration of deeper soil layers and 2 it generates the soil temperature gradient and drives soil moisture to move toward the frozen front active soil thawing and freezing change the soil water storage and infiltration capacities as well as the soil water conductivity redistributing water within the soil profile wang et al 2007a b the sryr is a typical permafrost region spanning 107619 13 km2 and accounting for 77 of total area of the sryr while seasonally frozen soils cover 30754 34 km2 and are distributed in the river valley zhou et al 2000 the cryosphere meltwater accounted for 66 of total runoff at the zmd station and calculations indicated that 49 of the recharge was contributed by supra permafrost water indicating that supra permafrost water dominates water resources in the study region field observations have verified that most precipitation remains frozen in the ground or is used to supplement the deficit of soil moisture and does not form runoff directly in permafrost regions li et al 2009 surface runoff process in permafrost regions of the tibetan plateau exhibits different characteristics from some previously investigated subarctic permafrost watersheds wang et al 2007a b regardless of the level of flood runoff in spring or summer the active thawing process was the most important factor influencing runoff processes direct runoff ratio had little while precipitation had no significant impact on the total annual fluvial runoff in the study region wang et al 2007a b the temperature of the active soil layer was the primary factor controlling the variation in runoff and components during the spring flood stage summer low flow stage spring flood recession and autumn low flow stage summer flood recession wang et al 2012 precipitation only played a minor role in spring flood runoff and autumn runoff and exhibited limited effects on direct runoff meanwhile total runoff was subject to the complexity of factors including the active soil layer temperature and deeper active soil layer moisture wang et al 2017 seasonal variations in the freezing and thawing of the active layer was the direct and the primary cause for the seasonal changes in interflow water and groundwater on the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2000 additionally the nonlinear increase in the precipitation controlled supra permafrost discharge may be non negligible in contributing to the recent lake growth on the tibetan plateau apart from the above mentioned factors such as thickening of the active layers and increased precipitation pan et al 2017 therefore the freezing and thawing of the active soil layer plays the most important role in controlling the precipitation supra permafrost water runoff processes that dominate fluvial runoff in the study region based on a new study zou et al 2017 permafrost seasonally frozen ground and unfrozen ground covered areas of 1 06 106 km2 40 1 46 106 km2 56 and 0 03 106 km2 1 on the tibetan plateau respectively excluding glaciers and lakes under the scenarios of global warming permafrost degradation which generally refers to decreases in permafrost thickness and areal extent and increases in the active layer thickness has been extensively studied notable warming trends in the mean annual soil temperature were detected in the permafrost regions on the tibetan plateau from 1980 to 2015 modeling results revealed that the permafrost area has significantly decreased at a rate of 0 066 106 km2 decade over the past 30 years and the decrease is accelerating wang et al 2019 climate warming has led to the thermal degradation of permafrost on the tibetan plateau over the past half century the total degraded area is approximately 153 76 104 km2 which accounts for 87 98 of the permafrost area in the 1960 s mean elevations of the very cold cold cool warm very warm and likely thawing types increased by 88 m 97 m 155 m 185 m 161 m and 250 m respectively ran et al 2018 permafrost controls the distribution recharge flow paths discharge dynamics and hydrochemistry of groundwater in cold regions cheng and jin 2013 as the active layer thickness increases the permafrost area shrinks and the permafrost thickness decreases owing to the effects of climatic warming on the tibetan plateau the degradation of permafrost affects the interactions among the surface water subsoil water and groundwater by changing the hydraulic conductivity and connectivity of the soil the degradation of the ice rich permafrost itself makes important contributions to surface runoff and the development of thermokarst lakes in the inner tibetan plateau zhang et al 2013 enhanced drainage may lead to increases in flood risk and reductions in ecosystem resiliency via seasonal shifts in stream flow and groundwater abundance because the decrease in permafrost water storage capacity leads to a reduction in the availability of water during the dry season wang et al 2017 all these changes will affect the balance of water resources and freshwater supply in asia which contains the headwater areas of major asian rivers over the next several decades air temperatures are predicted to increase by 2 6 c by the mid 2050 s when this climatic warming will cause an increase in permafrost temperature and reduce permafrost thickness majority of permafrost on the qinghai tibet plateau will thaw dramatically human activities such as the operations of the qinghai tibet highway and railway and rapid economic development will also accelerate permafrost warming thawing and eventually its complete disappearance therefore it is critical to develop scientific strategies for controlling or reducing potential threats to water security and ecological health in southern central and eastern asia future studies should devote more attention to the environmental impacts of permafrost degradation on the tibetan plateau especially to the mechanisms of precipitation supra permafrost water runoff which will provide insights into the effects of an unstable asian water tower 7 conclusions under temperature warming precipitation increasing and cryosphere retreating in the sryr the total runoff increased by 53 at the tth and 6 at the zmd station from 1961 to 1990 to 1991 2017 for river water the δ18o and δd values between the zmd and tth stations were close and there were no obvious seasonal variations seasonal variations in stable isotope composition of supra permafrost water and glaciers snow meltwater were random at the three sampling sites the runoff was replenished by multiple components under fully mixed conditions and these multiple components first infiltrated the permafrost active layer and turned into groundwater and then recharged river water in the sryr and what s more the supra permafrost water is the dominant recharge source in the basin and supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of river water at the tth station from june of 2016 to may of 2018 respectively the corresponding values were 49 34 and 17 at the zmd station for seasonal pattern most of the supra permafrost water converges into the river accounting for 56 and 55 of the runoff under the sharply increasing soil moisture content to owing to the gradually melting snow cover and permafrost active layer in may and june respectively the precipitation dominates runoff with a contribution rate of 49 and 48 in july and august under high temperature and rainfall conditions with the strong melting of glaciers and the permafrost active layer respectively the contribution from supra permafrost water increases from 42 in september to 79 in october with the decreasing temperatures and precipitation it can be concluded that seasonal variations in the freezing and thawing of the active layer directly cause the seasonal changes in runoff processes and seasonal patterns and the precipitation supra permafrost water runoff process dominates surface runoff in the sryr under the scenarios of global warming permafrost degradation will continue and this will affect the balance of water resources and sustainable development of tibetan plateau which contains the headwater areas of many of the major rivers in asia therefore future research should be focused on the environmental effects of permafrost degradation with special emphasis on determining the mechanisms underlying precipitation supra permafrost water runoff processes

5803,accelerating multiphase water transformation affects runoff processes and components greatly and have changed the spatiotemporal patterns of water resources in the third polar region the source region of the yangtze river is one location where accelerated warming has resulted in the gradual extension of the ablation period since 1990 this has caused the acceleration of multiphase water transformation characterized by increases in the rate of glacial retreat maximum freezing depth and annual actual evapotranspiration and by decreased snowfall in response the total runoff increased by 53 at the tuotuohe national hydrological station tth and 6 at the zhimenda national hydrological station zmd during the periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2017 respectively under these conditions runoff components were being determined based on stable isotope tracing substantial seasonal differences in δ18o δd among precipitation river water supra permafrost water and glaciers snow meltwater indicate that the runoff has been replenished by multiple components and that these first infiltrate the ground becoming part of the groundwater and then recharge river water supra permafrost water rather than precipitation now dominates river water based on the end member mixing analysis model supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of river water at the tth station from june 2016 to may 2018 the corresponding values at the zmd station were 49 34 and 17 additionally there are also differences in the seasonal contributions of runoff components to river water seasonal variations in the freezing and thawing of the active layer directly trigger the runoff process future research should be focused on determining the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of precipitation supra permafrost water runoff which will aid the assessment of the impacts of an unstable asian water tower on water resources keywords runoff permafrost stable isotope accelerating multiphase water transformation yangtze river 1 introduction multiphase water transformation mwt refers to the frequent conversion of bodies of water between the solid liquid and gaseous states which is a crucial link in the water cycle that greatly affects the spatiotemporal patterns of water resources additionally mwt serves an important hydrological function in safeguarding freshwater supplies and maintaining the ecological security of the watershed these transformations are also characterized by substantial cryosphere retreat on the tibetan plateau yao et al 2012 for example the latest report from the second tibetan plateau examination http www xinhuanet com tech 2018 09 10 c 1123404302 htm states that the glacial area has declined by 15 and the permafrost area has decreased by 16 whereas the lake area has increased from 40000 km2 to 47400 km2 over the past 50 years in the qilian mountains the acceleration of the mwt was quantified by three facts the glacier area retreat rate accelerated by 50 after 1990 the percentage of snowfall in precipitation decreased by 7 after 1990 and the contribution of recycled moisture to precipitation increased by 60 since 1990 which has increased runoff and changed seasonal runoff patterns and runoff components permafrost regions occupy approximately 53 of the land area on the tibetan plateau the highest and most extensive high altitude permafrost on earth zhou et al 2000 these regions are highly sensitive to climate change the cryosphere provides an important source of water in alpine regions and melting rates have increased under warming climatic conditions although warmer temperatures initially accelerated the cryosphere melting this contribution is expected to decrease as the cryosphere diminishes pu et al 2017 runoff components local water resources hydrological processes and ecological evolution will also undergo changes accordingly however our understanding of the hydrological function of these cryosphere regions remains limited owing to the limited observations of permafrost rivers and the difficulty in distinguishing between the influence of glaciers snow melting and permafrost thawing pu et al 2017 therefore it is essential to identify the relevant hydrological processes and evaluate the contribution of cryosphere meltwater to local water resources thereby providing a reference for the effective use of water resources and predictions of how they may change such information will also provide the insights needed to develop tourism agriculture and animal husbandry and ensure ecological protection sorg et al 2012 noted that there is a need for more integrative studies to address changes in all runoff components i e precipitation groundwater and meltwater from snow glaciers and permafrost to better appraise the degree of cryosphere depletion and subsequent changes in fluvial runoff in alpine regions to predict future changes in regional water resources it is necessary to develop a holistic understanding of the contributions of different types of cryosphere meltwater including those from glacial snow and permafrost to mountain discharge and to assess the magnitude and variability of hydrologic responses to fluctuating cryosphere conditions owing to the range of spatiotemporal scales available the δ18o and δd in various bodies of water have become effective means for investigating hydrologic systems kong and pang 2012 craig 1961 established the first global metrological water line gmwl which provided the coordinate system for isotopic hydrology hughes and crawford 2012 proposed a new precipitation weighted method for determining the meteoric water line for hydrological applications when stable isotope δ18o δd and d excess values in water are examined at the basinal or regional scale important information on hydrological processes is readily discernible therefore isotopic values have been widely used in hydrology pu et al 2017 they can be used to clarify the mechanisms controlling stream water behavior and to delineate flow paths and flow systems at the catchment scale eckhardt 2008 aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 confirmed the sources of groundwater by stable isotope tracing it can be also applied in confirming groundwater process in arid region or inland basins guo et al 2016 2018 aggarwal et al 2016 founded that stable isotope ratios can used to monitor changes in the character of precipitation in response to periodic variability or changes in climate furthermore isotopic tracers have been employed to investigate biogeochemical cycling gibson et al 2005 to identify the residence time of stream water and to investigate the mechanisms affecting stream water chemistry kling and nachtnebel 2009 the contributions of different components to runoff can be identified via hydrograph separation using stable isotopes kortatsi 2006 such results have shown that cryosphere meltwater is an important end member of river water in cold regions these studies have confirmed the importance of cryosphere meltwater to water resources under global warming which have also been helpful for establishing and redefining hydrological models in tibetan plateau the source region of yangtze river sryr located in the hinterland of the tibetan plateau has a concentrated distribution of glaciers and an area of 1215 53 km2 the study region is also within the continuous permafrost zone fig 1 permafrost and glaciers are very important for maintaining surface water resources and ecological balance moreover the study region is central to the formation evolution distribution conservation and regulation of water resources and the ecological security of the yangtze river basin li et al 2013 at the same time glaciers and snow precipitation and permafrost are the main sources of the water supply in the region and affect the inter annual fluctuations and long term evolutionary trends of surface water resources when these effects spread to the mid stream and down stream regions the sustainable utilization of water resources throughout the yangtze river basin will be affected zhu et al 2011 in recent years much research has been conducted on the water resources and ecological and environmental evolution of the sryr yang et al 2003 analyzed the effects of glacial changes on fluvial runoff using two sets of remote sensing image data they also analyzed the influence of climate vegetation permafrost system factors on fluvial runoff wang et al 2003 the variations in runoff and driving mechanisms have also been explored cao et al 2007 yu et al 2008 zhu et al 2011 qian et al 2012 zhang et al 2011 studied the causes of runoff from precipitation and potential evaporation by means of computational modeling meanwhile lv and zheng 2006 discussed the impacts of global climate change on the alpine meadow ecosystem in the sryr and zhang 2004 analyzed regional evaporation characteristics and their variations finally zhang et al 2015 also explored the variations in alpine meadow soil temperatures and moisture contents previous studies have focused on the statistical analysis of runoff and its associated influencing factors but the quantification on the impacts of cryosphere meltwater to runoff in the sryr remains ambiguous only minimal information is available regarding the importance of cryosphere meltwater and hydrological processes however this information is critical for research on the hydrological process and for water resource management the question of how to develop a holistic understanding of the importance of cryosphere meltwater and its hydrological effects has become an increasingly important issue in cold hydrology therefore it is necessary to understand the contribution of cryosphere meltwater including glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water to outlet runoff and to assess the magnitude and variability of hydrologic responses to mwt such information will provide an adequate basis for predicting future trends in runoff variability to clearly assess the influence of active thawing on runoff processes in permafrost regions of the third polar region the sryr where the influences of glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water are substantial was selected and observed the hydrological processes and climatic changes monitored from 1961 to 2018 and the analysis of water isotopes across multiple spatiotemporal scales from 2016 to 2018 in the sryr were used to 1 confirm mwt in the study region climate warming and cryosphere retreat 2 document the spatiotemporal patterns of δ18o and δ2h in different water bodies 3 evaluate the contribution of glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water to river water and its hydrological functions and 4 describe the runoff process in the cryosphere region during mwt achieving these aims is expected to improve of understanding of the effects of variation in soil freezing and thawing on runoff processes in permafrost regions and to provide insights into the hydrological function of mwt in the third polar region 2 study region the tibetan plateau and its adjacent mountains referred to by scientists as the third pole qiu 2008 is geomorphologically the largest and highest mountain region on earth the sryr is located in the hinterland of the tibetan plateau between 90 43 96 45 e and 32 30 35 35 n which is defined here as the area north of zmd station fig 1 it is an important ecological barrier and water conservation region in china the sryr and the hoh xil inland water basins were separated from the hoh xil mountains and the wulan wula mountains the southern boundaries are the tanggula mountains and sederi peak which contain the watersheds of the nujiang river and the lancangjiang river respectively the yellow river basin and the inland qaidam basin were separated from the kunlun mountains and their mountain branch the bayan hara mountains the mean altitude reaches 4000 m above sea level with a decreasing elevation from west to east yu et al 2013 that covers an area of approximately 138 000 km2 7 8 of the total area of the yangtze river basin most tributaries start from glaciers and form very dense drainage networks such as those of the chumaer river in the north tuotuohe river in the central regions and dangqu river in the south pu 1994 the glaciers in the sryr are mainly distributed along the north oriented slopes of the tanggula mountains and sedir mountains and the south oriented slopes of the kunlun mountains with a total area of 1496 04 km2 a reserve of 1496 04 108 m3 and annual ablation of 11 87 108 m3 yao et al 2014 the region is not only one of the main wetland ecosystem areas on the tibetan plateau but it also covers the most concentrated areas of the permafrost the permafrost has a thickness of 10 120 m which accounts for 77 of the total basin area and most surface soils are frozen during winter and thaw in summer and active layer thicknesses range from 1 to 4 m gao et al 2012 the climate of the sryr is a typical cold plateau climate characterized by low temperatures strong radiation and two seasons dry and wet with rainfall and high temperatures occurring during the same period hayashi et al 2015 from the southeast to the northwest the differences in the temperature and precipitation gradients are substantial annual average temperatures range from 3 to 5 5 c the warmest month is july during which the average temperature ranges from 3 to 17 3 c the maximum temperatures of some areas are below 10 c there is no absolutely frost free period and the annual precipitation ranges from 221 5 to 515 mm yu et al 2014 the mean annual precipitation varies considerably over the reserve and 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during summer with the highest precipitation occurring in august the geology consists of quaternary fluvial deposits mesozoic clastic rocks carbonates evaporites and volcanic rocks the mineral compositions of deposits contain large amounts of reactive quartz and a lower percentage of plagioclase potash feldspar calcite illite kaolinite chlorite montmorillonite hematite and gypsum the tuotuohe river basin located on the northern slope of the tanggula mountains in the northwestern geladandong glaciated area is one of the primary glacial areas in the sryr it occupies an area of approximately 15000 km2 above the tuotuohe national hydrological tth station fig 1 according to the chinese glacier inventory cgi for the yangtze river there are 92 glaciers within the tuotuohe river basin and these glaciers have a total area and volume of 389 09 km2 and 42 15 km3 respectively and account for 12 1 30 5 and 42 of the total number area and volume respectively of all glaciers in the sryr shi 2005 3 data 3 1 water samples collection and preparation we have collected a total of 813 samples of precipitation river water supra permafrost water and glaciers snow meltwater in the sryr table 1 the samples were collected within three hydrological years during from june 2016 to may 2018 it is very difficult to observe the hydrological process because of the harsh natural conditions in the tibetan plateau therefore the dominant contributor to water resources remains largely unknown therefore various water body samples were collected systematically for the first time in the study region precipitation river water supra permafrost water and glacier snow meltwater samples were collected across the whole region with continuously spatial and temporal pattern the sampling details for specific water types are described in the following sections 3 1 1 precipitation samples a total of 385 event scale samples were collected within three hydrological years during from june 2016 to may 2018 at different altitudes for two stations zmd 92 26 e 34 14 n 3540 m and tth 34 22 n 92 24 e 4533 m in the sryr fig 1 during sample collection precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were recorded at the corresponding national meteorological stations to avoid contamination from pollutant sources the sample collectors were placed on a rooftop 8 m above the ground and 1 m above the roof rainfall or snow was sampled manually using a wet collector which was fitted with a 5 l polyethylene collecting flask at the bottom and a polyethylene funnel of 26 cm in diameter before installation of collectors the funnels and flasks were carefully cleaned and dried the collected rainwater or snow was loaded into pre cleaned polyethylene sample bottles after each precipitation event 3 1 2 river water in order to explore the temporal variability of stable isotopes in river water samples were collected weekly within three hydrological years from two national hydrological observation stations at the outlets of tuotuohe river and the source region of the yangtze river leading to a total of 200 samples table 1 zmd national hydrological observation station is located in the outlet of the source region of the yangtze river and tth national hydrological observation station is located in the outlet of tuotuohe river fig 1 samples were collected at the zmd and tth hydrological observation stations only throughout the ablation period may october owing to the freezing of rivers in winter and spring 3 1 3 supra permafrost water samples supra permafrost water is the most widely distributed groundwater type in the sryr and it is mainly stored in the permafrost active layer fig 2 the supra permafrost water is affected by permafrost and seasonally frozen soils the hydrogeological characteristics are complex and changeable and the aquifer is mainly composed of a quaternary loose layer and a weathered and fractured zone of bedrock in the mountainous area as a relatively impermeable layer permafrost not only stores a large amount of solid water but also maintains the surface water and groundwater levels of rivers lakes and swamps on the tibetan plateau cheng and jin 2013 moreover supra permafrost water is the main runoff component and the higher the elevation the greater its contribution in recent years climate warming has accelerated the speed of groundwater circulation and shortened the cycle periods in permafrost regions wang et al 2007a b to study the spatiotemporal patterns of stable isotopes in supra permafrost water 114 samples were collected approximately once every 10 days in this study by comprehensive sampling in the ablation periods may october during from june 2016 to may 2018 sampling was performed manually the samples were collected continuously from sites at geladandong 91 38 e 33 95 n 5397 m tanggula 91 96 e 33 0 n 5056 m and yuzhufeng 94 16 e 35 62 n 4954 m approximately once every 10 days fig 1 firstly a 2 m deep profile of the permafrost active layer was dug at each of the sampling points secondly the collected water samples were then immediately filtered with a 0 45 µm millipore filtration membrane at the bottom of each profile 3 1 4 glaciers snow meltwater one hundred fourteen samples were collected from streams flowing out of the glacier front at a sampling interval of approximately once every 10 days during the ablation period from june 2016 to may 2018 the samples were continuously collected at jianggudiru glacier 91 e 33 45 n 5281 m dongkemadi glacier 92 e 33 n 5423 m and yuzhufeng glacier 94 22 e 35 63 n 5180 m fig 1 the geladandong region is extremely remote and so data from the continuous sampling at the hoh xil ecological protection station in qinghai province is very precious there are also observation stations of the chinese academy of sciences cas at dongkemadi glacier and yuzhufeng glacier so these were convenient for sample collection jianggudiru glacier is located on mt geladandong in the tanggula mountains which covers an area of 13 13 km2 and a length of 12 8 km it is the source of the tuotuohe river and the western source region of the yangtze river dongkemadi glacier is located in the central tanggula mountains fig 1 it covers an area of 15 89 km2 and has a terminal altitude of 5275 m with a gentle slope and a clean surface absent of moraines this glacier supplies an increasing amount of meltwater to the dangqu river and is the southern source region of the yangtze river yuzhufeng glacier is located in the eastern kunlun mountains covering an area of 6 75 km2 with a length of 5 7 km the chumaerhe river originated from this glacier which serves as the northern source region of the yangtze river 3 2

hydrological observation stations table 1 linear temperature and precipitation trends were calculated using a nonparametric approach sen s robust slope estimator based on kendall s τ sen 1968 has previously been applied in a study of annual temperature and precipitation change in southwestern china 4 methods 4 1 hydrograph separation hooper et al 1990 and hooper 2003 introduced end member mixing analysis emma using chemical isotopic compositions in waters the techniques involve graphical analyses in which chemical and isotopic parameters are used to represent the designated end members tracers are assumed to be constant in time and space essentially the changing composition of the water can be considered a result of intersections during its passage through each landscape tracers can be used to determine both sources and flow paths the emma tracer approach has become a common method for analyzing potential water sources contributing to stream flow gibson et al 2005 peng et al 2010 both the two and three component method can be described as a uniform equation 1 q t m 1 n q m q t c t j m 1 n q m c m j j l k where qt is total runoff discharge qm is the discharge of component m and cm j is the tracer j incorporated in the component m as refer to isotope hydrograph separation one of the tracers should be a kind of isotope if there is more than 4 end members it must be to consider using a calculation software such as e g isosource phillips and gregg 2003 herein a three end member mass balance mixing model such as the following was employed to calculate the contribution of up to three water sources in stream water 2a x s f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f 3 x 3 2b y s f 1 y 1 f 2 y 2 f 3 y 3 in eq 2 x and y represent concentrations of two types of different tracers δ18o and d excess were chosen for comparison in this study the subscripts represent stream water sample and 1 2 and 3 represent water from the respective contribution of three respective source waters end members to s stream water the fraction of each end source is denoted by f the solutions for f1 f2 and f3 in regards to tracer concentrations in eq 2 can be expressed as follows 3a f 1 x 3 x s x 3 x 2 y 3 y s y 3 y 2 y 1 y 3 y 3 y 2 x 1 x 3 x 3 x 2 3b f 2 x 3 x s x 3 x 1 y 3 y s y 3 y 1 y 2 y 3 y 3 y 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 1 3c f 3 1 f 1 f 2 eq 3 can be modified to be a two end member mass balance mixing equation when stream water derives just from two end sources if so only one chemical trace can be considered in eq 1 4 x s f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 and the solution for f1 and f2in terms of tracer concentrations in eq 1 can be expressed as follows peng et al 2012a b 5a f 1 x s x 2 x 1 x 2 5b f 2 1 f 1 4 2 uncertainty of hydrograph separation the uncertainty of tracer based hydrograph separations can be calculated using the error propagation technique genereux 1998 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 pu et al 2017 this approach considers errors of all separation equation variables assuming that the contribution of a specific streamflow component to streamflow is a function of several variables c1 c2 cn and the uncertainty in each variable is independent of the uncertainty in the others the uncertainty in the target variable e g the contribution of a specific streamflow component is estimated using the following equation uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 6 wfx z c 1 w c 1 2 z c 2 w c 2 2 z c n w c n 2 where w represents the uncertainty in the variable specified in the ubscript fx is the contribution of a specific streamflow component o streamflow the software package matlab is used to apply eq 3 to the different hydrograph separations in this study 5 results 5 1 change of climate cryosphere and runoff in sryr 5 1 1 climate climate warming in the sryr can be proved by two facts the annual average temperature which is 0 4 c decade and the 0 1 c decade reduction in the dtr from 1961 to 2017 fig 3 in these conditions the gradual extension of the ablation period can be confirmed by the decreased id 5 5 d decade and fd 4 3 d decade although gsl increased 2 7 d decade from 1961 to 2017 fig 3 all five meteorological observation stations exhibited notable increases in temperature including greater degrees of warming with increases in altitude furthermore the warming and the lengthening of the ablation period have accelerated since 1990 fig 3 for precipitation it also increased from 35 2 mm decade in 1961 2017 fig 4 and the r10 mm r20 mm and r25 mm increased by 0 5 d decade 0 1 d decade and 0 03 d decade fig 4 respectively these changes indicate an increasingly humid climate in study region however the rate of precipitation increase declined by 21 5 mm decade since 1990 fig 4 the rate of increase for r10 mm r20 mm and r25 mm also decreased after 1990 fig 4 these results suggest that the mwt has mainly been driven by accelerated warming in the sryr especially the lengthening of the ablation period and accelerating warming after 1990 5 1 2 cryosphere glacial shrinkage has become more serious and exhibited accelerated retreat rates since 1990 consistent with global climatic warming during 1969 1971 1999 2002 it was found that the most glaciers in the sryr were in a stage of retreat and the mean glacier length had retreated by 108 3 m and an area of 68 13 km2 was lost fig 5 xu et al 2013 and the meteorological data revealed that the retreat of glaciers was mainly caused by increasing temperatures the total glacial area in the basin was 1060 2 km2 in 2009 yao et al 2014 and it has retreated by 155 33 km2 from 1969 1971 2009 in the sryr meanwhile the total glacial area has decreased by 45 75 km2 between 1964 and 2010 in geladandong fig 5 wang et al 2013 moreover the rate of glacial retreat has accelerated in sryr and geladandong fig 5 table 2 field measurements have also demonstrated the heavy ablation of dongkemadi glacier between 2008 and 2012 the glacial terminus has retreated by 19 7 m zhang et al 2013a b the equilibrium line altitude was 120 m higher than in the early 1990 s the mass balance was 1584 mm and the increasing summer temperature was the controlling factor on glacial ablation zhang et al 2013a b snowfall increased form 1961 1990 and decreased from 1991 to 2017 fig 5 table 2 additionally snow cover in the study region exhibited a slight decrease overall between 2005 and 2014 permafrost degradation has also been substantial in the study area based on observation data table 3 the maximum freezing depth has decreased from 1961 to 1970 to 1990 2001 in sryr wang et al 2005 as shown in fig 5 the depth of the permafrost active layer has also increased in the sryr between 2006 and 2011 table 3 the mean rising rates of permafrost temperatures at 15 m depth and at the permafrost table were 0 018 c a and 0 015 c a from 2006 to 2011 respectively liu et al 2014 from 1960 to 2012 the annual actual evapotranspiration increased markedly with an increasing rate of 6 27 mm decade qiang et al 2018 as mentioned previously the rates of glacial ablation permafrost degradation decreasing snowfall and increasing actual evapotranspiration are accelerating which reflects the accelerative nature of mwt this will cause the meltwater to increase each year leading to changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and the water cycle notably causing changes to the hydrological environment of rivers lakes swamps and wetlands these changes will no doubt have a profound impact on the runoff components and process in the sryr 5 1 3 runoff in the study region the hydrological process is mainly concentrated between may and october under cold environmental conditions fig 6 during the sampling period june 2016 may 2018 the mean runoff values were significantly high at zmd station than that in tth station table 0 4 and the runoff increased by 40 34 3 m3 s and 61 356 5 m3 s from 2016 17 to 2017 18 for the tth and zmd stations respectively therefore the means include one high flow year and one low flow year at each station during mwt as rainfall increases glacial ablation and permafrost degradation and outlet runoff also increase in the study region table 4 the patterns also exhibited variation between 1961 and 1990 and 1991 2017 the runoff depth decreased from 1961 to 1990 and then increased between 1991 and 2017 at the tth station table 4 and the runoff increase was significantly higher in 1961 1990 than between 1991 and 2017 at the zmd station fig 6 compared to the period between 1961 and 1990 the total runoff increased by 6 8 108 m3 and 53 4 2 108 m3 at the zmd and tth station between 1991 and 2017 fig 6 table 4 these variations show that the acceleration of runoff increased after 1990 in the sryr additionally most of the lakes in the sryr were shrinking between 1976 and 1992 however the areas of the lakes increased from 801 6 km2 in 1992 to 927 5 km2 in 2010 and the lake area had increased by 15 7 in 2010 compared to 1976 because of abundant precipitation and runoff duan et al 2015 5 2 runoff components 5 2 1 isotope geochemistry 5 2 1 1 river water table 5 shows that it is evident that the δ18o and δ2h values between the zmd and tth stations 3540 m and 4533 m were close and that there is no altitude effect it is also clear that the d excess values of the two stations were higher than 10 fig 7 which agrees well with the surface water from high elevations in the himalayas such as those in the tajik pamir 12 5 the western himalayas 11 15 and the northern slope of the qilian mountains 11 17 which are related to the westerly moisture transport and cold temperatures during precipitation yang et al 2019 determined that river samples with high d excess may represent the isotopic signature of spring summer precipitation while intermediate d excess values indicate the recharge of supra permafrost water active layer water for interannual variation there was no obviously seasonal variation in the δ18o of outlet fluvial runoff at the zmd station and relatively higher values were found in june of 2016 stable variations occurred from july october of 2016 and also from may october of 2017 excluding august which had relatively negative values and relatively higher values were found in may of 2018 fig 7 although the seasonal variation of δ18o in river water at the tth station was also not obvious it displayed a decreasing trend between june and august 2016 and an increasing trend during august october 2016 similar variations were also exhibited from may october 2017 and may 2018 comparing with the zmd station the higher values of the standard deviations variances coefficients of variation and biases of δ18o in river water at the tth station also confirmed the relatively obvious seasonal variation table 6 additionally the reversal between δ18o and d excess was substantial at two stations fig 7 these variations suggested that the generality and individuality of runoff processes between the zmd and tth stations are mainly derived from multiple components and these components firstly infiltrated the ground and turned into groundwater before recharging the river water in the sryr this has the effect of smoothing seasonal fluctuations in δ18o and d excess meanwhile the individuality of these stations is due to the fact that the mixing level of multiple components is stronger at the zmd than at the tth station the isotopic regression line for surface water or groundwater in a region is called the local evaporation line lel the slope and intercept of the lel of river water at the tth are lower than those at zmd this indicates that it experienced evaporation when it flowed from the source region to river outlet fig 7 however this also suggests that runoff is mainly replenished by supra permafrost water under the influence of strong evaporation two reasons can be interpreted for the differences between the tth and zmd stations 1 the source region and upper reaches of the basin tth basin has lower runoff discharge and is strongly influenced by evaporation while some river water mainly originated from supra permafrost water with an enriched isotopic composition and 2 the water yields of the stations increased from higher to lower altitudes because the contribution from precipitation to fluvial runoff also increased whereas precipitation caused the relatively negative δ18o 5 2 1 2 supra permafrost water supra permafrost water samples were collected in the geladandong region gldd yuzhufeng region yzf and dongkemadi region dkmd during the same period as river water sampling the mean δ18o and δ2h values of supra permafrost water were 11 0 and 89 2 in study region there were also obvious differences in stable isotope values among the three sampling sites table 5 the interannual variation in the gldd increased from may to october with maxima in september 2016 and october 2017 fig 8 it also increased during the sampling period with the maximum in september in the yzf whiles the dkmd displayed decreasing fluctuations during the sampling period fig 8 in addition the lower slope and intercept of lels reflected the strong influence of evaporation table 5 and this influence was stronger in the gldd than in the yzf or dkmd the seasonal variation in δ18o varied at the three sampling sites fig 8 which can be also confirmed by the higher standard deviations variances coefficients of variation and biased of δ18o table 6 two reasons can account for this pattern 1 supra permafrost water is mainly stored in permafrost active layer and the stable isotopic compositions can be influenced by major imbalances in the isotopic dynamic fractionation caused by strong soil evaporation and vegetative transpiration and 2 the supra permafrost water has been recharged by rainfall water snow meltwater and ground ice meltwater which causes the variations in the stable isotopic composition for the lgl of all supra permafrost water samples the slope and intercept were close to those of river water table 5 these findings are indicative of tight hydraulic connectivity between river water and super permafrost water in the study region it is also evident that the d excess values of the three stations were close to 10 fig 8 which indicates that the supra permafrost water was also from high elevation and may have been sourced from glaciers snow meltwater and precipitation under cold temperatures 5 2 1 3 glaciers snow meltwater glaciers snow meltwater samples were regularly collected in the gldd yzf and dkmd during the same period as river water sampling the mean δ18o δ2h and d excess values of glaciers snow meltwater were 13 42 89 67 and 17 7 respectively these values reflect the cold environments of higher altitudes table 5 differences were also observed among the three sampling sites table 5 δ18o and δ2h values as well as lel for glaciers snow meltwater at yuzhufeng glacier were higher than those at jianggudiru glacier and dongkemadi glacier fig 9 the location of the glaciers might be the reason for their observed compositional differences yuzhufeng glacier is located on a sunny slope and experiences relatively strong evaporative conditions whereas the other two glaciers are located on shady slopes interannual variations showed different patterns during the ablation periods in 2016 and 2017 fig 9 but exhibited no seasonal trends table 6 these observations can be attributed to two reasons the stable isotopes in glaciers snow meltwater can be influenced by ablation intensity ablation duration and newly deposited snow meltwaters resulting in the residual snow and glacial ice becoming gradually enriched in δ18o isotopic exchange likely exists between meltwaters and the residual snow and glacial ice moreover glaciers snow meltwater is also recharged by rainfall or snowfall and thereby exhibits more negative values than glaciers snow meltwater especially the confluence rainfall newly deposited snow meltwater residual snow meltwater and glacier ice meltwater is random under different weather conditions for all glaciers snow meltwater samples the slope and intercept of lel are close to those of the lwml table 5 5 2 2 hydrograph separation 5 2 2 1 confirmation of runoff components in the study region the lmwl was established by the δ18o and δ2h of event based precipitation from two stations at different altitudes δ2h 8 03δ18o 11 34 r 2 0 97 fig 10 both the slope and intercept of the lmwl were slightly higher than those of the gmwl craig 1961 compared with previous results on the tibetan plateau the slope and intercept were lower than those of delingha δ2h 8 47δ18o 15 2 r 2 0 97 and hulugou δ2h 8 21δ18o 17 46 r 2 0 97 li et al 2014 and were significantly higher than those from lhasa δ2h 7 9δ18o 6 29 r 2 0 97 this is suggestive of different moisture sources of precipitation in these regions according to the division of circulation zones on the tibetan plateau yao et al 2013 delingha and hulugou are included within the northern transition zone they are greatly influenced by continentally recycled moisture and the westerlies and thus generate higher slopes and intercepts however lhasa belongs to the southern monsoonal zone and it receives more oceanic moisture which results in lower slopes and intercepts the sryr is located along the transition region whose moisture source is mainly dominated by monsoons continentally recycled moisture and the westerlies as shown in fig 10 glaciers snow meltwater is located in or above the lwml because it experiences weak evaporation under cold environmental conditions which were less negative in δ18o and δ2h when compared with other bodies of water in the study region supra permafrost water plotted below the lwml owing to relatively strong evaporation and the similar research in qilian mountains and the source area of the yellow river yang et al 2019 also confirmed this in addition changes in precipitation signatures over time and thawing and freezing processes maybe have a significant influence on stable isotope composition of supra permafrost water but the mechanism still need the further study the isotopic compositions of river water from the two stations were close to the lmwl and the δ18o and δ2h values fluctuated among precipitation glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water moreover these values clustered together between supra permafrost water and river water the clustering of the data for river water and other water bodies indicates that a hydraulic relationship of recharge and discharge exists among them fig 10 these characteristics suggest that river water is recharged from multiple sources including glaciers snow meltwater supra permafrost water and precipitation in the region during the sampling period the river water from two stations showed similar monthly δ18o trends and exhibited no significantly seasonal variation fig 11 this is suggestive of the same replenishment sources for river water at the tth and zmd stations although they are located at different altitudes however compared with precipitation the δ18o of the two rivers varied across a relatively narrow range fig 11 which is markedly different from the obvious seasonal fluctuations of precipitation this indicates that precipitation does not directly replenish surface runoff which is attributed to the precipitation first transforming into supra permafrost water that is stored in the permafrost active layer and which influences the runoff process the same findings were confirmed in the qilian mountains and may reflect the unique hydrological processes of cold regions smith et al 1998 natalie et al 2005 dery et al 2009 ala aho et al 2018 meanwhile the same seasonal patterns were observed between river water and supra permafrost water and the ranges of monthly mean δ18o values were also similar which indicates that the river water is mainly dominated and replenished by supra permafrost water fig 11 relative to the violent seasonal fluctuations in the monthly mean δ18o value for glaciers snow meltwater stable trends were observed for river water fig 11 in the study region the intersection of the lel for river water with the lmwl is 11 39 for δ18o and 80 15 for δ2h there are also differences between the intersections of the lel for the tth δ18o 10 9 δ2h 76 22 and zmd δ18o 11 88 δ2h 84 04 stations it is clear that the isotopic composition of the intersection of river water closely corresponds to the values of supra permafrost water δ18o 11 δ2h 77 especially for the tth station and it is enriched in comparison to the glaciers snow meltwater δ18o 13 42 δ2h 89 67 these results demonstrate that the river water in the study area is mainly sourced from supra permafrost water and that the runoff components are first mix and then replenish the runoff 5 2 2 2 hydrograph separation the emma model was used to identify variable source areas and mixing processes and to quantify the contribution of each end member there were significant differences in the concentrations of d excess and δ18o for glaciers snow meltwater supra permafrost water precipitation and river water at the tth and zmd stations during the sampling period fig 12 accordingly the concentrations of δ18o and d excess were selected for analysis because this combination provides the best separation of sources there were large spatiotemporal variations in the concentrations of these solutes and the river water was located within the triangle spanning the three end members suggesting that runoff is a mixture of them fig 12 therefore supra permafrost water can be treated as the first end member and precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater as the second and third end members respectively firstly the daily runoff was separated during the sampling period fig 13 at the tth station the contribution from precipitation increased from june to july and then decreased until october in 2016 17 the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater increased from june to august in 2016 17 and then decreased until october and the contribution of supra permafrost water decreased from june to july and then increased until october in 2016 17 additionally the contributions from precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater were obviously higher than in june during 2017 18 the contribution from precipitation increased from may to august and then decreased until october while the contribution of glaciers snow meltwater was higher in may increased from june to july and then decreased until october for the supra permafrost water the contribution to runoff increased from may to june and then increased from july to october seasonal patterns also showed some differences and the maximum contributions of precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater were in july and august for the outlet fluvial runoff i e at the zmd station the contribution from precipitation increased from may to july and then decreased until october and that of glaciers snow meltwater decreased from may to july and reached its maximum in august before decreasing until october meanwhile the contribution of supra permafrost water decreased from may to august and then increased until the maximum was reached in october of 2016 17 during 2017 18 the contribution of precipitation increased from may to august and then decreased until october while the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater was higher in may increased from june to july and then decreased until october finally the contribution from supra permafrost water decreased from may to july and then increased between august and october with respect to seasonal patterns although the contribution from precipitation was relatively higher the cryosphere meltwater including glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water dominated the runoff components and then the monthly runoff was also separated based on daily values during the sampling period fig 14 for the tth station supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of river water from june of 2016 to may of 2018 respectively for the zmd station calculations indicated that 49 of the recharge was contributed by supra permafrost water with precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater contributing by 34 and 17 from june of 2016 to may of 2018 respectively this suggests that the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater to runoff displayed a decreasing trend from the source region to the river outlet in the study region while the contribution of precipitation increased and that of supra permafrost water was nearly stable upon further analysis there were differences in the contributions of runoff components to river water during two hydrological years at the tth station fig 14 the contributions of supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater to fluvial runoff were 50 22 and 28 during the 2016 2017 year and 51 25 and 24 during the 2017 2018 year during the 2016 2017 year the contributions of supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater to fluvial runoff were 48 33 and 19 at the zmd station fig 14 and 50 36 and 14 during the 2017 2018 year based on observations at the tth station the mean temperature from may october of 2016 was 0 3 c higher than in 2017 while the amount of precipitation was 20 mm greater in 2017 than in 2016 thus the contribution from glaciers snow meltwater decreased from 2016 17 to 2017 18 while the contribution of precipitation increased at both of the two hydrological stations however runoff was mainly dominated by supra permafrost water which accounted for 50 of the outlet runoff 5 2 3 uncertainty analysis calculation of uncertainty in hydrograph separations requires tracer concentrations and an estimate of the uncertainty in each pu et al 2013 the uncertainty can originate from measurement methods field data or the expert knowledge of the investigators uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 those uncertainties generally included two aspects one is the emma method error due to the measurement of end member concentrations and the other is from the spatial and temporal variations of the tracer of components which could be calculated separately using the approach shown in eq 6 according to the calculations made using eq 6 the uncertainty was estimated to be 0 06 for the three component mixing model in the study region however the uncertainty terms of supra permafrost water and glacial snow meltwater accounted for the 75 of the total uncertainty because they were influenced by multiple factors and are sensitive to environmental change it indicated that the uncertainty in the emma method was less important than that in the temporal and spatial variations of tracer concentrations as for the relative proportions of supra permafrost water precipitation and glacial snow meltwater based on the three component separation model the uncertainties were 0 55 0 39 and 0 43 respectively the δ18o and δd variations of supra permafrost water accounted for more than 50 0 of the total uncertainty as mentioned above the stable isotopic compositions in supra permafrost water can be influenced by strong soil evaporation and vegetative transpiration and by rainfall water snow meltwater and ground ice meltwater which causes the random inter annual variations in addition the stable isotopes in glaciers snow meltwater can be also influenced by multiple factors with random variations most of the uncertainty in this study can be attributed to the variations in and the differences among tracer concentrations for runoff components the uncertainty for hydrograph separation should become more sensitive when the tracer concentrations of runoff components show greater variations and minor differences pu et al 2013 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 although there is some uncertainty for hydrograph separation isotope based hydrograph separations are still valuable tools for evaluating the contribution of meltwater to water resources and they are particularly helpful for improving our understanding of hydrological processes in cold regions where there is a lack of observational data also it should be noted that sampling with high temporal and spatial precision should be used in further studies to overcome the uncertainties originating from the variability of tracer concentrations 6 discussion 6 1 factors influencing runoff precipitation in the study region is mainly concentrated between may and october and accounts for 92 of the total annual precipitation runoff during this period also accounted for 96 and 87 of total annual runoff at the tth and zmd stations with maximum runoff levels recorded in august and july respectively liang et al 2011 the runoff at the zmd station showed a markedly increasing trend from 1956 to 2016 and precipitation was the leading driver of runoff variability with the other factors being surface evaporation and air temperature li 2018 the results of hbv models suggest that runoff is likely to increase over the next 20 years because of the increasing precipitation and meltwater in study region li et al 2013 for the increase in flow within the study region precipitation was the most significant factor evaporation was the second most important and glaciers snow meltwater was the least important li et al 2013 after 2005 the annual and seasonal precipitation in the region have increased notably but the annual and seasonal evaporation have decreased significantly zhou et al 2016 the meltwater from snow and glaciers has also increased due to increases in temperature and all of changes caused runoff levels to increase sharply in the sryr qi et al 2015 the cold region hydrological model also revealed that runoff are mainly influenced by precipitation in this region han et al 2017 which is also indicated that annual runoff are mainly driven by changes in annual precipitation 62 96 and are only weakly linked to changes in air temperature 7 38 qian et al 2014 li et al 2017 these results indicate the hydrological process is complicated and volatile in sryr especially under the increasing precipitation and the serious changes in the cryosphere glacial melting permafrost degradation glaciers have become shorter narrower and thinner under the effects of atmospheric warming increased stream flow has also been recorded in the study region in response to the increased melting of glaciers and permafrost which showed close but variable linkages among climate change glacial melting and water resources in the sryr models and observations have been used to evaluate the contributions from glaciers snow meltwater to runoff but only in small scale basins selecting the dongkemadi river basin with an area of 39 06 km2 in the sryr gao et al 2011 found that the runoff depth had increased by a rate of 56 mm decade and the glacier mass balance lose rate was 1360 mm decade furthermore the aggravation of glacial ablation accounted for about 66 of the increased runoff based on an hbv model and the glaciers snow meltwater had an important role in the discharge of the whole basin accounting for 49 based on measurements from may september of 1993 zhang et al 1997 according to a hydrological model the contribution of glaciers snow meltwater at the zmd station was 9 2 of the total discharge in the sryr in the 1970 s wu et al 2013 in the tuotuohe and buquhe river basins glaciers snow meltwater can supply 2 56 109 m3 a and 1 24 109 m3 a of meltwater to the stream flow in the two basins which accounts for 33 5 and 15 8 of the total runoff respectively wu et al 2013 additionally under the influence of permafrost degradation the recharge from melting ice is also important as these rivers exported a mean of 13 2 16 7 to the surface stream in the sryr yang et al 2019 additionally recent lake expansion is also linked to the increasing precipitation controlled supra permafrost discharge in the sryr and a precipitation runoff function was preliminarily identified in which the supra permafrost discharge nonlinearly increased with increasing precipitation pan et al 2017 6 2 runoff processes observations of these processes were made in the fenghuoshan watershed a permafrost catchment 92 48 e 93 03 e 34 39 n 34 48 n in 2004 2007 it is a sub basin in the sryr and its altitude ranges from 4720 m to 5392 m covering an area of 112 5 km2 furthermore the hydrological process mainly dominated by permafrost in addition 85 of the total annual runoff occurs between may and september during the spring and summer floods the peak of the summer flood is greater than that of the spring flood and soil temperature and moisture above 65 cm play leading roles in the spring flood whereas temperature and precipitation play leading roles in the summer flood li et al 2009 based on meteorological observations at the tth station fig 15 the monthly mean temperature is above 0 c from may september with a maximum in july or august whereas it is below 0 c after october in the study region precipitation is also mainly concentrated between may and september with the maximum in july or august and which accounts for 92 of the total annual precipitation the basin is frozen until may and runoff processes are mainly concentrated during the period from may october as the runoff process is influenced by a combination of several factors including glacial snow melting precipitation and freeze thaw processes the seasonal runoff process can be described based on stable isotope tracering in may fig 16 a the snow cover and permafrost active layer are gradually melting as temperatures rise rainfall increases but snowfall decreases which causes the soil moisture content to rise sharply but the melting depth of the permafrost active layer is only 40 50 cm and most of the supra permafrost water converges into the river therefore runoff is mainly replenished by supra permafrost water snow meltwater and rainfall and their contribution rates are 56 20 and 24 respectively when the soil thawing depth is less than 50 cm runoff increases sharply with increased thawing depth based on field observations wang et al 2007a b wang et al 2009 found that surface runoff increased as the temperature of the active soil layer was elevated and a weak exponential relationship existed between the air temperature and runoff the snowmelt runoff also increased with the elevation of air temperatures and was the main reason for the spring flood period the initial thawing including thawing of the surface active soil layer and melting of snow formed the spring flood flow through the generation of runoff from excess soil moisture which enhanced the increase in the runoff coefficient the surface soil temperature dynamics controlled the spring runoff processes by changing the runoff generation area in the permafrost region wang et al 2012 as the temperature and precipitation rise in june fig 16b glaciers gradually melt and snow cover melts rapidly the melting depth of the permafrost active layer is approximately 60 cm and most of the supra permafrost water also converges into the river precipitation is mainly dominated by rainfall so the contribution from precipitation to runoff increases to 29 whiles it decreases to 16 and 55 for glaciers snow meltwater and supra permafrost water respectively in june with the thawing of the active top soil soil saturation induced runoff and interflow discharge increase and eventually become the dominant runoff components wang et al 2009 based on observations there is no clear relationship between precipitation and total runoff suggesting that precipitation has a weaker influence on runoff during this period while the soil moisture and temperature more directly cause runoff during the spring flood period most of the snowmelt runoff caused by increased air temperatures is likely one of the main contributors to the surface runoff in may and june li et al 2009 therefore active soil thawing processes including the soil temperature and moisture and air temperature were the primary factors driving surface runoff wang et al 2012 under the high temperature and precipitation conditions in july fig 16c the strong melting of glaciers occurs and the snow cover melts away rainfall is normal and the melting depth of the permafrost active layer is approximately 80 cm as the water reservoir so precipitation dominates runoff with a contribution rate of 49 meanwhile the supra permafrost water is in a state of overdraft owing to the continuous replenishment of runoff from may june and evapotranspiration with a contribution rate of 31 and the remaining 20 is replenished by glaciers snow meltwater the plentiful rainfall during the summer could increase the recharge of supra permafrost water which would increase the discharge of groundwater to surface river flow wang et al 2017 in early july the soil moisture from the surface to the depth of 40 cm quickly decreases under the continual enhancement of evapotranspiration and little precipitation wang et al 2007a b there is no clear relationship between soil water and total runoff suggesting that supra permafrost water has a weaker influence on runoff during this period this is mainly because an increase in the thawing depth due to the increased soil temperatures allows soil water to be transported to deeper layers or toward the freezing front at depth zhou et al 2000 with the maximum temperature and precipitation occurring in august fig 16d precipitation also dominates and accounts for 48 of runoff and glaciers snow meltwater also contributes 19 of runoff under heavy melting the thawing depth of the active layer reaches to 120 cm or more as the water reservoir whereas supra permafrost water is deposited with the thickening permafrost active layer and the supra permafrost water accounts of 33 of runoff which is also consumed by strong evaporation and transpiration li et al 2009 also confirmed that precipitation dominated surface runoff in a permafrost catchment during the summer flood period during this stage the recharge of groundwater by precipitation was enhanced because of the relatively high permeability of the active layer of the soil and the movement of groundwater and precipitation recharge to runoff gradually became a major contributor wang et al 2017 although there is no clear relationship between rainfall and total runoff the direct runoff of the summer flood period displays a strong linear relationship with precipitation indicating that the precipitation in summer is still more influential on the direct runoff recharge during the summer flood period than during the other periods wang et al 2009 additionally the active soil layer temperature air temperature and deeper soil layer moisture also have similar degrees of influence on runoff wang et al 2009 with decreasing temperatures in september fig 16e glaciers snow meltwater only contributes 14 of the total runoff precipitation accounts for 44 of runoff with decreasing rainfall and the contribution from supra permafrost water obviously increases to 42 under the reduced effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration as temperatures decrease the surface soil layer gradually begins to freeze between late september and earlier october while the bottom of the active layer is also near freezing zhou et al 2000 wang et al 2007a b underground water discharge gradually decreases due to the freezing processes of the aquifer in the meantime direct runoff from precipitation is limited during this period the influence of soil freezing on autumn runoff is similar to the spring season runoff where a significant correlation exists between the frozen depth of the active layer and runoff wang et al 2017 in october fig 16f the glaciers and permafrost active layer gradually freeze with decreasing temperatures and glaciers snow meltwater only accounts for 9 of runoff snowfall increases and rainfall decreases while precipitation only accounts for 12 of the runoff owing to the overall decreased precipitation although the runoff is mainly sourced from supra permafrost water 79 runoff decreases sharply because of the transformation from supra permafrost water to ground water in the permafrost region nearly all of the river base flow and most of the total river flow in the autumn and winter seasons are contributed by groundwater discharge liu et al 2012 wang et al 2017 found that the contribution from groundwater discharge ranged from approximately 83 0 of the total fluvial runoff in september to 90 8 in october in 2014 the supra permafrost water discharge decreases exponentially when the active layer is frozen during autumn the bidirectional freezing of the active layer controls and changes the autumn runoff processes and runoff composition wang et al 2009 more succinctly cryosphere meltwater dominates runoff in the study region especially the supra permafrost water the precipitation supra permafrost water runoff process dominates the surface runoff in the sryr but the underlying mechanism requires further exploration in the future 6 3 implications of permafrost degradation on water resources the tibetan plateau is the most concentrated cryosphere region in the middle and low latitudes of the earth it is also the glaciation center in china and high asia yao et al 2013 under the influence of global warming glacial ablation is accelerating and glaciers snow meltwater has been increasing each year leading to changes in spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and water cycle this has profound impacts on social and economic development permafrost thawing owing to rising temperatures is one of the main factors that have led to changes in water cycle and the hydrological environments of rivers lakes swamps and wetlands have been closely related to permafrost degradation in the last several decades permafrost is a water barrier and hinders the movement and recharge of groundwater in the lateral and vertical directions tan et al 2016 it exhibits two primary hydrological functions 1 it functions as an impermeable layer and obstructs groundwater and the liquid water infiltration of deeper soil layers and 2 it generates the soil temperature gradient and drives soil moisture to move toward the frozen front active soil thawing and freezing change the soil water storage and infiltration capacities as well as the soil water conductivity redistributing water within the soil profile wang et al 2007a b the sryr is a typical permafrost region spanning 107619 13 km2 and accounting for 77 of total area of the sryr while seasonally frozen soils cover 30754 34 km2 and are distributed in the river valley zhou et al 2000 the cryosphere meltwater accounted for 66 of total runoff at the zmd station and calculations indicated that 49 of the recharge was contributed by supra permafrost water indicating that supra permafrost water dominates water resources in the study region field observations have verified that most precipitation remains frozen in the ground or is used to supplement the deficit of soil moisture and does not form runoff directly in permafrost regions li et al 2009 surface runoff process in permafrost regions of the tibetan plateau exhibits different characteristics from some previously investigated subarctic permafrost watersheds wang et al 2007a b regardless of the level of flood runoff in spring or summer the active thawing process was the most important factor influencing runoff processes direct runoff ratio had little while precipitation had no significant impact on the total annual fluvial runoff in the study region wang et al 2007a b the temperature of the active soil layer was the primary factor controlling the variation in runoff and components during the spring flood stage summer low flow stage spring flood recession and autumn low flow stage summer flood recession wang et al 2012 precipitation only played a minor role in spring flood runoff and autumn runoff and exhibited limited effects on direct runoff meanwhile total runoff was subject to the complexity of factors including the active soil layer temperature and deeper active soil layer moisture wang et al 2017 seasonal variations in the freezing and thawing of the active layer was the direct and the primary cause for the seasonal changes in interflow water and groundwater on the tibetan plateau zhou et al 2000 additionally the nonlinear increase in the precipitation controlled supra permafrost discharge may be non negligible in contributing to the recent lake growth on the tibetan plateau apart from the above mentioned factors such as thickening of the active layers and increased precipitation pan et al 2017 therefore the freezing and thawing of the active soil layer plays the most important role in controlling the precipitation supra permafrost water runoff processes that dominate fluvial runoff in the study region based on a new study zou et al 2017 permafrost seasonally frozen ground and unfrozen ground covered areas of 1 06 106 km2 40 1 46 106 km2 56 and 0 03 106 km2 1 on the tibetan plateau respectively excluding glaciers and lakes under the scenarios of global warming permafrost degradation which generally refers to decreases in permafrost thickness and areal extent and increases in the active layer thickness has been extensively studied notable warming trends in the mean annual soil temperature were detected in the permafrost regions on the tibetan plateau from 1980 to 2015 modeling results revealed that the permafrost area has significantly decreased at a rate of 0 066 106 km2 decade over the past 30 years and the decrease is accelerating wang et al 2019 climate warming has led to the thermal degradation of permafrost on the tibetan plateau over the past half century the total degraded area is approximately 153 76 104 km2 which accounts for 87 98 of the permafrost area in the 1960 s mean elevations of the very cold cold cool warm very warm and likely thawing types increased by 88 m 97 m 155 m 185 m 161 m and 250 m respectively ran et al 2018 permafrost controls the distribution recharge flow paths discharge dynamics and hydrochemistry of groundwater in cold regions cheng and jin 2013 as the active layer thickness increases the permafrost area shrinks and the permafrost thickness decreases owing to the effects of climatic warming on the tibetan plateau the degradation of permafrost affects the interactions among the surface water subsoil water and groundwater by changing the hydraulic conductivity and connectivity of the soil the degradation of the ice rich permafrost itself makes important contributions to surface runoff and the development of thermokarst lakes in the inner tibetan plateau zhang et al 2013 enhanced drainage may lead to increases in flood risk and reductions in ecosystem resiliency via seasonal shifts in stream flow and groundwater abundance because the decrease in permafrost water storage capacity leads to a reduction in the availability of water during the dry season wang et al 2017 all these changes will affect the balance of water resources and freshwater supply in asia which contains the headwater areas of major asian rivers over the next several decades air temperatures are predicted to increase by 2 6 c by the mid 2050 s when this climatic warming will cause an increase in permafrost temperature and reduce permafrost thickness majority of permafrost on the qinghai tibet plateau will thaw dramatically human activities such as the operations of the qinghai tibet highway and railway and rapid economic development will also accelerate permafrost warming thawing and eventually its complete disappearance therefore it is critical to develop scientific strategies for controlling or reducing potential threats to water security and ecological health in southern central and eastern asia future studies should devote more attention to the environmental impacts of permafrost degradation on the tibetan plateau especially to the mechanisms of precipitation supra permafrost water runoff which will provide insights into the effects of an unstable asian water tower 7 conclusions under temperature warming precipitation increasing and cryosphere retreating in the sryr the total runoff increased by 53 at the tth and 6 at the zmd station from 1961 to 1990 to 1991 2017 for river water the δ18o and δd values between the zmd and tth stations were close and there were no obvious seasonal variations seasonal variations in stable isotope composition of supra permafrost water and glaciers snow meltwater were random at the three sampling sites the runoff was replenished by multiple components under fully mixed conditions and these multiple components first infiltrated the permafrost active layer and turned into groundwater and then recharged river water in the sryr and what s more the supra permafrost water is the dominant recharge source in the basin and supra permafrost water precipitation and glaciers snow meltwater accounted for 51 26 and 23 of river water at the tth station from june of 2016 to may of 2018 respectively the corresponding values were 49 34 and 17 at the zmd station for seasonal pattern most of the supra permafrost water converges into the river accounting for 56 and 55 of the runoff under the sharply increasing soil moisture content to owing to the gradually melting snow cover and permafrost active layer in may and june respectively the precipitation dominates runoff with a contribution rate of 49 and 48 in july and august under high temperature and rainfall conditions with the strong melting of glaciers and the permafrost active layer respectively the contribution from supra permafrost water increases from 42 in september to 79 in october with the decreasing temperatures and precipitation it can be concluded that seasonal variations in the freezing and thawing of the active layer directly cause the seasonal changes in runoff processes and seasonal patterns and the precipitation supra permafrost water runoff process dominates surface runoff in the sryr under the scenarios of global warming permafrost degradation will continue and this will affect the balance of water resources and sustainable development of tibetan plateau which contains the headwater areas of many of the major rivers in asia therefore future research should be focused on the environmental effects of permafrost degradation with special emphasis on determining the mechanisms underlying precipitation supra permafrost water runoff processes

5804,an understanding of the origin and migration pathways of geofluids in an active seismic area is of paramount importance in terms of societal challenges such as mitigation of seismic hazards this study investigates the relationship between the stable isotope ratio 13c 12c of deep co2 and geothermometry in selected groundwater samples located close to extensional faults in central italy the temperature range is inferred from an equation based on the na li ratio and chemical geothermal modelling 113 130 c globally the calculated temperature range agrees with that resulting from deep boreholes in the northern apennines an alternative method is also included to better evaluate the difference in isotopic composition between the aqueous and gaseous δ13c co2 at deep condition a review of previously published data shows that monitoring of the isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic in springs fed by meteoric origin located in seismically active areas must take into account mass and isotopic balance to correctly evaluate the component and the role of deep fluid during seismic events in particular the coupled and corrected isotope and geothermometrical monitoring of the springs could help to distinguish between deep gas or deep fluid contributions to shallow aquifers the results of this study indicate that faults play a crucial role in controlling the migration of crustal fluids in addition they reveal that possible evaluation of potential seismic precursors mandatorily requires a long period of monthly monitoring keywords active seismic area geofluids deep co2 δ13c co2 geothermometry monitoring 1 introduction geofluids have long been known to influence fault zone motions and related seismic cycles smeraglia et al 2018 2016 ünal i̇mer et al 2016 uysal et al 2009 williams et al 2017 however little is known about how and where these fluids originate and how they migrate towards along and away from fault zones during the seismic cycle person et al 2007 the increasing importance of these earthquake related geofluids in the science of seismic precursors barberio et al 2017 de luca et al 2018 king et al 1995 onda et al 2018 skelton et al 2014 2019 makes an understanding of the origin and migration pathways of geofluids of paramount importance in addressing societal challenges such as seismic hazard mitigation fluids with high co2 partial pressure are possibly connected with seismic cycles skelton et al 2014 uysal et al 2009 therefore the stable isotope ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon dic has the potential to be a powerful tool for tracing the hydrogeological processes in seismically active areas rosen et al 2018 for instance deep pressurised fluids with co2 partial pressure of 68 97 mpa and at temperatures between 120 and 135 c were tapped through deep boreholes located in the seismically active umbria marche sector of the apennines central italy also the area of focus of the current study at depths of 3 70 4 75 km b s l collettini et al 2008 the δ13c dic was used to trace the deep co2 in the seismically active area of the gran sasso thrust in central italy chiodini et al 2011 where the relationship between seismic events hydrothermal anomalies and co2 rich deep fluids were also further remarked by wu et al 2016 in the surrounding seismogenic sectors heat anomalies were also inferred in aquifers where co2 of endogenic origin dissolves chiodini et al 2013 di luccio et al 2018 moreover in some locations of the central apennines central italy the heat flow could actually be high but masked by the rapid and abundant shallow circulation of cold groundwater duchi et al 1991 giustini et al 2013 our main aim in this work is to track the contribution of deep fluid sources to groundwater in seismically active areas of the central apennines central italy to achieve this we analyse groundwater samples from nine selected springs in seismically active areas where upwellings of deep fluids have previously been documented or hypothesised fig 1 the olevano antrodoco thrust area petitta et al 2011 the sulmona plain barberio et al 2017 and the matese mountains ascione et al 2014 in all these areas no anomalies on stable isotope ratio of oxygen and hydrogen in water molecule i e δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o were detected barberio et al 2017 di luccio et al 2018 petitta et al 2011 rosen et al 2018 in other terms previous studies showed that all waters could be classified as of meteoric origin and that at the same time the contribution of magmatic methamorphic fluids if any or the isotope fractionations due to water rock interaction at high temperature seem to be not significant for δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o clark and fritz 1997 mcsween et al 2003 sheppard 1986 differently the contribution of deep co2 gas of magmatic methamorphic origin to the groundwater of central italy is well known and widely documented chiodini et al 2011 2004 2013 2000 di luccio et al 2018 frondini et al 2018 however it is not yet clear whether the contribution of co2 occurs only in terms of gas or also by liquid mixing therefore in this study we use and try to combine chemical composition data the stable isotope ratio 13c 12c of the dic and sodium lithium geothermometry to evaluate how the geofluids originated and the role of heat anomaly on fluid mineral thermodynamic equilibria and mixing 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the central apennines are a late oligocene to present fold thrust belt generated by the eastward rollback of the adriatic plate under the european plate doglioni 1991 malinverno and ryan 1986 specifically the central apennine accretionary prism developed through folding and thrusting of the passive continental margin of the adriatic plate in central italy active contraction is presently located to the east of the belt below the western adriatic sea the stratigraphic horizons where the basal décollement is located can be recognised from seismic reflection profiles bally et al 1986 billi et al 2006 scrocca 2006 and are mainly represented by triassic evaporites located in the lower layers of the passive margin sequence the sole thrust of the apennines occurs at more than 20 km in the inner sector west shallowing to about 10 km towards the foreland the thrust sheets are mainly composed of meso cenozoic sedimentary succession as known from deep wells drilled in the apulian adriatic foreland the succession includes from bottom to the top permian triassic phyllites and quartzites triassic evaporites and meso cenozoic limestones and dolostones this succession is duplicated and eastward imbricated in the apennines fold thrust belt where it is also topped by syn and post orogenic siliciclastic marine and continental deposits the apennines fold thrust belt is presently cross cut by quaternary seismically active normal faults cardello and tesei 2013 galli et al 2002 2008 in central italy two major sub parallel normal fault systems accommodate the late pleistocene holocene deformation the eastern and western normal fault systems barchi et al 2000 boncio et al 2004 galadini and galli 2001 roberts and michetti 2004 that also controlled the formation of intramountain basins e g l aquila sulmona san vittorino and fucino basins extension is currently active in the axial portion of the central apennines where it is responsible for earthquakes of up to m 7 0 barchi et al 2000 boschi et al 1998 and for extension rates of 2 5 3 5 mm year riguzzi et al 2012 to the west of this area the moho is shallow at 20 25 km ponziani et al 1995 with high heat flow values of 100 mw m 2 della vedova et al 2001 mongelli and zito 1991 and high levels of co2 degassing chiodini et al 2004 more recently a re evaluation of the heat flow in the studied area has inferred even higher heat flow of up to 350 mw m 2 chiodini et al 2013 di luccio et al 2018 in the apennines both the cenozoic clayey syn orogenic deposits and the triassic anhydritic evaporites are known as important sealing levels for groundwater hydrocarbons and deep endogenic gases such as co2 carbon mass balance calculations hydrogeochemistry with isotopic and hydrological data identify the presence of a large flux of deep co2 centred in the extended sector of the apennines with a large area characterised by a flux greater than 0 45 t d 1 km 2 chiodini et al 2004 collettini et al 2008 the central apennines belt is characterised by huge carbonate aquifers with high permeability due to fracturing and karst processes the meso cenozoic carbonate sequences that host the aquifers are often compartmentalised by layers with low permeability aquitards and aquicludes composed of siliciclastic continental marine deposits boni et al 1986 petitta et al 2009 at points of contact with the carbonate aquifers these deposits act as a permeability boundary preventing underground hydraulic communication and giving rise to the basal springs of the regional groundwater fiorillo et al 2015 the permeability boundaries between siliciclastic marine and continental deposits and the fractured carbonate aquifers are often represented by normal and thrust faults consequently groundwater frequently undergoes physicochemical changes which are due to the local upward of mineralising fluids along these tectonic features petitta et al 2011 groundwater from the carbonate aquifers is subject to these physico chemical changes upon its movement towards the recent alluvial aquifers here mixing with deep fluids causes groundwater to take on different hydrochemical characteristics these physicochemical changes may be progressive or fast and localised depending on the interaction between the tectonic setting and the stratigraphic sequence 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis for this study nine springs were monitored and sampled during the 2018 non seismic phase five springs decontra1 raiano bellucci le fonti giardino table 1 had been

taking into account both the complete chemical composition of the water samples and all isotopic fractionation factors between aqueous mineral calcite and gas species mook 1976 1980 moreover any error

particular decontra 1 and raiano displays chemical variation due to mixing that occurred after the main shocks of earthquakes in 2016 2017 boschetti et al 2019 the exception is the antrodoco spring

hco3 ca springs from 2 1 mg l in rio freddo to 127 mg l in decontra 1 fluoride and strontium were also higher in the antrocodo sample 0 9 and 5 2 mg l respectively compared with the other springs table 1 the δ13cext results calculated by chiodini et al s 2000 2004 method and netpathxl code plummer et al 1994 are similar when the former is compared with the δ13cext co2 aq value obtained by the code mean difference 0 1 table 2 the slight difference which falls within the analytical error on isotope measurement of δ13c dic is mainly due to ion charge balance correction performed by the code moreover this fact agrees with the assumption in the δ13cext calculation that no fractionation occurs during input from any source to the solution chiodini et al 2000 finally the δ13cext co2 g values are approximately 1 more enriched than those for δ13cext co2 aq according to the mean co2 g co2 aq fractionation factor at the sampling temperature vogel et al 1970 5 discussion 5 1 δ13cext and na li geothermometer the bicarbonate composition of the investigated water samples is mainly due to interaction with calcites and dolomites of the mesozoic limestones fig 2b the more peculiar chemical composition of the antrodoco spring is attributable to a more extensive dissolution of the triassic sulphate minerals gypsum anhydrite of the burano formation fig 2b governa et al 1989 petitta et al 2011 this is confirmed by the fact that this sample showed the highest saturation indexes of gypsum anhydrite table 2 the carbon dioxide partial presure calculation showed the highest values in the antrodoco and grassano springs having a logpco2 g of 0 87 and 1 35 respectively the cext and the relative δ13cext calculations confirm that these samples had the most enriched values 1 69 for antrodoco and 4 53 for grassano which are within the hypothetical range of the deeply derived co2 from 1 to 5 chiodini et al 2004 frondini et al 2018 at the opposite end of the scale giardino rio freddo and le fonti springs showed lowest logpco2 g and a range of δ13cext values similar to those typical of the apennine infiltrating water frondini et al 2018 according to the δ13cext versus 1 cext model described by chiodini et al 2011 the other springs showed values of carbon contribution between those of the infiltrating water affected by biogenic carbon and the deep source fig 3 a in detail the groundwater from sulmona basin raiano decontra1 and bellucci and capovolturno fall in the middle of the range the recalculation of δ13cext from the δ13c dic of the gran sasso waters adinolfi falcone et al 2008 shows that the high altitude snowmelt and groundwater samples plot between typical atmospheric values 6 7 δ13c 8 2 coplen et al 2002 and those of the apennine infiltrating waters respectively fig 3a an exception is represented by the low altitude spring of capopescara located at the border between the sw gran sasso structure and the ne sulmona basin fig 3a adinolfi falcone et al 2008 in chiodini et al 2013 a heat flow of only 39 mw m 2 was inferred for the latter area in comparison with a higher heat flow value in the northern gran sasso structure 176 mw m 2 these data suggest that the δ13cext anomalies in the sulmona basin could be the result of a mixing of fluids from different sources a relationship between δ13cext and the concentration of some dissolved elements suggests a possible contribution not only of the deep gaseous component but also of the liquid fraction or a water mineral re equilibration due to heat flow this could be particularly applicable to the samples with the highest δ13cext anomalies in these samples the correlation between elements or their ratio and the co2 from the deep source suggests that the application of chemical geothermometers might be fruitful in terms of inferring the temperature reached by fluids at depth in the carbonate evaporite reservoirs of the apennine the sodium lithium na li minissale and duchi 1988 and sulphate fluoride so4 f chiodini et al 1995 marini et al 1986 have been shown to be the most reliable geothermometric equations in the first case minissale and duchi 1988 applied the na li equation put forward by fouillac and michard 1981 to spring waters from the northern apennines application of an updated na li equation by sanjuan et al 2014 specifically for the chloride concentration of the waters considered in this study cl 0 3 m gave temperatures of 96 c antrodoco and 146 c grassano table 2 and showed a significant correlation with the δ13cext fig 3b indeed the pearson s coefficient r is statistically significant p 0 01 taking into account the number of the samples n 8 and the critical value table df n 2 two tailed test siegle 2009 moreover an anova test on the slope and linearity of the normal probability plot also confirms that the regression is statistically significant originlab 2017 supplementary file s3 two water samples from the sulmona basin decontra 1 and raiano showed inferred temperatures of 101 c and 138 c respectively table 2 however their scattered chemical composition fig 2 the δ13cext mixed source fig 3a and the local low heat flow rates suggest that the geothermometric results of the groundwater from sulmona should be considered prudently statistical analysis of 32 samples collected to date at raiano spring excluding three outliers two from before the seismic sequence and the 06 12 2016 sample which suffered dilution after the main earthquake shock shows that the temperatures calculated from the na li ratio were significantly drawn from a normally distributed population originlab 2017 with t na li mean 126 12 c 1σ supplementary file s4 lower similar to local air or negative temperature values were obtained for the three water samples with δ13cext similar to the δ13cinf of the apennine infiltrating waters giardino rio freddo and le fonti springs fig 3b the application of the so4 f equation specifically for water samples within the low temperature range 50 150 c chiodini et al 1995 gave negative results for antrodoco and grassano and t 46 c for rio freddo according to blasco et al 2018 the unproductive results of the so4 f geothermometrical approach could be due to the anhydrite and fluorite undersaturation of the studied waters 5 2 geothermal modelling and recalculation of the δ13cext during the upwelling of fluid its composition could be altered by co2 degassing carbonate precipitation and mixing with shallow waters the use of geothermal modelling provides a more reliable approach to reconstructing fluid composition at depth and to estimating reservoir temperature battistel et al 2014 this is mainly because it considers the entire chemical analysis of the involved fluid rather than just a portion e g elements ratio thus avoiding some of the restricting assumptions on geothermometric equations based on an elements couple bethke 2008 in this study we tried to restore the deep fluid composition of the samples with the highest cext and δ13cext values by recalculating equilibria between water and typical carbonate evaporite minerals and increasing both temperature and co2 thus also attempting to restore the flashed gas the results obtained from geothermal modelling are close to those determined by the na li geothermometer with logpco2 1 1 0 3 calculated at the saturated vapour pressure fig 4 finally the δ13cext was recalculated using netpath code plummer et al 1994 at the mean temperatures obtained by na li and geothermal modelling tantrodoco 113 c tgrassano 130 c considering the temperatures measured in the antrodoco 1 borehole up to 60 c at 3 km trumpy and manzella 2017 the temperature inferred for that spring should correspond to a depth of approximatively 5 6 km the co2 partial pressure alkalinity and the ph were recalculated at the mean temperatures and a total pressure of p 100 mpa using phreeqc code and the phreeqc dat thermodynamic dataset which use the peng robinson equation of state for calculating the solubility of gases at high pressures parkhurst and appelo 2013 the δ13cext co2 g at the deep temperature and alkalinity values obtained by netpathxl code were 0 13 and 1 28 for antrodoco and grassano respectively table 3 these latter values are enriched at 0 8 and 2 3 compared to the δ13cext co2 g values obtained by the same code at sampling conditions in the burano formation at antrodoco the followings values for carbonate minerals were detected δ13cdolomite 2 7 and δ13ccalcite 1 6 masi et al 1995 the central value between the two carbonates is close to the mean value employed for limestones in central italy used for the δ13cext calculation i e δ13ccarb 2 2 di luccio et al 2018 frondini et al 2018 netpathxl code permits a differentiation of the isotope composition of both calcite and dolomite in order to obtain a more accurate evaluation of the deep δ13c co2 the obtained δ13cext co2 g 0 095 for antrodoco is slightly higher than the aforementioned value i e δ13cext co2 g 0 13 however this difference is negligible in the light of the accuracy of the δ13c dic analytical method a similar approach has been employed to infer deep δ13cext co2 g values at raiano the geochemical modelling applied to that sample produced a temperature of t 129 c supplementary file s4 which is within the historical mean obtained by the na li geothermometer t 126 12 c supplementary file s5 at that temperature the carbon dioxide partial pressure at the saturated vapour pressure is logpco2 g 0 82 whereas it is approximately 1 3 at the total pressure of 100 mpa table 3 the mean temperature of t 127 c for that spring could be compatible with a fluid from a depth of approximately 7 km that is within a complex thrust zone where late triassic evaporites anidriti di burano formation are tectonically interbedded with late permian triassic quartzites and phyllites verrucano formation romano et al 2013 santilano et al 2019 the recalculated δ13cext co2 g 3 36 is significantly different from the value at sampling condition i e δ13cext co2 g 6 67 table 2 however the values inferred for antrodoco and grassano are closer to the δ13cext values of 0 and 1 5 as recently calculated for the deep source end member in the central apennine area chiodini et al 2013 di luccio et al 2018 5 3 waters sampled during the 2016 2017 central italy seismic sequence after testing the above described method with chemical and isotopic δ13c dic data from our dataset referring to the non seismic sequence 2018 see table 1 we also applied the same method to the chemical and isotopic data collected by rosen et al 2018 during the seismic sequence in amatrice norcia during 2016 2017 in order to evaluate possible geochemical anomalies related to the seismic cycle the chemical and isotope compositions of four springs were studied during the seismic sequence that occurred in central italy between august 2016 and january 2017 rosen et al 2018 in that study the authors reported that the postmainshock δ13c dic value range of the waters was from 5 to 3 placing it within the range of mantle derived co2 in the central apennines i e 5 to 1 chiodini et al 2004 2000 however they did not perform the necessary isotope mass balance to determine the δ13cext indeed even higher δ13c dic values up to 2 2 were measured in the pes springs during periods of non seismic alarm civita and fiorucci 2010 in fig 5 we plotted the recalculated δ13cext and cext parameters from the chemical and isotope values published by rosen et al 2018 supplementary file s6 in that manuscript the most enriched δ13c dic values were detected in pes and sus springs in terms of the recalculated δ13cext these samples are clustered between the deep and cinf sources fig 5a which are similar to the so called group b water samples of chiodini et al 2011 however despite the addition of deeply derived co2 the highest δ13cext detected in a pes spring on 31 october 2016 i e one day after the main shock on 30 october 2016 was not higher than 6 it should be also noted that during the seismic sequence the pes spring samples also showed a linear path when δ13cext is plotted against the temperatures inferred by the na li geothermometer fig 5b this fact testifies the addition of a liquid deep source which is characteristic of the st vittorino plain petitta et al 2011 indeed deep fluid with a lithium concentration up to 200 μg l has been measured in that area cotilia thermal spring civita and fiorucci 2010 this also agree with the abrupt changes at pes spring of the calculated na li temperature and δ13cext during the seismic sequences of the 2016 2017 fig 6 a in contrast sus samples depicted δ13cext variation at an almost constant na li ratio probably due to an ingression of only the gas phase and no liquid from the deep source however the mixing between deep and shallow sources at pes springs is supposed to be quite normal presumably constant but with variable proportions this hypothesis is supported by the historical concentration data regarding sodium and lithium detected in that spring barbieri et al 2017 civita and fiorucci 2010 fig 6b which confirm that mixing also occurred during periods without earthquake warnings rather the anomalous na li ratio detected on 31 october 2016 fig 5b could be due to i an increased contribution from the shallow source after a post seismic permeability change charmoille et al 2005 ii a change of mineralisation potentially affecting the character of a fault slip in response to earthquakes bense et al 2013 or iii a combination of both of these phenomena 6 conclusions the chemical composition and stable isotope ratio 13c 12c of the dic of nine selected springs from the central apennines show a correlation between the temperatures inferred by geothermometers and the isotopic composition of the deep co2 gas of magmatic methamorphic origin the so called cext which is dissolved in water as co2 aq the shallow groundwater end member of the mixing is characterized by a biogenic signature of the dissolved carbon dioxide which is typical of infiltrating waters the so called cinf the sodium lithium geothermometric equation allows direct verification of this correlation among the studied spring water samples those from the olevano antrodoco and the matese fault systems showed the most promising results for studying deep fluids involved in seismic swarms in the sulmona basin the raiano spring showed the most enriched values in term of δ13cext and the related deep temperature the inferred range of temperature 113 130 c and the mean co2 partial pressure calculated at depth logpco2 1 1 0 3 for these three springs are comparable with figures obtained from deep boreholes in the northern apennines collettini et al 2008 the observed correlation between δ13cext and na li temperature was also verified in samples collected during a seismic sequence and recalculated from rosen et al 2018 therefore in terms of the endogenic co2 flow and the seismic cycle of the study area we can infer from our results that the monthly samples performed in our study are useful for distinguishing between springs which receive deep co2 contributions only and those having a mix of gas plus liquid phases the combined results of δ13cext and na li ratio data demonstrate that mixing between deep and shallow fluids occurs in some seismic area of central italy the resulting fluids seem to be in equilibrium with the aquifer minerals at temperature not higher than 150 c the temperature range detected in the studied groundwater is not higher enough to produce a 18o enrichment in the water molecule due to interaction with minerals e g giggenbach 1992 this could explain the reason why no significant δ18o h2o variations were detected during seismic swarms barberio et al 2017 rosen et al 2018 as deep co2 input during pre seismic crustal dilatancy seems to be one of the driving factors for the hydrochemical changes of groundwater observed before strong earthquakes in various localities including apennines and italy our results identify a useful method to be adopted for selecting springs to monitor and identify of possible hydrogeochemical precursors of earthquakes however the combined and complex response of na li and cext variations during an earthquake sequence necessarily requires an historical chemical and isotope dataset to allow for a complete and in depth understanding of the complex hydrogeological and geochemical processes involved

5804,an understanding of the origin and migration pathways of geofluids in an active seismic area is of paramount importance in terms of societal challenges such as mitigation of seismic hazards this study investigates the relationship between the stable isotope ratio 13c 12c of deep co2 and geothermometry in selected groundwater samples located close to extensional faults in central italy the temperature range is inferred from an equation based on the na li ratio and chemical geothermal modelling 113 130 c globally the calculated temperature range agrees with that resulting from deep boreholes in the northern apennines an alternative method is also included to better evaluate the difference in isotopic composition between the aqueous and gaseous δ13c co2 at deep condition a review of previously published data shows that monitoring of the isotopic composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon dic in springs fed by meteoric origin located in seismically active areas must take into account mass and isotopic balance to correctly evaluate the component and the role of deep fluid during seismic events in particular the coupled and corrected isotope and geothermometrical monitoring of the springs could help to distinguish between deep gas or deep fluid contributions to shallow aquifers the results of this study indicate that faults play a crucial role in controlling the migration of crustal fluids in addition they reveal that possible evaluation of potential seismic precursors mandatorily requires a long period of monthly monitoring keywords active seismic area geofluids deep co2 δ13c co2 geothermometry monitoring 1 introduction geofluids have long been known to influence fault zone motions and related seismic cycles smeraglia et al 2018 2016 ünal i̇mer et al 2016 uysal et al 2009 williams et al 2017 however little is known about how and where these fluids originate and how they migrate towards along and away from fault zones during the seismic cycle person et al 2007 the increasing importance of these earthquake related geofluids in the science of seismic precursors barberio et al 2017 de luca et al 2018 king et al 1995 onda et al 2018 skelton et al 2014 2019 makes an understanding of the origin and migration pathways of geofluids of paramount importance in addressing societal challenges such as seismic hazard mitigation fluids with high co2 partial pressure are possibly connected with seismic cycles skelton et al 2014 uysal et al 2009 therefore the stable isotope ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon dic has the potential to be a powerful tool for tracing the hydrogeological processes in seismically active areas rosen et al 2018 for instance deep pressurised fluids with co2 partial pressure of 68 97 mpa and at temperatures between 120 and 135 c were tapped through deep boreholes located in the seismically active umbria marche sector of the apennines central italy also the area of focus of the current study at depths of 3 70 4 75 km b s l collettini et al 2008 the δ13c dic was used to trace the deep co2 in the seismically active area of the gran sasso thrust in central italy chiodini et al 2011 where the relationship between seismic events hydrothermal anomalies and co2 rich deep fluids were also further remarked by wu et al 2016 in the surrounding seismogenic sectors heat anomalies were also inferred in aquifers where co2 of endogenic origin dissolves chiodini et al 2013 di luccio et al 2018 moreover in some locations of the central apennines central italy the heat flow could actually be high but masked by the rapid and abundant shallow circulation of cold groundwater duchi et al 1991 giustini et al 2013 our main aim in this work is to track the contribution of deep fluid sources to groundwater in seismically active areas of the central apennines central italy to achieve this we analyse groundwater samples from nine selected springs in seismically active areas where upwellings of deep fluids have previously been documented or hypothesised fig 1 the olevano antrodoco thrust area petitta et al 2011 the sulmona plain barberio et al 2017 and the matese mountains ascione et al 2014 in all these areas no anomalies on stable isotope ratio of oxygen and hydrogen in water molecule i e δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o were detected barberio et al 2017 di luccio et al 2018 petitta et al 2011 rosen et al 2018 in other terms previous studies showed that all waters could be classified as of meteoric origin and that at the same time the contribution of magmatic methamorphic fluids if any or the isotope fractionations due to water rock interaction at high temperature seem to be not significant for δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o clark and fritz 1997 mcsween et al 2003 sheppard 1986 differently the contribution of deep co2 gas of magmatic methamorphic origin to the groundwater of central italy is well known and widely documented chiodini et al 2011 2004 2013 2000 di luccio et al 2018 frondini et al 2018 however it is not yet clear whether the contribution of co2 occurs only in terms of gas or also by liquid mixing therefore in this study we use and try to combine chemical composition data the stable isotope ratio 13c 12c of the dic and sodium lithium geothermometry to evaluate how the geofluids originated and the role of heat anomaly on fluid mineral thermodynamic equilibria and mixing 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the central apennines are a late oligocene to present fold thrust belt generated by the eastward rollback of the adriatic plate under the european plate doglioni 1991 malinverno and ryan 1986 specifically the central apennine accretionary prism developed through folding and thrusting of the passive continental margin of the adriatic plate in central italy active contraction is presently located to the east of the belt below the western adriatic sea the stratigraphic horizons where the basal décollement is located can be recognised from seismic reflection profiles bally et al 1986 billi et al 2006 scrocca 2006 and are mainly represented by triassic evaporites located in the lower layers of the passive margin sequence the sole thrust of the apennines occurs at more than 20 km in the inner sector west shallowing to about 10 km towards the foreland the thrust sheets are mainly composed of meso cenozoic sedimentary succession as known from deep wells drilled in the apulian adriatic foreland the succession includes from bottom to the top permian triassic phyllites and quartzites triassic evaporites and meso cenozoic limestones and dolostones this succession is duplicated and eastward imbricated in the apennines fold thrust belt where it is also topped by syn and post orogenic siliciclastic marine and continental deposits the apennines fold thrust belt is presently cross cut by quaternary seismically active normal faults cardello and tesei 2013 galli et al 2002 2008 in central italy two major sub parallel normal fault systems accommodate the late pleistocene holocene deformation the eastern and western normal fault systems barchi et al 2000 boncio et al 2004 galadini and galli 2001 roberts and michetti 2004 that also controlled the formation of intramountain basins e g l aquila sulmona san vittorino and fucino basins extension is currently active in the axial portion of the central apennines where it is responsible for earthquakes of up to m 7 0 barchi et al 2000 boschi et al 1998 and for extension rates of 2 5 3 5 mm year riguzzi et al 2012 to the west of this area the moho is shallow at 20 25 km ponziani et al 1995 with high heat flow values of 100 mw m 2 della vedova et al 2001 mongelli and zito 1991 and high levels of co2 degassing chiodini et al 2004 more recently a re evaluation of the heat flow in the studied area has inferred even higher heat flow of up to 350 mw m 2 chiodini et al 2013 di luccio et al 2018 in the apennines both the cenozoic clayey syn orogenic deposits and the triassic anhydritic evaporites are known as important sealing levels for groundwater hydrocarbons and deep endogenic gases such as co2 carbon mass balance calculations hydrogeochemistry with isotopic and hydrological data identify the presence of a large flux of deep co2 centred in the extended sector of the apennines with a large area characterised by a flux greater than 0 45 t d 1 km 2 chiodini et al 2004 collettini et al 2008 the central apennines belt is characterised by huge carbonate aquifers with high permeability due to fracturing and karst processes the meso cenozoic carbonate sequences that host the aquifers are often compartmentalised by layers with low permeability aquitards and aquicludes composed of siliciclastic continental marine deposits boni et al 1986 petitta et al 2009 at points of contact with the carbonate aquifers these deposits act as a permeability boundary preventing underground hydraulic communication and giving rise to the basal springs of the regional groundwater fiorillo et al 2015 the permeability boundaries between siliciclastic marine and continental deposits and the fractured carbonate aquifers are often represented by normal and thrust faults consequently groundwater frequently undergoes physicochemical changes which are due to the local upward of mineralising fluids along these tectonic features petitta et al 2011 groundwater from the carbonate aquifers is subject to these physico chemical changes upon its movement towards the recent alluvial aquifers here mixing with deep fluids causes groundwater to take on different hydrochemical characteristics these physicochemical changes may be progressive or fast and localised depending on the interaction between the tectonic setting and the stratigraphic sequence 3 methods 3 1 sampling and analysis for this study nine springs were monitored and sampled during the 2018 non seismic phase five springs decontra1 raiano bellucci le fonti giardino table 1 had been

thermo dat thermodynamic datasets coupled with debye hückel and b dot theory for the activity mineral saturation indexes and co2 g partial pressure calculations respectively appelo et al 2014 bethke

taking into account both the complete chemical composition of the water samples and all isotopic fractionation factors between aqueous mineral calcite and gas species mook 1976 1980 moreover any error in terms of isotope mass balance due to chemical analysis can be evaluated by using the charge balancing option plummer et al 1994 in both methods the value of δ13ccarb 2 2 was assumed as the isotopic

particular decontra 1 and raiano displays chemical variation due to mixing that occurred after the main shocks of earthquakes in 2016 2017 boschetti et al 2019 the exception is the antrodoco spring

hco3 ca springs from 2 1 mg l in rio freddo to 127 mg l in decontra 1 fluoride and strontium were also higher in the antrocodo sample 0 9 and 5 2 mg l respectively compared with the other springs table 1 the δ13cext results calculated by chiodini et al s 2000 2004 method and netpathxl code plummer et al 1994 are similar when the former is compared with the δ13cext co2 aq value obtained by the code mean difference 0 1 table 2 the slight difference which falls within the analytical error on isotope measurement of δ13c dic is mainly due to ion charge balance correction performed by the code moreover this fact agrees with the assumption in the δ13cext calculation that no fractionation occurs during input from any source to the solution chiodini et al 2000 finally the δ13cext co2 g values are approximately 1 more enriched than those for δ13cext co2 aq according to the mean co2 g co2 aq fractionation factor at the sampling temperature vogel et al 1970 5 discussion 5 1 δ13cext and na li geothermometer the bicarbonate composition of the investigated water samples is mainly due to interaction with calcites and dolomites of the mesozoic limestones fig 2b the more peculiar chemical composition of the antrodoco spring is attributable to a more extensive dissolution of the triassic sulphate minerals gypsum anhydrite of the burano formation fig 2b governa et al 1989 petitta et al 2011 this is confirmed by the fact that this sample showed the highest saturation indexes of gypsum anhydrite table 2 the carbon dioxide partial presure calculation showed the highest values in the antrodoco and grassano springs having a logpco2 g of 0 87 and 1 35 respectively the cext and the relative δ13cext calculations confirm that these samples had the most enriched values 1 69 for antrodoco and 4 53 for grassano which are within the hypothetical range of the deeply derived co2 from 1 to 5 chiodini et al 2004 frondini et al 2018 at the opposite end of the scale giardino rio freddo and le fonti springs showed lowest logpco2 g and a range of δ13cext values similar to those typical of the apennine infiltrating water frondini et al 2018 according to the δ13cext versus 1 cext model described by chiodini et al 2011 the other springs showed values of carbon contribution between those of the infiltrating water affected by biogenic carbon and the deep source fig 3 a in detail the groundwater from sulmona basin raiano decontra1 and bellucci and capovolturno fall in the middle of the range the recalculation of δ13cext from the δ13c dic of the gran sasso waters adinolfi falcone et al 2008 shows that the high altitude snowmelt and groundwater samples plot between typical atmospheric values 6 7 δ13c 8 2 coplen et al 2002 and those of the apennine infiltrating waters respectively fig 3a an exception is represented by the low altitude spring of capopescara located at the border between the sw gran sasso structure and the ne sulmona basin fig 3a adinolfi falcone et al 2008 in chiodini et al 2013 a heat flow of only 39 mw m 2 was inferred for the latter area in comparison with a higher heat flow value in the northern gran sasso structure 176 mw m 2 these data suggest that the δ13cext anomalies in the sulmona basin could be the result of a mixing of fluids from different sources a relationship between δ13cext and the concentration of some dissolved elements suggests a possible contribution not only of the deep gaseous component but also of the liquid fraction or a water mineral re equilibration due to heat flow this could be particularly applicable to the samples with the highest δ13cext anomalies in these samples the correlation between elements or their ratio and the co2 from the deep source suggests that the application of chemical geothermometers might be fruitful in terms of inferring the temperature reached by fluids at depth in the carbonate evaporite reservoirs of the apennine the sodium lithium na li minissale and duchi 1988 and sulphate fluoride so4 f chiodini et al 1995 marini et al 1986 have been shown to be the most reliable geothermometric equations in the first case minissale and duchi 1988 applied the na li equation put forward by fouillac and michard 1981 to spring waters from the northern apennines application of an updated na li equation by sanjuan et al 2014 specifically for the chloride concentration of the waters considered in this study cl 0 3 m gave temperatures of 96 c antrodoco and 146 c grassano table 2 and showed a significant correlation with the δ13cext fig 3b indeed the pearson s coefficient r is statistically significant p 0 01 taking into account the number of the samples n 8 and the critical value table df n 2 two tailed test siegle 2009 moreover an anova test on the slope and linearity of the normal probability plot also confirms that the regression is statistically significant originlab 2017 supplementary file s3 two water samples from the sulmona basin decontra 1 and raiano showed inferred temperatures of 101 c and 138 c respectively table 2 however their scattered chemical composition fig 2 the δ13cext mixed source fig 3a and the local low heat flow rates suggest that the geothermometric results of the groundwater from sulmona should be considered prudently statistical analysis of 32 samples collected to date at raiano spring excluding three outliers two from before the seismic sequence and the 06 12 2016 sample which suffered dilution after the main earthquake shock shows that the temperatures calculated from the na li ratio were significantly drawn from a normally distributed population originlab 2017 with t na li mean 126 12 c 1σ supplementary file s4 lower similar to local air or negative temperature values were obtained for the three water samples with δ13cext similar to the δ13cinf of the apennine infiltrating waters giardino rio freddo and le fonti springs fig 3b the application of the so4 f equation specifically for water samples within the low temperature range 50 150 c chiodini et al 1995 gave negative results for antrodoco and grassano and t 46 c for rio freddo according to blasco et al 2018 the unproductive results of the so4 f geothermometrical approach could be due to the anhydrite and fluorite undersaturation of the studied waters 5 2 geothermal modelling and recalculation of the δ13cext during the upwelling of fluid its composition could be altered by co2 degassing carbonate precipitation and mixing with shallow waters the use of geothermal modelling provides a more reliable approach to reconstructing fluid composition at depth and to estimating reservoir temperature battistel et al 2014 this is mainly because it considers the entire chemical analysis of the involved fluid rather than just a portion e g elements ratio thus avoiding some of the restricting assumptions on geothermometric equations based on an elements couple bethke 2008 in this study we tried to restore the deep fluid composition of the samples with the highest cext and δ13cext values by recalculating equilibria between water and typical carbonate evaporite minerals and increasing both temperature and co2 thus also attempting to restore the flashed gas the results obtained from geothermal modelling are close to those determined by the na li geothermometer with logpco2 1 1 0 3 calculated at the saturated vapour pressure fig 4 finally the δ13cext was recalculated using netpath code plummer et al 1994 at the mean temperatures obtained by na li and geothermal modelling tantrodoco 113 c tgrassano 130 c considering the temperatures measured in the antrodoco 1 borehole up to 60 c at 3 km trumpy and manzella 2017 the temperature inferred for that spring should correspond to a depth of approximatively 5 6 km the co2 partial pressure alkalinity and the ph were recalculated at the mean temperatures and a total pressure of p 100 mpa using phreeqc code and the phreeqc dat thermodynamic dataset which use the peng robinson equation of state for calculating the solubility of gases at high pressures parkhurst and appelo 2013 the δ13cext co2 g at the deep temperature and alkalinity values obtained by netpathxl code were 0 13 and 1 28 for antrodoco and grassano respectively table 3 these latter values are enriched at 0 8 and 2 3 compared to the δ13cext co2 g values obtained by the same code at sampling conditions in the burano formation at antrodoco the followings values for carbonate minerals were detected δ13cdolomite 2 7 and δ13ccalcite 1 6 masi et al 1995 the central value between the two carbonates is close to the mean value employed for limestones in central italy used for the δ13cext calculation i e δ13ccarb 2 2 di luccio et al 2018 frondini et al 2018 netpathxl code permits a differentiation of the isotope composition of both calcite and dolomite in order to obtain a more accurate evaluation of the deep δ13c co2 the obtained δ13cext co2 g 0 095 for antrodoco is slightly higher than the aforementioned value i e δ13cext co2 g 0 13 however this difference is negligible in the light of the accuracy of the δ13c dic analytical method a similar approach has been employed to infer deep δ13cext co2 g values at raiano the geochemical modelling applied to that sample produced a temperature of t 129 c supplementary file s4 which is within the historical mean obtained by the na li geothermometer t 126 12 c supplementary file s5 at that temperature the carbon dioxide partial pressure at the saturated vapour pressure is logpco2 g 0 82 whereas it is approximately 1 3 at the total pressure of 100 mpa table 3 the mean temperature of t 127 c for that spring could be compatible with a fluid from a depth of approximately 7 km that is within a complex thrust zone where late triassic evaporites anidriti di burano formation are tectonically interbedded with late permian triassic quartzites and phyllites verrucano formation romano et al 2013 santilano et al 2019 the recalculated δ13cext co2 g 3 36 is significantly different from the value at sampling condition i e δ13cext co2 g 6 67 table 2 however the values inferred for antrodoco and grassano are closer to the δ13cext values of 0 and 1 5 as recently calculated for the deep source end member in the central apennine area chiodini et al 2013 di luccio et al 2018 5 3 waters sampled during the 2016 2017 central italy seismic sequence after testing the above described method with chemical and isotopic δ13c dic data from our dataset referring to the non seismic sequence 2018 see table 1 we also applied the same method to the chemical and isotopic data collected by rosen et al 2018 during the seismic sequence in amatrice norcia during 2016 2017 in order to evaluate possible geochemical anomalies related to the seismic cycle the chemical and isotope compositions of four springs were studied during the seismic sequence that occurred in central italy between august 2016 and january 2017 rosen et al 2018 in that study the authors reported that the postmainshock δ13c dic value range of the waters was from 5 to 3 placing it within the range of mantle derived co2 in the central apennines i e 5 to 1 chiodini et al 2004 2000 however they did not perform the necessary isotope mass balance to determine the δ13cext indeed even higher δ13c dic values up to 2 2 were measured in the pes springs during periods of non seismic alarm civita and fiorucci 2010 in fig 5 we plotted the recalculated δ13cext and cext parameters from the chemical and isotope values published by rosen et al 2018 supplementary file s6 in that manuscript the most enriched δ13c dic values were detected in pes and sus springs in terms of the recalculated δ13cext these samples are clustered between the deep and cinf sources fig 5a which are similar to the so called group b water samples of chiodini et al 2011 however despite the addition of deeply derived co2 the highest δ13cext detected in a pes spring on 31 october 2016 i e one day after the main shock on 30 october 2016 was not higher than 6 it should be also noted that during the seismic sequence the pes spring samples also showed a linear path when δ13cext is plotted against the temperatures inferred by the na li geothermometer fig 5b this fact testifies the addition of a liquid deep source which is characteristic of the st vittorino plain petitta et al 2011 indeed deep fluid with a lithium concentration up to 200 μg l has been measured in that area cotilia thermal spring civita and fiorucci 2010 this also agree with the abrupt changes at pes spring of the calculated na li temperature and δ13cext during the seismic sequences of the 2016 2017 fig 6 a in contrast sus samples depicted δ13cext variation at an almost constant na li ratio probably due to an ingression of only the gas phase and no liquid from the deep source however the mixing between deep and shallow sources at pes springs is supposed to be quite normal presumably constant but with variable proportions this hypothesis is supported by the historical concentration data regarding sodium and lithium detected in that spring barbieri et al 2017 civita and fiorucci 2010 fig 6b which confirm that mixing also occurred during periods without earthquake warnings rather the anomalous na li ratio detected on 31 october 2016 fig 5b could be due to i an increased contribution from the shallow source after a post seismic permeability change charmoille et al 2005 ii a change of mineralisation potentially affecting the character of a fault slip in response to earthquakes bense et al 2013 or iii a combination of both of these phenomena 6 conclusions the chemical composition and stable isotope ratio 13c 12c of the dic of nine selected springs from the central apennines show a correlation between the temperatures inferred by geothermometers and the isotopic composition of the deep co2 gas of magmatic methamorphic origin the so called cext which is dissolved in water as co2 aq the shallow groundwater end member of the mixing is characterized by a biogenic signature of the dissolved carbon dioxide which is typical of infiltrating waters the so called cinf the sodium lithium geothermometric equation allows direct verification of this correlation among the studied spring water samples those from the olevano antrodoco and the matese fault systems showed the most promising results for studying deep fluids involved in seismic swarms in the sulmona basin the raiano spring showed the most enriched values in term of δ13cext and the related deep temperature the inferred range of temperature 113 130 c and the mean co2 partial pressure calculated at depth logpco2 1 1 0 3 for these three springs are comparable with figures obtained from deep boreholes in the northern apennines collettini et al 2008 the observed correlation between δ13cext and na li temperature was also verified in samples collected during a seismic sequence and recalculated from rosen et al 2018 therefore in terms of the endogenic co2 flow and the seismic cycle of the study area we can infer from our results that the monthly samples performed in our study are useful for distinguishing between springs which receive deep co2 contributions only and those having a mix of gas plus liquid phases the combined results of δ13cext and na li ratio data demonstrate that mixing between deep and shallow fluids occurs in some seismic area of central italy the resulting fluids seem to be in equilibrium with the aquifer minerals at temperature not higher than 150 c the temperature range detected in the studied groundwater is not higher enough to produce a 18o enrichment in the water molecule due to interaction with minerals e g giggenbach 1992 this could explain the reason why no significant δ18o h2o variations were detected during seismic swarms barberio et al 2017 rosen et al 2018 as deep co2 input during pre seismic crustal dilatancy seems to be one of the driving factors for the hydrochemical changes of groundwater observed before strong earthquakes in various localities including apennines and italy our results identify a useful method to be adopted for selecting springs to monitor and identify of possible hydrogeochemical precursors of earthquakes however the combined and complex response of na li and cext variations during an earthquake sequence necessarily requires an historical chemical and isotope dataset to allow for a complete and in depth understanding of the complex hydrogeological and geochemical processes involved
