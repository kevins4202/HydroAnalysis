7120,understanding the space time structure and characteristics of drought is crucial for drought risk mitigation and forecasting efforts in this paper the drought events are identified by an improved 3 dimensional clustering algorithm the 3 month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei3 is calculated based on the climatic research unit cru dataset from january 1966 to december 2015 to construct the longitude latitude time space the characteristics of these identified events are described by a series of indicators such as duration severity intensity affected area centroids and track path after which the spatial pattern and temporal evolution are studied in addition the vegetation health index vhi vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci are also included to investigate the possible impact of drought on the vegetation health results show that a total of 60 persisting drought events for at least 3 months have been identified in central asia the most severe drought event occurred between may 1974 and january 1976 with a duration of 21 months and an affected area of 5 77 million km2 most events have a duration between 3 and 5 months in addition the droughts in central asia tend to have an east west trajectory seasonally the study area experienced more drought months in spring and summer during the recent 35 years there has been a slowly increasing thermal stress and a significantly decreasing soil moisture stress that causes an overall decreasing drought stress on vegetation health keywords drought space time characteristics vegetation response spei central asia 1 introduction drought is one of the costliest natural hazards and is one of the most complex and widespread but least understood hazard with great impacts on water resources zhang et al 2015 agricultural production al kaisi et al 2013 liverman 1990 mkhabela et al 2010 wang et al 2014 ecosystem bond et al 2008 dijk et al 2013 and human health patz et al 2005 on account of global warming the occurrence and frequency of drought events are becoming more dramatic with an increased severe impact zhang and zhou 2015 the understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought is therefore of prime importance to mitigate its impact and to establish better water management strategies however the identification and characterization of drought events still face grand challenges this is partly because drought development e g rise persistence evolution and recovery and drought characteristics such as duration severity intensity and tracks are not well understood wood et al 2015 drought indices have been commonly used for drought monitoring globally barua et al 2010 montaseri and amirataee 2017 over the past decades a series of meteorological drought indices have been developed such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 self calibrating pdsi scpdsi wells et al 2004 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 spi is one of the most popular drought indices damberg and aghakouchak 2014 thanks to its inherent strengths such as flexibility in time scales simple calculation and easy comparison between different climate regions ashraf and routray 2015 ganguli and ganguly 2016 portela et al 2015 however the application of spi in semiarid and arid regions is often limited by the fact that it only considers precipitation and neglects other factors such as temperature and evapotranspiration that play an important role in drought monitoring pdsi is calculated from precipitation temperature and soil moisture condition based on the water balance equation palmer 1965 it suffers however from several deficiencies such as the fixed time scale poor performance on the frozen and snow surface the limitation in spatial comparability and the subjectivity in deciding drought conditions andreadis et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2010 wilhite and pulwarty 2018 these deficiencies limit its ability to capture the spatiotemporal characteristic of drought liu et al 2016 the scpdsi was developed wells et al 2004 and improved van der schrier et al 2013 to overcome these problems but still suffers from limitations in time scales guo et al 2018 van der schrier et al 2013 among these indices spei is more flexible and reliable for drought monitoring because it incorporates the effects of both precipitation and temperature on drought and considers the multiscale characteristics of drought events chen and sun 2015 li et al 2016a drought identification and characterization are the pre requisite for frequency analysis and spatiotemporal variation analysis xu et al 2015b in recent years the threshold level method hisdal et al 2004 yevjevich 1967 run theory ayantobo et al 2017 guo et al 2016 guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 empirical orthogonal functions eof kim et al 2011 wang et al 2015b wavelet analysis merino et al 2015 mishra et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 principle component analysis pca and cluster analysis gocic and trajkovic 2014 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 have been widely applied for drought characterization which provide useful references for drought mitigation the threshold level and run theory methods are the most common and easiest ways to describe drought characteristics like duration severity and intensity heudorfer and stahl 2017 lee et al 2017 montaseri and amirataee 2017 as a data dimensionality reduction method pca combined with cluster analysis is helpful to extract essential drought information and for drought regionalization li et al 2012 portela et al 2017 santos et al 2010 based on the linear assumption and the assumption that the required drought information is represented by the first component explaining the maximum variance of input data hao and singh 2015 the wavelet analysis is mainly used to identify drought periodicity and relations between drought condition and teleconnections huang et al 2017 joshi et al 2016 liu et al 2013 merino et al 2015 mishra et al 2015 wang et al 2015b zhao et al 2017 one common drawback of these methods is simplifying the space time drought characteristics by studying the temporal evolution within fixed area or analyzing the spatial pattern over fixed durations lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015a in that case the full 3 dimensional drought structure is reduced to a lower subspace one or two dimensions as a result the spatiotemporal structure of drought events is destroyed or discarded even though it is the foundation to understand the forcing on drought development lloyd hughes 2012 to date some reports have studied drought characteristics by tracking the drought cluster within the 3 dimensional space for example andreadis et al 2005 introduced an innovative clustering algorithm to define drought event as a continuous cluster in the latitude longitude time space where the drought index is lower than one specified threshold the severity area duration sad curves are also developed based on this algorithm sheffield et al 2009 zhan et al 2016 the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm has also been extended by incorporating drought centroids drought direction analysis drought track analysis on regional and global scales herrera estrada et al 2017 lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015b the three dimensional clustering algorithm is mainly adopted for the characterization of drought events while minor attention has been paid to the study of drought impacts on vegetation within the 3 dimensional space as one of the most vulnerable regions in the world the ecosystem of central asia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and the northwestern region of china is susceptible to droughts with limited water resources and low adaptive capacity qi et al 2012 under the context of global warming temperature increases and precipitation decreases have been proven by several studies lioubimtseva and cole 2006 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 xu et al 2016 yin et al 2016 the drought impacts will be intensified by the global warming and unreasonable human activities for example the desiccation of the aral sea known as one of the planet s worst environmental disasters has resulted in a more than 3 times drought occurrence in the surrounding area and has led to significant hydrologic economic environmental and public health impacts issanova and abuduwaili 2017 in addition the economies in central asia are mainly based on agriculture which makes central asia more vulnerable to drought events patrick 2017 however the drought monitoring study in central asia has attracted limited attention during recent years and little work has been done to study the spatiotemporal drought characteristics li et al 2017 investigated the general dryness trend in the last half century and found an increasing dryness trend during the last decade although as recent as early 2018 guo et al 2018 discussed the drought characteristics based on spei and the run theory which both provide a useful reference for drought risk assessment however the drought characteristics have not yet been studied by considering the drought structure and evolution within the three dimensional space latitude longitude time in central asia and this creates a significant gap in our understanding of drought events in the region the spatiotemporal structure of drought events is fundamental so as to better understand the drought development to assess the potential impact and to improve the accuracy of drought monitoring and the effectiveness of drought mitigation therefore this paper aims to study the spatial and temporal drought characteristics based on the 3 month spei and a structural 3 dimensional clustering algorithm over central asia from 1966 to 2015 firstly the severe drought events are identified based on the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm then they are characterized by a series of indices like duration severity intensity centroid and affected area the drought events are cross validated by the soil moisture data from global land data assimilation system gldas in addition based on the typical drought events the temporal evolution of the severity intensity and area are also analyzed at a monthly scale finally the impacts of individual drought events on vegetation health are assessed the results of this study are helpful for more understanding of the drought development the behaviors of drought characteristics and the potential impacts of drought on vegetation health 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area as an integral part of eurasia central asia comprises kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan and the northwestern part of china fig 1 it covers an area of about 6 106 km2 elevation ranges from 151 m in the coastal region of the caspian sea western part of kazakhstan and turkmenistan to more than 7000 m in the south and southeastern mountain region tianshan mountains pamir and kunlun mountains central asia is mainly dominated by the westerly climatic regime chen and huang 2017 chen 2009 huang et al 2015 as this area is located far from the ocean it has a semi arid and arid climate with less precipitation and strong evaporation summer is hot and dry while winter is cold and relatively moist guo et al 2015 xu et al 2016 droughts have become increasingly severe resulting from both the global warming and human activities in recent years which lead to increased impacts on agricultural production animal husbandry water resources economies and human health lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 though less attention has been paid on drought monitoring a series of drought events in this region have been reported the drought that occurred between 1975 and 1977 is regarded as one of the most severe droughts of the 20th century sheffield and wood 2012 several other ones such as the 1997 1998 drought zou 2005 the 2000 2001 drought lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 rumer 2002 van vliet et al 2016 who 2001 and the 2010 drought de beurs et al 2015 xu et al 2016 have also been recorded in addition central asia has been experiencing an increasingly drying trend in recent years especially after 2003 deng and chen 2017 guo et al 2018 li et al 2017 sheffield and wood 2008 central asia is in structure vulnerable to drought hazards due to several reasons firstly the countries of central asia are highly dependent on agriculture which accounts for more than 25 of the gdp in most regions except kazakhstan and the northwestern part of china irrigated agriculture accounts for almost all crop land in uzbekistan turkmenistan the majority in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan in all these countries the predominant form of land use is rain fed pasture whose productivity is especially vulnerable to drought secondly the electricity generation is highly dependent on hydro power especially for kyrgyzstan and tajikistan thirdly the water management within the countries is inadequate in uzbekistan for example which accounts for more than half of the irrigated land in central asia it is estimated that 70 of water is lost due to the aging and disrepair of the irrigation system and poor drainage further exacerbates the water management problem wb 2005 lessons on the region s vulnerability to drought can be drawn from the one that hit central asia in 2000 2001 resulting in rainfall levels dropping from 60 to 40 percent below the average and river flows dropping by 35 to 40 percent from normal patrick 2017 according to the report from the world bank in terms of lost agricultural production loss during the 2000 2001 drought period the direct economic cost is estimated amounting to about us 800 million wb 2005 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 cru precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the monthly gridded precipitation and pet data from the latest version of the climatic research unit version 4 00 cru ts4 00 harris et al 2014 mitchell and jones 2005 were used for the spei calculation and latitude longitude time space establishment from 1966 to 2015 50 years developed by the university of east anglia cru has a 0 5 monthly resolution and long term availability which is necessary for a robust spei calculation at least 30 years and climatological studies burroughs 2003 as a gauge interpolated dataset cru dataset is generated from different gauge datasets including the monthly climatic data for the world mcdw the monthly climate bulletins climat world weather records wwr decadal data and some other additional monthly climate datasets with good quality control and homogeneity check harris et al 2014 mitchell and jones 2005 the cru pet data is calculated based on the penman monteith equation which is considered as the most accurate pet equation djaman et al 2015 spinoni et al 2017 cru data have been widely applied in climatological studies in central asia deng and chen 2017 li et al 2017 li et al 2016b and other regions asadi zarch et al 2015 awange et al 2016 mitra and srivastava 2017 steinkamp et al 2015 wang et al 2017 however the cru dataset made before 1960 may not be suitable for various applications with a limited gauge number jones et al 2016 therefore the latest 50 year data from 1966 to 2015 are selected for use in this study 2 2 2 gldas soil moisture the 0 25 monthly soil moisture data for three layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm from the noah model of gldas are used for cross validation of the drought identification the gldas noah soil moisture dataset from 1966 to 2015 is downloaded from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center gesdisc 2017 in order to be consistent with cru and avoid the effect of seasonality the 0 25 soil moisture dataset was first resampled to 0 5 by using the nearest neighbor method and then transformed as the soil moisture standardized anomaly sma according to eq 1 1 sm a i j s m i j s m j σ j where i represents year ranging from 1966 to 2015 and j the month ranging from january to december smai j stands for the standardized soil moisture anomalies for month j and year i smi j means the soil moisture value in month j and year i s m j and σ j illustrate the average value and standard deviation of the soil moisture for month j respectively 2 2 3 avhrr vegetation indices in order to analyze the impacts of drought events on vegetation health condition the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr vegetation indices including the vegetation condition index vci temperature condition index tci and vegetation health index vhi are adopted from 1981 to 2015 the vegetation index products are available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa center for satellite applications and research star noaa 2015 the 4 km vegetation index products are accumulated to monthly and resampled to 0 5 by using the nearest neighbor method temporally there are 4 or 5 weekly vegetation index maps in each month when accumulating the products from weekly to monthly the four maps close to day 1 8 15 and 22 in each month are selected in addition all three vegetation indices are also normalized to avoid the effect of seasonality eq 2 2 vi a i j v i i j v i j σ j where vi represents the different vegetation indices i e vci tci and vhi i the year from 1981 to 2015 and j stands for the month ranging from january to december viai j represents the standardized vegetation index anomalies for the month j and year i vii j means the vegetation index value in month j and year i v i j and σ j mean the average value and standard deviation of the vegetation index for month j respectively 3 methodology 3 1 drought index drought identification and characterization are greatly affected by evapotranspiration or temperature especially in case of the short term droughts vicente serrano et al 2010 therefore the drought indices incorporating both precipitation and temperature like spei and pdsi should be used in drought monitoring studies the pdsi and spei are the two most widely used methods however pdsi fails to reflect drought condition with multiple timescales developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 spei is proposed based on the supply and demand of the water balance equation which is expressed by the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration spei considers both the effects of temperature on drought condition which makes it better than spi and the multiscale characteristics of drought which makes it an improvement over pdsi the standardization in spei allows the comparison of drought conditions between regions with different climatic conditions therefore spei is adopted in this study to quantify drought conditions the detailed calculation of spei may refer to hao et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 evapotranspiration plays an important role in spei calculation thornthwaite and penman monteith equations are the two most popular evapotranspiration methods however previous studies found that the thornthwaite equation tends to underestimate evapotranspiration in the semi arid and arid environment jensen et al 1990 therefore the cru pet product based on penman monteith equation is adopted to calculate spei by using the r package spei beguería and vicente serrano 2013 the 3 month spei spei3 was selected in this study to reflect the seasonal drought condition and to study the response of vegetation during drought events as spei3 is proven to have the highest correlation between drought evolution and vegetation change haro monteagudo et al 2017 3 2 drought identification and characteristics in this study drought is defined in a meteorological sense specifically a grid cell is under drought when its spei3 value is less than 1 a drought event is noted when continuously connected grids are under drought in both spatial and temporal direction within a 3 dimensional space the 3 dimensional space longitude latitude and time is built by stacking the spatial spei maps over central asia by the order of time the 3 dimensional space has a size of nlat nlon nt where nlat and nlon represent the grid number along with the latitude and longitude while nt stands for the month number during the period of 1966 2015 the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015b is used to identify the independent drought areas non overlapping in both the latitude longitude and temporal space firstly drought patch identification is conducted in each time step for each monthly map from january 1966 to december 2015 the first grid with spei 1 is defined as the starting point and then the 3 3 neighborhood of the starting grid cell is checked the neighboring grids under drought spei 1 were grouped into the current drought patch the neighborhood searching process is repeated until no neighborhood grids are under drought then the first drought patch in the current time step is identified the drought patch searching process is repeated until no grid cell of the concurrent time step is under drought secondly a drought patch selection is carried out only the areas larger than a specified threshold here referred to as area threshold are considered because small threshold areas may make large scale drought event separated into several smaller ones sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 and xu et al 2015b found that the area threshold of 1 6 of the study area can effectively address this problem therefore an area threshold of 98000 km2 about 1 6 of study area is used in this study thirdly the drought event identification is performed throughout the study period the overlap area between the patches of two continuous months is calculated in order to filter out the small scale drought events an overlapping area threshold of 6400 km2 is specified following herrera estrada et al 2017 vidal et al 2010 if the overlapping area is larger than the specified threshold the two drought patches will be labeled as one otherwise they are defined as two independent drought events the process is repeated until all drought patches in each time step are labeled a series of drought event characteristics are calculated as follows 1 drought duration dd is defined as the number of months for the drought event drought peak value dp is defined as the maximum value for different characteristics during one drought event both peak value of drought severity dps and drought area dpa are identified drought growth period dgp and drought retreat period drp are defined as the number of months before and after the drought peak value respectively 2 drought severity ds means a water storage deficit the drought severity of the nth drought event can be calculated as eqs 3 and 4 3 d s n i n lat j n lon k n t s i j k 4 s i j k spei i j k a r e a i j k 1 m o n t h i f g r i d i j k i s l a b e l e d b y n t h d r o u g h t e v e n t 0 i f g r i d i j k i s n o t l a b e l e d b y n t h d r o u g h t e v e n t n is the label of a drought event area means the areas of the corresponding grid cells 1 month is the time period the area of grid cell between longitudes λ1 and λ2 and latitudes φ1 and φ2 defined in eq 5 5 area 2 π 360 r e 2 λ 2 λ 1 sin ϕ 2 sin ϕ 1 where re stands for the radius of 6371 km 3 drought intensity di is defined as the division of the drought severity over the product of drought duration and drought area eq 6 6 di ds dd d a 4 drought affected area da is the region affected by the drought event which is also the projected area on the surface of latitude longitude 5 drought centroid dc represents the drought position in the latitude longitude time space which is decided by the weighted center of spei within the 3 dimensional drought space 6 drought track length dl is defined as the length of the drought track which is the sum of the distance of all centroids in each time step the haversine function is used to calculate the distance d between the two centroids eqs 7 10 7 a sin 2 φ 1 φ 2 2 c o s φ 1 c o s φ 2 s i n 2 λ 1 λ 2 2 8 c 2 a t a n 2 a 1 a 9 d r e c 10 dl t 1 dd 1 d t where dt means the distance between the centroid of the month t and t 1 in order to study the drought development severity intensity area and centroid in each time step during the lifetime of drought events are also calculated and are hereby referred to as monthly severity ms monthly intensity mi monthly area ma and monthly centroid mc respectively for one drought event with a duration of n each monthly characteristic i e ms mi ma mc is a value list with a length equal to n msn is defined as the cumulated spei3 value of all grids in the nth drought patch eqs 11 and 12 11 m s n i 1 n lat j 1 n lon ms i j 12 ms spei i j a r e a i j 1 m o n t h i f g r i d i j i s l a b e l e d b y n t h d r o u g h t p a t c h 0 i f g r i d i j i s n o t l a b e l e d b y n t h d r o u g h t p a t c h where msn is the monthly drought severity of the n th drought patch with a unit of the km2 month i and j indicate the grid position area stands for the area of the grid cell i j which is calculated based on eq 5 in the nth drought patch min is defined as the average spei3 value of all grids labeled by n and man is the summed area of these grids the area of each grid is calculated based on eq 5 mcn is calculated by the weighted center of drought intensity 4 results and discussion 4 1 cross validation of drought events the detailed drought record in central asia is very limited and insufficient to validate the identified drought events directly hence due to its high drought sensitivity soil moisture is indirectly used to cross validate the drought identification results guo et al 2017 xu et al 2015b the top three layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm of gldas soil moisture are selected to valid the accuracy drought identification by considering both the capability of 3 month spei in reflecting soil moisture wang et al 2015a and the facts that the growth of most vegetation in central asia mainly depends on shallow soil water li et al 2017 the sma is calculated based on eq 1 to reduce the effects of seasonality hirschi et al 2014 based on the spei3 time series from 1966 to 2015 and the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm the drought events with different labels are identified and the drought severities are calculated according to the unique labels of drought events the corresponding sma clusters are extracted from the sma time series 1966 2015 each sma cluster has the same spatial and temporal dimensions with the corresponding drought event to make sure they have the same duration and affected area then the corresponding sma severities absolute cumulated values eqs 3 and 4 from three layers are calculated and compared with the severities of the corresponding drought events in fig 2 it is shown that the severities between sma in three depth layers and spei3 within the identified drought events are well correlated with high r2 0 8 the highest r2 is up to 0 95 between the severities of the surface sma 0 10 cm and spei3 this indicates that large scale drought events can be well extracted based on spei3 and the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm in addition the decreasing r2 from the surface layer 0 10 cm to the third layer 40 100 cm indicates that the soil moisture in the top layers is more sensitive to drought events detected based on spei3 4 2 spatial and temporal distribution of drought events in order to visualize the structure of a drought event the structure of the latest long term drought event that occurred between december 2013 and september 2014 is shown in the 3 dimensional space latitude longitude and time in fig 3 the bottom layer shows the spatial distribution of cumulated spei3 during the drought event with a horizontal color bar while the layers marked with timestamps show the spatial patterns of monthly spei3 in a down up order the vertical color bar indicates the intensity of monthly spei3 the characteristics of the drought event are marked with a grey background in table 1 from this 3 dimensional view it is clear that the drought structure is quite complicated and the patterns vary considerably the drought event originated from the eastern part of central asia hexi corridor region and persisted in the region for 4 months with gradually gravitating intensity from april 2014 onwards the drought started to move from the eastern part to the western part with an increasingly affected area finally it retreated quickly within two months august 2014 to september 2014 in the northwestern part from 1966 to 2015 a total of 60 large scale drought events are identified in central asia only droughts lasting at least 3 months have been considered in this study the top 30 severe drought events and their characteristics i e dd di ds da dc and dl are listed in table 1 among the 60 drought events the duration includes 3 4 5 6 9 and longer than 9 months with drought frequency of 18 14 11 4 7 and 6 times respectively most of them about 87 have a duration between 3 and 5 months and only three drought events lasted for longer than 1 year the three longest drought events also possess the highest severities which suggests that drought duration is one important factor contributing to drought severity the 1974 1975 drought event has had the longest duration largest intensity and affected area the most severe drought event persisted for 21 months from may 1974 to january 1976 with a severity of 6 89 107 km2 month in agreement with the results of the previous study guo et al 2018 it affected more than 5 77 million km2 94 of the study area this drought event has also been reported as one of the most severe drought events in the 20th century rumer 2002 despite the same duration the 1996 1997 event and the 1967 1968 event have quite different severities 3 74 107 km2 mon and 2 28 107 km2 mon respectively due to different dis 0 56 and 0 39 and das 5 18 107 km2 and 4 53 107 km2 the results indicate that drought events with the same duration may have quite a different drought affected area and drought severity even though the severities are similar the dd di da of drought events may be very different this phenomenon can be illustrated by the 6th and 7th events with the same severity of 1 97 107 km2 month the 6th drought event june 1998 may 1999 focused on a smaller area 3 21 107 km2 but has a longer duration 12 months and a higher intensity 0 51 while the 7th drought event november 1966 july 1667 affected a wider area 4 47 107 km2 with a relatively mild intensity 0 49 and a shorter duration 9 months these differences suggest the complexity of droughts which mostly emanates from the variations in intensity areal extent persistence contributing factors etc fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the centroids of the 60 drought events in color representing the drought duration and size demonstrating the drought severity in a unit of 106 km2 month the centroids of large scale drought events are mainly located in the central and southern part of the study area southern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan this kind of mid region effect is partially caused by the limitation of the study area boundary colwell and lees 2000 the drought events located in southeastern part are relatively less severe with a shorter duration the directional analysis is useful to understand the drought evolution mechanism and to track the drought development for prediction fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of drought direction which is represented by arrows the direction is calculated from the severity weighted centroids which are identified in each month during the evolution of drought events the tail of the arrow represents the mean location of the severity weighted centroids during the first half of the event similarly the head of the arrow is based on the mean location of the severity weighted centroids during the last half of the event the rose diagram and stacked histogram are used to illustrate the directional distribution the different colors indicate drought duration from the rose diagram and the stacked histogram droughts that occurred in central asia preferred to shift from east to west and from west to east probably in relation to the effects of the westerlies in the region the duration of drought events seems to have little relationship with its directional shift the temporal distribution of drought characteristics for both the total lifetime i e ds da di and each monthly step i e ms ma and mi are plotted in fig 6 ds da and di are marked by the solid black rectangles while the ms ma and mi are represented by the filled and colored pillars the 60 drought events are colored differently according to their duration for a better comparison with figs 4 and 5 in order to study the drought s preferred seasonality the number of drought initiation and drought termination month in different seasons are summed up and shown as a stacked histogram in fig 6d and e in addition the cumulated month number for months under drought is also calculated in fig 6f except for several short term drought events most large scale drought events do not overlap each other which indicates that the large scale drought events in central asia tend to occur separately in time the periods 1978 1981 1987 1993 2003 2005 experienced fewer drought and the temporal drought events are divided into four periods 1966 1978 1981 1987 1993 2003 and 2005 2015 among the four periods the period 1966 1978 seems to suffer from more drought events with a higher drought severity and a larger drought affected area all drought events lasting less than 9 months have only one peak of the affected area and severity while almost all drought events with duration of at least 9 months have multiple peaks for both the severity and affected area this phenomenon indicates that drought events with a longer duration tend to have multiple severity and affected area peaks the multi peak feature makes the prediction of the drought termination more difficult as the temporary decrease of drought severity and affected area may be mistakenly regarded as the retreat of droughts in order to further study the drought evolution the growth period dgp and retreat period drp of the long term drought events with a duration of at least 9 months 13 drought events are calculated in table 2 the growth period is defined as the number of months before the maximum severity while the retreat period is defined as the period after the maximum severity or affected area the results show that these long term drought events have a longer growth time with an averaged period of 6 23 months for severity and 6 62 months for the affected area relative to the retreat period average 4 69 months for severity and 4 31 months for the affected area the averaged dgp for drought severity accounts for 56 of the total averaged duration while the remaining 44 is attributed to drp in addition the averaged dgp for drought area accounts for almost 60 of total average duration while the remaining 40 is for drp while there seems to be little difference between the long term droughts and the short term droughts in terms of the drought monthly intensity mi fig 6c according to the seasonal distribution of drought occurrence termination and cumulated months fig 6d f droughts seem to start less in summer and terminate less in spring however there are more cumulated months under drought in spring and summer which indicates that this region experienced more drought months during spring and summer the longer drought months in spring and summer may not be good for the large scale and concentrated grassland and cropland in the area 4 3 drought events analysis the study period is divided into five 10 year intervals 1966 1975 1976 1985 1986 1995 1996 2005 and 2006 2015 in the specific event view the most severe drought event in each interval is used to study their spatial pattern and temporal evolution characteristics the five drought events are labeled as d1 d5 and marked in table 1 with an orange background the spatial distribution of the cumulated spei3 during the life of a drought event and the corresponding temporal evolution of monthly characteristics i e ms mi and ma have been shown in fig 7 the black dots represent centroids of the drought cluster in each month and the red arrows between connecting centroids are the drought track path the spatial and temporal evolution of drought events varies considerably the spei value of d1 november 1967 to november 1968 concentrated on the northeastern part with circled tracks fig 7a the d1 drought originated from the northeastern part of central asia and wandered in this region for 13 months until the end of the drought in november 1968 even though there has been relatively stable drought centroids in terms of monthly severity ms shown as black points in fig 7a the region affected by this drought is still large with the maximum monthly affected area of 3 45 106 km2 about 56 of the study area the temporal evolution of the monthly area severity and intensity are also complex with multiple peaks the d2 drought consists of two sub drought patterns the central western region from january 1977 to july 1977 and the central eastern part for the last two months august and september in 1977 an obvious west to east track path is found originating from the northwestern part grew to the central part and finally shrank in the eastern part the drought track traveled through the study area within 9 months in a temporal analysis there is a close symmetrical pattern of the ma and ms before and after the drought peak fig 7d the d3 drought was concentrated in the northwestern part originating from the southern part and slowly moving to the northwest of central asia like d2 two sub droughts are found in the southern and northwestern part it is noted that the drought event has had a shorter growth period 3 months from january 1988 to april 1988 and a longer retreating time 5 months from april 1988 to september 1988 a relatively uniform drought pattern is found for d4 which originated from the southwestern through the southeastern part and disappeared in the northeastern part this drought lasted for 13 months and covered 4720 km2 with the largest monthly drought area measuring 3 23 106 km2 about 53 of the study area fig 7g and h affecting the total area of approximately 5 18 106 km2 about 85 of the study area table 1 three high peaks of ma and ms are found in the temporal evolution which renders the prediction quite difficult in fig 7i a north to south drought track path is detected for d5 the drought mainly affected the western part of central asia it had a very long drought growth period 7 months and a really short contraction period only 1 month despite the differences the drought events also share some common features for example most of them experienced multiple peaks in ms ma and mi the temporal pattern of ms is similar to that of ma but mi seems to have less similarity 5 drought impacts on vegetation condition vegetation in the semi arid and arid climate is sensitive to the climatic parameters particularly precipitation and temperature precipitation deficiency causes moisture stress whereas the high temperature imparts thermal stress to vegetation health therefore vegetation may be highly impacted by drought events through both moisture and thermal stress in order to investigate the drought impacts on vegetation health the 3 dimensional cluster of the vias vcia tcia and vhia for the 40 drought events during the period from 1981 to 2015 are extracted with the same spatial and temporal extent in reference to the normal condition the negative vhia signifies the overall stress to the vegetation health condition while the negative vcia and tcia indicate the vegetation health stress from a moisture deficit and high temperature the ratios in percentage between the negative grids and the total grids of the via cluster are calculated to quantify the extent of the drought impacts as shown in fig 8 a in addition the cumulated negative vias are also calculated to quantify the magnitude or severity of the impacts shown in fig 8b different trends are found in the extent percentage of vcia and tcia throughout the 40 drought events fig 8a there is an increasing tcia trend with a slope of 0 37 while a decreasing trend with larger magnitude is found in the percentage of the negative vcia with a slope of 0 98 the opposite trends result in a slowly decreasing trend of the negative vhia with a slope of 0 33 the phenomenon indicates that the moisture stress effect is being weakened while thermal stress seems to play an increasingly important role in exacerbating the drought impacts on the vegetation health which may be attributed to the rising temperature due to global warming as reported by a lot of studies in central asia lioubimtseva and cole 2006 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 xu et al 2016 yin et al 2016 in addition the vhia pattern seems to be more like the pattern of vcia which may be related to the dominant role of water in vegetation growth in the semi arid and arid region this kind of pattern can also be found between the cumulated vhia and vcia in fig 8b according to the trend lines in fig 8b there is a seemingly opposite trend between the cumulated value of tcia and vcia the severity of the drought impacts on vegetation seems to vary considerably in various events the 20th drought event that occurred during december 1996 and december 1997 has had the greatest influence on vegetation health due to its long duration and vast area coverage comparing the cumulated value of both vcia and tcia one found that both moisture and thermal stress play an important role in terms of the drought impacts on vegetation health however the behaviors of vcia and tcia can be quite different in some events they correspond to each other with high values while in other events one counters the other when there is a mismatch between the stress from moisture deficit and high temperature the magnitude of the drought impacts on vegetation health will be reduced or even canceled according to the different behaviors of the moisture and thermal condition the drought impacts may be divided into two types including the moisture dominated impacts resulting from a larger moisture stress and favorable thermal condition smaller thermal stress and the thermal dominated impacts generated from a larger thermal stress and relatively favorable moisture condition smaller moisture stress in a special case the vegetation may remain healthy due to the canceling effect between vcia and tcia in order to further investigate on different behaviors of vcia and tcia under the specific drought events four drought events with different impact types are selected the spatially cumulated pattern and the temporal evolution of the cumulated vias vcia tcia and vhia are calculated for a better comparability in fig 9 both the cumulated values of vcia and tcia are high during the drought di1 fig 9a and b this resulted in severe stress on vegetation health as can be illustrated by the high cumulated vhia values fig 9c the result is consistent with the temporal evolution of the cumulated values shown in fig 9m due to different behaviors in the other three drought events i e di2 di3 and di4 the vci counters the tci and in this case the magnitude of drought impacts on vegetation is reduced thanks to the mismatch between the moisture and thermal condition for example during the di2 vegetation experienced less thermal stress but a more severe moisture stress and the drought impacts on vegetation health was mainly dominated by the moisture stress whose phenomenon is more obvious in the temporal evolution fig 9n however vegetation condition is mainly stressed by the heatwaves with negative tcia values especially for the central part where vegetation experienced favorable moisture conditions but a severe thermal stress fig 9g i the stress of the high temperature may counteract the favorable moisture condition in di4 the southwestern part vegetation suffered from severe thermal stress however this kind of stress was counteracted by the positive moisture condition with positive vcia values in fig 9j this could avoid the drought impacts and maintain the healthy vegetative condition fig 9p the stress magnitude of vegetation health from droughts is dependent on the collective effects of both thermal and moisture stress expressed by tcia and vcia vegetation stress from high temperature and vegetation stress from water deficit can correspond to each other while in other drought events one may counter the other and their behavior determines the magnitude of the vegetation impacts from droughts 6 conclusions this paper describes the space time characteristics of drought events in central asia based on a three dimensional clustering algorithm the cru dataset from 1966 to 2015 and the spei drought index are used to construct the latitude longitude time space several drought characteristic indicators like duration intensity severity scope centroids and track path are extracted to describe the spatiotemporal variation in addition the drought impacts on vegetation health are also discussed by incorporating three vegetation health indices vhi vci and tci to quantify the overall moisture and thermal stress the results of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm is effective to identify and characterize drought events and the identified drought events based on spei3 have good correlations with the soil moisture 2 a total of 60 drought events are detected in central asia their characteristics vary considerably and the characteristics within one drought event also vary greatly over time the most severe drought event persisted for 21 months from may 1974 to january 1976 and affected more than 94 of central asia 3 most drought events about 87 persisted for 3 5 months and only 6 events lasted for more than 9 months the long term drought events 9 months tend to have multiple peaks for their severity and affected area which makes the drought prediction even more complex in addition a longer growth period and a shorter retreat period for both the monthly severity average 6 23 months and 4 69 months respectively and the monthly affected area average 6 62 months and 4 32 months respectively are found in these long term drought events 4 in terms of the directional analysis based on track path it is found that the drought events in central asia tend to have a west east or east west track path the period from 1966 to 1978 incurred more drought occurrences with a higher drought severity and a largely affected area seasonally central asia experienced more drought months during spring and summer 5 within the 40 identified drought events in the period 1981 2015 the overall vegetation stress was decreasing for both the affected area and severity which is mainly a result of the significant drop in moisture stress and a relatively slower increase in thermal stress based on the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of vhia vcia and tcia it is found that the thermal stress and moisture stress may correspond to each other resulting into a severe stress to vegetation health while they may also counter each other resulting in a reduced drought impact on vegetation health the identification and characterization of the drought events from the 3 dimensional view are helpful to deepen our understanding of the space time nature of the drought events in central asia the results of this paper may serve as scientific references for the water resources management and drought mitigation the space time structure of drought events should be considered for regional drought modeling and prediction for example the multiple peaks of the long term drought events should be included in the regional drought prediction work in the future the physical mechanism and potential drivers for the long term droughts as well as the mountain effects on drought tracks will be studied

7120,understanding the space time structure and characteristics of drought is crucial for drought risk mitigation and forecasting efforts in this paper the drought events are identified by an improved 3 dimensional clustering algorithm the 3 month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei3 is calculated based on the climatic research unit cru dataset from january 1966 to december 2015 to construct the longitude latitude time space the characteristics of these identified events are described by a series of indicators such as duration severity intensity affected area centroids and track path after which the spatial pattern and temporal evolution are studied in addition the vegetation health index vhi vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci are also included to investigate the possible impact of drought on the vegetation health results show that a total of 60 persisting drought events for at least 3 months have been identified in central asia the most severe drought event occurred between may 1974 and january 1976 with a duration of 21 months and an affected area of 5 77 million km2 most events have a duration between 3 and 5 months in addition the droughts in central asia tend to have an east west trajectory seasonally the study area experienced more drought months in spring and summer during the recent 35 years there has been a slowly increasing thermal stress and a significantly decreasing soil moisture stress that causes an overall decreasing drought stress on vegetation health keywords drought space time characteristics vegetation response spei central asia 1 introduction drought is one of the costliest natural hazards and is one of the most complex and widespread but least understood hazard with great impacts on water resources zhang et al 2015 agricultural production al kaisi et al 2013 liverman 1990 mkhabela et al 2010 wang et al 2014 ecosystem bond et al 2008 dijk et al 2013 and human health patz et al 2005 on account of global warming the occurrence and frequency of drought events are becoming more dramatic with an increased severe impact zhang and zhou 2015 the understanding of the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought is therefore of prime importance to mitigate its impact and to establish better water management strategies however the identification and characterization of drought events still face grand challenges this is partly because drought development e g rise persistence evolution and recovery and drought characteristics such as duration severity intensity and tracks are not well understood wood et al 2015 drought indices have been commonly used for drought monitoring globally barua et al 2010 montaseri and amirataee 2017 over the past decades a series of meteorological drought indices have been developed such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 self calibrating pdsi scpdsi wells et al 2004 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 spi is one of the most popular drought indices damberg and aghakouchak 2014 thanks to its inherent strengths such as flexibility in time scales simple calculation and easy comparison between different climate regions ashraf and routray 2015 ganguli and ganguly 2016 portela et al 2015 however the application of spi in semiarid and arid regions is often limited by the fact that it only considers precipitation and neglects other factors such as temperature and evapotranspiration that play an important role in drought monitoring pdsi is calculated from precipitation temperature and soil moisture condition based on the water balance equation palmer 1965 it suffers however from several deficiencies such as the fixed time scale poor performance on the frozen and snow surface the limitation in spatial comparability and the subjectivity in deciding drought conditions andreadis et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2010 wilhite and pulwarty 2018 these deficiencies limit its ability to capture the spatiotemporal characteristic of drought liu et al 2016 the scpdsi was developed wells et al 2004 and improved van der schrier et al 2013 to overcome these problems but still suffers from limitations in time scales guo et al 2018 van der schrier et al 2013 among these indices spei is more flexible and reliable for drought monitoring because it incorporates the effects of both precipitation and temperature on drought and considers the multiscale characteristics of drought events chen and sun 2015 li et al 2016a drought identification and characterization are the pre requisite for frequency analysis and spatiotemporal variation analysis xu et al 2015b in recent years the threshold level method hisdal et al 2004 yevjevich 1967 run theory ayantobo et al 2017 guo et al 2016 guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 empirical orthogonal functions eof kim et al 2011 wang et al 2015b wavelet analysis merino et al 2015 mishra et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 principle component analysis pca and cluster analysis gocic and trajkovic 2014 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 have been widely applied for drought characterization which provide useful references for drought mitigation the threshold level and run theory methods are the most common and easiest ways to describe drought characteristics like duration severity and intensity heudorfer and stahl 2017 lee et al 2017 montaseri and amirataee 2017 as a data dimensionality reduction method pca combined with cluster analysis is helpful to extract essential drought information and for drought regionalization li et al 2012 portela et al 2017 santos et al 2010 based on the linear assumption and the assumption that the required drought information is represented by the first component explaining the maximum variance of input data hao and singh 2015 the wavelet analysis is mainly used to identify drought periodicity and relations between drought condition and teleconnections huang et al 2017 joshi et al 2016 liu et al 2013 merino et al 2015 mishra et al 2015 wang et al 2015b zhao et al 2017 one common drawback of these methods is simplifying the space time drought characteristics by studying the temporal evolution within fixed area or analyzing the spatial pattern over fixed durations lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015a in that case the full 3 dimensional drought structure is reduced to a lower subspace one or two dimensions as a result the spatiotemporal structure of drought events is destroyed or discarded even though it is the foundation to understand the forcing on drought development lloyd hughes 2012 to date some reports have studied drought characteristics by tracking the drought cluster within the 3 dimensional space for example andreadis et al 2005 introduced an innovative clustering algorithm to define drought event as a continuous cluster in the latitude longitude time space where the drought index is lower than one specified threshold the severity area duration sad curves are also developed based on this algorithm sheffield et al 2009 zhan et al 2016 the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm has also been extended by incorporating drought centroids drought direction analysis drought track analysis on regional and global scales herrera estrada et al 2017 lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015b the three dimensional clustering algorithm is mainly adopted for the characterization of drought events while minor attention has been paid to the study of drought impacts on vegetation within the 3 dimensional space as one of the most vulnerable regions in the world the ecosystem of central asia kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan uzbekistan and the northwestern region of china is susceptible to droughts with limited water resources and low adaptive capacity qi et al 2012 under the context of global warming temperature increases and precipitation decreases have been proven by several studies lioubimtseva and cole 2006 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 xu et al 2016 yin et al 2016 the drought impacts will be intensified by the global warming and unreasonable human activities for example the desiccation of the aral sea known as one of the planet s worst environmental disasters has resulted in a more than 3 times drought occurrence in the surrounding area and has led to significant hydrologic economic environmental and public health impacts issanova and abuduwaili 2017 in addition the economies in central asia are mainly based on agriculture which makes central asia more vulnerable to drought events patrick 2017 however the drought monitoring study in central asia has attracted limited attention during recent years and little work has been done to study the spatiotemporal drought characteristics li et al 2017 investigated the general dryness trend in the last half century and found an increasing dryness trend during the last decade although as recent as early 2018 guo et al 2018 discussed the drought characteristics based on spei and the run theory which both provide a useful reference for drought risk assessment however the drought characteristics have not yet been studied by considering the drought structure and evolution within the three dimensional space latitude longitude time in central asia and this creates a significant gap in our understanding of drought events in the region the spatiotemporal structure of drought events is fundamental so as to better understand the drought development to assess the potential impact and to improve the accuracy of drought monitoring and the effectiveness of drought mitigation therefore this paper aims to study the spatial and temporal drought characteristics based on the 3 month spei and a structural 3 dimensional clustering algorithm over central asia from 1966 to 2015 firstly the severe drought events are identified based on the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm then they are characterized by a series of indices like duration severity intensity centroid and affected area the drought events are cross validated by the soil moisture data from global land data assimilation system gldas in addition based on the typical drought events the temporal evolution of the severity intensity and area are also analyzed at a monthly scale finally the impacts of individual drought events on vegetation health are assessed the results of this study are helpful for more understanding of the drought development the behaviors of drought characteristics and the potential impacts of drought on vegetation health 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area as an integral part of eurasia central asia comprises kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan and the northwestern part of china fig 1 it covers an area of about 6 106 km2 elevation ranges from 151 m in the coastal region of the caspian sea western part of kazakhstan and turkmenistan to more than 7000 m in the south and southeastern mountain region tianshan mountains pamir and kunlun mountains central asia is mainly dominated by the westerly climatic regime chen and huang 2017 chen 2009 huang et al 2015 as this area is located far from the ocean it has a semi arid and arid climate with less precipitation and strong evaporation summer is hot and dry while winter is cold and relatively moist guo et al 2015 xu et al 2016 droughts have become increasingly severe resulting from both the global warming and human activities in recent years which lead to increased impacts on agricultural production animal husbandry water resources economies and human health lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 though less attention has been paid on drought monitoring a series of drought events in this region have been reported the drought that occurred between 1975 and 1977 is regarded as one of the most severe droughts of the 20th century sheffield and wood 2012 several other ones such as the 1997 1998 drought zou 2005 the 2000 2001 drought lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 rumer 2002 van vliet et al 2016 who 2001 and the 2010 drought de beurs et al 2015 xu et al 2016 have also been recorded in addition central asia has been experiencing an increasingly drying trend in recent years especially after 2003 deng and chen 2017 guo et al 2018 li et al 2017 sheffield and wood 2008 central asia is in structure vulnerable to drought hazards due to several reasons firstly the countries of central asia are highly dependent on agriculture which accounts for more than 25 of the gdp in most regions except kazakhstan and the northwestern part of china irrigated agriculture accounts for almost all crop land in uzbekistan turkmenistan the majority in kyrgyzstan and tajikistan in all these countries the predominant form of land use is rain fed pasture whose productivity is especially vulnerable to drought secondly the electricity generation is highly dependent on hydro power especially for kyrgyzstan and tajikistan thirdly the water management within the countries is inadequate in uzbekistan for example which accounts for more than half of the irrigated land in central asia it is estimated that 70 of water is lost due to the aging and disrepair of the irrigation system and poor drainage further exacerbates the water management problem wb 2005 lessons on the region s vulnerability to drought can be drawn from the one that hit central asia in 2000 2001 resulting in rainfall levels dropping from 60 to 40 percent below the average and river flows dropping by 35 to 40 percent from normal patrick 2017 according to the report from the world bank in terms of lost agricultural production loss during the 2000 2001 drought period the direct economic cost is estimated amounting to about us 800 million wb 2005 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 cru precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the monthly gridded precipitation and pet data from the latest version of the climatic research unit version 4 00 cru ts4 00 harris et al 2014 mitchell and jones 2005 were used for the spei calculation and latitude longitude time space establishment from 1966 to 2015 50 years developed by the university of east anglia cru has a 0 5 monthly resolution and long term availability which is necessary for a robust spei calculation at least 30 years and climatological studies burroughs 2003 as a gauge interpolated dataset cru dataset is generated from different gauge datasets including the monthly climatic data for the world mcdw the monthly climate bulletins climat world weather records wwr decadal data and some other additional monthly climate datasets with good quality control and homogeneity check harris et al 2014 mitchell and jones 2005 the cru pet data is calculated based on the penman monteith equation which is considered as the most accurate pet equation djaman et al 2015 spinoni et al 2017 cru data have been widely applied in climatological studies in central asia deng and chen 2017 li et al 2017 li et al 2016b and other regions asadi zarch et al 2015 awange et al 2016 mitra and srivastava 2017 steinkamp et al 2015 wang et al 2017 however the cru dataset made before 1960 may not be suitable for various applications with a limited gauge number jones et al 2016 therefore the latest 50 year data from 1966 to 2015 are selected for use in this study 2 2 2 gldas soil moisture the 0 25 monthly soil moisture data for three layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm from the noah model of gldas are used for cross validation of the drought identification the gldas noah soil moisture dataset from 1966 to 2015 is downloaded from the goddard earth sciences data and information services center gesdisc 2017 in order to be consistent with cru and avoid the effect of seasonality the 0 25 soil moisture dataset was first resampled to 0 5 by using the nearest neighbor method and then transformed as the soil moisture standardized anomaly sma according to eq 1 1 sm a i j s m i j s m j σ j where i represents year ranging from 1966 to 2015 and j the month ranging from january to december smai j stands for the standardized soil moisture anomalies for month j and year i smi j means the soil moisture value in month j and year i s m j and σ j illustrate the average value and standard deviation of the soil moisture for month j respectively 2 2 3 avhrr vegetation indices in order to analyze the impacts of drought events on vegetation health condition the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr vegetation indices including the vegetation condition index vci temperature condition index tci and vegetation health index vhi are adopted from 1981 to 2015 the vegetation index products are available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa center for satellite applications and research star noaa 2015 the 4 km vegetation index products are accumulated to monthly and resampled to 0 5 by using the nearest neighbor method temporally there are 4 or 5 weekly vegetation index maps in each month when accumulating the products from weekly to monthly the four maps close to day 1 8 15 and 22 in each month are selected in addition all three vegetation indices are also normalized to avoid the effect of seasonality eq 2 2 vi a i j v i i j v i j σ j where vi represents the different vegetation indices i e vci tci and vhi i the year from 1981 to 2015 and j stands for the month ranging from january to december viai j represents the standardized vegetation index anomalies for the month j and year i vii j means the vegetation index value in month j and year i v i j and σ j mean the average value and standard deviation of the vegetation index for month j respectively 3 methodology 3 1 drought index drought identification and characterization are greatly affected by evapotranspiration or temperature especially in case of the short term droughts vicente serrano et al 2010 therefore the drought indices incorporating both precipitation and temperature like spei and pdsi should be used in drought monitoring studies the pdsi and spei are the two most widely used methods however pdsi fails to reflect drought condition with multiple timescales developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 spei is proposed based on the supply and demand of the water balance equation which is expressed by the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration spei considers both the effects of temperature on drought condition which makes it better than spi and the multiscale characteristics of drought which makes it an improvement over pdsi the standardization in spei allows the comparison of drought conditions between regions with different climatic conditions therefore spei is adopted in this study to quantify drought conditions the detailed calculation of spei may refer to hao et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2010 evapotranspiration plays an important role in spei calculation thornthwaite and penman monteith equations are the two most popular evapotranspiration methods however previous studies found that the thornthwaite equation tends to underestimate evapotranspiration in the semi arid and arid environment jensen et al 1990 therefore the cru pet product based on penman monteith equation is adopted to calculate spei by using the r package spei beguería and vicente serrano 2013 the 3 month spei spei3 was selected in this study to reflect the seasonal drought condition and to study the response of vegetation during drought events as spei3 is proven to have the highest correlation between drought evolution and vegetation change haro monteagudo et al 2017 3 2 drought identification and characteristics in this study drought is defined in a meteorological sense specifically a grid cell is under drought when its spei3 value is less than 1 a drought event is noted when continuously connected grids are under drought in both spatial and temporal direction within a 3 dimensional space the 3 dimensional space longitude latitude and time is built by stacking the spatial spei maps over central asia by the order of time the 3 dimensional space has a size of nlat nlon nt where nlat and nlon represent the grid number along with the latitude and longitude while nt stands for the month number during the period of 1966 2015 the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm andreadis et al 2005 lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015b is used to identify the independent drought areas non overlapping in both the latitude longitude and temporal space firstly drought patch identification is conducted in each time step for each monthly map from january 1966 to december 2015 the first grid with spei 1 is defined as the starting point and then the 3 3 neighborhood of the starting grid cell is checked the neighboring grids under drought spei 1 were grouped into the current drought patch the neighborhood searching process is repeated until no neighborhood grids are under drought then the first drought patch in the current time step is identified the drought patch searching process is repeated until no grid cell of the concurrent time step is under drought secondly a drought patch selection is carried out only the areas larger than a specified threshold here referred to as area threshold are considered because small threshold areas may make large scale drought event separated into several smaller ones sheffield et al 2009 wang et al 2011 and xu et al 2015b found that the area threshold of 1 6 of the study area can effectively address this problem therefore an area threshold of 98000 km2 about 1 6 of study area is used in this study thirdly the drought event identification is performed throughout the study period the overlap area between the patches of two continuous months is calculated in order to filter out the small scale drought events an overlapping area threshold of 6400 km2 is specified following herrera estrada et al 2017 vidal et al 2010 if the overlapping area is larger than the specified threshold the two drought patches will be labeled as one otherwise they are defined as two independent drought events the process is repeated until all drought patches in each time step are labeled a series of drought event characteristics are calculated as follows 1 drought duration dd is defined as the number of months for the drought event drought peak value dp is defined as the maximum value for different characteristics during one drought event both peak value of drought severity dps and drought area dpa are identified drought growth period dgp and drought retreat period drp are defined as the number of months before and after the drought peak value respectively 2 drought severity ds means a water storage deficit the drought severity of the nth drought

validate the identified drought events directly hence due to its high drought sensitivity soil moisture is indirectly used to cross validate the drought identification results guo et al 2017 xu et al 2015b the top three layers 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm of gldas soil moisture are selected to valid the accuracy drought identification by considering both the capability of 3 month spei in reflecting soil moisture wang et al 2015a and the facts that the growth of most vegetation in central asia mainly depends on shallow soil water li et al 2017 the sma is calculated based on eq 1 to reduce the effects of seasonality hirschi et al 2014 based on the spei3 time series from 1966 to 2015 and the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm the drought events with different labels are identified and the drought severities are calculated according to the unique labels of drought events the corresponding sma clusters are extracted from the sma time series 1966 2015 each sma cluster has the same spatial and temporal dimensions with the corresponding drought event to make sure they have the same duration and affected area then the corresponding sma severities absolute cumulated values eqs 3 and 4 from three layers are calculated and compared with the severities of the corresponding drought events in fig 2 it is shown that the severities between sma in three depth layers and spei3 within the identified drought events are well correlated with high r2 0 8 the highest r2 is up to 0 95 between the severities of the surface sma 0 10 cm and spei3 this indicates that large scale drought events can be well extracted based on spei3 and the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm in addition the decreasing r2 from the surface layer 0 10 cm to the third layer 40 100 cm indicates that the soil moisture in the top layers is more sensitive to drought events detected based on spei3 4 2 spatial and temporal distribution of drought events in order to visualize the structure of a drought event the structure of the latest long term drought event that occurred between december 2013 and september 2014 is shown in the 3 dimensional space latitude longitude and time in fig 3 the bottom layer shows the spatial distribution of cumulated spei3 during the drought event with a horizontal color bar while the layers marked with timestamps show the spatial patterns of monthly spei3 in a down up order the vertical color bar indicates the intensity of monthly spei3 the characteristics of the drought event are marked with a grey background in table 1 from this 3 dimensional view it is clear that the drought structure is quite complicated and the patterns vary considerably the drought event originated from the eastern part of central asia hexi corridor region and persisted in the region for 4 months with gradually gravitating intensity from april 2014 onwards the drought started to move from the eastern part to the western part with an increasingly affected area finally it retreated quickly within two months august 2014 to september 2014 in the northwestern part from 1966 to 2015 a total of 60 large scale drought events are identified in central asia only droughts lasting at least 3 months have been considered in this study the top 30 severe drought events and their characteristics i e dd di ds da dc and dl are listed in table 1 among the 60 drought events the duration includes 3 4 5 6 9 and longer than 9 months with drought frequency of 18 14 11 4 7 and 6 times respectively most of them about 87 have a duration between 3 and 5 months and only three drought events lasted for longer than 1 year the three longest drought events also possess the highest severities which suggests that drought duration is one important factor contributing to drought severity the 1974 1975 drought event has had the longest duration largest intensity and affected area the most severe drought event persisted for 21 months from may 1974 to january 1976 with a severity of 6 89 107 km2 month in agreement with the results of the previous study guo et al 2018 it affected more than 5 77 million km2 94 of the study area this drought event has also been reported as one of the most severe drought events in the 20th century rumer 2002 despite the same duration the 1996 1997 event and the 1967 1968 event have quite different severities 3 74 107 km2 mon and 2 28 107 km2 mon respectively due to different dis 0 56 and 0 39 and das 5 18 107 km2 and 4 53 107 km2 the results indicate that drought events with the same duration may have quite a different drought affected area and drought severity even though the severities are similar the dd di da of drought events may be very different this phenomenon can be illustrated by the 6th and 7th events with the same severity of 1 97 107 km2 month the 6th drought event june 1998 may 1999 focused on a smaller area 3 21 107 km2 but has a longer duration 12 months and a higher intensity 0 51 while the 7th drought event november 1966 july 1667 affected a wider area 4 47 107 km2 with a relatively mild intensity 0 49 and a shorter duration 9 months these differences suggest the complexity of droughts which mostly emanates from the variations in intensity areal extent persistence contributing factors etc fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the centroids of the 60 drought events in color representing the drought duration and size demonstrating the drought severity in a unit of 106 km2 month the centroids of large scale drought events are mainly located in the central and southern part of the study area southern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan this kind of mid region effect is partially caused by the limitation of the study area boundary colwell and lees 2000 the drought events located in southeastern part are relatively less severe with a shorter duration the directional analysis is useful to understand the drought evolution mechanism and to track the drought development for prediction fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of drought direction which is represented by arrows the direction is calculated from the severity weighted centroids which are identified in each month during the evolution of drought events the tail of the arrow represents the mean location of the severity weighted centroids during the first half of the event similarly the head of the arrow is based on the mean location of the severity weighted centroids during the last half of the event the rose diagram and stacked histogram are used to illustrate the directional distribution the different colors indicate drought duration from the rose diagram and the stacked histogram droughts that occurred in central asia preferred to shift from east to west and from west to east probably in relation to the effects of the westerlies in the region the duration of drought events seems to have little relationship with its directional shift the temporal distribution of drought characteristics for both the total lifetime i e ds da di and each monthly step i e ms ma and mi are plotted in fig 6 ds da and di are marked by the solid black rectangles while the ms ma and mi are represented by the filled and colored pillars the 60 drought events are colored differently according to their duration for a better comparison with figs 4 and 5 in order to study the drought s preferred seasonality the number of drought initiation and drought termination month in different seasons are summed up and shown as a stacked histogram in fig 6d and e in addition the cumulated month number for months under drought is also calculated in fig 6f except for several short term drought events most large scale drought events do not overlap each other which indicates that the large scale drought events in central asia tend to occur separately in time the periods 1978 1981 1987 1993 2003 2005 experienced fewer drought and the temporal drought events are divided into four periods 1966 1978 1981 1987 1993 2003 and 2005 2015 among the four periods the period 1966 1978 seems to suffer from more drought events with a higher drought severity and a larger drought affected area all drought events lasting less than 9 months have only one peak of the affected area and severity while almost all drought events with duration of at least 9 months have multiple peaks for both the severity and affected area this phenomenon indicates that drought events with a longer duration tend to have multiple severity and affected area peaks the multi peak feature makes the prediction of the drought termination more difficult as the temporary decrease of drought severity and affected area may be mistakenly regarded as the retreat of droughts in order to further study the drought evolution the growth period dgp and retreat period drp of the long term drought events with a duration of at least 9 months 13 drought events are calculated in table 2 the growth period is defined as the number of months before the maximum severity while the retreat period is defined as the period after the maximum severity or affected area the results show that these long term drought events have a longer growth time with an averaged period of 6 23 months for severity and 6 62 months for the affected area relative to the retreat period average 4 69 months for severity and 4 31 months for the affected area the averaged dgp for drought severity accounts for 56 of the total averaged duration while the remaining 44 is attributed to drp in addition the averaged dgp for drought area accounts for almost 60 of total average duration while the remaining 40 is for drp while there seems to be little difference between the long term droughts and the short term droughts in terms of the drought monthly intensity mi fig 6c according to the seasonal distribution of drought occurrence termination and cumulated months fig 6d f droughts seem to start less in summer and terminate less in spring however there are more cumulated months under drought in spring and summer which indicates that this region experienced more drought months during spring and summer the longer drought months in spring and summer may not be good for the large scale and concentrated grassland and cropland in the area 4 3 drought events analysis the study period is divided into five 10 year intervals 1966 1975 1976 1985 1986 1995 1996 2005 and 2006 2015 in the specific event view the most severe drought event in each interval is used to study their spatial pattern and temporal evolution characteristics the five drought events are labeled as d1 d5 and marked in table 1 with an orange background the spatial distribution of the cumulated spei3 during the life of a drought event and the corresponding temporal evolution of monthly characteristics i e ms mi and ma have been shown in fig 7 the black dots represent centroids of the drought cluster in each month and the red arrows between connecting centroids are the drought track path the spatial and temporal evolution of drought events varies considerably the spei value of d1 november 1967 to november 1968 concentrated on the northeastern part with circled tracks fig 7a the d1 drought originated from the northeastern part of central asia and wandered in this region for 13 months until the end of the drought in november 1968 even though there has been relatively stable drought centroids in terms of monthly severity ms shown as black points in fig 7a the region affected by this drought is still large with the maximum monthly affected area of 3 45 106 km2 about 56 of the study area the temporal evolution of the monthly area severity and intensity are also complex with multiple peaks the d2 drought consists of two sub drought patterns the central western region from january 1977 to july 1977 and the central eastern part for the last two months august and september in 1977 an obvious west to east track path is found originating from the northwestern part grew to the central part and finally shrank in the eastern part the drought track traveled through the study area within 9 months in a temporal analysis there is a close symmetrical pattern of the ma and ms before and after the drought peak fig 7d the d3 drought was concentrated in the northwestern part originating from the southern part and slowly moving to the northwest of central asia like d2 two sub droughts are found in the southern and northwestern part it is noted that the drought event has had a shorter growth period 3 months from january 1988 to april 1988 and a longer retreating time 5 months from april 1988 to september 1988 a relatively uniform drought pattern is found for d4 which originated from the southwestern through the southeastern part and disappeared in the northeastern part this drought lasted for 13 months and covered 4720 km2 with the largest monthly drought area measuring 3 23 106 km2 about 53 of the study area fig 7g and h affecting the total area of approximately 5 18 106 km2 about 85 of the study area table 1 three high peaks of ma and ms are found in the temporal evolution which renders the prediction quite difficult in fig 7i a north to south drought track path is detected for d5 the drought mainly affected the western part of central asia it had a very long drought growth period 7 months and a really short contraction period only 1 month despite the differences the drought events also share some common features for example most of them experienced multiple peaks in ms ma and mi the temporal pattern of ms is similar to that of ma but mi seems to have less similarity 5 drought impacts on vegetation condition vegetation in the semi arid and arid climate is sensitive to the climatic parameters particularly precipitation and temperature precipitation deficiency causes moisture stress whereas the high temperature imparts thermal stress to vegetation health therefore vegetation may be highly impacted by drought events through both moisture and thermal stress in order to investigate the drought impacts on vegetation health the 3 dimensional cluster of the vias vcia tcia and vhia for the 40 drought events during the period from 1981 to 2015 are extracted with the same spatial and temporal extent in reference to the normal condition the negative vhia signifies the overall stress to the vegetation health condition while the negative vcia and tcia indicate the vegetation health stress from a moisture deficit and high temperature the ratios in percentage between the negative grids and the total grids of the via cluster are calculated to quantify the extent of the drought impacts as shown in fig 8 a in addition the cumulated negative vias are also calculated to quantify the magnitude or severity of the impacts shown in fig 8b different trends are found in the extent percentage of vcia and tcia throughout the 40 drought events fig 8a there is an increasing tcia trend with a slope of 0 37 while a decreasing trend with larger magnitude is found in the percentage of the negative vcia with a slope of 0 98 the opposite trends result in a slowly decreasing trend of the negative vhia with a slope of 0 33 the phenomenon indicates that the moisture stress effect is being weakened while thermal stress seems to play an increasingly important role in exacerbating the drought impacts on the vegetation health which may be attributed to the rising temperature due to global warming as reported by a lot of studies in central asia lioubimtseva and cole 2006 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 xu et al 2016 yin et al 2016 in addition the vhia pattern seems to be more like the pattern of vcia which may be related to the dominant role of water in vegetation growth in the semi arid and arid region this kind of pattern can also be found between the cumulated vhia and vcia in fig 8b according to the trend lines in fig 8b there is a seemingly opposite trend between the cumulated value of tcia and vcia the severity of the drought impacts on vegetation seems to vary considerably in various events the 20th drought event that occurred during december 1996 and december 1997 has had the greatest influence on vegetation health due to its long duration and vast area coverage comparing the cumulated value of both vcia and tcia one found that both moisture and thermal stress play an important role in terms of the drought impacts on vegetation health however the behaviors of vcia and tcia can be quite different in some events they correspond to each other with high values while in other events one counters the other when there is a mismatch between the stress from moisture deficit and high temperature the magnitude of the drought impacts on vegetation health will be reduced or even canceled according to the different behaviors of the moisture and thermal condition the drought impacts may be divided into two types including the moisture dominated impacts resulting from a larger moisture stress and favorable thermal condition smaller thermal stress and the thermal dominated impacts generated from a larger thermal stress and relatively favorable moisture condition smaller moisture stress in a special case the vegetation may remain healthy due to the canceling effect between vcia and tcia in order to further investigate on different behaviors of vcia and tcia under the specific drought events four drought events with different impact types are selected the spatially cumulated pattern and the temporal evolution of the cumulated vias vcia tcia and vhia are calculated for a better comparability in fig 9 both the cumulated values of vcia and tcia are high during the drought di1 fig 9a and b this resulted in severe stress on vegetation health as can be illustrated by the high cumulated vhia values fig 9c the result is consistent with the temporal evolution of the cumulated values shown in fig 9m due to different behaviors in the other three drought events i e di2 di3 and di4 the vci counters the tci and in this case the magnitude of drought impacts on vegetation is reduced thanks to the mismatch between the moisture and thermal condition for example during the di2 vegetation experienced less thermal stress but a more severe moisture stress and the drought impacts on vegetation health was mainly dominated by the moisture stress whose phenomenon is more obvious in the temporal evolution fig 9n however vegetation condition is mainly stressed by the heatwaves with negative tcia values especially for the central part where vegetation experienced favorable moisture conditions but a severe thermal stress fig 9g i the stress of the high temperature may counteract the favorable moisture condition in di4 the southwestern part vegetation suffered from severe thermal stress however this kind of stress was counteracted by the positive moisture condition with positive vcia values in fig 9j this could avoid the drought impacts and maintain the healthy vegetative condition fig 9p the stress magnitude of vegetation health from droughts is dependent on the collective effects of both thermal and moisture stress expressed by tcia and vcia vegetation stress from high temperature and vegetation stress from water deficit can correspond to each other while in other drought events one may counter the other and their behavior determines the magnitude of the vegetation impacts from droughts 6 conclusions this paper describes the space time characteristics of drought events in central asia based on a three dimensional clustering algorithm the cru dataset from 1966 to 2015 and the spei drought index are used to construct the latitude longitude time space several drought characteristic indicators like duration intensity severity scope centroids and track path are extracted to describe the spatiotemporal variation in addition the drought impacts on vegetation health are also discussed by incorporating three vegetation health indices vhi vci and tci to quantify the overall moisture and thermal stress the results of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the 3 dimensional clustering algorithm is effective to identify and characterize drought events and the identified drought events based on spei3 have good correlations with the soil moisture 2 a total of 60 drought events are detected in central asia their characteristics vary considerably and the characteristics within one drought event also vary greatly over time the most severe drought event persisted for 21 months from may 1974 to january 1976 and affected more than 94 of central asia 3 most drought events about 87 persisted for 3 5 months and only 6 events lasted for more than 9 months the long term drought events 9 months tend to have multiple peaks for their severity and affected area which makes the drought prediction even more complex in addition a longer growth period and a shorter retreat period for both the monthly severity average 6 23 months and 4 69 months respectively and the monthly affected area average 6 62 months and 4 32 months respectively are found in these long term drought events 4 in terms of the directional analysis based on track path it is found that the drought events in central asia tend to have a west east or east west track path the period from 1966 to 1978 incurred more drought occurrences with a higher drought severity and a largely affected area seasonally central asia experienced more drought months during spring and summer 5 within the 40 identified drought events in the period 1981 2015 the overall vegetation stress was decreasing for both the affected area and severity which is mainly a result of the significant drop in moisture stress and a relatively slower increase in thermal stress based on the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of vhia vcia and tcia it is found that the thermal stress and moisture stress may correspond to each other resulting into a severe stress to vegetation health while they may also counter each other resulting in a reduced drought impact on vegetation health the identification and characterization of the drought events from the 3 dimensional view are helpful to deepen our understanding of the space time nature of the drought events in central asia the results of this paper may serve as scientific references for the water resources management and drought mitigation the space time structure of drought events should be considered for regional drought modeling and prediction for example the multiple peaks of the long term drought events should be included in the regional drought prediction work in the future the physical mechanism and potential drivers for the long term droughts as well as the mountain effects on drought tracks will be studied

7121,conventional neuro fuzzy systems used for rainfall runoff r r modelling are generally dependent on expert knowledge in these models not only the structure is designed by the expert user but also all the required knowledge for fuzzy partitioning of the input output space and rule base need to be provided by the expert to move towards nfs with a more flexible rule base and structure efforts are made to integrate the self reliant mechanisms into the learning algorithm that enable the model to identify the position and distribution of fuzzy labels in input output space and generate the required rule base in this study the self adaptive fuzzy inference network safin is used for the r r application safin employs a new clustering technique known as categorical learning induced partitioning clip which allows the model to adapt to the new incoming tuple by consistently updating the model safin is also equipped with a rule pruning mechanism that can exclude inconsistent and obsolete rules in this study safin r r models are developed in three different catchment types and sizes where the results are compared against a benchmark nfs model and few physical models including urhm hbv gr4j results shows that safin is a capable and robust tool for r r modeling under varying catchment conditions moreover safin produced comparable if not superior results to the benchmark models it was concluded that ssfin with its self reliant learning and rule generation mechanism equipped with rule pruning can make it a competent tool for r r modelling in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies keywords rainfall runoff modelling safin denfis self reliant learning 1 introduction rainfall runoff r r modeling is an important field of study in hydrology which aims to understand and capture the rainfall runoff process for resolving many hydrological problems such as flood forecasting drainage infrastructure design and urban planning beside the physically based models which require the knowledge of the system mechanism and its parameters there are system theoretic models which do not concern much of the physical processes of the problem but instead focus on correlation and mapping between the rainfall and runoff data minns and hall 1996 in the 1990 s and early 2000 s system theoretic models were used extensively in r r modeling examples of such models are regression models artificial neural networks ann and neuro fuzzy systems nfs hsu et al 1995 sajikumar and thandaveswara 1999 xiong et al 2001 rajurkar et al 2002 these models have been capable of capturing rainfall runoff process with different degree of non linearity and complexity without requiring prior knowledge of the physical processes of the system although widely used many of these models provide little information about the physics of the problem and normally are considered as black box models however in recent years nfs began to gain widespread adoption through their semantic based fuzzy neural architecture quek and singh 2005 nfs combine the human inspired reasoning style of fuzzy systems with the learning structure of neural networks an advantage of nfs in contrast to ann is a significant reduction in training time due to the decrease in the dimensions since parameters related to the problem domain are initialized maguire et al 1998 based on the method chosen for determining the output nfs can be classified into two types the linguistic or mamdani type mamdani and assilian 1975 and the precise or takagi sugeno kang tsk type takagi and sugeno 1985 linguistic nfs are models where both antecedents and consequents are defined by fuzzy sets whereas precise nfs are models where only the antecedent is defined by a fuzzy set while the consequent can be represented by crisp values on the other hand nfs can be also categorized based on their design method in this classification nfs are designed either by expert knowledge or directly from data tung et al 2011 in the former not only the structure of the model is designed by the expert user but also all the required knowledge for fuzzy partitioning of the input output space and rule base need to be provided by the expert therefore only the fine tuning of the system parameters will be done by the learning process from the data however in the latter a self reliant mechanism is integrated into the learning algorithm that enables the model to identify the position and distribution of fuzzy labels in input output space and generate the required rule base in recent years different types of nfs models have been widely used in r r modelling from which adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis jang 1993 is perhaps the most commonly and its superiority to regression based and ann models is evident in literature nayak et al 2004 aqil et al 2007 firat and güngör 2008 dorum et al 2010 yaseen et al 2017 ahani et al 2018 badrzadeh et al 2018 dariane and azimi 2018 despite its successful application anfis suffers from its dependency on expert s knowledge where the number of labels in input output space and the corresponding rules need to be set by the user in development stage this limitation makes anfis structure inflexible as unnecessary and or inconsistent rules may exist without exclusion to move towards nfs with self reliant rule generation and flexible structure kasabov and song 2002 proposed dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system denfis which employs online learning in its rules development nfs learning is usually classified as either offline or online learning online learning allows models to dynamically reiterate parameters based on new training data that are presented to the model while offline learning or batch learning optimizes parameters based on a static dataset in such dynamic learning process model can evolve through flow of the data to date very few studies have employed denfis for r r application hong and white 2009 talei et al 2013 chang et al 2016 despite the successful application of denfis in r r modelling denfis suffers from an ever growing rule base due to its incremental learning algorithm in other words the rules can be only generated but not removed therefore in case of having outdated or inconsistent rules at the end of training those rules remain in the system and may affect the accuracy of the simulation in validation stage more recently ashrafi et al 2017 adopted the generic self evolving takagi seugeno kang gsetsk model for river flow forecasting the model was used to forecast flow in klippan 2 catchment in sweden and the lower mekong river china the model performance was then compared against a physical model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv and denfis gsetsk performed comparably well when compared with hbv and denfis models however gsetsk had the advantage of being a fully online model while not enquiry any priori knowledge for model initialization unlike denfis where knowledge of the data such as upper and lower bounds were necessary for data normalization gsetsk is also able to prune the rule base when it is necessary as it is evident in the provided literature review there are few studies on addressing self reliant rule base in r r modeling only in recent years some nfs models began incorporating the capabilities of dynamic and flexible structures one major issue in many of these nfs models such as denfis is the lack of a consistent rule base due to the incremental learning nature of many of these models they would continuously update and expand their rule base while the inconsistent and outdated rules remain dormant within the system this would not only saturate the rule base with redundant rules but also might result in a gradual deterioration in model performance as certain rules become obsolete talei et al 2013 without a rule pruning mechanism the model is unable to remove unnecessary inconsistent and outdated rules from the system therefore there is a need for nfs r r models that can have a consistent and flexible rule base in this study the self adaptive fuzzy inference network safin which is a self organising neural fuzzy system tung et al 2011 is adopted for r r modelling in three different catchment types and sizes where the results are compared against several benchmark models safin employs a new clustering technique known as categorical learning induced partitioning clip which allows the model to adapt to the new incoming tuple by consistently updating the model as compared to offline learning safin is also equipped with a rule pruning mechanism that can exclude inconsistent and obsolete rules the structure of safin and its learning process is explained in section 2 the methodology which includes study sites models used and model development is provided in section 3 finally the results of this study are presented and discussed in section 4 which will be followed by research conclusion in section 5 2 self adaptive fuzzy inference network safin safin is a self organizing neural fuzzy system with online or local learning capability safin is formulated to overcome the issues present in other common neuro fuzzy models for example anfis lacks the capabilities of an online learning mechanism which requires retraining of the entire dataset when introduced with new data whereas denfis lacks the ability to adapt to the concept of drifts where existing rules remained within the model over time become obsolete as newer data exhibit gradual changes within their properties safin introduces a new fuzzy clustering technique and a self automated rule generation mechanism with rule pruning capabilities these mechanisms provide safin with capabilities of online learning and adaptability in detecting and conforming to concept of drifts 2 1 safin architecture the safin model is constructed as a five layer multilayer perceptron mlp network as shown in fig 1 the notations used in fig 1 are defined in table 1 the input vector x is defined as whilethedesiredoutputvector while the desired output vector d and computed output vector y are denoted as and and y y 1 y q y q respectively the rule base of safin includes if then mamdani fuzzy rules which are encoded within layer 3 of safin architecture the kth rule of rule node rk is given in eq 1 1 if x 1 i s a j 1 k and x p is a jp k then y 1 is c l 1 k and y q is c lq k where a jp k and c lq k are the jth antecedent node and lth consequent node associated with the pth input and qth output connected to kth rule node rk respectively safin uses gaussian membership function μ as fuzzy labels embedded within the antecedent and consequent nodes which is given in eq 2 2 μ c σ x exp x c 2 σ 2 where c and σ are the center and width of the gaussian function respectively safin employs the neural network based gradient descent approach to fine tune the parameters of the membership functions 2 2 reasoning process in safin the reasoning process of safin includes the propagation of input vector x from layer 1 to layer 5 see fig 1 layers 2 to 4 are responsible for performing inferences whereas layer 5 computes the output vector y the activation function for layer m is denoted as a m where m can be 1 2 or 5 considering o as the output of any arbitrary node in any layer the internal processes of the different layers of safin are as following 2 2 1 layer 1 this layer is responsible to directly pass on the input vector to layer 2 this operation in input node i p is given by 3 o p a 1 x p x p 2 2 2 layer 2 layer 2 functions as an antecedent matching between the input training tuple against the antecedent fuzzy labels which are defined as gaussian functions the degree of similarity between x p and the membership function within jth antecedent fuzzy cluster ajp is computed as 4 o jp a 2 o p μ jp c jp σ jp x p where μ jp c jp σ jp x describes the gaussian membership function in node ajp 2 2 3 layer 3 this layer contains the rule sets that are defined from the training data for each rule node rk the overall degree of similarity between the input vector and the antecedent of the kth fuzzy rule is calculated hence the firing rate of rk is defined as 5 o k a 3 o j 1 k o jp k min p 1 p o jp k 2 2 4 layer 4 the fuzzy labels clq define the consequent segments of the fuzzy rules in the system layer 4 performs as consequent derivation for the fuzzy rules which output the cumulative neural computation for clq as follows 6 o lq a 4 o 1 l q o k lq l q max k 1 k lq o k l q where klq is the total number of fuzzy rules in safin that shares the same consequent node clq and o k lq is the output of the kth fuzzy rule that shares clq 2 2 5 layer 5 this layer performs defuzzification which obtains a crisp output value using the center of average coa method the neural operation of oq is described as 7 y q o q a 5 o 1 q o lq lq l q l q o lq c lq σ lq lq l q l q o lq σ lq where clq and σ l q are the center and width of the gaussian function embedded in node clq respectively 2 3 safin learning mechanism common issues in neuro fuzzy systems consist of an inconsistent rule base need for prior knowledge and the stability plasticity tradeoff tung et al 2011 safin attempts to resolve these issues through the implementation of two main components in its learning mechanism which are 1 self organizing clustering and 2 self automated rule generation in conventional neuro fuzzy systems the fuzzy clusters and fuzzy rule base require initialization through the knowledge of human experts however safin does not contain any fuzzy partitioning or fuzzy rules initially safin s learning mechanism allows new fuzzy labels and rules to be created from the incoming training tuple through the self organizing clustering technique the numbers positions and spreads of fuzzy labels are self determined from the training dataset whenever the knowledge from a training tuple appears to be novel compared to the existing clusters a new cluster will be created then further adjustments are made to the existing clusters to achieve coherence between old knowledge and new knowledge that is provided by the incoming training tuple this clustering technique introduced in safin is known as categorical learning induced partitioning clip clip is an approach developed to address the stability plasticity issues faced by other nfs models which mimics the behavioral category learning process of humans the safin model has two parameters involved within the fuzzy partitioning process through the clip algorithm as its process is depicted in fig 2 the parameter α is the minimum membership threshold of a fuzzy membership function while parameter β is the contrasting threshold which determines the necessity of creating a new cluster fig 2 1 a shows the first data point introduced to the model centered around c1 a cluster is then formed around c1 as depicted in fig 2 1 b with gaussian widths σ11 and σ12 to the left and right of the data point while the lower bound of the gaussian functions is set to the minimum threshold α the domain of the cluster is considered a b which is also the domain of the data obtained from priori knowledge the formation of the first cluster a1p in the input dimension p can be described by 8 c 1 p x p σ 1 p r min p x p 2 log α max p x p 2 log α where c1p and σ1p are the center and width of the fuzzy cluster respectively the parameter α should be defined in such way that the minimum membership value at any point in the domain becomes α r is the regulation function which ensures that the newly created membership function produces distinct fuzzy clusters as shown in fig 2 1 c r is defined as 9 r σ 1 σ 2 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 when a subsequent new data point is introduced as shown in fig 2 2 a a similarity measure between the input data and existing clusters is computed for a similarity measure which is lower than the contrasting threshold β the data point is considered novel and a new cluster is formed and centered around the novel data point c2 as shown in fig 2 2 b training tuples are considered novel when the similarity match function output does not meet the threshold parameter β therefore a new fuzzy cluster will be formulated the similarity match function is defined as 10 sm x p a jp μ jp c jp σ jp x p the new cluster is formed with widths σ21 and σ22 and lower bound α which is then regulated as shown in fig 2 2 c each time a new cluster is created the cluster must perform a regulation function to allow clear interpretation against other existing clusters moreover direct neighboring clusters require updating to ensure coherence between clusters these adjustments of new clusters with existing clusters address the stability plasticity of safin which allows old knowledge to coexist with the new information this process will be repeated for the upcoming data points safin also employs a self automated rule generation mechanism which formulates and updates the rule base accordingly over time initial fuzzy rules are formed through incoming training tuples while subsequent rules added into the system change the assigned weight of each rule the weight of fuzzy rules is important in depicting each rules significance in the system while allowing the system to remove any low impact or conflicting rules this method gives safin the capability of rule pruning where inconsistent and obsolete rules are removed over a period of time fig 3 shows the flowchart of the self automated rule generation mechanism upon achieving fuzzy partitioning of data with clip the rule base is ready to be formulated rule generation runs in two stages rule creation and rule consistency check for each incoming training tuple x d the best matched fuzzy cluster for the pth input dimension and qth output dimension are denoted as ajp and clq respectively a fuzzy rule r is then created where a jp p 1 p and c lq q 1 q are the antecedent and consequent segments of this rule a novelty check is performed on r where this rule can be added to the rule base if it is novel safin also employs a weight for each rule which shows its significance for application a rule with higher weight has more potential of being applied later in modeling the application environment consistency checks are performed upon rule base formation to identify the inconsistent rules which can be rules with similar precedent conditions but with varying outcomes when inconsistencies are found the rule with the lowest weightage i e the obsolete rule is removed from the rule base 3 methodology 3 1 study sites and data in this study data from 3 catchments with varying sizes and environments are used catchment 1 is the heshui catchment shown in fig 4 it has an area of 2275 km2 and is a tributary of the ganjian river which originates from the wugong mountains the heshui watershed has a population of approximately 1 1 million people mostly relying on agriculture and farming for living the daily rainfall and discharge data recorded from 1 january 1990 to 21 january 2006 at beimen station are used in this study this catchment is chosen since it is a good representative of a rural catchment with limited rainfall stations catchment 2 is the klippan 2 see fig 5 which is a sub catchment of the rönne basin sweden with an area of 241 33 km2 the mean daily rainfall runoff and temperature time series from 1961 to 2003 are used in this study using the temperature time series of this catchment is for considering the effects of snow melt process this catchment is chosen as a good representative of a rural catchment with the cold climate catchment 3 is the clarence river catchment as shown in fig 6 the catchment area is 22 400 km2 and it is located in new south wales australia a large proportion of the catchment is protected against developments where the land use consists of 20 national park and 30 state forest with the remaining parts which are either undeveloped or accommodate some urban developments runoff data at the catchment outlet and rainfall data from 17 rainfall stations were available however only 11 out of 17 rainfall stations are considered in this study due to the missing data in some stations the hourly rainfall and runoff time series from 1 january 2007 to 31 march 2013 are used in this study this catchment is chosen as the representative of the catchments with multiple rainfall stations 3 2 models used to compare the performance of the developed safin models in each catchment with benchmark models the available physical models in these catchments are adopted from previous studies therefore the physical models are different in study catchments however all the selected physical models are based on the same hydrological concepts and practically are doing the same job 3 2 1 university of regina hydrologic model urhm urhm qin et al 2010 is a distributed hydrologic model designed to simulate the physical processes of large watersheds the model initially divides the watershed into smaller sub watersheds which are clustered based on several key aspects such as meteorological hydrological and physiographic factors for each cluster further analysis can be conducted on one representative sub watershed a series of sub models are calibrated and verified to simulate the r r process for each cluster during calibration a non linear optimization approach and performance verification is examined based on error analysis the identified sub models can then be integrated to form the distributed model urhm mainly relies on two assumptions 1 model parameters are spatially heterogeneous over the watershed 2 the rainfall runoff relationships are homogeneous the inputs necessary for calibration of urhm include sub watershed area latitude and altitude of sub watershed mean elevation mean distance of each sub watershed from nearest stream layout of the sub watersheds daily precipitation daily mean air temperature daily dew point temperature and daily global radiation this model is calibrated and validated for catchment 1 qin et al 2010 with the same training and testing datasets used in safin for comparison purposes 3 2 2 hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv the hbv model is a semi distributed conceptual rainfall runoff model formulated by bergstrom and forsman 1973 and further developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi bergstrom 1976 the hbv water balance concept can be denoted as 11 q p e δ s s m u z l z where p e and q are precipitation evaporation and runoff in mm respectively s sm uz and lz are water storage compartments for snow solid moisture upper zone of ground water and the lower zone of ground water in mm respectively δ denotes the change in a certain time step p and the estimated e are the inputs used within the model the formulation of hbv can be understood as a physical representation of the runoff dynamics without explicit links to the physical characteristics of the catchment hbv can be divided into three routines 1 a snow routine which represents snow accumulation storage and snow melt 2 a soil routine which represents soil moisture and partitioning to subsurface flow direct runoff actual evapotranspiration evaporation and infiltration 3 response routing which represents the rate of runoff from the ground water compartments the model is typically conducted on daily rainfall and temperature data with daily or monthly estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet pet estimates derived by the penman monteith equation allows the calculation of the actual evapotranspiration through the use of net radiation wind speed air temperature vapor pressure deficit and estimated canopy roughness and resistance when soil moisture is above a certain fraction of the soil moisture storage the actual evapotranspiration is assumed to be identical to the pet during conditions where the soil moisture storage is low a linear function of the soil moisture is assumed and the actual evapotranspiration rate can be calculated interception evaporation is calculated through a similar approach using the penman monteith equation and a simple precipitation interception model for estimating the potential interception evaporation rate the results of a previously developed hbv model on catchment 2 talei et al 2013 are adopted for comparison with safin results in catchment 2 it is worth mentioning that the calibration and validation datasets used for hbv are same as training and testing datasets used for safin 3 2 3 génie rural gr4j the gr4j model modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier is a conceptual rainfall runoff model for daily streamflow estimation developed in france perrin et al 2003 there are two state variables in the model including soil water storage s and routing water storage r and four parameters including the capacity of s x1 the maximum groundwater exchange rate x2 the reference capacity of r x3 and the length parameter of the unit hydrographs x4 the precipitation is initially intercepted by the vegetation canopy and then split into surface runoff and penetration into a soil water storage the total runoff including the underground flow and the surface runoff is then empirically split into a fast and a slow routing processes ten percent of the total runoff is propagated through the fast routing with a single unit hydrography uh2 while the other ninety percent of the runoff is propagated through the slow routing with a combination of another unit hydrograph uh1 and a routing storage a gr4j model was calibrated using a hybrid objective function unweighted mean of two nash sutcliffe coefficient indexes on catchment 3 li et al 2018 where its results are compared with safin the calibration and validation datasets used in gr4j were similar to those used for safin as shown in table 2 3 3 safin model development safin is developed for continuous r r modeling in the 3 study catchments the performance of safin model in each catchment was then compared with the denfis model and one conceptual or physically based model as benchmark each catchment s dataset is split into training and validation sub sets as presented in table 2 while the statistical data on training and validation datasets for each catchment are provided in table 3 as it can be seen in table 3 the validation datasets are chosen in a way that they contain peak discharges bigger than the ones available in training dataset this is to challenge the extrapolation capability of the proposed model one main difficulty in the application of data driven models is the choice of inputs input selection analysis is necessary for identifying proper rainfall and or runoff antecedents to train the model correlation analysis is one of the most commonly used methods to identify proper inputs in data driven models including ann and nfs maier and dandy 1997 coulibaly et al 2000 brion et al 2001 asadnia et al 2014 mekanik et al 2016 moreover mutual information analysis has been used for input selection in several similar studies and is found to be a good choice in identifying appropriate inputs elshorbagy et al 2010 he et al 2011 talei and chua 2012 proposed an input selection method based on combining correlation coefficient cc and mutual information mi analyses in this method the selected input data should satisfy the criteria of being highly correlated with output while possessing low mutual information with other inputs the correlation coefficient is expressed by 12 c c x y σ xy σ x σ y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where σxy is the covariance between variables x and y σ x and σ y are standard deviations of x and y respectively x and y are average values of x and y respectively and n is the number of data points in addition mutual information is expressed by da costa couto 2009 13 m i x y 1 2 log σ x 2 σ y 2 σ xy where σ x 2 and σ y 2 are the variance of variables x and y respectively chang et al 2017 employed this input selection approach to develop an anfis rainfall runoff model in a tropical catchment with multiple rainfall stations to select the optimal combination between mi and cc talei and chua 2012 proposed a ranking coefficient as 14 r k i 1 n c i i 1 n j i 1 n i ij where c i is the normalized correlation coefficient between q t and an input e g rainfall lead time in kth input combination n is the number of inputs in this specific input combination and i ij is the normalized value for 1 mi calculated for the ith and jth input lead times in the kth input combination since mi is mutual information 1 mi represents independence for an input combination with n inputs the second term of eq 14 includes c n 2 n 2 n 2 number of mutual information terms for example in an input combination with 4 inputs 6 terms of mutual information are expected the ideal normalized value of c i for the maximum correlation and 1 mi for the lowest mutual information would be 1 therefore r can be 3 6 10 for input combinations with 2 3 4 rainfall inputs respectively in this study the top five input combinations with 2 3 4 inputs are used to develop the safin model this input selection method is conducted for all three catchments using rainfall and runoff antecedents except for catchment 2 where antecedents of temperature time series are also considered the model output for all catchments was runoff at the present time q t 4 results and discussion the adopted input selection method based on correlation and mutual information analyses was used to identify the appropriate inputs for both safin and denfis models through various tests both the safin and denfis were also found to be sensitive to the use of too many inputs therefore it was necessary to limit the number of inputs when conducting the model training this was more significant in catchment 3 where so many rainfall antecedents from 11 rainfall stations were involved however in catchment 3 the input selection method selected rainfall inputs from few rainfall stations only this is an advantage as less rainfall stations are selected through a merit based mechanism that removes unnecessary inputs the selected inputs for developing safin and denfis models in each study catchment are presented in table 4 4 1 sensitivity analysis on the safin model parameters as described in section 2 3 the safin model utilizes 2 user defined parameters α and β which directly influence the fuzzy clustering process tung et al 2011 concluded that a decreasing α and an increasing β would generally produce better results due to a greater number of fuzzy clusters being generated at the expense of increased computational complexity however the pre specification of α and β remains arbitrary and requires the aid of certain heuristic or optimization approaches a sensitivity analysis is first introduced to study the effect of the parameters on the hydrologic modeling performance the analysis is done through running multiple safin models within training data set of each individual catchment while systematically iterating the α and β parameters for each model this analysis provides a visualization on the model performance in accordance with the parameters fig 7 shows the 2d surface plots which represent the nash sutcliffe coefficient ce as well as the logarithm of the number of rules for all 3 catchments used in this study the plots are obtained by modeling safin through iterating α between 0 25 0 7 and β between 0 25 0 85 as recommended by tung et al 2011 the ce values for the 3 study catchments show that a reducing parameter α with an increasing parameter β produces superior results in general conversely the α and β parameters exhibit a correlation with the number of rules produced at the end of training where lower α and higher β values result in an exponentially increasing number of rules based on the ce indices the model performance is generally better at the parameter values which result in a very high rule number count this might be attributed to the sufficient high number of rules required to capture the non linearity properties of the system or could possibly be the model memorization of certain aspects of the data however the stability plasticity dilemma can be observed where α approaches its lower limit and β approaches its upper limit in such a case the model performance can experience a drastic drop just near the peak ce values this could be attributed to the fact that the model is considered as too stable in such a situation the model lacks plasticity and attempts to memorize rather than learn moreover it was also concluded that the model performance deteriorates when it is trained using the similar values of both parameters i e α β essentially performance reduces when the minimum membership threshold is assigned to similar contrasting threshold values this is due to fuzzy clusters being formed with a minimum threshold α where the clusters cover a larger spread during the cluster creation since the contrasting threshold matches the minimum threshold new clusters would only form where the novel points are excessively far from any other fuzzy clusters hence this shows that the model over generalizes and exhibits a highly plastic model behavior in general selection of the α and β parameters for optimal model performance can be generalized under the conditions β α and α 0 6 to further fine tune the model parameter meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga would provide an optimized solution by using model performance metrics such as the ce as the fitness function it wouldn t take ga many generations to obtain a global minimum maximum for parameter optimization as convergence is generally in the direction of parameters resulting in a higher rule number the genetic algorithm ga was implemented into the safin model as the optimization tool for the parameters the framework for the genetic algorithm was set to a population size of 40 with a function tolerance of 1e 8 the parameters α and β were set to the constraints of a lower bound of 0 2 and an upper bound of 0 8 since a larger interval between α and β would increase computational complexity those boundaries were chosen to maintain a maximum interval of 0 6 which gave a reasonable maximum time of around 30 s per simulation the optimized parameters for safin models used in catchments 1 2 and 3 are shown in table 5 talei et al 2013 found that using 3 membership functions with a dthr parameter value of 0 1 for the cluster radius are appropriate initial parameters for r r modeling with denfis hence the same parameters were adopted in this study as initial values 4 2 safin model performance in this section the overall r r safin model performance for the three catchments with various climate and size are presented safin was calibrated and tested for catchments 1 2 and 3 and its simulated hydrographs were compared against the ones obtained by denfis and the physically based and conceptual models urhm hbv and gr4j for each respective catchment a summary of the performance metrics of ce r2 and mae is tabulated in table 6 as can be seen safin generally outperforms the urhm hbv and gr4j models in catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively for all evaluation metrics comparison between safin and denfis showed that safin performance is comparable with denfis in catchments 1 and 2 however safin produced better results for catchment 3 when compared against denfis model for further comparison the scatterplots of observed discharge against simulated discharge obtained by safin and denfis models for catchments 1 2 and 3 are provided in fig 8 for catchment 1 see fig 8a and b both safin and denfis models performed well in simulating both low flows and medium flows while both models underestimated the high flows in catchment 2 see fig 8c and d however both safni and denfis were capable of estimating low medium and high flows quite well whereas for catchment 3 fig 8e and f showed that safin outperforms denfis in estimating low and medium flows while both models suffer from underestimating the peak flows this could be attributed to the fact that the available data for catchment 3 was limited and the training dataset didn t contain sufficient peaks to train the model sufficiently it is worth mentioning that sizable portion of the observed discharge is very low in value near 0 m3 s therefore estimation of peak discharges would show a higher impact on the model performance indices such as ce this is evident in table 6 as the ce value resulted by safin is significantly higher than the one obtained by denfis to further assess the ability of the models in peak estimation the relative peak error rpe metric was used to select the extreme discharge values the discharge thresholds of 100 m3 s 15 m3 s and 2000 m3 s were selected for catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively the selected thresholds for catchments 1 2 and 3 encapsulate 28 18 and 18 peaks respectively to be used for evaluating the peak estimation capacity of the models the rpe values for safin denfis and the physically based models obtained in the 3 study catchments are provided in fig 9 by boxplots for catchments 1 and 2 safin performs better in peak estimation when compared against the physically based models however denfis outperformed safin in simulating peak flows and remained more accurate and consistent the highest observed peak flow in testing data of catchment 1 was on day 1629 where the rpe resulting from safin and denfis were 0 283 and 0 248 respectively for catchment 2 the highest discharge in the testing dataset was on day 347 where the rpe of 0 200 and 0 119 were obtained for safin and denfis respectively it is worth mentioning that the highest peak discharge of the entire dataset for both catchments 1 and 2 is included within the testing dataset in order to challenge the extrapolation capabilities of the models this maybe an indication of why many of the simulated peak discharges were under estimated when observing catchment 3 safin outperforms both denfis and gr4j in peak estimation and remains consistent in simulating peak flow whereas denfis experienced a significant drop in performance when observing the highest discharge in the testing dataset the event was on day 322 where the rpe values of 0 275 and 0 220 were obtained by safin and denfis respectively 4 3 discussion the stability plasticity is an important feature in designing any artificial neural based models achieving stability and plasticity allows models to continuously learn the patterns without being trapped in memorization to address this issue safin has two mechanisms in its training process 1 a flexible fuzzy partitioning process considering parameters α and β and 2 pruning process of inconsistent rules as discussed in section 2 3 parameters α and β directly impact on safin s ability to capture and retain information these two parameters directly influence the potential size growth of the rule base moreover safin inherits a rule pruning mechanism which enables forgetting of less significant rules which are conflicted to better understand these two processes in safin the rule generation and pruning processes are assessed throughout the training progression for this the number of rules before and after pruning are recorded in 20 snapshots within the training dataset of each catchment in other words the training datasets for each catchment were assumed to be consisted of 20 equal chunks of data where the safin models train through by this experiment it is possible to track the rule progression throughout the training data set from its first chunk to the last one 20th the number of rules in safin model before and after pruning are presented in fig 10 a c for catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively it is important to first note the number of rules generated at the end of training in safin where catchments 1 and 2 produced significantly larger number of rules as compared to catchment 3 the number of rules has no correlation with training data size number of training inputs or catchment size the main reason is data diversity its distribution and the α and β parameters resulted from the genetic algorithm ga for the model the parameters were optimized through the minimization of the error function in which a stability plasticity balance was achieved to maximize modelling performance the large number of rules might signify a larger degree of diversity in input output space which could exist within the data of the first 2 catchments conversely the lesser number of rules in catchment 3 may indicate that the data contains relatively lesser diversity or complexity therefore relatively lesser number of rules would be sufficient to capture the association between input and output this is evident by referring to table 3 where a substantial portion of the training dataset in catchment 3 belongs to low flows and extreme events are practically outliers it was evident as 99 percentile of flow data equal to 1278 5 m3 s is still much smaller than the maximum observed flow equal to 11 015 6 m3 s therefore the data contain lot of low flows which may not need new rules to capture them in observing the rules present before and after pruning 20 3 and 36 3 of rules were pruned by the end of training process in catchments 1 and 2 respectively whereas catchment 3 showed only an 8 removal of rules which might be attributed to the lower number but highly significant rules within the rule base on the other hand denfis with its incremental rule generating mechanism can only add new rules whenever it is necessary while no pruning happens in its rule base for example denfis eventually produced 19 rules on training data set of catchment 3 compared to 23 in safin where none of them are subjected to any pruning it is worth mentioning that safin and denfis exhibit very different approaches in learning safin generally has a wider flexibility in generating rules while denfis is more conservative in rule generation due to its pre set clustering threshold although having more rules in a nfs model generally is not an indication of superiority it could mean a better coverage of the input output space this is perhaps the advantage of the safin model with flexible rule base over denfis with a constrained rule base overall the results of this limited study show the good potential of safin as a capable and robust tool for r r modeling under various catchment conditions safin produced comparable if not superior results to denfis and physical models its self reliant learning and rule generation mechanism equipped with pruning can make safin a competent tool for r r modelling in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies 5 conclusion the findings of this study can be concluded as following i safin rainfall runoff model calibrated in three different catchments types and sizes and its results were compared against physical models and denfis safin was able to produce comparable if not superior results in all three catchments for both low and high flows ii in peak estimation safin outperforms physical models in all three catchments however its overall performance in peak estimation was lower when compared with denfis except for catchment 3 where safin was better than denfis iii safin rule pruning mechanism removed 20 3 36 3 and 8 of the rules in catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively however denfis learning process was incremental with no pruning this allowed safin to have a more flexible and efficient structure compared to denfis where number of rules can only grow and would maintain outdated rules in its rule base this makes safin a reliable modelling tool in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies or the input output relationship may change throughout time acknowledgment financial support from monash university malaysia is gratefully acknowledged for the

7121,conventional neuro fuzzy systems used for rainfall runoff r r modelling are generally dependent on expert knowledge in these models not only the structure is designed by the expert user but also all the required knowledge for fuzzy partitioning of the input output space and rule base need to be provided by the expert to move towards nfs with a more flexible rule base and structure efforts are made to integrate the self reliant mechanisms into the learning algorithm that enable the model to identify the position and distribution of fuzzy labels in input output space and generate the required rule base in this study the self adaptive fuzzy inference network safin is used for the r r application safin employs a new clustering technique known as categorical learning induced partitioning clip which allows the model to adapt to the new incoming tuple by consistently updating the model safin is also equipped with a rule pruning mechanism that can exclude inconsistent and obsolete rules in this study safin r r models are developed in three different catchment types and sizes where the results are compared against a benchmark nfs model and few physical models including urhm hbv gr4j results shows that safin is a capable and robust tool for r r modeling under varying catchment conditions moreover safin produced comparable if not superior results to the benchmark models it was concluded that ssfin with its self reliant learning and rule generation mechanism equipped with rule pruning can make it a competent tool for r r modelling in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies keywords rainfall runoff modelling safin denfis self reliant learning 1 introduction rainfall runoff r r modeling is an important field of study in hydrology which aims to understand and capture the rainfall runoff process for resolving many hydrological problems such as flood forecasting drainage infrastructure design and urban planning beside the physically based models which require the knowledge of the system mechanism and its parameters there are system theoretic models which do not concern much of the physical processes of the problem but instead focus on correlation and mapping between the rainfall and runoff data minns and hall 1996 in the 1990 s and early 2000 s system theoretic models were used extensively in r r modeling examples of such models are regression models artificial neural networks ann and neuro fuzzy systems nfs hsu et al 1995 sajikumar and thandaveswara 1999 xiong et al 2001 rajurkar et al 2002 these models have been capable of capturing rainfall runoff process with different degree of non linearity and complexity without requiring prior knowledge of the physical processes of the system although widely used many of these models provide little information about the physics of the problem and normally are considered as black box models however in recent years nfs began to gain widespread adoption through their semantic based fuzzy neural architecture quek and singh 2005 nfs combine the human inspired reasoning style of fuzzy systems with the learning structure of neural networks an advantage of nfs in contrast to ann is a significant reduction in training time due to the decrease in the dimensions since parameters related to the problem domain are initialized maguire et al 1998 based on the method chosen for determining the output nfs can be classified into two types the linguistic or mamdani type mamdani and assilian 1975 and the precise or takagi sugeno kang tsk type takagi and sugeno 1985 linguistic nfs are models where both antecedents and consequents are defined by fuzzy sets whereas precise nfs are models where only the antecedent is defined by a fuzzy set while the consequent can be represented by crisp values on the other hand nfs can be also categorized based on their design method in this classification nfs are designed either by expert knowledge or directly from data tung et al 2011 in the former not only the structure of the model is designed by the expert user but also all the required knowledge for fuzzy partitioning of the input output space and rule base need to be provided by the expert therefore only the fine tuning of the system parameters will be done by the learning process from the data however in the latter a self reliant mechanism is integrated into the learning algorithm that enables the model to identify the position and distribution of fuzzy labels in input output space and generate the required rule base in recent years different types of nfs models have been widely used in r r modelling from which adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis jang 1993 is perhaps the most commonly and its superiority to regression based and ann models is evident in literature nayak et al 2004 aqil et al 2007 firat and güngör 2008 dorum et al 2010 yaseen et al 2017 ahani et al 2018 badrzadeh et al 2018 dariane and azimi 2018 despite its successful application anfis suffers from its dependency on expert s knowledge where the number of labels in input output space and the corresponding rules need to be set by the user in development stage this limitation makes anfis structure inflexible as unnecessary and or inconsistent rules may exist without exclusion to move towards nfs with self reliant rule generation and flexible structure kasabov and song 2002 proposed dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system denfis which employs online learning in its rules development nfs learning is usually classified as either offline or online learning online learning allows models to dynamically reiterate parameters based on new training data that are presented to the model while offline learning or batch learning optimizes parameters based on a static dataset in such dynamic learning process model can evolve through flow of the data to date very few studies have employed denfis for r r application hong and white 2009 talei et al 2013 chang et al 2016 despite the successful application of denfis in r r modelling denfis suffers from an ever growing rule base due to its incremental learning algorithm in other words the rules can be only generated but not removed therefore in case of having outdated or inconsistent rules at the end of training those rules remain in the system and may affect the accuracy of the simulation in validation stage more recently ashrafi et al 2017 adopted the generic self evolving takagi seugeno kang gsetsk model for river flow forecasting the model was used to forecast flow in klippan 2 catchment in sweden and the lower mekong river china the model performance was then compared against a physical model hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv and denfis gsetsk performed comparably well when compared with hbv and denfis models however gsetsk had the advantage of being a fully online model while not enquiry any priori knowledge for model initialization unlike denfis where knowledge of the data such as upper and lower bounds were necessary for data normalization gsetsk is also able to prune the rule base when it is necessary as it is evident in the provided literature review there are few studies on addressing self reliant rule base in r r modeling only in recent years some nfs models began incorporating the capabilities of dynamic and flexible structures one major issue in many of these nfs models such as denfis is the lack of a consistent rule base due to the incremental learning nature of many of these models they would continuously update and expand their rule base while the inconsistent and outdated rules remain dormant within the system this would not only saturate the rule base with redundant rules but also might result in a gradual deterioration in model performance as certain rules become obsolete talei et al 2013 without a rule pruning mechanism the model is unable to remove unnecessary inconsistent and outdated rules from the system therefore there is a need for nfs r r models that can have a consistent and flexible rule base in this study the self adaptive fuzzy inference network safin which is a self organising neural fuzzy system tung et al 2011 is adopted for r r modelling in three different catchment types and sizes where the results are compared against several benchmark models safin employs a new clustering technique known as categorical learning induced partitioning clip which allows the model to adapt to the new incoming tuple by consistently updating the model as compared to offline learning safin is also equipped with a rule pruning mechanism that can exclude inconsistent and obsolete rules the structure of safin and its learning process is explained in section 2 the methodology which includes study sites models used and model development is provided in section 3 finally the results of this study are presented and discussed in section 4 which will be followed by research conclusion in section 5 2 self adaptive fuzzy inference network safin safin is a self organizing neural fuzzy system with online or local learning capability safin is formulated to overcome the issues present in other common neuro fuzzy models for example anfis lacks the capabilities of an online learning mechanism which requires retraining of the entire dataset when introduced with new data whereas denfis lacks the ability to adapt to the concept of drifts where existing rules remained within the model over time become obsolete as newer data exhibit gradual changes within their properties safin introduces a new fuzzy clustering technique and a self automated rule generation mechanism with rule pruning capabilities these mechanisms provide safin with capabilities of online learning and adaptability in detecting and conforming to concept of drifts 2 1 safin architecture the safin model is constructed as a five layer multilayer perceptron mlp network as shown in fig 1 the notations used in fig 1 are defined in table 1 the input vector x is defined as whilethedesiredoutputvector while the desired output vector d and computed output vector y are denoted as and and y y 1 y q y q respectively the rule base of safin includes if then mamdani fuzzy rules which are encoded within layer 3 of safin architecture the kth rule of rule node rk is given in eq 1 1 if x 1 i s a j 1 k and x p is a jp k then y 1 is c l 1 k and y q is c lq k where a jp k and c lq k are the jth antecedent node and lth consequent node associated with the pth input and qth output connected to kth rule node rk respectively safin uses gaussian membership function μ as fuzzy labels embedded within the antecedent and consequent nodes which is given in eq 2 2 μ c σ x exp x c 2 σ 2 where c and σ are the center and width of the gaussian function respectively safin employs the neural network based gradient descent approach to fine tune the parameters of the membership functions 2 2 reasoning process in safin the reasoning process of safin includes the propagation of input vector x from layer 1 to layer 5 see fig 1 layers 2 to 4 are responsible for performing inferences whereas layer 5 computes the output vector y the activation function for layer m is denoted as a m where m can be 1 2 or 5 considering o as the output of any arbitrary node in any layer the internal processes of the different layers of safin are as following 2 2 1 layer 1 this layer is responsible to directly pass on the input vector to layer 2 this operation in input node i p is given by 3 o p a 1 x p x p 2 2 2 layer 2 layer 2 functions as an antecedent matching between the input training tuple against the antecedent fuzzy labels which are defined as gaussian functions the degree of similarity between x p and the membership function within jth antecedent fuzzy cluster ajp is computed as 4 o jp a 2 o p μ jp c jp σ jp x p where μ jp c jp σ jp x describes the gaussian membership function in node ajp 2 2 3 layer 3 this layer contains the rule sets that are defined from the training data for each rule node rk the overall degree of similarity between the input vector and the antecedent of the kth fuzzy rule is calculated hence the firing rate of rk is defined as 5 o k a 3 o j 1 k o jp k min p 1 p o jp k 2 2 4 layer 4 the fuzzy labels clq define the consequent segments of the fuzzy rules in the system layer 4 performs as consequent derivation for the fuzzy rules which output the cumulative neural computation for clq as follows 6 o lq a 4 o 1 l q o k lq l q max k 1 k lq o k l q where klq is the total number of fuzzy rules in safin that shares the same consequent node clq and o k lq is the output of the kth fuzzy rule that shares clq 2 2 5 layer 5 this layer performs defuzzification which obtains a crisp output value using the center of average coa method the neural operation of oq is described as 7 y q o q a 5 o 1 q o lq lq l q l q o lq c lq σ lq lq l q l q o lq σ lq where clq and σ l q are the center and width of the gaussian function embedded in node clq respectively 2 3 safin learning mechanism common issues in neuro fuzzy systems consist of an inconsistent rule base need for prior knowledge and the stability plasticity tradeoff tung et al 2011 safin attempts to resolve these issues through the implementation of two main components in its learning mechanism which are 1 self organizing clustering and 2 self automated rule generation in conventional neuro fuzzy systems the fuzzy clusters and fuzzy rule base require initialization through the knowledge of human experts however safin does not contain any fuzzy partitioning or fuzzy rules initially safin s learning mechanism allows new fuzzy labels and rules to be created from the incoming training tuple through the self organizing clustering technique the numbers positions and spreads of fuzzy labels are self determined from the training dataset whenever the knowledge from a training tuple appears to be novel compared to the existing clusters a new cluster will be created then further adjustments are made to the existing clusters to achieve coherence between old knowledge and new knowledge that is provided by the incoming training tuple this clustering technique introduced in safin is known as categorical learning induced partitioning clip clip is an approach developed to address the stability plasticity issues faced by other nfs models which mimics the behavioral category learning process of humans the safin model has two parameters involved within the fuzzy partitioning process through the clip algorithm as its process is depicted in fig 2 the parameter α is the minimum membership threshold of a fuzzy membership function while parameter β is the contrasting threshold which determines the necessity of creating a new cluster fig 2 1 a shows the first data point introduced to the model centered around c1 a cluster is then formed around c1 as depicted in fig 2 1 b with gaussian widths σ11 and σ12 to the left and right of the data point while the lower bound of the gaussian functions is set to the minimum threshold α the domain of the cluster is considered a b which is also the domain of the data obtained from priori knowledge the formation of the first cluster a1p in the input dimension p can be described by 8 c 1 p x p σ 1 p r min p x p 2 log α max p x p 2 log α where c1p and σ1p are the center and width of the fuzzy cluster respectively the parameter α should be defined in such way that the minimum membership value at any point in the domain becomes α r is the regulation function which ensures that the newly created membership function produces distinct fuzzy clusters as shown in fig 2 1 c r is defined as 9 r σ 1 σ 2 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 when a subsequent new data point is introduced as shown in fig 2 2 a a similarity measure between the input data and existing clusters is computed for a similarity measure which is lower than the contrasting threshold β the data point is considered novel and a new cluster is formed and centered around the novel data point c2 as shown in fig 2 2 b training tuples are considered novel when the similarity match function output does not meet the threshold parameter β therefore a new fuzzy cluster will be formulated the similarity match function is defined as 10 sm x p a jp μ jp c jp σ jp x p the new cluster is formed with widths σ21 and σ22 and lower bound α which is then regulated as shown in fig 2 2 c each time a new cluster is created the cluster must perform a regulation function to allow clear interpretation against other existing clusters moreover direct neighboring clusters require updating to ensure coherence between clusters these adjustments of new clusters with existing clusters address the stability plasticity of safin which allows old knowledge to coexist with the new information this process will be repeated for the upcoming data points safin also employs a self automated rule generation mechanism which formulates and updates the rule base accordingly over time initial fuzzy rules are formed through incoming training tuples while subsequent rules added into the system change the assigned weight of each rule the weight of fuzzy rules is important in depicting each rules significance in the system while allowing the system to remove any low impact or conflicting rules this method gives safin the capability of rule pruning where inconsistent and obsolete rules are removed over a period of time fig 3 shows the flowchart of the self automated rule generation mechanism upon achieving fuzzy partitioning of data with clip the rule base is ready to be formulated rule generation runs in two stages rule creation and rule consistency check for each incoming training tuple x d the best matched fuzzy cluster for the pth input dimension and qth output dimension are denoted as ajp and clq respectively a fuzzy rule r is then created where a jp p 1 p and c lq q 1 q are the antecedent and consequent segments of this rule a novelty check is performed on r where this rule can be added to the rule base if it is novel safin also employs a weight for each rule which shows its significance for application a rule with higher weight has more potential of being applied later in modeling the application environment consistency checks are performed upon rule base formation to identify the inconsistent rules which can be rules with similar precedent conditions but with varying outcomes when inconsistencies are found the rule with the lowest weightage i e the obsolete rule is removed from the rule base 3 methodology 3 1 study sites and data in this study data from 3 catchments with varying sizes and environments are used catchment 1 is the heshui catchment shown in fig 4 it has an area of 2275 km2 and is a tributary of the ganjian river which originates from the wugong mountains the heshui watershed has a population of approximately 1 1 million people mostly relying on agriculture and farming for living the daily rainfall and discharge data recorded from 1 january 1990 to 21 january 2006 at beimen station are used in this study this catchment is chosen since it is a good representative of a rural catchment with limited rainfall stations catchment 2 is the klippan 2 see fig 5 which is a sub catchment of the rönne basin sweden with an area of 241 33 km2 the mean daily rainfall runoff and temperature time series from 1961 to 2003 are used in this study using the temperature time series of this catchment is for considering the effects of snow melt process this catchment is chosen as a good representative of a rural catchment with the cold climate catchment 3 is the clarence river catchment as shown in fig 6 the catchment area is 22 400 km2 and it is located in new south wales australia a large proportion of the catchment is protected against developments where the land use consists of 20 national park and 30 state forest with the remaining parts which are either undeveloped or accommodate some urban developments runoff data at the catchment outlet and rainfall data from 17 rainfall stations were available however only 11 out of 17 rainfall stations are considered in this study due to the missing data in some stations the hourly rainfall and runoff time series from 1 january 2007 to 31 march 2013 are used in this study this catchment is chosen as the representative of the catchments with multiple rainfall stations 3 2 models used to compare the performance of the developed safin models in each catchment with benchmark models the available physical models in these catchments are adopted from previous studies therefore the physical models are different in study catchments however all the selected physical models are based on the same hydrological concepts and practically are doing the same job 3 2 1 university of regina hydrologic model urhm urhm qin et al 2010 is a distributed hydrologic model designed to simulate the physical processes of large watersheds the model initially divides the watershed into smaller sub watersheds which are clustered based on several key aspects such as meteorological hydrological and physiographic factors for each cluster further analysis can be conducted on one representative sub watershed a series of sub models are calibrated and verified to simulate the r r process for each cluster during calibration a non linear optimization approach and performance verification is examined based on error analysis the identified sub models can then be integrated to form the distributed model urhm mainly relies on two assumptions 1 model parameters are spatially heterogeneous over the watershed 2 the rainfall runoff relationships are homogeneous the inputs necessary for calibration of urhm include sub watershed area latitude and altitude of sub watershed mean elevation mean distance of each sub watershed from nearest stream layout of the sub watersheds daily precipitation daily mean air temperature daily dew point temperature and daily global radiation this model is calibrated and validated for catchment 1 qin et al 2010 with the same training and testing datasets used in safin for comparison purposes 3 2 2 hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv the hbv model is a semi distributed conceptual rainfall runoff model formulated by bergstrom and forsman 1973 and further developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi bergstrom 1976 the hbv water balance concept can be denoted as 11 q p e δ s s m u z l z where p e and q are precipitation evaporation and runoff in mm respectively s sm uz and lz are water storage compartments for snow solid moisture upper zone of ground water and the lower zone of ground water in mm respectively δ denotes the change in a certain time step p and the estimated e are the inputs used within the model the formulation of hbv can be understood as a physical representation of the runoff dynamics without explicit links to the physical characteristics of the catchment hbv can be divided into three routines 1 a snow routine which represents snow accumulation storage and snow melt 2 a soil routine which represents soil moisture and partitioning to subsurface flow direct runoff actual evapotranspiration evaporation and infiltration 3 response routing which represents the rate of runoff from the ground water compartments the model is typically conducted on daily rainfall and temperature data with daily or monthly estimates of potential evapotranspiration pet pet estimates derived by the penman monteith equation allows the calculation of the actual evapotranspiration through the use of net radiation wind speed air temperature vapor pressure deficit and estimated canopy roughness and resistance when soil moisture is above a certain fraction of the soil moisture storage the actual evapotranspiration is assumed to be identical to the pet during conditions where the soil moisture storage is low a linear function of the soil moisture is assumed and the actual evapotranspiration rate can be calculated interception evaporation is calculated through a similar approach using the penman monteith equation and a simple precipitation interception model for estimating the potential interception evaporation rate the results of a previously developed hbv model on catchment 2 talei et al 2013 are adopted for comparison with safin results in catchment 2 it is worth mentioning that the calibration and validation datasets used for hbv are same as training and testing datasets used for safin 3 2 3 génie rural gr4j the gr4j model modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier is a conceptual rainfall runoff model for daily streamflow estimation developed in france perrin et al 2003 there are two state variables in the model including soil water storage s and routing water storage r and four parameters including the capacity of s x1 the maximum groundwater exchange rate x2 the reference capacity of r x3 and the length parameter of the unit hydrographs x4 the precipitation is initially intercepted by the vegetation canopy and then split into surface runoff and penetration into a soil water storage the total runoff including the underground flow and the surface runoff is then empirically split into a fast and a slow routing processes ten percent of the total runoff is propagated through the fast routing with a single unit hydrography uh2 while the other ninety percent of the runoff is propagated through the slow routing with a combination of another unit hydrograph uh1 and a routing storage a gr4j model was calibrated using a hybrid objective function unweighted mean of two nash sutcliffe coefficient indexes on catchment 3 li et al 2018 where its results are compared with safin the calibration and validation datasets used in gr4j were similar to those used for safin as shown in table 2 3 3 safin model development safin is developed for continuous r r modeling in the 3 study catchments the performance of safin model in each catchment was then compared with the denfis model and one conceptual or physically based model as benchmark each catchment s dataset is split into training and validation sub sets as presented in table 2 while the statistical data on training and validation datasets for each catchment are provided in table 3 as it can be seen in table 3 the validation datasets are chosen in a way that they contain peak discharges bigger than the ones available in training dataset this is to challenge the extrapolation capability of the proposed model one main difficulty in the application of data driven models is the choice of inputs input selection analysis is necessary for identifying proper rainfall and or runoff antecedents to train the model correlation analysis is one of the most commonly used methods to identify proper inputs in data driven models including ann and nfs maier and dandy 1997 coulibaly et al 2000 brion et al 2001 asadnia et al 2014 mekanik et al 2016 moreover mutual information analysis has been used for input selection in several similar studies and is found to be a good choice in identifying appropriate inputs elshorbagy et al 2010 he et al 2011 talei and chua 2012 proposed an input selection method based on combining correlation coefficient cc and mutual information mi analyses in this method the selected input data should satisfy the criteria of being highly correlated with output while possessing low mutual information with other inputs the correlation coefficient is expressed by 12 c c x y σ xy σ x σ y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where σxy is the covariance between variables x and y σ x and σ y are standard deviations of x and y respectively x and y are average values of x and y respectively and n is the number of data points in addition mutual information is expressed by da costa couto 2009 13 m i x y 1 2 log σ x 2 σ y 2 σ xy where σ x 2 and σ y 2 are the variance of variables x and y respectively chang et al 2017 employed this input selection approach to develop an anfis rainfall runoff model in a tropical catchment with multiple rainfall stations to select the optimal combination between mi and cc talei and chua 2012 proposed a ranking coefficient as 14 r k i 1 n c i i 1 n j i 1 n i ij where c i is the normalized correlation coefficient between q t and an input e g rainfall lead time in kth input combination n is the number of inputs in this specific input combination and i ij is the normalized value for 1 mi calculated for the ith and jth input lead times in the kth input combination since mi is mutual information 1 mi represents independence for an input combination with n inputs the second term of eq 14 includes c n 2 n 2 n 2 number of mutual information terms for example in an input combination with 4 inputs 6 terms of mutual information are expected the ideal normalized value of c i for the maximum correlation and 1 mi for the lowest mutual information would be 1 therefore r can be 3 6 10 for input combinations with 2 3 4 rainfall inputs respectively in this study the top five input combinations with 2 3 4 inputs are used to develop the safin model this input selection method is conducted for all three catchments using rainfall and runoff antecedents except for catchment 2 where antecedents of temperature time series are also considered the model output for all catchments was runoff at the present time q t 4 results and discussion the adopted input selection method based on correlation and mutual information analyses was used to identify the appropriate inputs for both safin and denfis models through various tests both the safin and denfis were also found to be sensitive to the use of too many inputs therefore it was necessary to limit the number of inputs when conducting the model training this was more significant in catchment 3 where so many rainfall antecedents from 11 rainfall stations were involved however in catchment 3 the input selection method selected rainfall inputs from few rainfall stations only this is an advantage as less rainfall stations are selected through a merit based mechanism that removes unnecessary inputs the selected inputs for developing safin and denfis models in each study catchment are presented in table 4 4 1 sensitivity analysis on the safin model parameters as described in section 2 3 the safin model utilizes 2 user defined parameters α and β which directly influence the fuzzy clustering process tung et al 2011 concluded that a decreasing α and an increasing β would generally produce better results due to a greater number of fuzzy clusters being generated at the expense of increased computational complexity however the pre specification of α and β remains arbitrary and requires the aid of certain heuristic or optimization approaches a sensitivity analysis is first introduced to study the effect of the parameters on the hydrologic modeling performance the analysis is done through running multiple safin models within training data set of each individual catchment while systematically iterating the α and β parameters for each model this analysis provides a visualization on the model performance in accordance with the parameters fig 7 shows the 2d surface plots which represent the nash sutcliffe coefficient ce as well as the logarithm of the number of rules for all 3 catchments used in this study the plots are obtained by modeling safin through iterating α between 0 25 0 7 and β between 0 25 0 85 as recommended by tung et al 2011 the ce values for the 3 study catchments show that a reducing parameter α with an increasing parameter β produces superior results in general conversely the α and β parameters exhibit a correlation with the number of rules produced at the end of training where lower α and higher β values result in an exponentially increasing number of rules based on the ce indices the model performance is generally better at the parameter values which result in a very high rule number count this might be attributed to the sufficient high number of rules required to capture the non linearity properties of the system or could possibly be the model memorization of certain aspects of the data however the stability plasticity dilemma can be observed where α approaches its lower limit and β approaches its upper limit in such a case the model performance can experience a drastic drop just near the peak ce values this could be attributed to the fact that the model is considered as too stable in such a situation the model lacks plasticity and attempts to memorize rather than learn moreover it was also concluded that the model performance deteriorates when it is trained using the similar values of both parameters i e α β essentially performance reduces when the minimum membership threshold is assigned to similar contrasting threshold values this is due to fuzzy clusters being formed with a minimum threshold α where the clusters cover a larger spread during the cluster creation since the contrasting threshold matches the minimum threshold new clusters would only form where the novel points are excessively far from any other fuzzy clusters hence this shows that the model over generalizes and exhibits a highly plastic model behavior in general selection of the α and β parameters for optimal model performance can be generalized under the conditions β α and α 0 6 to further fine tune the model parameter meta heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga would provide an optimized solution by using model performance metrics such as the ce as the fitness function it wouldn t take ga many generations to obtain a global minimum maximum for parameter optimization as convergence is generally in the direction of parameters resulting in a higher rule number the genetic algorithm ga was implemented into the safin model as the optimization tool for the parameters the framework for the genetic algorithm was set to a population size of 40 with a function tolerance of 1e 8 the parameters α and β were set to the constraints of a lower bound of 0 2 and an upper bound of 0 8 since a larger interval between α and β would increase computational complexity those boundaries were chosen to maintain a maximum interval of 0 6 which gave a reasonable maximum time of around 30 s per simulation the optimized parameters for safin models used in catchments 1 2 and 3 are shown in table 5 talei et al 2013 found that using 3 membership functions with a dthr parameter value of 0 1 for the cluster radius are appropriate initial parameters for r r modeling with denfis hence the same parameters were adopted in this study as initial values 4 2 safin model performance in this section the overall r r safin model performance for the three catchments with various climate and size are presented safin was calibrated and tested for catchments 1 2 and 3 and its simulated hydrographs were compared against the ones obtained by denfis and the physically based and conceptual models urhm hbv and gr4j for each respective catchment a summary of the performance metrics of ce r2 and mae is tabulated in table 6 as can be seen safin generally outperforms the urhm hbv and gr4j models in catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively for all evaluation metrics comparison between safin and denfis showed that safin performance is comparable with denfis in catchments 1 and 2 however safin produced better results for catchment 3 when compared against denfis model for further comparison the scatterplots of observed discharge against simulated discharge obtained by safin and denfis models for catchments 1 2 and 3 are provided in fig 8 for catchment 1 see fig 8a and b both safin and denfis models performed well in simulating both low flows and medium flows while both models underestimated the high flows in catchment 2 see fig 8c and d however both safni and denfis were capable of estimating low medium and high flows quite well whereas for catchment 3 fig 8e and f showed that safin outperforms denfis in estimating low and medium flows while both models suffer from underestimating the peak flows this could be attributed to the fact that the available data for catchment 3 was limited and the training dataset didn t contain sufficient peaks to train the model sufficiently it is worth mentioning that sizable portion of the observed discharge is very low in value near 0 m3 s therefore estimation of peak discharges would show a higher impact on the model performance indices such as ce this is evident in table 6 as the ce value resulted by safin is significantly higher than the one obtained by denfis to further assess the ability of the models in peak estimation the relative peak error rpe metric was used to select the extreme discharge values the discharge thresholds of 100 m3 s 15 m3 s and 2000 m3 s were selected for catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively the selected thresholds for catchments 1 2 and 3 encapsulate 28 18 and 18 peaks respectively to be used for evaluating the peak estimation capacity of the models the rpe values for safin denfis and the physically based models obtained in the 3 study catchments are provided in fig 9 by boxplots for catchments 1 and 2 safin performs better in peak estimation when compared against the physically based models however denfis outperformed safin in simulating peak flows and remained more accurate and consistent the highest observed peak flow in testing data of catchment 1 was on day 1629 where the rpe resulting from safin and denfis were 0 283 and 0 248 respectively for catchment 2 the highest discharge in the testing dataset was on day 347 where the rpe of 0 200 and 0 119 were obtained for safin and denfis respectively it is worth mentioning that the highest peak discharge of the entire dataset for both catchments 1 and 2 is included within the testing dataset in order to challenge the extrapolation capabilities of the models this maybe an indication of why many of the simulated peak discharges were under estimated when observing catchment 3 safin outperforms both denfis and gr4j in peak estimation and remains consistent in simulating peak flow whereas denfis experienced a significant drop in performance when observing the highest discharge in the testing dataset the event was on day 322 where the rpe values of 0 275 and 0 220 were obtained by safin and denfis respectively 4 3 discussion the stability plasticity is an important feature in designing any artificial neural based models achieving stability and plasticity allows models to continuously learn the patterns without being trapped in memorization to address this issue safin has two mechanisms in its training process 1 a flexible fuzzy partitioning process considering parameters α and β and 2 pruning process of inconsistent rules as discussed in section 2 3 parameters α and β directly impact on safin s ability to capture and retain information these two parameters directly influence the potential size growth of the rule base moreover safin inherits a rule pruning mechanism which enables forgetting of less significant rules which are conflicted to better understand these two processes in safin the rule generation and pruning processes are assessed throughout the training progression for this the number of rules before and after pruning are recorded in 20 snapshots within the training dataset of each catchment in other words the training datasets for each catchment were assumed to be consisted of 20 equal chunks of data where the safin models train through by this experiment it is possible to track the rule progression throughout the training data set from its first chunk to the last one 20th the number of rules in safin model before and after pruning are presented in fig 10 a c for catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively it is important to first note the number of rules generated at the end of training in safin where catchments 1 and 2 produced significantly larger number of rules as compared to catchment 3 the number of rules has no correlation with training data size number of training inputs or catchment size the main reason is data diversity its distribution and the α and β parameters resulted from the genetic algorithm ga for the model the parameters were optimized through the minimization of the error function in which a stability plasticity balance was achieved to maximize modelling performance the large number of rules might signify a larger degree of diversity in input output space which could exist within the data of the first 2 catchments conversely the lesser number of rules in catchment 3 may indicate that the data contains relatively lesser diversity or complexity therefore relatively lesser number of rules would be sufficient to capture the association between input and output this is evident by referring to table 3 where a substantial portion of the training dataset in catchment 3 belongs to low flows and extreme events are practically outliers it was evident as 99 percentile of flow data equal to 1278 5 m3 s is still much smaller than the maximum observed flow equal to 11 015 6 m3 s therefore the data contain lot of low flows which may not need new rules to capture them in observing the rules present before and after pruning 20 3 and 36 3 of rules were pruned by the end of training process in catchments 1 and 2 respectively whereas catchment 3 showed only an 8 removal of rules which might be attributed to the lower number but highly significant rules within the rule base on the other hand denfis with its incremental rule generating mechanism can only add new rules whenever it is necessary while no pruning happens in its rule base for example denfis eventually produced 19 rules on training data set of catchment 3 compared to 23 in safin where none of them are subjected to any pruning it is worth mentioning that safin and denfis exhibit very different approaches in learning safin generally has a wider flexibility in generating rules while denfis is more conservative in rule generation due to its pre set clustering threshold although having more rules in a nfs model generally is not an indication of superiority it could mean a better coverage of the input output space this is perhaps the advantage of the safin model with flexible rule base over denfis with a constrained rule base overall the results of this limited study show the good potential of safin as a capable and robust tool for r r modeling under various catchment conditions safin produced comparable if not superior results to denfis and physical models its self reliant learning and rule generation mechanism equipped with pruning can make safin a competent tool for r r modelling in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies 5 conclusion the findings of this study can be concluded as following i safin rainfall runoff model calibrated in three different catchments types and sizes and its results were compared against physical models and denfis safin was able to produce comparable if not superior results in all three catchments for both low and high flows ii in peak estimation safin outperforms physical models in all three catchments however its overall performance in peak estimation was lower when compared with denfis except for catchment 3 where safin was better than denfis iii safin rule pruning mechanism removed 20 3 36 3 and 8 of the rules in catchments 1 2 and 3 respectively however denfis learning process was incremental with no pruning this allowed safin to have a more flexible and efficient structure compared to denfis where number of rules can only grow and would maintain outdated rules in its rule base this makes safin a reliable modelling tool in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies or the input output relationship may change throughout time acknowledgment financial support from monash university malaysia is gratefully acknowledged for the

7122,water is central to sustainable development making transboundary cooperation among riparians a core aspect of agenda 2030 and the sustainable development goals sdgs sdg 6 on water and sanitation includes an indicator sdg indicator 6 5 2 to assess cooperation over transboundary waters by measuring the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation the definitions developed by the methodology for calculating the indicator have the potential to significantly impact the resulting structure and type of cooperation that are assessed and that will develop indeed the composition of this indicator will both directly and indirectly influence water diplomacy international policy and water law in this research we analyze the methodology for assessing sdg indicator 6 5 2 examine how operational cooperative arrangements are defined and identify the strengths and limitations of the method for measuring transboundary water cooperation this is done by simulating the application of the methodology and calculating the indicator in three national case studies bangladesh honduras and uganda and in a global overview the unequal distribution regionally of operational cooperation is evident as well as the gap in coverage between transboundary surface waters and aquifers however the normative and binary nature of the indicator obscures the political complexity of establishing cooperative processes and has the potential to present a false depiction of the extent of cooperation that is occurring over shared waters in this article we also discuss bias that can be introduced with using surface area as a metric to assess cooperation that results in weighting larger basins and aquifers over smaller basins in the calculation of the indicator this paper presents a basis for further analysis of sdg indicator 6 5 2 and the possible adaptations of the indicator design to better assess transboundary water cooperation keywords measuring cooperation sustainable development goals shared waters transboundary river basin transboundary aquifer geographic information science gis 1 introduction water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation transboundary waters are surface waters and groundwaters that mark cross or are located on international political boundaries between two or more states unece 1992 globally 310 international transboundary river basins cover 47 1 of the world s land surface while there are at least 592 transboundary aquifers underlying about 20 of the world s land surface igrac unesco ihp 2015 mccracken and wolf forthcoming see fig 1 nearly half of the world s population lives within a transboundary river or lake basin or over a transboundary aquifer thus these waters are important for ensuring global national and individual water security tfdd 2016 due to global reliance on transboundary waters the implications for sustainable development and the political nature of shared waters encouraging transboundary cooperation and diplomacy over shared waters is an important but complex component of the international development agenda diplomacy is the process of interactions between states with the goal of preventing hostility islam and susskind 2013 it relies on the promotion creation and maintenance of cooperation cooperation is the coordination between states where they collaborate to achieve common interests with mutual benefits leb 2015 zartman 2008 therefore the role of water diplomacy in the context of international waters is to foster transboundary cooperation over shared waters between states managing water is complex as it requires addressing the unequal distribution of water resources in both space and time exacerbated by climate change and the increasing demands for domestic agricultural and industrial uses demands are further expanding with population growth economic development and changing lifestyles water quality and environmental needs further impact management and governance with all aspects combining to increase competition and risk of conflict over shared resources political borders add a layer of complexity and as states develop their internationally shared waters they experience this complexity which requires diplomacy and cooperation to avoid negative impacts to the nation or to the shared resource mitchell and zawahri 2015 transboundary cooperation presents opportunities for riparian states to identify shared interests and develop actions towards mutual benefits these benefits can be directly related to the resource but can also extend beyond it such as monetary or energy exchange sadoff and grey 2002 wolf 1998 shared interests and mutual benefits are readily apparent in cooperative arrangements such as treaties and negotiated agreements giordano et al 2013 treaties agreements river basin organizations or positive international relations are examples of institutional capacity which is an indicator of the potential for dispute or cooperation over shared waters wolf 2007 adequate institutional capacity in a shared water system has the ability to absorb rapid physical or institutional change which can lower the potential for conflict wolf et al 2003 diplomatic and cooperative efforts are needed to establish and maintain institutional capacity for example the signing of a treaty in a transboundary basin increases the potential for future water cooperation brochmann 2012 a basin or aquifer that is categorized as having cooperation does not exclude it from conflict or tension therefore cooperation and conflict do not necessarily occur in isolation from each other zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 the political will of riparian states determines if cooperation will occur wouters 2013 therefore water diplomacy is essential to increase trust and develop the political desire to establish and maintain cooperation cooperation between countries for the management of shared water resources is ubiquitously supported by scholars however various definitions of transboundary water cooperation coexist which translate into the absence of a single accepted means to measure it saruchera and lautze 2015 tarlock 2015 the conceptualization and measurement of transboundary water cooperation takes a wide range of forms de stefano et al 2010 2017 mirumachi 2007 strategic foresight group 2015 tarlock 2015 unep dhi 2016 these multiple understandings present difficulties in monitoring and encouraging cooperation because there is not a consistent and comparable measurement method the complexity surrounding transboundary cooperation contributes to the variability in defining and monitoring cooperation developing a globally applied method must simplify the complexity by selecting elements to represent the level of cooperation in addition to overcoming the political nature of determining which elements should be used as a proxy the signing of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the sdg framework present an opportunity to promote transboundary water cooperation through water diplomacy by providing a method of defining and measuring transboundary cooperation globally while also integrating the water goals with the rest of the 2030 agenda this method could also serve as a limited proxy for the effectiveness of water diplomacy it is expected that sdg indicator 6 5 2 for transboundary cooperation described in section 2 2 will influence the development and structure of cooperation over shared surface waters and groundwaters as countries enact elements of operational cooperation in order to achieve the indicator through 2030 therefore it is important to better understand the benefits limitations and implications of this global framework for transboundary water cooperation this paper analyzes the methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 examines how operational cooperative arrangements are defined and identifies the strengths and limitations of this method for measuring transboundary water cooperation 2 background 2 1 agenda 2030 from sdg 6 on water and sanitation to sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary cooperation in 2015 the un general assembly signed resolution a res 70 1 transforming our world the 2030 agenda for sustainable development which builds on i the conclusions of the rio 20 conference on sustainable development ii the results of two years of international consultations and engagement with civil society and iii the millennium development goals un 2015 the 17 sdgs and the 169 targets increase the scale ambition and interconnection of the international development agenda un 2015 during the development process members of the global community pushed to include a specific water

considered by the inter agency and expert group on sustainable development goals indicators iaeg sdgs at the 47th session of the statistical commission in march 2016 iaeg sdgs 2016 unesco ihp and the unece water convention secretariat were appointed as custodian agencies for the indicator and are responsible for compiling and verifying country reported data developing regional and global data aggregates and for submitting data reports to the un statistics division under the un water umbrella unesco ihp and the unece water convention secretariat coordinated a working group to develop the methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 as a part of the global expanded monitoring initiative gemi an inter agency mechanism to coordinate monitoring efforts and data collection and management for sdg targets 6 3 through 6 6 in april 2016 a draft step by step monitoring methodology for indicator 6 5 2 was published un water 2016b and the methodology was tested in five pilot countries jordan the netherlands peru senegal and uganda un water 2017c in parallel there was a consultation process on the indicator s proposed methodology with a wide group of un water members and related experts un water 2017c the final step by step monitoring methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 was published in january 2017 this included minor changes from feedback during the testing and consultation process un water 2017a in april 2017 the indicator was approved to tier ii 1 the tier classification system divides the sdg indicators based on the level of methodological development and data availability the

will provide their own statistics for transboundary basin area as well as information on cooperative arrangements the reporting mechanism for the 1992 unece convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes hereafter unece water convention has been integrated with the sdg indicator 6 5 2 reporting questionnaire unece water convention secretariat 2016 as a result countries that are parties to the unece water convention report to both mechanisms at once sdg indicator 6 5 2 data collection began in spring 2017 with the first report on the status of sdg indicator 6 5 2 due in june 2018 in the context of this paper and sdg indicator 6 5 2 transboundary basin area represents both surface water and groundwater systems within the transboundary basin area of a country are the country s basin country units bcu and aquifer country units acu a bcu is the area of a transboundary river basin within a riparian state similarly an acu is the area of a transboundary aquifer that underlies the country of interest a transboundary river basin or aquifer therefore has a minimum of two bcus or acus depending on the number of states that share the waters the summation of a country s bcu and acu area is the country s total transboundary area in the step by step monitoring methodology for indicator 6 5 2 un water 2017a a country s initial step in calculating sdg indicator 6 5 2 is to identify international transboundary river basins and aquifers in the country and then to determine if a cooperative arrangement exists for each transboundary river basin or aquifer identified a cooperative arrangement is defined by the methodology as a bilateral or multilateral treaty convention agreement or other formal arrangement such as memorandum of understanding between riparian countries that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management un water 2017a p 3 if a cooperative arrangement exists then it must be determined if it is operational i e if it meets all the following criteria un water 2017a p 3 there is a joint body joint mechanism or commission e g a river basin organization for transboundary cooperation there are regular at least once per year formal communications between riparian countries in the form of meetings either at the political or technical level there is a joint or coordinated water management plan s or joint objectives have been set and there is a regular exchange at least once per year of data and information although all criteria must be met in order for a cooperative arrangement to be considered operational it is important to note that they do not have to be stated explicitly in the cooperative arrangement as long as they are occurring in practice un water 2017a these criteria are based on principles of international water law that are codified within the 1997 un convention on the law of the non navigational uses of international watercourses hereafter un watercourses convention the unece water convention and the draft law of transboundary aquifers un statistics 2016 the goal of structuring the indicator in this manner is to encourage countries to establish new operational arrangements or to update existing arrangements to be operational un water 2017a in that sense the criteria serve to provide guidance to un member states on where improvements can be made this methodology incorporates the feedback from the pilot testing and consultations on sdg 6 un water 2017b 2017c there are only minor alterations from the april 2016 draft un water 2016a b these consist of the addition of a set frequency at least once per year for the regularity of meetings and exchange of information criteria and they allow for the calculation of the indicator at the sub basin level un water 2017d 3 methodology the objective of this paper is to test the methodology and conceptualization of sdg indicator 6 5 2 by simulating its calculation in order to evaluate its application and its ability to measure transboundary water cooperation we approached this through both national 3 see gwp 2017 measuring transboundary water cooperation options for

explained below the results are from research conducted in 2016 using the draft step by step monitoring methodology for indicator 6 5 2 un water 2016b the differences between the draft and final methodology do not alter the outcomes of this analysis the first component of the analysis simulates the calculation of the indicator from the perspective of an individual country for three case studies bangladesh honduras and uganda this was completed as part of research supported by the global water partnership gwp these countries were selected because they are part of the gwp sdg preparedness facility which aims to assist countries in their implementation sdg 6 gwp 2016 most importantly the three countries present different contexts for evaluating the indicator they represent three different regions with varied extents of transboundary river basins and aquifers for transboundary areas we used global datasets including the tfdd s spatial database and the igrac and unesco ihp delineations of transboundary aquifers igrac unesco ihp 2015 tfdd 2016 information on cooperative arrangements was collected from in country representatives using the questionnaire 5 the template for the questionnaire used in the national overview study was from the eleventh meeting of the working group on iwrm on 18 19 october 2016 in geneva http www unece org fileadmin dam env documents 2016 wat 10oct 18 19wgiwrm wg 1 2016 inf5 reporting pdf5 5 and through secondary literature the criteria for operationality were evaluated based on both the formal agreements and other aspects of cooperative arrangements that were not explicit in the agreements these were identified using secondary literature second since agenda 2030 is a global framework that will be viewed monitored and analyzed as a global dataset we also applied the methodology consistently across all countries in a global overview through research supported by unesco ihp this allowed us to consider the indicator from a broader perspective the same draft step by step monitoring methodology for indicator 6 5 2 methodology was applied however data collection and sources differed between the national and global overviews given the scope of the global overview the extensive research required to evaluate the criteria at the depth of the national perspective was not feasible therefore the criteria were only evaluated against the articles and provisions within the formal arrangements on transboundary rivers lakes and aquifers these arrangements were primarily found in global datasets including inter alia the tfdd s international freshwater treaties database the international water law project and faolex as a result the second component of the analysis provides an overview of transboundary cooperation as formalized in legal arrangements but not necessarily as carried out in practice we acknowledge that through the use of global datasets it is likely that some existing agreements have not been included by considering this methodology from the national and global perspectives we hope to understand both the strengths and limitations of the definition of transboundary cooperation implied by sdg indicator 6 5 2 and its methodology 4 analysis of sdg indicator 6 5 2 4 1 national overview to analyze the application of the indicator s methodology we considered transboundary water cooperation for three case studies bangladesh honduras and uganda which have varied transboundary water systems bangladesh and uganda figs 2 and 4 are similar in that they both are nearly contained within one international transboundary river basin the ganges brahmaputra meghna and the nile respectively despite this they differ in upstream downstream orientation honduras fig 3 on the other hand has six international transboundary river basins but combined these only compose about 20 of the country s surface area in terms of transboundary aquifers bangladesh has one major aquifer system compared with honduras and uganda which have several smaller transboundary aquifers however in all three countries as with much of the world aquifers have not been extensively assessed or mapped 6 the global igrac and unesco ihp delineations of transboundary aquifers igrac unesco ihp 2015 were used for aquifer areas this global dataset provides a good representation of the location and area of transboundary groundwaters in the future the accuracy of the sdg 6 5 2 calculation could be improved with additional assessment of aquifer systems 6 hydro politically the three countries also exhibit different levels and types of cooperation for example india and bangladesh have signed the 1996 ganges water sharing treaty and participate in the indo bangladesh joint rivers commission hossain 1998 sood and mathukumalli 2011 in the nile river basin there is a long history of conflict and cooperation major agreements include the 1929 nile waters agreement and the 1959 agreement for the full utilization of the nile water between egypt and sudan recently there has been several notable cooperative efforts throughout the basin including the cooperative framework agreement signed in 2010 though not in force and the nile basin initiative which was established in 1999 salman 2013 honduras has limited formal state to state cooperation occurring on its internationally shared waters the only agreement is the tratado entre las repúblicas de el salvador guatemala y honduras para la ejecución del plan trifinio also known as the trifinio plan that addresses water resources in the upper lempa river basin lópez 2004 unep 2007 much of the cooperation in transboundary river basins and aquifers is informal local or through the backing of third party international organizations for this study the transboundary river basin area and transboundary aquifer area within bangladesh fig 2 honduras fig 3 and uganda fig 4 were mapped specifying whether the area is under an operational arrangement for cooperation following the methodology the indicator as presented in table 1 column 2 results in the percent of the total transboundary area that has an operational cooperative arrangement this value combines both transboundary river basin and aquifer areas which may obscure cooperation occurring or hide a lack of cooperation because of the weight implied by the use of area in the calculation generally there is significantly more cooperation occurring over transboundary river basins than transboundary aquifers the composition of the sdg indicator allows for the values to be disaggregated by type of water resources i e to calculate the indicator for transboundary river basin area and transboundary aquifer area separately which is illustrated in table 1 columns 3 and 4 disaggregating the indicator will be important to provide a more accurate picture of where cooperation is occurring within the country and will aid in determining where diplomatic efforts may need to be targeted to increase the level of cooperation as can been seen in figs 2 4 and table 1 neither bangladesh nor honduras have any transboundary area river basin or aquifer that has operational cooperation as not all the criteria required by the methodology has been met as seen above uganda has operational cooperation occurring within the nile river basin because the nile river basin constitutes majority of uganda s transboundary area it yields a high value for the indicator of 90 percent this high value for sdg indicator 6 5 2 hides the lack of operational cooperation on transboundary aquifers which is made apparent when results are disaggregated as demonstrated in table 1 furthermore the structure of the indicator may hide components of cooperation that are occurring but are not enough to satisfy all the criteria for operational cooperation this is made apparent when disaggregating the indicator by its four criteria as shown by table 2 which presents the break down for the fulfillment of criteria for the bcus and acus for the three case studies the national overview highlights the need for significant knowledge of cooperative processes in order to accurately determine the operationality of an arrangement it appears essential to look beyond the single indicator value to better understand and represent the cooperation process that might be occurring therefore countries should be invited to acknowledge the complexity of cooperative processes and provide as detailed information as possible when monitoring and reporting on the indicator similarly agencies and organizations using the indicator should be aware of the complexity and take account of the detailed information provided by the reporting countries 4 2 global overview from a global perspective sdg indicator 6 5 2 varies widely between regions and countries fig 5 based on existing arrangements states with the highest proportion of transboundary area under an operational arrangement for water cooperation are located in europe africa and north america east and west africa present mixed values for the indicator as do central and south america sdg indicator 6 5 2 is generally very low throughout the middle east as well as in asia and the pacific there are notable exceptions in central and southeast asia large bcus and acus that compose the majority of a country s area such as in bangladesh and uganda as discussed in section 4 1 may artificially weight the value of the indicator positively or negatively depending on whether the area has operational cooperation this may cause smaller bcus or acus to be overlooked as they will not affect the value of the indicator as much as larger basins the weight from these large areas can result in clusters of states with a particularly high or low proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for instance in central europe many countries have a high indicator value due to the existence of operational water cooperation within the po rhine and danube river basins the latter basin spans 19 states of which 15 are contracting parties to the convention on cooperation for the protection and sustainable use of the danube river 1994 central asia presents a similar case with the aral sea basin shared between afghanistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan with the exception of afghanistan all the riparian countries have agreed to the statute of the interstate commission for water coordination of central asia 2008 an arrangement that meets all the conditions for operationality of sdg indicator 6 5 2 although sdg indicator 6 5 2 gives a specific overview of cooperation that may not capture the full spectrum of cooperative processes between riparian countries this confirms the observation made in the national overview analysis that in order to better represent the extent of cooperation it is essential to disaggregate data by type of water resources surface water and groundwater as evidenced in figs 5 to 7 when disaggregated the data exemplify the lack of formalized operational cooperation for transboundary aquifers compared to transboundary river basins as also shown in table 3 this makes apparent the ability of operational cooperation in transboundary river basins to mask the lack of operational cooperation in transboundary aquifers table 3 illustrates the gap between transboundary surface water and groundwater in terms of development of operational cooperation worldwide only three transboundary aquifers have an operational arrangement for water cooperation the genovese aquifer shared by france and switzerland the nubian sandstone aquifer system which is shared by libya egypt chad and sudan and the northwestern sahara aquifer system which is jointly managed by algeria tunisia and libya the lack of formal operational cooperation over shared groundwater resources partially stems from until recently limited scientific and technical knowledge regarding their location extent and other physical characteristics indeed the first world map of transboundary aquifers was published in 2008 only by the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources bgr and unesco ihp it comprised 273 shared aquifers bgr and unesco 2008 since then the assessment of transboundary aquifers has continued to progress in 2012 the map of the transboundary aquifers of the world identified 445 aquifers followed by 592 in the 2015 edition igrac unesco ihp 2012 2015 this underlines the importance of disaggregating sdg indicator 6 5 2 by type of water resources to get a clearer picture of where operational cooperation processes are happening or lacking furthermore it is beneficial for water stakeholders and managers to understand the difference in extent of cooperation between surface and groundwater in order to highlight areas and hydrogeological units without operational transboundary cooperation gwp 2017 however the recent progression of identification and delineation of aquifers highlights a potential difficulty states may encounter when reporting on the indicator lack of data and information about aquifers may make it difficult to report as well as difficult to develop cooperative arrangements considering these results and processes through which we calculated sdg indicator 6 5 2 for both the national and global overviews several observations can be made about the indicator and its methodology for defining and quantifying transboundary cooperation 5 discussion strengths and limitations of sdg indicator 6 5 2 in measuring transboundary water cooperation the criteria used to define operational cooperation river basin organization meetings data exchange and joint management plans all support procedural rules within international water law these criteria for the indicator will support states in meeting their obligations particularly for the newly in force 1997 un watercourses convention and the newly opened to non ece states 1992 unece water convention unece 2016 these procedural rules and their derivative criteria support the research stating that states should be encouraged to develop adequate institutional capacity in order to reduce the potential for dispute wolf et al 2003 the broad nature of the criteria related to meeting and joint management allows for the inclusion of wide forms of cooperation although the lack of a precise definition leaves room for interpretation and could lead to discrepancies in reporting between riparian countries furthermore the indicator is relatively straightforward to calculate and yields a singular value that can be easily quoted the methodology also allows for the disaggregation of results by type of water resources which provides better insight into where operational cooperation is missing although not highlighted in the methodology the design of sdg indicator 6 5 2 also offers the possibility to disaggregate data by criteria of operationality which can illustrate the procedural elements that are lacking in cooperative arrangements overall this aids in making the indicator a potentially effective tool for encouraging policy change in that sense sdg indicator 6 5 2 constitutes a first stage towards the monitoring of transboundary cooperation and seems to fit the needs for global monitoring within agenda 2030 even though this indicator and its interpretation are based on international water law and current academic thinking regarding increases in institutional capacity the indicator presents a high level of complexity and several limitations thus we present and discuss those limitations as illustrated by the national and global overviews in general a zero percent for sdg indicator 6 5 2 indicates that there is no operational cooperation but this also may imply that there is no cooperation at all which is not the case for many shared waters this results from the binary categorical structure of this conceptualization of operational cooperation to be operational an arrangement must meet all the four criteria embedded in the methodology meaning a cooperative arrangement is either operational or not there is no in between as a result sdg indicator 6 5 2 masks cooperative processes that do not meet all the criteria as shown in table 2 for example in bangladesh s bcu for the ganges brahmaputra meghna river basin only one criterion is not met the implementation of joint plans or joint objectives causing the area not to contribute to the sdg indicator calculation similarly the area for the upper lempa river in honduras does not contribute to the indicator because it lacks formal data and information exchange regarding the shared water resources managed by the trifinio plan and tri national commission these two examples exemplify areas where cooperation is occurring but is not recognized as operational under the indicator the draft step by step monitoring methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 as well as the final january 2017 version attempts to address this issue by stating the operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation the operationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames and in a year or two progress could potentially be observed un water 2016b however the binary yes or no nature of the indicator is likely to mask positively evolving cooperation and stepwise progress made towards operationality during the monitoring and reporting timeframe unless each criterion of sdg indicator 6 5 2 is satisfied for example negotiations for the ganges water sharing treaty started in 1950 four decades later the agreement was finally signed in 1996 hossain 1998 still the arrangement on the ganges is not considered operational under the indicator achieving operational cooperation as conceptualized by sdg indicator 6 5 2 may never be attainable for some basins and aquifers due to the hydro political context given the importance of political will in establishing transboundary cooperation as discussed in the introduction recognizing steps made towards cooperation is essential for encouraging countries in their efforts the evolution of the methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 will have to include parameters to overcome the difficulty in accurately displaying all progress made towards cooperation this is particularly important as it has the potential to encourage countries to continue pursuing and developing cooperation and to prevent the diversion of funding and other resources from transboundary basins and thus countries that artificially through the indicator do not show progress towards cooperation compared to the draft april 2016 version the january 2017 final step by step methodology for indicator 6 5 2 has been updated to allow for the consideration of operational arrangements that are at the sub basin scale this allows transboundary sub basin areas to count toward the indicator even if the basin as a whole does not have a cooperative arrangement or an operational cooperative arrangement un water 2017a this adjustment could allow for a more precise depiction of transboundary cooperation however it also raises several questions related to its implementation i how to address arrangements that do not cover all the area of a transboundary basin ii how to address arrangements that only cover a limited set of substantive rules or issues for example the ganges water sharing treaty determines the allocations between india and bangladesh at the farakka barrage this treaty is limited in scope and extent as it only addresses allocation at a particular point in the basin if all the criteria were to be fulfilled by bangladesh and it was considered to be an operational cooperative arrangement which area would this apply to for the calculation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 the whole basin or the point at farakka furthermore should the cooperative arrangement be considered equivalent to an arrangement that includes additional issues that impact the transboundary management of the basin such as environmental flows fisheries or water quality concerns do and should the substantive issues that are encompassed in a cooperative arrangement matter when evaluating its operationality although the current methodology for the calculation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 does not aim at evaluating the scope of arrangements it does present a critical issue when comparing the degree of cooperation between countries the nature of indicators lends to comparison however operational cooperative arrangements are not comparable nor equivalent as represented in the indicator another methodological issue is how to account for the overlapping of hydrological management units with differing arrangements for example the democratic republic of congo is party to two operational arrangements under sdg indicator 6 5 2 one for the management of the congo basin and a second for the management of the tanganyika lake sub basin as a result the tanganyika lake sub basin is covered by two operational arrangements with different scopes and provisions in that case and considering that a transboundary basin area should only be accounted once which agreement should be taken into account for the calculation of the indicator overlapping hydrological features are also physically observed since transboundary surface waters are often underlain by a portion of or a full transboundary aquifer fig 1 given the significant disparity in coverage of operational cooperation between transboundary basins and aquifers a solution could be to integrate the management of those groundwater resources with the agreements of the shared surface waters this is already observed in some transboundary surface water basins although the scope of such conjunctive treaties is still limited to institutional issues lautze et al 2018 it is unlikely that such treaties would fit the requirements of sdg indicator 6 5 2 in terms of operational cooperation for transboundary groundwaters additionally since transboundary aquifers rarely lie entirely underneath a single transboundary river basin and can even underlie several river basins conjunctive treaties have the potential to spatially fragment and further complexify the management of shared aquifers as law and governance discourse have migrated toward the use of the basin scale as the main unit of consideration the use of area as the base metric for calculating the extent of transboundary cooperation is understandable however the use of area in the indicator s calculation implies a weight to larger basins and aquifers which may not correlate with the importance of the basin or aquifer nor align with where cooperative and diplomatic efforts need to be emphasized other alternatives to area could be considered such as volume of water number of people dependent on the resource or number of agreements for example the draft 3rd state of the nile report indicators includes a measure of transboundary water cooperation that is determined by the percent of countries a country has cooperative agreements with abuzeid 2016 however metrics such as volume may similarly imply a weight to basins in more humid climates although sdg indicator 6 5 2 focuses on state to state cooperation much of the cooperative processes may be occurring at the regional or local level since the political context may not allow for cooperation at the level of the national governments additionally cooperation may be easier to initiate at a local scale than over a large area in an international context in honduras for example much of the cooperative processes have been occurring at the local level in that case the role of third parties was also particularly important iucn unep and unesco ihp were critical in initiating the cooperative efforts without national government involvement the local scale cooperation is likely to remain dependent on third parties for financial support this results in an unsustainable framework and cooperative efforts may not be effective or may fail over time due to the lack of support the step by step methodology for indicator 6 5 2 recognizes some of its limitations and gives particular attention to the fact that not all riparians may be parties to a transboundary arrangement the document states that in situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin but only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours un water 2017a p 3 this acknowledges that the focus on the country scale may mask gaps in cooperation within a basin or aquifer for example in the uganda case study discussed earlier the nile river basin was found to have operational cooperation however not all riparians participate in the cooperative framework agreement egypt the democratic republic of the congo south sudan and sudan are yet to sign the agreement therefore the methodology recommends aggregating the data across the basin in addition to the national scale while the exclusion of riparians from cooperative arrangements is not ideal the methodology recognizes that it is still important for the indicator to acknowledge partial cooperative efforts that are occurring in multilateral basins and aquifers given that full multilateral and operational arrangements may not be possible depending on the social or political context however the inclusion or exclusion of a riparian from a cooperative arrangement would only be apparent when considering the indicator across a single river basin or aquifer rather than just the country scale the national focus on country level indicators is a requirement of the sdg framework to which the sdg indicator 6 5 2 must adhere however this is inconsistent with the push towards basin or aquifer scale governance and management which countries should be cognizant of when utilizing the indicator and developing cooperative arrangements ultimately sdg indicator 6 5 2 presents at first sight a simple straightforward methodology that seems to meet the requirements of agenda 2030 however the challenge of developing a sole global indicator for assessing transboundary water cooperation given its inherently high political nature has resulted in several limitations in the definition of the indicator and its measurement of operational cooperation for transboundary waters when calculating the indicator this implies limited results and a binary biased depiction of cooperation in terms of forms and locations the scope including the substantive issues extent of coverage of a cooperative arrangement weight and importance of a particular shared water source and the political and social context needs to be considered in addition to the procedural criteria that the indicator reflects in addition there is significant value in considering the disaggregated data within a particular basin or aquifer from all the different riparians as well as the aggregated data for a basin or aquifer this captures an alternative view of transboundary cooperation that may not be visible with national level data particularly in multilateral basins nonetheless sdg indicator 6 5 2 offers a first step monitoring tool that could be used by states to initially gather information and initiate interest for developing mutually beneficial transboundary cooperation considering the 15 year timeframe of the sdg process there is potential and need for the methodology to be improved particularly with feedback from countries over the course of the next fifteen years 6 way forward as countries and agencies work with the indicator they should be aware of data reliability a key element for accurate calculation and monitoring of sdg indicator 6 5 2 is the state s capacity to access and gather reliable data on their shared waters the existing arrangements and the four criteria for operationality the quality of data from countries is likely to be inconsistent across the globe this may be due to the data gap faced by some countries particularly developing ones the difficulties experienced in accessing and collecting relevant information or the incorrect or incomplete submission of the reporting questionnaires in particular the accuracy of responses to questionnaires depends on how they are filled out and on which stakeholders participate to the reporting process if needed countries could use open access databases such as the tfdd river basin organization and treaties databases faolex 7 fao legal and policy database http www fao org faolex en 7 and eur lex 8 eur lex access to eu law http eur lex europa eu homepage html 8 as secondary sources of information on river basin organizations and cooperative arrangements other open access databases such as the transboundary waters assessment programme 9 twap river basins interactive data portal http twap rivers org indicators 9 the unesco ihp water information network system 10 unesco ihp wins http en unesco org ihp wins 10 and the tfdd s spatial database 11 tfdd http www transboundarywaters orst edu 11 can also provide countries with access to spatial data on their transboundary river basins and aquifers this may be particularly helpful for the delineation of transboundary aquifers which countries often lack and may face difficulties in producing over short time frames or due to lack funds and capacities as the aforementioned databases only provide information at the transboundary basin scale disaggregation and reporting of the indicator at the sub basin scale may only rely on spatial data from states which may not be available in every country without proper delineations reliable calculation of the indicator will not be possible in that sense the role of the unece water convention secretariat and unesco ihp as custodian agencies will be critical in order to provide member states with support and guidance in the monitoring and reporting of the indicator but also to ensure quality reporting on sdg indicator 6 5 2 in order to be more consistent and accurate in capturing transboundary water cooperation the methodology could be updated in the future to allow for the recognition that each basin or aquifer is unique with a different set of physical and hydro political conditions that result in different structures scopes extents etc of cooperative arrangements one potential recommendation would be to transform sdg indicator 6 5 2 into an index in this vision of the indicator the presence of i a joint commission authority organization ii regular meetings iii exchange of data and information and iv joint management plans and or objectives would be accounted for separately this would give a more nuanced picture of cooperation it would also track progress towards the criteria for operationality that are currently masked by the binary nature of the indicator additionally the index could be expanded to also consider substantive rules or particular issues such as allocation water quality conflict resolution and environmental protection which are currently absent in the present iteration of the indicator this would potentially address the current assumption that arrangements are equivalent if they meet the procedural criteria furthermore addressing the level of implementation of the cooperative arrangement could help identify paper tigers i e when formalized cooperation is not reflected in practice or when the arrangement does not address the issues at hand for example despite the operational arrangement within the aral sea basin the institutional framework lacks integration and cooperation and is often inhibited by conflicts of interest and insufficient coordination unep 2014 future updates to the indicator could include accounting for the quality of cooperation and not just the presence or absence of specific criteria sdg indicator 6 5 1 presents an example of an index based on a percentage approach in comparison to sdg indicator 6 5 2 s binary construction the methodology for the degree of implementation of iwrm in sdg indicator 6 5 1 as briefly mentioned in the background section allows countries to rate their progress towards each question in the survey by six thresholds which are then averaged to yield an index value for the sdg indicator 6 5 1 similarly it allows for the disaggregation of the index to provide an assessment of the degree of implementation of the four components measured by the survey on iwrm un water 2017e an index variation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 could allow for additional development of the criteria for operationality to identify the state of cooperation and acknowledge what cooperation is occurring for example the criterion for data and information exchange could be separated into levels such as 1 transfer of data 2 data harmonization and 3 joint data collection sdg indicator 6 5 1 presents an interesting comparison to how an index could be developed for sdg indication 6 5 2 7 conclusion the 2030 agenda with target 6 5 and sdg indicator 6 5 2 presents a unique opportunity at the international policy level to promote and measure transboundary cooperation and encourage water diplomacy by building institutional capacity that allows states to adapt and respond to the increasing demands on shared water resources the changing climate and the evolving hydro political context we simulated the calculation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 in two overview analyses a global overview analysis and a national overview analysis of three case studies the results illustrate the high variability in the occurrence of operational cooperation across the globe with countries in europe and africa meeting more of the criteria for operationality in addition operational cooperation occurs more frequently over shared surface waters than over shared aquifers while indicators are useful to inform decision making they can have embedded aspects that support a specific approach or position hezri 2004 it is important for countries agencies and users to recognize the assumptions made in developing the indicator and that it is endogenous to the cooperative processes it is measuring therefore sdg indicator 6 5 2 should not be considered a panacea to improve all efforts towards transboundary cooperation but rather as a reflection of the current positions on thinking surrounding transboundary cooperation from an international development perspective as a result we must recognize the benefits and limitations of sdg indicator 6 5 2 and its framework as a first global step for measuring transboundary water cooperation the discussion in section 5 identifies several benefits including the development of institutional capacity support for international water law and the versatility of aggregation and disaggregation of the indicator similarly several limitations and considerations were demonstrated including oversimplification of the hydro political context normative and procedural criteria exclusion of substantive issues overlooking of informal cooperation non state actors and the role of third parties and the focus on national scale of analysis compared to a basin or aquifer scale finally section 6 discusses a potential way forward as the indicator evolves and adapts during the 15 year sdg time frame in response to country feedback funding

7122,water is central to sustainable development making transboundary cooperation among riparians a core aspect of agenda 2030 and the sustainable development goals sdgs sdg 6 on water and sanitation includes an indicator sdg indicator 6 5 2 to assess cooperation over transboundary waters by measuring the proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation the definitions developed by the methodology for calculating the indicator have the potential to significantly impact the resulting structure and type of cooperation that are assessed and that will develop indeed the composition of this indicator will both directly and indirectly influence water diplomacy international policy and water law in this research we analyze the methodology for assessing sdg indicator 6 5 2 examine how operational cooperative arrangements are defined and identify the strengths and limitations of the method for measuring transboundary water cooperation this is done by simulating the application of the methodology and calculating the indicator in three national case studies bangladesh honduras and uganda and in a global overview the unequal distribution regionally of operational cooperation is evident as well as the gap in coverage between transboundary surface waters and aquifers however the normative and binary nature of the indicator obscures the political complexity of establishing cooperative processes and has the potential to present a false depiction of the extent of cooperation that is occurring over shared waters in this article we also discuss bias that can be introduced with using surface area as a metric to assess cooperation that results in weighting larger basins and aquifers over smaller basins in the calculation of the indicator this paper presents a basis for further analysis of sdg indicator 6 5 2 and the possible adaptations of the indicator design to better assess transboundary water cooperation keywords measuring cooperation sustainable development goals shared waters transboundary river basin transboundary aquifer geographic information science gis 1 introduction water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation transboundary waters are surface waters and groundwaters that mark cross or are located on international political boundaries between two or more states unece 1992 globally 310 international transboundary river basins cover 47 1 of the world s land surface while there are at least 592 transboundary aquifers underlying about 20 of the world s land surface igrac unesco ihp 2015 mccracken and wolf forthcoming see fig 1 nearly half of the world s population lives within a transboundary river or lake basin or over a transboundary aquifer thus these waters are important for ensuring global national and individual water security tfdd 2016 due to global reliance on transboundary waters the implications for sustainable development and the political nature of shared waters encouraging transboundary cooperation and diplomacy over shared waters is an important but complex component of the international development agenda diplomacy is the process of interactions between states with the goal of preventing hostility islam and susskind 2013 it relies on the promotion creation and maintenance of cooperation cooperation is the coordination between states where they collaborate to achieve common interests with mutual benefits leb 2015 zartman 2008 therefore the role of water diplomacy in the context of international waters is to foster transboundary cooperation over shared waters between states managing water is complex as it requires addressing the unequal distribution of water resources in both space and time exacerbated by climate change and the increasing demands for domestic agricultural and industrial uses demands are further expanding with population growth economic development and changing lifestyles water quality and environmental needs further impact management and governance with all aspects combining to increase competition and risk of conflict over shared resources political borders add a layer of complexity and as states develop their internationally shared waters they experience this complexity which requires diplomacy and cooperation to avoid negative impacts to the nation or to the shared resource mitchell and zawahri 2015 transboundary cooperation presents opportunities for riparian states to identify shared interests and develop actions towards mutual benefits these benefits can be directly related to the resource but can also extend beyond it such as monetary or energy exchange sadoff and grey 2002 wolf 1998 shared interests and mutual benefits are readily apparent in cooperative arrangements such as treaties and negotiated agreements giordano et al 2013 treaties agreements river basin organizations or positive international relations are examples of institutional capacity which is an indicator of the potential for dispute or cooperation over shared waters wolf 2007 adequate institutional capacity in a shared water system has the ability to absorb rapid physical or institutional change which can lower the potential for conflict wolf et al 2003 diplomatic and cooperative efforts are needed to establish and maintain institutional capacity for example the signing of a treaty in a transboundary basin increases the potential for future water cooperation brochmann 2012 a basin or aquifer that is categorized as having cooperation does not exclude it from conflict or tension therefore cooperation and conflict do not necessarily occur in isolation from each other zeitoun and mirumachi 2008 the political will of riparian states determines if cooperation will occur wouters 2013 therefore water diplomacy is essential to increase trust and develop the political desire to establish and maintain cooperation cooperation between countries for the management of shared water resources is ubiquitously supported by scholars however various definitions of transboundary water cooperation coexist which translate into the absence of a single accepted means to measure it saruchera and lautze 2015 tarlock 2015 the conceptualization and measurement of transboundary water cooperation takes a wide range of forms de stefano et al 2010 2017 mirumachi 2007 strategic foresight group 2015 tarlock 2015 unep dhi 2016 these multiple understandings present difficulties in monitoring and encouraging cooperation because there is not a consistent and comparable measurement method the complexity surrounding transboundary cooperation contributes to the variability in defining and monitoring cooperation developing a globally applied method must simplify the complexity by selecting elements to represent the level of cooperation in addition to overcoming the political nature of determining which elements should be used as a proxy the signing of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the sdg framework present an opportunity to promote transboundary water cooperation through water diplomacy by providing a method of defining and measuring transboundary cooperation globally while also integrating the water goals with the rest of the 2030 agenda this method could also serve as a limited proxy for the effectiveness of water diplomacy it is expected that sdg indicator 6 5 2 for transboundary cooperation described in section 2 2 will influence the development and structure of cooperation over shared surface waters and groundwaters as countries enact elements of operational cooperation in order to achieve the indicator through 2030 therefore it is important to better understand the benefits limitations and implications of this global framework for transboundary water cooperation this paper analyzes the methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 examines how operational cooperative arrangements are defined and identifies the strengths and limitations of this method for measuring transboundary water cooperation 2 background 2 1 agenda 2030 from sdg 6 on water and sanitation to sdg indicator 6 5 2 on transboundary

will provide their own statistics for transboundary basin area as well as information on cooperative arrangements the reporting mechanism for the 1992 unece convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes hereafter unece water convention has been integrated with the sdg indicator 6 5 2 reporting questionnaire unece water convention secretariat 2016 as a result countries that are parties to the unece water convention report to both mechanisms at once sdg indicator 6 5 2 data collection began in spring 2017 with the first report on the status of sdg indicator 6 5 2 due in june 2018 in the context of this paper and sdg indicator 6 5 2 transboundary basin area represents both surface water and groundwater systems within the transboundary basin area of a country are the country s basin country units bcu and aquifer country units acu a bcu is the area of a transboundary river basin within a riparian state similarly an acu is the area of a transboundary aquifer that underlies the country of interest a transboundary river basin or aquifer therefore has a minimum of two bcus or acus depending on the number of states that share the waters the summation of a country s bcu and acu area is the country s total transboundary area in the step by step monitoring methodology for indicator 6 5 2 un water 2017a a country s initial step in calculating sdg indicator 6 5 2 is to identify international transboundary river basins and aquifers in the country and then to determine if a cooperative arrangement exists for each transboundary river basin or aquifer identified a cooperative arrangement is defined by the methodology as a bilateral or multilateral treaty convention agreement or other formal arrangement such as memorandum of understanding between riparian countries that provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management un water 2017a p 3 if a cooperative arrangement exists then it must be determined if it is operational i e if it meets all the following criteria un water 2017a p 3 there is a joint body joint mechanism or commission e g a river basin organization for transboundary cooperation there are regular at least once per year formal communications between riparian countries in the form of meetings either at the political or technical level there is a joint or coordinated water management plan s or joint objectives have been set and there is a regular exchange at least once per year of data and information although all criteria must be met in order for a cooperative arrangement to be considered operational it is important to note that they do not have to be stated explicitly in the cooperative arrangement as long as they are occurring in practice un water 2017a these criteria are based on principles of international water law that are codified within the 1997 un convention on the law of the non navigational uses of international watercourses hereafter un watercourses convention the unece water convention and the draft law of transboundary aquifers un statistics 2016 the goal of structuring the indicator in this manner is to encourage countries to establish new operational arrangements or to update existing arrangements to be operational un water 2017a in that sense the criteria serve to provide guidance to un member states on where improvements can be made this methodology incorporates the feedback from the pilot testing and consultations on sdg 6 un water 2017b 2017c there are only minor alterations from the april 2016 draft un water 2016a b these consist of the addition of a set frequency at least once per year for the regularity of meetings and exchange of information criteria and they allow for the calculation of the

explained below the results are from research conducted in 2016 using the draft step by step monitoring methodology for indicator 6 5 2 un water 2016b the differences between the draft and final methodology do not alter the outcomes of this analysis the first component of the analysis simulates the calculation of the indicator from the perspective of an individual country for three case studies bangladesh honduras and uganda this was completed as part of research supported by the global water partnership gwp these countries were selected because they are part of the gwp sdg preparedness facility which aims to assist countries in their implementation sdg 6 gwp 2016 most importantly the three countries present different contexts for evaluating the indicator they represent three different regions with varied extents of transboundary river basins and aquifers for transboundary areas we used global datasets including the tfdd s spatial database and the igrac and unesco ihp delineations of transboundary aquifers igrac unesco ihp 2015 tfdd 2016 information on cooperative arrangements was collected from in country representatives using the questionnaire 5 the template for the questionnaire used in the national overview study was from the eleventh meeting of the working group on iwrm on 18 19 october 2016 in geneva http www unece org fileadmin dam env documents 2016 wat 10oct 18 19wgiwrm wg 1 2016 inf5 reporting pdf5 5 and through secondary literature the criteria for operationality were evaluated based on both the formal agreements and other aspects of cooperative arrangements that were not explicit in the agreements these were identified using secondary literature second since agenda 2030 is a global framework that will be viewed monitored and analyzed as a global dataset we also applied the methodology consistently across all countries in a global overview through research supported by unesco ihp this allowed us to consider the indicator from a broader perspective the same draft step by step monitoring methodology for indicator 6 5 2 methodology was applied however data collection and sources differed between the national and global overviews given the scope of the global overview the extensive research required to evaluate the criteria at the depth of the national perspective was not feasible therefore the criteria were only evaluated against the articles and provisions within the formal arrangements on transboundary rivers lakes and aquifers these arrangements were primarily found in global datasets including inter alia the tfdd s international freshwater treaties database the international water law project and faolex as a result the second component of the analysis provides an overview of transboundary cooperation as formalized in legal arrangements but not necessarily as carried out in practice we acknowledge that through the use of global datasets it is likely that some existing agreements have not been included by considering this methodology from the national and global perspectives we hope to understand both the strengths and limitations of the definition of transboundary cooperation implied by sdg indicator 6 5 2 and its methodology 4 analysis of sdg indicator 6 5 2 4 1 national overview to analyze the application of the indicator s methodology we considered transboundary water cooperation for three case studies bangladesh honduras and uganda which have varied transboundary water systems bangladesh and uganda figs 2 and 4 are similar in that they both are nearly contained within one international transboundary river basin the ganges brahmaputra meghna and the nile respectively despite this they differ in upstream downstream orientation honduras fig 3 on the other hand has six international transboundary river basins but combined these only compose about 20 of the country s surface area in terms of transboundary aquifers bangladesh has one major aquifer system compared with honduras and uganda which have several smaller transboundary aquifers however in all three countries as with much of the world aquifers have not been extensively assessed or mapped 6 the global igrac and unesco ihp delineations of transboundary aquifers igrac unesco ihp 2015 were used for aquifer areas this global dataset provides a good representation of the location and area of transboundary groundwaters in the future the accuracy of the sdg 6 5 2 calculation could be improved with additional assessment of aquifer systems 6 hydro politically the three countries also exhibit different levels and types of cooperation for example india and bangladesh have signed the 1996 ganges water sharing treaty and participate in the indo bangladesh joint rivers commission hossain 1998 sood and mathukumalli 2011 in the nile river basin there is a long history of conflict and cooperation major agreements include the 1929 nile waters agreement and the 1959 agreement for the full utilization of the nile water between egypt and sudan recently there has been several notable cooperative efforts throughout the basin including the cooperative framework agreement signed in 2010 though not in force and the nile basin initiative which was established in 1999 salman 2013 honduras has limited formal state to state cooperation occurring on its internationally shared waters the only agreement is the tratado entre las repúblicas de el salvador guatemala y honduras para la ejecución del plan trifinio also known as the trifinio plan that addresses water resources in the upper lempa river basin lópez 2004 unep 2007 much of the cooperation in transboundary river basins and aquifers is informal local or through the backing of third party international organizations for this study the transboundary river basin area and transboundary aquifer area within bangladesh fig 2 honduras fig 3 and uganda fig 4 were mapped specifying whether the area is under an operational arrangement for cooperation following the methodology the indicator as presented in table 1 column 2 results in the percent of the total transboundary area that has an operational cooperative arrangement this value combines both transboundary river basin and aquifer areas which may obscure cooperation occurring or hide a lack of cooperation because of the weight implied by the use of area in the calculation generally there is significantly more cooperation occurring over transboundary river basins than transboundary aquifers the composition of the sdg indicator allows for the values to be disaggregated by type of water resources i e to calculate the indicator for transboundary river basin area and transboundary aquifer area separately which is illustrated in table 1 columns 3 and 4 disaggregating the indicator will be important to provide a more accurate picture of where cooperation is occurring within the country and will aid in determining where diplomatic efforts may need to be targeted to increase the level of cooperation as can been seen in figs 2 4 and table 1 neither bangladesh nor honduras have any transboundary area river basin or aquifer that has operational cooperation as not all the criteria required by the methodology has been met as seen above uganda has operational cooperation occurring within the nile river basin because the nile river basin constitutes majority of uganda s transboundary area it yields a high value for the indicator of 90 percent this high value for sdg indicator 6 5 2 hides the lack of operational cooperation on transboundary aquifers which is made apparent when results are disaggregated as demonstrated in table 1 furthermore the structure of the indicator may hide components of cooperation that are occurring but are not enough to satisfy all the criteria for operational cooperation this is made apparent when disaggregating the indicator by its four criteria as shown by table 2 which presents the break down for the fulfillment of criteria for the bcus and acus for the three case studies the national overview highlights the need for significant knowledge of cooperative processes in order to accurately determine the operationality of an arrangement it appears essential to look beyond the single indicator value to better understand and represent the cooperation process that might be occurring therefore countries should be invited to acknowledge the complexity of cooperative processes and provide as detailed information as possible when monitoring and reporting on the indicator similarly agencies and organizations using the indicator should be aware of the complexity and take account of the detailed information provided by the reporting countries 4 2 global overview from a global perspective sdg indicator 6 5 2 varies widely between regions and countries fig 5 based on existing arrangements states with the highest proportion of transboundary area under an operational arrangement for water cooperation are located in europe africa and north america east and west africa present mixed values for the indicator as do central and south america sdg indicator 6 5 2 is generally very low throughout the middle east as well as in asia and the pacific there are notable exceptions in central and southeast asia large bcus and acus that compose the majority of a country s area such as in bangladesh and uganda as discussed in section 4 1 may artificially weight the value of the indicator positively or negatively depending on whether the area has operational cooperation this may cause smaller bcus or acus to be overlooked as they will not affect the value of the indicator as much as larger basins the weight from these large areas can result in clusters of states with a particularly high or low proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for instance in central europe many countries have a high indicator value due to the existence of operational water cooperation within the po rhine and danube river basins the latter basin spans 19 states of which 15 are contracting parties to the convention on cooperation for the protection and sustainable use of the danube river 1994 central asia presents a similar case with the aral sea basin shared between afghanistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan with the exception of afghanistan all the riparian countries have agreed to the statute of the interstate commission for water coordination of central asia 2008 an arrangement that meets all the conditions for operationality of sdg indicator 6 5 2 although sdg indicator 6 5 2 gives a specific overview of cooperation that may not capture the full spectrum of cooperative processes between riparian countries this confirms the observation made in the national overview analysis that in order to better represent the extent of cooperation it is essential to disaggregate data by type of water resources surface water and groundwater as evidenced in figs 5 to 7 when disaggregated the data exemplify the lack of formalized operational cooperation for transboundary aquifers compared to transboundary river basins as also shown in table 3 this makes apparent the ability of operational cooperation in transboundary river basins to mask the lack of operational cooperation in transboundary aquifers table 3 illustrates the gap between transboundary surface water and groundwater in terms of development of operational cooperation worldwide only three transboundary aquifers have an operational arrangement for water cooperation the genovese aquifer shared by france and switzerland the nubian sandstone aquifer system which is shared by libya egypt chad and sudan and the northwestern sahara aquifer system which is jointly managed by algeria tunisia and libya the lack of formal operational cooperation over shared groundwater resources partially stems from until recently limited scientific and technical knowledge regarding their location extent and other physical characteristics indeed the first world map of transboundary aquifers was published in 2008 only by the federal institute for geosciences and natural resources bgr and unesco ihp it comprised 273 shared aquifers bgr and unesco 2008 since then the assessment of transboundary aquifers has continued to progress in 2012 the map of the transboundary aquifers of the world identified 445 aquifers followed by 592 in the 2015 edition igrac unesco ihp 2012 2015 this underlines the importance of disaggregating sdg indicator 6 5 2 by type of water resources to get a clearer picture of where operational cooperation processes are happening or lacking furthermore it is beneficial for water stakeholders and managers to understand the difference in extent of cooperation between surface and groundwater in order to highlight areas and hydrogeological units without operational transboundary cooperation gwp 2017 however the recent progression of identification and delineation of aquifers highlights a potential difficulty states may encounter when reporting on the indicator lack of data and information about aquifers may make it difficult to report as well as difficult to develop cooperative arrangements considering these results and processes through which we calculated sdg indicator 6 5 2 for both the national and global overviews several observations can be made about the indicator and its methodology for defining and quantifying transboundary cooperation 5 discussion strengths and limitations of sdg indicator 6 5 2 in measuring transboundary water cooperation the criteria used to define operational cooperation river basin organization meetings data exchange and joint management plans all support procedural rules within international water law these criteria for the indicator will support states in meeting their obligations particularly for the newly in force 1997 un watercourses convention and the newly opened to non ece states 1992 unece water convention unece 2016 these procedural rules and their derivative criteria support the research stating that states should be encouraged to develop adequate institutional capacity in order to reduce the potential for dispute wolf et al 2003 the broad nature of the criteria related to meeting and joint management allows for the inclusion of wide forms of cooperation although the lack of a precise definition leaves room for interpretation and could lead to discrepancies in reporting between riparian countries furthermore the indicator is relatively straightforward to calculate and yields a singular value that can be easily quoted the methodology also allows for the disaggregation of results by type of water resources which provides better insight into where operational cooperation is missing although not highlighted in the methodology the design of sdg indicator 6 5 2 also offers the possibility to disaggregate data by criteria of operationality which can illustrate the procedural elements that are lacking in cooperative arrangements overall this aids in making the indicator a potentially effective tool for encouraging policy change in that sense sdg indicator 6 5 2 constitutes a first stage towards the monitoring of transboundary cooperation and seems to fit the needs for global monitoring within agenda 2030 even though this indicator and its interpretation are based on international water law and current academic thinking regarding increases in institutional capacity the indicator presents a high level of complexity and several limitations thus we present and discuss those limitations as illustrated by the national and global overviews in general a zero percent for sdg indicator 6 5 2 indicates that there is no operational cooperation but this also may imply that there is no cooperation at all which is not the case for many shared waters this results from the binary categorical structure of this conceptualization of operational cooperation to be operational an arrangement must meet all the four criteria embedded in the methodology meaning a cooperative arrangement is either operational or not there is no in between as a result sdg indicator 6 5 2 masks cooperative processes that do not meet all the criteria as shown in table 2 for example in bangladesh s bcu for the ganges brahmaputra meghna river basin only one criterion is not met the implementation of joint plans or joint objectives causing the area not to contribute to the sdg indicator calculation similarly the area for the upper lempa river in honduras does not contribute to the indicator because it lacks formal data and information exchange regarding the shared water resources managed by the trifinio plan and tri national commission these two examples exemplify areas where cooperation is occurring but is not recognized as operational under the indicator the draft step by step monitoring methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 as well as the final january 2017 version attempts to address this issue by stating the operationality of cooperation is more dynamic as it evolves with the expansion of cooperation the operationality can be expected to evolve over shorter time frames and in a year or two progress could potentially be observed un water 2016b however the binary yes or no nature of the indicator is likely to mask positively evolving cooperation and stepwise progress made towards operationality during the monitoring and reporting timeframe unless each criterion of sdg indicator 6 5 2 is satisfied for example negotiations for the ganges water sharing treaty started in 1950 four decades later the agreement was finally signed in 1996 hossain 1998 still the arrangement on the ganges is not considered operational under the indicator achieving operational cooperation as conceptualized by sdg indicator 6 5 2 may never be attainable for some basins and aquifers due to the hydro political context given the importance of political will in establishing transboundary cooperation as discussed in the introduction recognizing steps made towards cooperation is essential for encouraging countries in their efforts the evolution of the methodology for sdg indicator 6 5 2 will have to include parameters to overcome the difficulty in accurately displaying all progress made towards cooperation this is particularly important as it has the potential to encourage countries to continue pursuing and developing cooperation and to prevent the diversion of funding and other resources from transboundary basins and thus countries that artificially through the indicator do not show progress towards cooperation compared to the draft april 2016 version the january 2017 final step by step methodology for indicator 6 5 2 has been updated to allow for the consideration of operational arrangements that are at the sub basin scale this allows transboundary sub basin areas to count toward the indicator even if the basin as a whole does not have a cooperative arrangement or an operational cooperative arrangement un water 2017a this adjustment could allow for a more precise depiction of transboundary cooperation however it also raises several questions related to its implementation i how to address arrangements that do not cover all the area of a transboundary basin ii how to address arrangements that only cover a limited set of substantive rules or issues for example the ganges water sharing treaty determines the allocations between india and bangladesh at the farakka barrage this treaty is limited in scope and extent as it only addresses allocation at a particular point in the basin if all the criteria were to be fulfilled by bangladesh and it was considered to be an operational cooperative arrangement which area would this apply to for the calculation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 the whole basin or the point at farakka furthermore should the cooperative arrangement be considered equivalent to an arrangement that includes additional issues that impact the transboundary management of the basin such as environmental flows fisheries or water quality concerns do and should the substantive issues that are encompassed in a cooperative arrangement matter when evaluating its operationality although the current methodology for the calculation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 does not aim at evaluating the scope of arrangements it does present a critical issue when comparing the degree of cooperation between countries the nature of indicators lends to comparison however operational cooperative arrangements are not comparable nor equivalent as represented in the indicator another methodological issue is how to account for the overlapping of hydrological management units with differing arrangements for example the democratic republic of congo is party to two operational arrangements under sdg indicator 6 5 2 one for the management of the congo basin and a second for the management of the tanganyika lake sub basin as a result the tanganyika lake sub basin is covered by two operational arrangements with different scopes and provisions in that case and considering that a transboundary basin area should only be accounted once which agreement should be taken into account for the calculation of the indicator overlapping hydrological features are also physically observed since transboundary surface waters are often underlain by a portion of or a full transboundary aquifer fig 1 given the significant disparity in coverage of operational cooperation between transboundary basins and aquifers a solution could be to integrate the management of those groundwater resources with the agreements of the shared surface waters this is already observed in some transboundary surface water basins although the scope of such conjunctive treaties is still limited to institutional issues lautze et al 2018 it is unlikely that such treaties would fit the requirements of sdg indicator 6 5 2 in terms of operational cooperation for transboundary groundwaters additionally since transboundary aquifers rarely lie entirely underneath a single transboundary river basin and can even underlie several river basins conjunctive treaties have the potential to spatially fragment and further complexify the management of shared aquifers as law and governance discourse have migrated toward the use of the basin scale as the main unit of consideration the use of area as the base metric for calculating the extent of transboundary cooperation is understandable however the use of area in the indicator s calculation implies a weight to larger basins and aquifers which may not correlate with the importance of the basin or aquifer nor align with where cooperative and diplomatic efforts need to be emphasized other alternatives to area could be considered such as volume of water number of people dependent on the resource or number of agreements for example the draft 3rd state of the nile report indicators includes a measure of transboundary water cooperation that is determined by the percent of countries a country has cooperative agreements with abuzeid 2016 however metrics such as volume may similarly imply a weight to basins in more humid climates although sdg indicator 6 5 2 focuses on state to state cooperation much of the cooperative processes may be occurring at the regional or local level since the political context may not allow for cooperation at the level of the national governments additionally cooperation may be easier to initiate at a local scale than over a large area in an international context in honduras for example much of the cooperative processes have been occurring at the local level in that case the role of third parties was also particularly important iucn unep and unesco ihp were critical in initiating the cooperative efforts without national government involvement the local scale cooperation is likely to remain dependent on third parties for financial support this results in an unsustainable framework and cooperative efforts may not be effective or may fail over time due to the lack of support the step by step methodology for indicator 6 5 2 recognizes some of its limitations and gives particular attention to the fact that not all riparians may be parties to a transboundary arrangement the document states that in situations where more than two riparian countries share a basin but only some of them have operational cooperation arrangements the indicator value may mask the gap that a riparian country does not have cooperation arrangements with both its upstream and downstream neighbours un water 2017a p 3 this acknowledges that the focus on the country scale may mask gaps in cooperation within a basin or aquifer for example in the uganda case study discussed earlier the nile river basin was found to have operational cooperation however not all riparians participate in the cooperative framework agreement egypt the democratic republic of the congo south sudan and sudan are yet to sign the agreement therefore the methodology recommends aggregating the data across the basin in addition to the national scale while the exclusion of riparians from cooperative arrangements is not ideal the methodology recognizes that it is still important for the indicator to acknowledge partial cooperative efforts that are occurring in multilateral basins and aquifers given that full multilateral and operational arrangements may not be possible depending on the social or political context however the inclusion or exclusion of a riparian from a cooperative arrangement would only be apparent when considering the indicator across a single river basin or aquifer rather than just the country scale the national focus on country level indicators is a requirement of the sdg framework to which the sdg indicator 6 5 2 must adhere however this is inconsistent with the push towards basin or aquifer scale governance and management which countries should be cognizant of when utilizing the indicator and developing cooperative arrangements ultimately sdg indicator 6 5 2 presents at first sight a simple straightforward methodology that seems to meet the requirements of agenda 2030 however the challenge of developing a sole global indicator for assessing transboundary water cooperation given its inherently high political nature has resulted in several limitations in the definition of the indicator and its measurement of operational cooperation for transboundary waters when calculating the indicator this implies limited results and a binary biased depiction of cooperation in terms of forms and locations the scope including the substantive issues extent of coverage of a cooperative arrangement weight and importance of a particular shared water source and the political and social context needs to be considered in addition to the procedural criteria that the indicator reflects in addition there is significant value in considering the disaggregated data within a particular basin or aquifer from all the different riparians as well as the aggregated data for a basin or aquifer this captures an alternative view of transboundary cooperation that may not be visible with national level data particularly in multilateral basins nonetheless sdg indicator 6 5 2 offers a first step monitoring tool that could be used by states to initially gather information and initiate interest for developing mutually beneficial transboundary cooperation considering the 15 year timeframe of the sdg process there is potential and need for the methodology to be improved particularly with feedback from countries over the course of the next fifteen years 6 way forward as countries and agencies work with the indicator they should be aware of data reliability a key element for accurate calculation and monitoring of sdg indicator 6 5 2 is the state s capacity to access and gather reliable data on their shared waters the existing arrangements and the four criteria for operationality the quality of data from countries is likely to be inconsistent across the globe this may be due to the data gap faced by some countries particularly developing ones the difficulties experienced in accessing and collecting relevant information or the incorrect or incomplete submission of the reporting questionnaires in particular the accuracy of responses to questionnaires depends on how they are filled out and on which stakeholders participate to the reporting process if needed countries could use open access databases such as the tfdd river basin organization and treaties databases faolex 7 fao legal and policy database http www fao org faolex en 7 and eur lex 8 eur lex access to eu law http eur lex europa eu homepage html 8 as secondary sources of information on river basin organizations and cooperative arrangements other open access databases such as the transboundary waters assessment programme 9 twap river basins interactive data portal http twap rivers org indicators 9 the unesco ihp water information network system 10 unesco ihp wins http en unesco org ihp wins 10 and the tfdd s spatial database 11 tfdd http www transboundarywaters orst edu 11 can also provide countries with access to spatial data on their transboundary river basins and aquifers this may be particularly helpful for the delineation of transboundary aquifers which countries often lack and may face difficulties in producing over short time frames or due to lack funds and capacities as the aforementioned databases only provide information at the transboundary basin scale disaggregation and reporting of the indicator at the sub basin scale may only rely on spatial data from states which may not be available in every country without proper delineations reliable calculation of the indicator will not be possible in that sense the role of the unece water convention secretariat and unesco ihp as custodian agencies will be critical in order to provide member states with support and guidance in the monitoring and reporting of the indicator but also to ensure quality reporting on sdg indicator 6 5 2 in order to be more consistent and accurate in capturing transboundary water cooperation the methodology could be updated in the future to allow for the recognition that each basin or aquifer is unique with a different set of physical and hydro political conditions that result in different structures scopes extents etc of cooperative arrangements one potential recommendation would be to transform sdg indicator 6 5 2 into an index in this vision of the indicator the presence of i a joint commission authority organization ii regular meetings iii exchange of data and information and iv joint management plans and or objectives would be accounted for separately this would give a more nuanced picture of cooperation it would also track progress towards the criteria for operationality that are currently masked by the binary nature of the indicator additionally the index could be expanded to also consider substantive rules or particular issues such as allocation water quality conflict resolution and environmental protection which are currently absent in the present iteration of the indicator this would potentially address the current assumption that arrangements are equivalent if they meet the procedural criteria furthermore addressing the level of implementation of the cooperative arrangement could help identify paper tigers i e when formalized cooperation is not reflected in practice or when the arrangement does not address the issues at hand for example despite the operational arrangement within the aral sea basin the institutional framework lacks integration and cooperation and is often inhibited by conflicts of interest and insufficient coordination unep 2014 future updates to the indicator could include accounting for the quality of cooperation and not just the presence or absence of specific criteria sdg indicator 6 5 1 presents an example of an index based on a percentage approach in comparison to sdg indicator 6 5 2 s binary construction the methodology for the degree of implementation of iwrm in sdg indicator 6 5 1 as briefly mentioned in the background section allows countries to rate their progress towards each question in the survey by six thresholds which are then averaged to yield an index value for the sdg indicator 6 5 1 similarly it allows for the disaggregation of the index to provide an assessment of the degree of implementation of the four components measured by the survey on iwrm un water 2017e an index variation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 could allow for additional development of the criteria for operationality to identify the state of cooperation and acknowledge what cooperation is occurring for example the criterion for data and information exchange could be separated into levels such as 1 transfer of data 2 data harmonization and 3 joint data collection sdg indicator 6 5 1 presents an interesting comparison to how an index could be developed for sdg indication 6 5 2 7 conclusion the 2030 agenda with target 6 5 and sdg indicator 6 5 2 presents a unique opportunity at the international policy level to promote and measure transboundary cooperation and encourage water diplomacy by building institutional capacity that allows states to adapt and respond to the increasing demands on shared water resources the changing climate and the evolving hydro political context we simulated the calculation of sdg indicator 6 5 2 in two overview analyses a global overview analysis and a national overview analysis of three case studies the results illustrate the high variability in the occurrence of operational cooperation across the globe with countries in europe and africa meeting more of the criteria for operationality in addition operational cooperation occurs more frequently over shared surface waters than over shared aquifers while indicators are useful to inform decision making they can have embedded aspects that support a specific approach or position hezri 2004 it is important for countries agencies and users to recognize the assumptions made in developing the indicator and that it is endogenous to the cooperative processes it is measuring therefore sdg indicator 6 5 2 should not be considered a panacea to improve all efforts towards transboundary cooperation but rather as a reflection of the current positions on thinking surrounding transboundary cooperation from an international development perspective as a result we must recognize the benefits and limitations of sdg indicator 6 5 2 and its framework as a first global step for measuring transboundary water cooperation the discussion in section 5 identifies several benefits including the development of institutional capacity support for international water law and the versatility of aggregation and disaggregation of the indicator similarly several limitations and considerations were demonstrated including oversimplification of the hydro political context normative and procedural criteria exclusion of substantive issues overlooking of informal cooperation non state actors and the role of third parties and the focus on national scale of analysis compared to a basin or aquifer scale finally section 6 discusses a potential way forward as the indicator evolves and adapts during the 15 year sdg time frame in response to country feedback funding

7123,documenting the changing sources of water during high streamflows following rainfall is important for understanding catchment behaviour this study uses tritium 3h major ion concentrations and δ18o values to identify the sources of water that sustained streamflow in the upper yarra and latrobe catchments of southeast australia over two high flow events in march 2016 and august 2016 the variations in geochemistry imply that direct contribution of rainfall to streamflow was minor rather the baseflow that sustained the streams prior to the events was augmented by water derived from the soils or regolith a two component mass balance based on 3h indicates that the soil regolith water constituted 60 100 of total streamflow at the peak of the events a mass balance based on silica yields similar estimates 50 70 the 3h activities of the soil water imply residence times of up to six years these are sufficiently long for evapotranspiration dissolution of organic matter and mineral weathering to increase the major ion concentrations above those of rainfall and for mixing to homogenise δ18o and δ2h values this study helps resolve the paradox that the water contributing to high flow events in streams is commonly not rainfall but is unlikely to be only increased inflows of groundwater due to the time required for hydraulic loading to occur keywords river baseflow tritium geochemistry old water paradox 1 introduction understanding the stores of water that contribute to high flow events in streams and rivers following rainfall has provided a challenge to hydrogeologists for several decades hubert 1969 crouzet et al 1970 sklash and farvolden 1979 kennedy et al 1986 buttle 1994 uhlenbrook et al 2002 kirchner 2003 kienzler and naef 2008 botter et al 2010 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 litt et al 2015 fischer et al 2017a in many catchments baseflow probably consisting of groundwater inflows together with slowly draining water from the unsaturated zone and bank return flows sustains the streams during periods of low flow however the major ion or stable isotope geochemistry of stream water collected over high flow events is commonly inconsistent with the additional streamflow being simply derived from rainfall rather the geochemical variations suggest that older water stored within the catchment is mobilised during these events and contributes significantly to streamflow hence the old water paradox the volume of the water stores are proportional to their residence times maloszewski and zuber 1982 morgenstern et al 2010 hence catchments where streamflows are dominated by old water will contain substantial reservoirs of water in the soils regolith or aquifer systems as streamflow in catchments with large reservoirs is less vulnerable to short term rainfall variations cartwright and morgenstern 2015 understanding the age of the water that sustains the streamflow helps predict catchment responses to rainfall variability the mechanism s that result in the inflows of older water into the stream and the origin s of that water are not well understood buttle 1994 uhlenbrook et al 2002 kirchner 2003 botter et al 2010 groundwater recharge following rainfall plausibly increases the hydraulic head gradient between the regional groundwater and the stream hydraulic loading resulting in higher baseflow fluxes however because recharge rates are generally much slower than the response times of streamflow to rainfall commonly as little as a few hours the effectiveness of hydraulic loading is questionable kirchner 2003 the presence of macropores or fractures may permit rapid recharge in some catchments mcdonnell 1990 groundwater ridging gillham 1984 propagation of pressure waves beven 1981 and transmissivity feedback frei et al 2010 have also been proposed as mechanisms for rapidly increasing groundwater discharge alternatively water from shallower stores within the catchment e g the soils or regolith may be mobilised by the infiltrating rainfall and flow into the stream as either overland flow or interflow pilgrim et al 1979 hooper et al 1990 huth et al 2004 kienzler and naef 2008 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 camacho suarez et al 2015 documenting the changing stores of water during high flow events is important for catchment management shallow water stores are more susceptible to contamination than deeper water stores and if they contribute significantly to streamflow there may be an increase in contaminant loads in the streams at high flows conversely the utilisation of deeper groundwater for irrigation or domestic supply lowers the water table which would reduce the inflows to rivers if hydraulic loading occurred 1 1 catchment water geochemistry groundwater and soil water almost invariably have higher concentrations of major ions than rainfall herczeg and edmunds 2000 mineral dissolution in the soils and aquifers increases the concentrations of the major cations silica and some anions notably bicarbonate and sulfate the breakdown of organic material in the soil zone may result in increased concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon and nitrate in semi arid areas evapotranspiration commonly increases the salinity of the catchment waters and is the main cause of high concentrations of conservative ions such as cl and br the relative importance of these processes may result in the different stores of water having different geochemistry hooper et al 1990 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 for example due to the abundance of organic matter soil water may have higher nitrate concentrations than groundwater individual rainfall events at any location commonly have different δ18o or δ2h values however δ18o or δ2h values of catchment water stores become more homogeneous with increasing residence times as rain from different events mix clark and fritz 1997 stable isotope ratios and major ion concentrations are commonly used to determine the changing sources of water in streams over high flow events sklash and farvolden 1979 kennedy et al 1986 hooper et al 1990 jarvie et al 2001 uhlenbrook et al 2002 kirchner 2003 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 huth et al 2004 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 litt et al 2015 tweed et al 2016 fischer et al 2017a many of these studies have utilised manual or automatic sampling of the stream water typically at intervals of a few hours to days recent analytical advances allow several parameters to be measured continuously time intervals of minutes to hours over extended periods electrical conductivity ec which commonly correlates with the concentration of total dissolved solutes tds or one or more of the major ions is routinely measured using commercially available loggers although more analytically demanding 222rn activities δ18o and δ2h values and many major ion concentrations may also be measured continuously jarvie et al 2001 hofmann et al 2011 tweed et al 2016 von freyberg et al 2017 continuous geochemical records potentially allow a detailed understanding of the changing sources of water as streamflows increase and subsequently decline however care must be exercised to choose parameters that can distinguish between the different water stores 1 2 changing ages of water during high flow events baseflow is the oldest water store that contributes to streamflow whereas water from shallower stores such as the soils and regolith will almost certainly be younger uhlenbrook et al 2002 morgenstern et al 2010 recent rainfall represents the youngest water that may contribute to streamflow thus documenting how the age of water in streams varies over high flow events helps resolve the old water paradox in particular this approach can resolve whether increased inflows of older groundwater or the displacement of younger water from the soils and regolith contribute to streamflows however largely due to difficulties in estimating residence times only a few studies hubert 1969 crouzet et al 1970 kennedy et al 1986 hofmann et al 2018 have attempted this tritium 3h with a half life of 12 32 years is part of the water molecule in contrast to solute tracers such as 14c or 32si 3h activities are little affected by the dissolution of minerals or organic matter in the soil zone additionally unlike the dissolved gas tracers e g 3he chlorofluorocarbons or sf6 3h activities are not altered by contact with the atmosphere thus 3h activities may be used to estimate residence times of surface water water from the unsaturated zone or groundwater where these are 100 years clark and fritz 1997 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 morgenstern et al 2010 water flow paths within catchments have varying lengths and water sampled from the aquifers soils regolith or the streams has a range of transit or residence times rather than a discrete age maloszewski and zuber 1982 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 even if flow paths are close to being parallel e g in a confined aquifer macroscopic dispersion results in water samples having a range of residence times lumped parameter models describe the tracer concentrations and residence time distributions in homogeneous aquifers with simplified geometries and uniform recharge rates maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 jurgens et al 2012 if the tracer input is known these models allow the mean transit or residence times of water from within the catchment to be estimated while not a catchment specific flow model this approach is invaluable in estimating the timescales of water flow in catchments using 3h to estimate residence times is currently more straightforward in the southern hemisphere rainfall 3h activities peaked in the 1950s 1960s due to the production of 3h in atmospheric thermonuclear tests the 3h bomb pulse because of the much lower bomb pulse 3h activities in the southern hemisphere international atomic energy agency 2017 the 3h activities of remnant bomb pulse waters are now generally below those of modern rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 this situation enables residence or transit times to be estimated from individual samples in an analogous manner to how tracers such as 14c are used in regional groundwater by contrast the use of 3h to estimate transit times in the northern hemisphere currently requires time series data uncertainties in the 3h activity of recharge mixing of water following different flow paths within a catchment and differences between the geometry of the lumped parameter models and the real flow systems result in uncertainties in calculated transit times kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a b cartwright et al 2018 however because the bomb pulse 3h has largely declined southern hemisphere water with lower 3h activities is older than water with higher 3h activities this is invaluable as it allows relative transit times to be established which permits assessment of the contribution of older and younger water over high flow events 1 3 objectives here we use 3h together with other geochemical tracers to assess the changing sources of water in three headwater streams in southeast australia during two high flow events generated by rainfall specifically we test the hypothesis that the water contributing to these events is derived from stores within the catchment but is not simply increased inflows of baseflow thus we predict that there will not be a simple dilution of the major ion geochemistry of the stream water over these events but that the 3h activities will be higher at high streamflows additionally we assess which tracers are useful in discerning the changing water stores during high flow events while this study is based on a specific area the results are of broad relevance to catchments globally 2 study area the study is based in the headwater streams of the latrobe and yarra catchments of southeast australia fig 1 that are described in more detail by cartwright et al 2018 this part of the upper yarra catchment drains the eastern slopes of the dandenong ranges average rainfall is 750 1000 mm yr 1 and average evapotranspiration rates are 500 600 mm yr 1 bureau of meteorology 2017 higher rainfall and lower evapotranspiration results in higher streamflows during the winter months department of environment land water and planning 2017 many of the streams in the upper latrobe and yarra catchments are perennial and continued to flow even through drought years department of environment land water and planning 2017 this implies that long lived water stores in the catchments sustains streamflows during low flow periods using 3h activities cartwright et al 2018 estimated that this baseflow input had a mean transit time of several years to decades the geology of the upper yarra catchment includes a basement of indurated silurian devonian turbidites and granitic rocks overlain by thin devonian calcareous sandstones and tertiary basalts energy and earth resources 2017 tweed et al 2005 thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along the streams groundwater flow is hosted in fractures and weathered zones of the indurated rocks and in the more permeable layers of the basalts and sediments tweed et al 2005 the upper yarra catchment has been largely cleared for agriculture and current landuse includes dairying horticulture vineyards and grazing together with scattered low density residential developments melbourne water 2014 the upper latrobe streams drain the southern slopes of the yarra ranges fig 1 annual rainfall in upper latrobe catchment is between 1100 and 1400 mm yr 1 and average evapotranspiration rates are 500 600 mm yr 1 bureau of meteorology 2017 again due to the higher rainfall and lower evapotranspiration in winter streamflows in this catchment are generally higher in winter department of environment land water and planning 2017 the geology of the upper latrobe catchment is similar to that of the upper yarra catchment silurian devonian granitic rocks and metamorphosed turbidities are the predominant lithologies and these host groundwater flow mainly in weathered zones and fractures energy and earth resources 2017 thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along the major streams and there are minor outcrops of tertiary basalt by contrast with the upper yarra catchment the upper latrobe catchment is dominated by native eucalypt forest much of it in the alpine national park additionally there are plantation forests mainly along the loch valley and zones of mixed agriculture including dairying vineyards and grazing around noojee southern rural water 2014 3 methods 3 1 sampling stream samples were collected over two high flow events from two sites in the upper latrobe catchment the latrobe river at noojee and the loch river at noojee and one site in the upper yarra catchment woori yallock creek at woori yallock supplement fig 1 the march 2016 event represents a discrete high flow event at the end of the austral summer while the august 2016 samples were collected over a high flow event during winter when streamflows were generally higher due to the logistics of sampling the first samples in both events were collected on rather than before the rising limb of the hydrographs sampling times are denoted as australian eastern daylight savings time utc 9 00 in march and australian eastern standard time utc 10

lysimeters inserted at depths of 50 70 cm from three sites near noojee because of the low extraction rates these samples were collected periodically over several weeks major ion concentrations and stable isotope ratios were measured on the individual soil water samples and 3h activities measured on the aggregated samples 3 2 geochemical analyses a continuous 60 min interval electrical conductivity ec record was generated for the latrobe river at noojee for the march 2016 event using a winsitu aqua troll 200 logger ec values were also measured at the time of sampling using a

counters following vacuum distillation and electrolytic enrichment morgenstern and taylor 2009 3h activities are expressed in tritium units tu where 1 tu represents a 3h 1h ratio of 1 10 18 tritium enrichment by a factor of 95 yields a detection limit of 0 02 tu and deuterium calibration of each sample ensures a 1 reproducibility of tritium enrichment relative precision 1σ of individual analyses

small falls between 19 03 2016 and 30 03 2016 fig 2 at woori yallock 43 8 mm of rainfall was recorded between 04 00 18 03 2016 and 07 30 19 03 2016 with an additional 0 6 mm between 19 03 2016 and 30 03 2016 streamflow at all three sites increased from approximately 06 00 18 03 2016 and peaked between 00 00 19 03 2016 and 10 30 19 03 2016 the increase in streamflows were from 1 75 104 to 1 57 105

23rd to 25th march with those in the loch river declining more rapidly than at the other two sites the rainfall that generated the august 2016 event fell over a longer period than in march 2016 fig 2b rainfall totals at noojee between 29 07 2016 and 12 08 2016 were 60 4 mm with 41 8 mm falling between 31 07 2016 and 03 08 2016 rainfall totals at woori yallock were 43 8 mm between 31 07 2016 and 03 08 2016 with 56 4 mm falling between 29 07 2016 and 12 08 2016 streamflows increased from approximately 06 00 01 08 2016 to 12 00 01 08 2016 and peaked between 07 00 02 08 2016 loch river and 18 15 02

the ec values of the august 2016 rainfall were 23 2 μs cm 1 and cl no3 and si concentrations were 2 38 0 44 and 0 07 mg l 1 respectively the soil waters had higher ec values and major ion concentrations than rainfall supplement fig 3 ec values were 66 3 80 4 μs cm 1 average 71 6 4 6 median 70 5 μs cm 1 cl concentrations were 12 0 16 0 mg l 1 average 14 0 1 1 median 13 8 mg l 1 no3

increased marginally from 60 to 65 μs cm 1 at the start of the march 2016 event to 65 to 70 μs cm 1 approximately three days after the peak streamflows and subsequently declined to pre event values

and loch rivers varied little over the two events supplement fig 3a b in march 2016 cl concentrations varied between 10 1 and 12 1 mg l 1 and were highest during the higher streamflows similar to the continuous ec variations in august 2016 cl concentrations varied between 9 9 and 11 3 mg l 1 with the lowest concentrations recorded during the high streamflows by contrast cl na mg2 ca2 and k concentrations in woori yallock creek decreased by several mg l 1 during both events supplement figs 3 and 4 for example cl concentrations decreased from 78 7 to 32 8 mg l 1 in march 2016 and 53 5 to

of melbourne rainfall 5 6 and 32 international atomic energy agency 2017 the δ18o value of the march 2016 rainfall was 7 3 fig 3i the δ18o values of stream water during the march 2016 event varied from 6 1 to 5 6 latrobe river 6 2 to 5 7 loch river and 4 7 to 4 4 woori yallock creek fig 3i despite being initially higher than the rainfall the δ18o values of the latrobe and loch rivers increased during the march event before returning to pre event values by contrast the δ18o values of woori yallock creek decreased during the event the δ18o value of the august 2016 rainfall was 4 8 fig 3j the δ18o values of the latrobe and loch rivers increased slightly during the august event from 6 6 to 6 4 to 6 1 to 6 0 whereas in woori yallock creek they varied irregularly between 5 1 and 5 3 fig 3j 4 4 tritium activities the expected present day annual 3h activity of rainfall in this region interpolated from the data of tadros et al 2014 is between 2 6 and 3 0 tu in agreement with that prediction the 3h activity of an annual rainfall sample from yarra junction fig 1 was 2 76 tu cartwright et al 2018 the 3h activity of the march 2016 rainfall was 3 15 tu which is higher than the annual average 3h activity figs 3 and 4 the 3h activities of the streams during the march event varied from 1 52 to 2 40 tu latrobe river 1 44 to 2 28 tu loch river and 1 42 to 1 88 tu woori yallock creek and are broadly correlated with streamflow fig 5 a due to the first sampling round occurring on the rising limb of the hydrograph the lowest 3h activities were recorded when streamflows had declined to pre event values the lowest 3h activities are similar to those recorded at similar streamflows at these sites in april 2015 figs 3 5 there are similar variations in 3h activities with streamflow in august 2016 fig 5b 3h activities in the streams varied from 1 89 to 2 19 tu latrobe river 1 94 to 2 14 tu loch river and 2 01 to 2 58 tu woori yallock creek with the lowest activities again recorded on the receding limb of the hydrograph as with the march 2016 event the lowest 3h activities in august 2016 are similar to those at comparable streamflows in august 2015 figs 3 5 by contrast with march 2016 the 3h activity of the august 2016 rainfall sample was 2 16 tu which is lower than the highest 3h activities in the streams and significantly lower than that of average annual rainfall in this region the 3h activities of the soil water vary between 2 25 and 2 71 tu figs 3 5 these are lower than those of average rainfall but overlap with the highest 3h activities of the stream water 5 discussion the combined geochemical data allow the changing water stores that contribute to these streams during the high flow events to be understood 5 1 changing sources of water the increase in 3h activities during the high flow events confirms that the higher streamflows were not generated solely by increased baseflow but were augmented by the addition of younger water especially in the latrobe and loch rivers there was no reduction in the concentrations of many of the major ions e g cl or ec values that would be expected if substantial quantities of rainfall contributed to streamflow at those times additionally the increase in δ18o values in march 2016 is opposite to the trend expected if inflow of significant rainfall had occurred the 3h activity of the august 2016 rainfall was lower than the highest 3h activity recorded in the streams which again is not consistent with a significant contribution of that rainfall to the higher streamflows the changes to the 3h activities δ18o values and no3 and si concentrations in the streams are better explained by the influx of water from the soils or regolith figs 3 and 4 the cl ca2 k and na concentrations and the ec values of the soil water are similar to those in the latrobe and loch rivers at baseflow conditions supplement which would account for the observation that their concentrations remained relatively constant over the events the sources of water in woori yallock creek are more difficult to constrain firstly the soil water samples were from the upper latrobe catchment and soil water geochemistry in the upper yarra catchment may be different secondly the considerable reduction of ec values and major ion concentrations during the events is consistent with the inflow of either rainfall or soil water however the increase in no3 concentrations and the observation that the 3h activities of woori yallock creek in august were again occasionally higher than those of the rainfall suggests that the inflow of water from the soils or regolith is more likely the changing proportions of soil or regolith water and baseflow contributing to streamflow was estimated from the 3h activities and si concentrations for the march 2016 event in the latrobe and loch rivers using eq 1 fig 6 it was assumed that the 3h activities and si concentrations of the baseflow were those recorded on 30 03 2016 i e following the event as noted above the first samples were collected after streamflows had started to increase and thus probably do not represent the baseflow geochemistry the 3h activities and major ion geochemistry of the 30 03 2016 samples are similar to those recorded at similar streamflows at these sites in 2015 figs 3 5 that represent baseflow conditions cartwright et al 2018 for soil water 3h activities of 2 25 to 2 71 tu the estimated proportion of soil or regolith water is 0 65 1 0 at the highest streamflows the estimated proportions of soil or regolith water over the march 2016 event estimated from the si concentrations are slightly lower 0 52 0 71 given that the 3h activities and si concentrations in the soil water are locally variable and there are uncertainties in their mean values there is good agreement between these tracers the calculations imply that the younger shallower store of water contributes to streamflow for several days after the high flow events 5 2 residence times of baseflow and soil water using 3h activities and lumped parameter models cartwright et al 2018 estimated that the mean residence times of baseflow that sustains these streams between high flow events were 7 36 years in winter and 16 62 years in summer the soil waters have 3h activities of 2 25 2 71 tu that are lower than those of average annual rainfall in this area tadros et al 2014 cartwright et al 2018 given that there are only three samples it is difficult to estimate precise residence times for the soil waters if the rainfall has a 3h activity of 2 8 tu a simple age calculation based on piston flow through the soil i e not accounting for variable length flow paths dispersion or mixing yields residence times of 0 6 4 1 years substantially similar residence times are estimated using lumped parameter models if soil waters infiltrated vertically residence times may be calculated using the dispersion lumped parameter model that is based on the one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation maloszewski 2000 jurgens et al 2012 using the same approach as cartwright et al 2018 residence times calculated using the tracerlpm excel workbook jurgens et al 2012 with the 3h activities of local rainfall as the input function and a dispersion parameter of 0 1 which is appropriate for metre scale flow systems maloszewski 2000 are 0 5 4 5 years other lumped parameter models yield almost identical estimates while insensitive to the assumed geometry of flow the calculated residence times are sensitive to the 3h activity of modern rainfall cartwright et al 2018 the likely range of 3h activities of modern rainfall in these catchments is between 2 6 and 3 0 tu tadros et al 2014 adopting a 3h activity of 3 0 tu results in mean residence times of 1 8 5 9 years whereas the mean residence times are up to 2 7 years if the 3h activity is 2 6 tu the conclusion that residence times of the soil water are a few years is consistent with the stable isotope and major ion geochemistry the monthly variation of rainfall δ18o values in melbourne is 14 international atomic energy agency 2017 whereas the δ18o values of the soil water are much more homogeneous 5 42 0 34 hence residence times must be sufficiently long for mixing of water from several rain events with different δ18o values to have occurred similarly the concentrations of the major ions in the soil water are significantly higher than those of rainfall cl concentrations of water in the soils regolith or aquifers in southeast australia most likely increase due to evapotranspiration whereas cation and si concentrations increase due to a combination of evapotranspiration and mineral dissolution herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2005 cartwright et al 2018 thus the soil water must have been present in the catchment sufficiently long for those processes to occur 6 conclusions the variations in geochemistry of the headwater streams in the upper yarra and latrobe catchments imply that the displacement of water from the soils or regolith occurred during the high flow events following rainfall displacement of soil or regolith water occurred during both the late summer and winter events suggesting that this behaviour is common in these catchments while the soil water is substantially younger than baseflow it has a residence time of a few years the influx of water that is chemically distinct from both baseflow and rainfall during high flow events has been documented in other catchments pilgrim et al 1979 hooper et al 1990 huth et al 2004 kienzler and naef 2008 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 camacho suarez et al 2015 if these water stores have long residence times it implies that their storage volumes are also high while little work has been done on estimating residence times the decline of the residual bomb pulse 3h activities will make this more feasible the results have implications for protection and management of these catchments contamination of shallow water stores is common especially by nitrate in agricultural areas mobilisation of these shallow water stores by rainfall may result in the transport of contaminants to the stream by contrast any contaminants in deeper groundwater will likely impact the streams mainly during low streamflows similarly groundwater pumping will mainly impact the low streamflows rather than the higher streamflows following rainfall this study also highlights that integration of several tracers are required to understand the contribution of the various water stores in this study stable isotope ratios and ec values which may be routinely measured continuously were not particularly informative in understanding the changing sources of water during the high flow events as with many studies that have invoked the displacement of water from within the catchments during high flow events the mechanism s by which this occurs are not clear kirchner 2003 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 macropores such as soil pipes or rotted tree roots are common in the unsaturated zone of upland areas and may provide pathways through which flow can be mobilised following storm events mcdonnell 1990 jones 1997 the presence of low hydraulic conductivity layers within the soils or regolith may also promote rapid lateral flow by allowing zones of saturation to develop klaus and mcdonnell 2013 mobilisation of near surface water stores may also be promoted by high antecedent wetness and soils with limited storage capacity huth et al 2004 kienzler and naef 2008 fischer et al 2017a b the poor understanding of the mechanisms that cause the mobilisation of catchment waters is due to few studies simultaneously examining stream water geochemistry and water mobilisation on hillslopes integrating such studies will allow a better understand

7123,documenting the changing sources of water during high streamflows following rainfall is important for understanding catchment behaviour this study uses tritium 3h major ion concentrations and δ18o values to identify the sources of water that sustained streamflow in the upper yarra and latrobe catchments of southeast australia over two high flow events in march 2016 and august 2016 the variations in geochemistry imply that direct contribution of rainfall to streamflow was minor rather the baseflow that sustained the streams prior to the events was augmented by water derived from the soils or regolith a two component mass balance based on 3h indicates that the soil regolith water constituted 60 100 of total streamflow at the peak of the events a mass balance based on silica yields similar estimates 50 70 the 3h activities of the soil water imply residence times of up to six years these are sufficiently long for evapotranspiration dissolution of organic matter and mineral weathering to increase the major ion concentrations above those of rainfall and for mixing to homogenise δ18o and δ2h values this study helps resolve the paradox that the water contributing to high flow events in streams is commonly not rainfall but is unlikely to be only increased inflows of groundwater due to the time required for hydraulic loading to occur keywords river baseflow tritium geochemistry old water paradox 1 introduction understanding the stores of water that contribute to high flow events in streams and rivers following rainfall has provided a challenge to hydrogeologists for several decades hubert 1969 crouzet et al 1970 sklash and farvolden 1979 kennedy et al 1986 buttle 1994 uhlenbrook et al 2002 kirchner 2003 kienzler and naef 2008 botter et al 2010 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 litt et al 2015 fischer et al 2017a in many catchments baseflow probably consisting of groundwater inflows together with slowly draining water from the unsaturated zone and bank return flows sustains the streams during periods of low flow however the major ion or stable isotope geochemistry of stream water collected over high flow events is commonly inconsistent with the additional streamflow being simply derived from rainfall rather the geochemical variations suggest that older water stored within the catchment is mobilised during these events and contributes significantly to streamflow hence the old water paradox the volume of the water stores are proportional to their residence times maloszewski and zuber 1982 morgenstern et al 2010 hence catchments where streamflows are dominated by old water will contain substantial reservoirs of water in the soils regolith or aquifer systems as streamflow in catchments with large reservoirs is less vulnerable to short term rainfall variations cartwright and morgenstern 2015 understanding the age of the water that sustains the streamflow helps predict catchment responses to rainfall variability the mechanism s that result in the inflows of older water into the stream and the origin s of that water are not well understood buttle 1994 uhlenbrook et al 2002 kirchner 2003 botter et al 2010 groundwater recharge following rainfall plausibly increases the hydraulic head gradient between the regional groundwater and the stream hydraulic loading resulting in higher baseflow fluxes however because recharge rates are generally much slower than the response times of streamflow to rainfall commonly as little as a few hours the effectiveness of hydraulic loading is questionable kirchner 2003 the presence of macropores or fractures may permit rapid recharge in some catchments mcdonnell 1990 groundwater ridging gillham 1984 propagation of pressure waves beven 1981 and transmissivity feedback frei et al 2010 have also been proposed as mechanisms for rapidly increasing groundwater discharge alternatively water from shallower stores within the catchment e g the soils or regolith may be mobilised by the infiltrating rainfall and flow into the stream as either overland flow or interflow pilgrim et al 1979 hooper et al 1990 huth et al 2004 kienzler and naef 2008 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 camacho suarez et al 2015 documenting the changing stores of water during high flow events is important for catchment management shallow water stores are more susceptible to contamination than deeper water stores and if they contribute significantly to streamflow there may be an increase in contaminant loads in the streams at high flows conversely the utilisation of deeper groundwater for irrigation or domestic supply lowers the water table which would reduce the inflows to rivers if hydraulic loading occurred 1 1 catchment water geochemistry groundwater and soil water almost invariably have higher concentrations of major ions than rainfall herczeg and edmunds 2000 mineral dissolution in the soils and aquifers increases the concentrations of the major cations silica and some anions notably bicarbonate and sulfate the breakdown of organic material in the soil zone may result in increased concentrations of dissolved inorganic and organic carbon and nitrate in semi arid areas evapotranspiration commonly increases the salinity of the catchment waters and is the main cause of high concentrations of conservative ions such as cl and br the relative importance of these processes may result in the different stores of water having different geochemistry hooper et al 1990 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 for example due to the abundance of organic matter soil water may have higher nitrate concentrations than groundwater individual rainfall events at any location commonly have different δ18o or δ2h values however δ18o or δ2h values of catchment water stores become more homogeneous with increasing residence times as rain from different events mix clark and fritz 1997 stable isotope ratios and major ion concentrations are commonly used to determine the changing sources of water in streams over high flow events sklash and farvolden 1979 kennedy et al 1986 hooper et al 1990 jarvie et al 2001 uhlenbrook et al 2002 kirchner 2003 uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 huth et al 2004 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 litt et al 2015 tweed et al 2016 fischer et al 2017a many of these studies have utilised manual or automatic sampling of the stream water typically at intervals of a few hours to days recent analytical advances allow several parameters to be measured continuously time intervals of minutes to hours over extended periods electrical conductivity ec which commonly correlates with the concentration of total dissolved solutes tds or one or more of the major ions is routinely measured using commercially available loggers although more analytically demanding 222rn activities δ18o and δ2h values and many major ion concentrations may also be measured continuously jarvie et al 2001 hofmann et al 2011 tweed et al 2016 von freyberg et al 2017 continuous geochemical records potentially allow a detailed understanding of the changing sources of water as streamflows increase and subsequently decline however care must be exercised to choose parameters that can distinguish between the different water stores 1 2 changing ages of water during high flow events baseflow is the oldest water store that contributes to streamflow whereas water from shallower stores such as the soils and regolith will almost certainly be younger uhlenbrook et al 2002 morgenstern et al 2010 recent rainfall represents the youngest water that may contribute to streamflow thus documenting how the age of water in streams varies over high flow events helps resolve the old water paradox in particular this approach can resolve whether increased inflows of older groundwater or the displacement of younger water from the soils and regolith contribute to streamflows however largely due to difficulties in estimating residence times only a few studies hubert 1969 crouzet et al 1970 kennedy et al 1986 hofmann et al 2018 have attempted this tritium 3h with a half life of 12 32 years is part of the water molecule in contrast to solute tracers such as 14c or 32si 3h activities are little affected by the dissolution of minerals or organic matter in the soil zone additionally unlike the dissolved gas tracers e g 3he chlorofluorocarbons or sf6 3h activities are not altered by contact with the atmosphere thus 3h activities may be used to estimate residence times of surface water water from the unsaturated zone or groundwater where these are 100 years clark and fritz 1997 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 morgenstern et al 2010 water flow paths within catchments have varying lengths and water sampled from the aquifers soils regolith or the streams has a range of transit or residence times rather than a discrete age maloszewski and zuber 1982 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 even if flow paths are close to being parallel e g in a confined aquifer macroscopic dispersion results in water samples having a range of residence times lumped parameter models describe the tracer concentrations and residence time distributions in homogeneous aquifers with simplified geometries and uniform recharge rates maloszewski 2000 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 jurgens et al 2012 if the tracer input is known these models allow the mean transit or residence times of water from within the catchment to be estimated while not a catchment specific flow model this approach is invaluable in estimating the timescales of water flow in catchments using 3h to estimate residence times is currently more straightforward in the southern hemisphere rainfall 3h activities peaked in the 1950s 1960s due to the production of 3h in atmospheric thermonuclear tests the 3h bomb pulse because of the much lower bomb pulse 3h activities in the southern hemisphere international atomic energy agency 2017 the 3h activities of remnant bomb pulse waters are now generally below those of modern rainfall morgenstern et al 2010 this situation enables residence or transit times to be estimated from individual samples in an analogous manner to how tracers such as 14c are used in regional groundwater by contrast the use of 3h to estimate transit times in the northern hemisphere currently requires time series data uncertainties in the 3h activity of recharge mixing of water following different flow paths within a catchment and differences between the geometry of the lumped parameter models and the real flow systems result in uncertainties in calculated transit times kirchner 2016 stewart et al 2017 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 2016a b cartwright et al 2018 however because the bomb pulse 3h has largely declined southern hemisphere water with lower 3h activities is older than water with higher 3h activities this is invaluable as it allows relative transit times to be established which permits assessment of the contribution of older and younger water over high flow events 1 3 objectives here we use 3h together with other geochemical tracers to assess the changing sources of water in three headwater streams in southeast australia during two high flow events generated by rainfall specifically we test the hypothesis that the water contributing to these events is derived from stores within the catchment but is not simply increased inflows of baseflow thus we predict that there will not be a simple dilution of the major ion geochemistry of the stream water over these events but that the 3h activities will be higher at high streamflows additionally we assess which tracers are useful in discerning the changing water stores during high flow events while this study is based on a specific area the results are of broad relevance to catchments globally 2 study area the study is based in the headwater streams of the latrobe and yarra catchments of southeast australia fig 1 that are described in more detail by cartwright et al 2018 this part of the upper yarra catchment drains the eastern slopes of the dandenong ranges average rainfall is 750 1000 mm yr 1 and average evapotranspiration rates are 500 600 mm yr 1 bureau of meteorology 2017 higher rainfall and lower evapotranspiration results in higher streamflows during the winter months department of environment land water and planning 2017 many of the streams in the upper latrobe and yarra catchments are perennial and continued to flow even through drought years department of environment land water and planning 2017 this implies that long lived water stores in the catchments sustains streamflows during low flow periods using 3h activities cartwright et al 2018 estimated that this baseflow input had a mean transit time of several years to decades the geology of the upper yarra catchment includes a basement of indurated silurian devonian turbidites and granitic rocks overlain by thin devonian calcareous sandstones and tertiary basalts energy and earth resources 2017 tweed et al 2005 thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along the streams groundwater flow is hosted in fractures and weathered zones of the indurated rocks and in the more permeable layers of the basalts and sediments tweed et al 2005 the upper yarra catchment has been largely cleared for agriculture and current landuse includes dairying horticulture vineyards and grazing together with scattered low density residential developments melbourne water 2014 the upper latrobe streams drain the southern slopes of the yarra ranges fig 1 annual rainfall in upper latrobe catchment is between 1100 and 1400 mm yr 1 and average evapotranspiration rates are 500 600 mm yr 1 bureau of meteorology 2017 again due to the higher rainfall and lower evapotranspiration in winter streamflows in this catchment are generally higher in winter department of environment land water and planning 2017 the geology of the upper latrobe catchment is similar to that of the upper yarra catchment silurian devonian granitic rocks and metamorphosed turbidities are the predominant lithologies and these host groundwater flow mainly in weathered zones and fractures energy and earth resources 2017 thin deposits of recent alluvial sediments occur along the major streams and there are minor outcrops of tertiary basalt by contrast with the upper yarra catchment the upper latrobe catchment is dominated by native eucalypt forest much of it in the alpine national park additionally there are plantation forests mainly along the loch valley and zones of mixed agriculture including dairying vineyards and grazing around

river at noojee and one site in the upper yarra catchment woori yallock creek at woori yallock supplement fig 1 the march 2016 event represents a discrete high flow event at the end of the austral summer while the august 2016 samples were collected over a high flow event during winter when streamflows were generally higher due to the logistics of sampling the first samples in both events were

during the march event before returning to pre event values by contrast the δ18o values of woori yallock creek decreased during the event the δ18o value of the august 2016 rainfall was 4 8 fig 3j the δ18o values of the latrobe and loch rivers increased slightly during the august event from 6 6 to 6 4 to 6 1 to 6 0 whereas in woori yallock creek they varied irregularly between 5 1 and 5 3 fig 3j 4 4 tritium activities the expected present day annual 3h activity of rainfall in this region interpolated from the data of tadros et al 2014 is between 2 6 and 3 0 tu in agreement with that prediction the 3h activity of an annual rainfall sample from yarra junction fig 1 was 2 76 tu cartwright et al 2018 the 3h activity of the march 2016 rainfall was 3 15 tu which is higher than the annual average 3h activity figs 3 and 4 the 3h activities of the streams during the march event varied from 1 52 to 2 40 tu latrobe river 1 44 to 2 28 tu loch river and 1 42 to 1 88 tu woori yallock creek and are broadly correlated with streamflow fig 5 a due to the first sampling round occurring on the rising limb of the hydrograph the lowest 3h activities were recorded when streamflows had declined to pre event values the lowest 3h activities are similar to those recorded at similar streamflows at these sites in april 2015 figs 3 5 there are similar variations in 3h activities with streamflow in august 2016 fig 5b 3h activities in the streams varied from 1 89 to 2 19 tu latrobe river 1 94 to 2 14 tu loch river and 2 01 to 2 58 tu woori yallock creek with the lowest activities again recorded on the receding limb of the hydrograph as with the march 2016 event the lowest 3h activities in august 2016 are similar to those at comparable streamflows in august 2015 figs 3 5 by contrast with march 2016 the 3h activity of the august 2016 rainfall sample was 2 16 tu which is lower than the highest 3h activities in the streams and significantly lower than that of average annual rainfall in this region the 3h activities of the soil water vary between 2 25 and 2 71 tu figs 3 5 these are lower than those of average rainfall but overlap with the highest 3h activities of the stream water 5 discussion the combined geochemical data allow the changing water stores that contribute to these streams during the high flow events to be understood 5 1 changing sources of water the increase in 3h activities during the high flow events confirms that the higher streamflows were not generated solely by increased baseflow but were augmented by the addition of younger water especially in the latrobe and loch rivers there was no reduction in the concentrations of many of the major ions e g cl or ec values that would be expected if substantial quantities of rainfall contributed to streamflow at those times additionally the increase in δ18o values in march 2016 is opposite to the trend expected if inflow of significant rainfall had occurred the 3h activity of the august 2016 rainfall was lower than the highest 3h activity recorded in the streams which again is not consistent with a significant contribution of that rainfall to the higher streamflows the changes to the 3h activities δ18o values and no3 and si concentrations in the streams are better explained by the influx of water from the soils or regolith figs 3 and 4 the cl ca2 k and na concentrations and the ec values of the soil water are similar to those in the latrobe and loch rivers at baseflow conditions supplement which would account for the observation that their concentrations remained relatively constant over the events the sources of water in woori yallock creek are more difficult to constrain firstly the soil water samples were from the upper latrobe catchment and soil water geochemistry in the upper yarra catchment may be different secondly the considerable reduction of ec values and major ion concentrations during the events is consistent with the inflow of either rainfall or soil water however the increase in no3 concentrations and the observation that the 3h activities of woori yallock creek in august were again occasionally higher than those of the rainfall suggests that the inflow of water from the soils or regolith is more likely the changing proportions of soil or regolith water and baseflow contributing to streamflow was estimated from the 3h activities and si concentrations for the march 2016 event in the latrobe and loch rivers using eq 1 fig 6 it was assumed that the 3h activities and si concentrations of the baseflow were those recorded on 30 03 2016 i e following the event as noted above the first samples were collected after streamflows had started to increase and thus probably do not represent the baseflow geochemistry the 3h activities and major ion geochemistry of the 30 03 2016 samples are similar to those recorded at similar streamflows at these sites in 2015 figs 3 5 that represent baseflow conditions cartwright et al 2018 for soil water 3h activities of 2 25 to 2 71 tu the estimated proportion of soil or regolith water is 0 65 1 0 at the highest streamflows the estimated proportions of soil or regolith water over the march 2016 event estimated from the si concentrations are slightly lower 0 52 0 71 given that the 3h activities and si concentrations in the soil water are locally variable and there are uncertainties in their mean values there is good agreement between these tracers the calculations imply that the younger shallower store of water contributes to streamflow for several days after the high flow events 5 2 residence times of baseflow and soil water using 3h activities and lumped parameter models cartwright et al 2018 estimated that the mean residence times of baseflow that sustains these streams between high flow events were 7 36 years in winter and 16 62 years in summer the soil waters have 3h activities of 2 25 2 71 tu that are lower than those of average annual rainfall in this area tadros et al 2014 cartwright et al 2018 given that there are only three samples it is difficult to estimate precise residence times for the soil waters if the rainfall has a 3h activity of 2 8 tu a simple age calculation based on piston flow through the soil i e not accounting for variable length flow paths dispersion or mixing yields residence times of 0 6 4 1 years substantially similar residence times are estimated using lumped parameter models if soil waters infiltrated vertically residence times may be calculated using the dispersion lumped parameter model that is based on the one dimensional advection dispersion transport equation maloszewski 2000 jurgens et al 2012 using the same approach as cartwright et al 2018 residence times calculated using the tracerlpm excel workbook jurgens et al 2012 with the 3h activities of local rainfall as the input function and a dispersion parameter of 0 1 which is appropriate for metre scale flow systems maloszewski 2000 are 0 5 4 5 years other lumped parameter models yield almost identical estimates while insensitive to the assumed geometry of flow the calculated residence times are sensitive to the 3h activity of modern rainfall cartwright et al 2018 the likely range of 3h activities of modern rainfall in these catchments is between 2 6 and 3 0 tu tadros et al 2014 adopting a 3h activity of 3 0 tu results in mean residence times of 1 8 5 9 years whereas the mean residence times are up to 2 7 years if the 3h activity is 2 6 tu the conclusion that residence times of the soil water are a few years is consistent with the stable isotope and major ion geochemistry the monthly variation of rainfall δ18o values in melbourne is 14 international atomic energy agency 2017 whereas the δ18o values of the soil water are much more homogeneous 5 42 0 34 hence residence times must be sufficiently long for mixing of water from several rain events with different δ18o values to have occurred similarly the concentrations of the major ions in the soil water are significantly higher than those of rainfall cl concentrations of water in the soils regolith or aquifers in southeast australia most likely increase due to evapotranspiration whereas cation and si concentrations increase due to a combination of evapotranspiration and mineral dissolution herczeg et al 2001 tweed et al 2005 cartwright et al 2018 thus the soil water must have been present in the catchment sufficiently long for those processes to occur 6 conclusions the variations in geochemistry of the headwater streams in the upper yarra and latrobe catchments imply that the displacement of water from the soils or regolith occurred during the high flow events following rainfall displacement of soil or regolith water occurred during both the late summer and winter events suggesting that this behaviour is common in these catchments while the soil water is substantially younger than baseflow it has a residence time of a few years the influx of water that is chemically distinct from both baseflow and rainfall during high flow events has been documented in other catchments pilgrim et al 1979 hooper et al 1990 huth et al 2004 kienzler and naef 2008 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 camacho suarez et al 2015 if these water stores have long residence times it implies that their storage volumes are also high while little work has been done on estimating residence times the decline of the residual bomb pulse 3h activities will make this more feasible the results have implications for protection and management of these catchments contamination of shallow water stores is common especially by nitrate in agricultural areas mobilisation of these shallow water stores by rainfall may result in the transport of contaminants to the stream by contrast any contaminants in deeper groundwater will likely impact the streams mainly during low streamflows similarly groundwater pumping will mainly impact the low streamflows rather than the higher streamflows following rainfall this study also highlights that integration of several tracers are required to understand the contribution of the various water stores in this study stable isotope ratios and ec values which may be routinely measured continuously were not particularly informative in understanding the changing sources of water during the high flow events as with many studies that have invoked the displacement of water from within the catchments during high flow events the mechanism s by which this occurs are not clear kirchner 2003 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 macropores such as soil pipes or rotted tree roots are common in the unsaturated zone of upland areas and may provide pathways through which flow can be mobilised following storm events mcdonnell 1990 jones 1997 the presence of low hydraulic conductivity layers within the soils or regolith may also promote rapid lateral flow by allowing zones of saturation to develop klaus and mcdonnell 2013 mobilisation of near surface water stores may also be promoted by high antecedent wetness and soils with limited storage capacity huth et al 2004 kienzler and naef 2008 fischer et al 2017a b the poor understanding of the mechanisms that cause the mobilisation of catchment waters is due to few studies simultaneously examining stream water geochemistry and water mobilisation on hillslopes integrating such studies will allow a better understand

7124,the future resilience of water supply systems is unprecedentedly challenged by non stationary processes such as fast population growth and a changing climate a thorough understanding of how these non stationarities impact water supply resilience is vital to support sustainable decision making particularly for large cities in arid and or semi arid regions in this study a novel modeling framework which integrates hydrological processes and water management was established over a representative water limited metropolitan area to evaluate the impacts of water availability and water demand on reservoir storage and water supply reliability in this framework climate change induced drought events were selected from statistically downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 outputs under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 scenario while future water demand was estimated by the product of projected future population and per capita water use compared with the first half of the 21st century 2000 2049 reservoir storage and water supply reliability during the second half century 2050 2099 are projected to reduce by 16 1 and 14 2 respectively while both future multi year droughts and population growth will lower water supply resilience the uncertainty associated with future climate projection is larger than that associated with urbanization to reduce the drought risks a combination of mitigation strategies e g additional conservation integrating new water sources and water use redistribution was found to be the most efficient approach and can significantly improve water supply reliability by as much as 15 9 keywords water supply resilience non stationarity droughts climate change demand growth 1 introduction resilient water supply systems are critical for urban socio economic development to be classified as resilient a water supply system should not respond precipitously to a major surprise during its economic life fiering 1982 currently most of the existing water infrastructures were designed with the assumption of stationarity a belief that historical statistics can be applied to future decision making matthews et al 2011 koutsoyiannis montanari 2015 however this assumption is challenged by ongoing global environmental changes such as climate change population growth and land use land cover lulc change milly et al 2008 gao bryan 2017 zhao et al 2016a subsequently the sustainability of our water resources management systems is at unprecedented risk dovers handmer 1992 hirsch 2011 to manage a water supply system sustainably the key is to balance water availability with water demand yet both availability and demand are susceptible to non stationarity on the availability side there are multiple non stationary factors such as climate change flow regulation lulc change and increasing groundwater withdrawals kundzewicz et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 mcdonald et al 2014 barlow leake 2012 among these climate change induced precipitation alteration is expected to result in the largest impact on water availability milly et al 2005 schewe et al 2014 in the past several decades both observations and model simulations have shown increasing aridity trends across the globe due to the changing climate dai 2013 moreover with enhanced evapotranspiration loss due to increasing global temperatures droughts are likely to be more severe with longer duration parry 2007 on the demand side both the net growth and migration of population challenge the stationarity assumption global freshwater consumption has increased nearly six fold from 1900 to 1995 as a result of population growth shiklomanov 1999 specifically regional water demand has surged due to urbanization population redistribution for many regions in the world how to best provide sufficient water for the world s growing cities has become the most difficult and urgent problem for water management house peters chang 2011 results from mcdonald et al 2011 suggest that there were 150 million people in city areas suffering from perennial water shortage in the year 2000 this number will increase to 1 billion by 2050 due to population growth however evaluating future water supply resilience in a non stationary fashion is critically difficult primarily due to three challenges the first challenge is that the current modeling tools are inadequate to represent the dynamic feedback between hydrologic variabilities and water management decisions currently natural hydrological processes and water management activities are modeled in a separate or not fully integrated manner muttiah wurbs 2002 portland water bureau 2002 o hara georgakakos 2008 matonse et al 2013 despite in depth thoughts and processes existing in both types of models i e natural rainfall runoff versus operational reservoir management models the connections were usually loosely made through a few selected surface water controlling points this simplification would inevitably lead to inaccurate simulation of water availability and demand as well as their dynamic two way interactions zhao et al 2016b a few models such as the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 2001 model and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 are capable of addressing processes on both sides however such models are usually lumped semi lumped and are insufficient to represent dynamic features such as enhanced open water evaporation through reservoirs therefore full integration of the spatially distributed hydrological processes with water management activities should be prioritized for model development and employment the second challenge is that droughts are intrinsically difficult to predict especially in the long term future given the large uncertainties considering its low probability and our limited observational records future drought scenarios that fully rely on historical observations frick et al 1990 bekele knapp 2010 may underestimate the severity and trend of future droughts in the context of notable thermodynamical and dynamical global changes emori brown 2005 seager et al 2010 even for the historical period there are still disagreements about the trends of global drought dai 2013 sheffield et al 2012 in order to evaluate water supply resilience more reliably there is a need to utilize ensemble based future drought projections to support our decision making the third challenge is that both availability and demand estimates involve large uncertainties which add another layer of complexity to the water supply resilience evaluation yet uncertainty analysis is important for policy makers who make important decisions under an environment of risk thus quantification of uncertainties associated with non stationarities is critical for water resilience evaluation to our knowledge there have been very few studies that focus on water supply resilience under multi year droughts using fully distributed hydrological models dynamically coupled with water management systems amarasinghe et al 2016 watts et al 2012 collet et al 2015 most of these studies mainly tested the system resilience based on historical or artificially designed droughts and not on the expected future droughts derived from state of the art climate models therefore in this study we used a novel modeling framework which integrates hydrological processes and water management decisions zhao et al 2016b to overcome these limitations and dynamically evaluated water supply resilience under the impacts of two most significant sources of non stationarities potential multi year droughts and the growing demand from an increasing population we specifically want to answer three scientific questions 1 how do sources of non stationarities from both availability especially under multi year droughts and demand influence the resilience of a water supply system 2 how do uncertainties associated with these sources of non stationarities compare and which side i e availability or demand is dominant 3 what are the possible mitigation strategies to improve water supply resilience in this paper we use a case study to demonstrate a holistic approach for evaluating the future water resilience of large cities under an environment of non stationarity by bridging the gap between hydrological modeling water management practices climate change studies and population demographic projections in section 2 the selected study area the city of dallas is introduced the detailed methodology is explained in section 3 in section 4 the model calibration validation results are first demonstrated and then the future water supply and demand are compared and analyzed under various drought scenarios with the goal of answering the aforementioned scientific questions section 5 discusses the conclusions and the general applicability of this approach 2 study area the city of dallas in texas fig 1 was selected as our pilot study area to demonstrate the modeling framework which is applicable to any surface water dominated urban water supply system dallas is the ninth largest city in the u s in terms of population size from 1950 to 2010 dallas has experienced very fast urbanization both inside of the city boundaries and in the surrounding suburbs within the city alone the population has increased from 0 43 million to 1 20 million during this time period with this rapid urbanization process the capability of existing water systems to handle increasing future demand becomes a main concern for water resources planners in the area because of the limited groundwater resources the water supply of dallas fully depends on surface water which is highly variable both seasonally and inter annually during the severe 1950s statewide drought dallas municipal water supply was fully depleted the city s major water source lake dallas only had a capacity of 2 39 108 m3 this was quickly depleted once the drought started and the city had to purchase salty water from the distant red river to survive because of the severe water stress induced by this drought policy makers launched extensive reservoir construction projects to reduce future drought impacts on the city fig 1 in the trinity river basin four lakes were gradually constructed grapevine lake impounded in 1952 lavon lake 1953 lake ray hubbard 1969 and ray roberts lake 1987 lake dallas was also expanded to 5 38 108 m3 and renamed as lewisville lake 1955 in addition the city of dallas contracted with the sabine river authority for additional water supply from lake tawakoni 1960 and lake fork 1980 in 2010 these seven multi purpose reservoirs were capable of providing about 1 89 106 m3 d for dallas dallas water utilities dwu is responsible for the municipal water supply for the city and for 27 wholesale customer cities the total population served by dwu from the connected reservoirs was 2 40 million in 2010 with a total water demand of 1 63 106 m3 d texas commission on environmental quality 2017 even though the combined capacity of these seven reservoirs is sufficient to satisfy dallas water demand at 1 63 106 m3 d the real time reservoir storage varies considerably due to climate variability and other factors how this water supply system will respond in a non stationary environment is an unsolved question for the policy makers climate change and the associated increase in severity and frequency of extreme events that affect future water availability are increasing this challenge venkataraman et al 2016 meanwhile the city will also be stressed by increasing water demand from population growth which will be exacerbated by decreasing water availability due to more frequent drought conditions therefore to better support policy making for the sustainable development of the city of dallas it is essential to quantify the resilience of the water supply system in the context of demographic growth and future potential droughts 3 methodology 3 1 drought quantification under future climate conditions in a changing climate drought projections that only use historical data are no longer appropriate for representing the non stationary system in the past decades general circulation models gcms have been substantially improved with regard to both model algorithms and spatiotemporal resolutions ipcc et al 2013 even though these physically based models provide quite different projections for the future they offer a range of possible conditions by simulating the evolution of the physical processes therefore they are widely used for drought evaluation under a non stationary climate ghosh mujumdar 2007 touma et al 2015 there are several drought indexes that are commonly used for quantification of different drought types e g atmospheric hydrological and agricultural in this study we employed the widely used palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 to quantify meteorological drought as it uses the available water content awc of the soil to calculate other basic hydrologic terms such as potential evapotranspiration pet potential runoff soil recharge and soil loss it is capable of accurately capturing the drought characteristics impacting the surface water based supply system of dallas for the pet calculation currently there are several algorithms available thornthwaite 1948 hamon 1960 priestley and taylor 1972 monteith 1965 and others among these approaches the penman monteith approach monteith 1965 is considered the most accurate because it uses precipitation radiative forcing wind speed and humidity data to estimate pet instead of only using temperature for example such as the thornthwaite s method the pdsi generated from penman monteith pet calculations pdsi pm has shown to be a more accurate representation of historical droughts than the more commonly used pdsi from thornthwaite s pet method sheffield et al 2012 from this perspective pdsi pm is more physically based and thus more appropriate in this case study than other indexes such as the standardized precipitation index and the aridity index dai 2011 thus in this study we employed pdsi pm to better represent the drought processes statistically downscaled meteorological forcings were adopted from the downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate and hydrology projections reclamation 2013 however not all gcms from cmip5 are suitable for application on any given target watershed chiew et al 2009 by comparing the cumulative probabilities between the gcm based pdsi pm and the observation based pdsi pm during the historical period 1950 1999 8 models out of 19 were selected to provide future drought scenarios given their abilities to better represent the historical drought patterns supporting information representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 was selected as an example to demonstrate the drought quantification framework compared with other rcps rcp 8 5 offers a larger uncertainty range for testing the water supply resilience the comparison between rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is in the supporting information drought quantification was conducted in two steps first pdsi pm time series were calculated for each of the 8 gcms in order to choose the drought events of interest from the time series a threshold under which droughts are defined was applied in the original study conducted by palmer 1965 0 50 was used as a threshold based on a case study in central iowa and kansas however this value was rather arbitrarily selected and was not identified based on physical meaning alley 1984 thus a location specific pdsi pm threshold is more appropriate for quantifying the beginning and ending of droughts burke et al 2006 ryu et al 2014 svoboda et al 2015 in this study we used the 20th percentile of historical pdsi pm values as the threshold second the most severe droughts were selected based on the cumulative pdsi pm deficit for two future periods fig 2 and table 1 period 1 is from 2000 to 2049 and period 2 is from 2050 to 2099 we used the most severe droughts because they can better test the resilience of the water supply system and therefore provide the worst possible situation that can in turn help to adjust current policy both fig 2 and table 1 suggested significant non stationarity in future water availability introduced by prolonged droughts from period 1 to period 2 the average drought duration has increased from 23 months to 36 months similarly the drought severity which is the cumulative pdsi pm deficit has increased from 36 5 to 84 1 specifically the most severe drought in period 2 lasts for 61 months resulting in a severity of 181 3 3 2 water demand under growing population water demand is the total amount of water needed by consumers to ensure the regular operations of a society the water demand should be satisfied regardless of the external circumstances e g flood or drought however there are a number of factors that can influence water demand especially with respect to population growth and changes in water use per capita per day wupcd some other influential factors include economic activities lulc change water price water leakage water recycling and others since water demand is affected by many factors each with associated uncertainties its future projection is usually limited for example many climate studies use fixed values for these parameters and provide multiple or even single scenarios for the water demand wu et al 2015 ranatunga et al 2014 laghari et al 2012 furthermore there are no quantified uncertainties associated with the demand scenarios this dramatically restricts the application of these studies in the policy making process historically the city planners have been managing the water supply reservoirs as a system therefore we made future projections based on the total water use from these 7 reservoirs instead of making an individual projection for each one of them using the 2007 2011 water use data as the initial condition a monte carlo simulation was utilized to estimate future water demand in order to obtain the most likely demand values with their associated confidence intervals it is assumed that the future water demand is primarily affected by population and wupcd for population we defined an increase rate r n which follows a normal distribution an approach used in many studies hone 1999 nam reilly 2013 the average population increase rate r n is set to 1 32 yr for the city of dallas according to the dallas city council 2014 with respect to wupcd there is a decreasing trend due to technology improvement and policy intervention over the past 30 years texas water development board twdb 2016 in 2011 the average wupcd for dallas was about 745 l which has reduced by 235 l since 2000 however compared with other us cities such as new york city which currently has a wupcd of 450 l there is a large potential to further reduce the dallas water demand per capita thus twdb projected a continuous reduction of wupcd for dallas the average decrease rate is 0 45 yr twdb 2016 the decreasing rate of wupcd r u is also assumed to follow a normal distribution to account for possible uncertainties billings jones 2011 the parameters of these two normal distributions were estimated according to the dallas city council 2014 other factors such as water supply leakage and rainfall harvest which are considered to be water conservation practices see section 4 3 are not represented in eq 1 1 wd n 0 1 r n t u 0 1 r u t 2 r n d norm μ n σ n a n m i n b n m a x 3 r u d norm μ u σ u a u m i n b u m a x where wd is total water demand n 0 is the initial population r n is the population growth rate u 0 is the initial wupcd and r u is the wupcd decrease rate both r n and r u follow normal distributions eqs 2 and 3 where μ σ a and b are the mean standard deviation lower boundary and upper boundary for the normal distribution both r n and r u are assumed to be statistically independent a total of 10 000 samples were generated through monte carlo simulation to support the analysis after computing the probability distribution of wd the 1st 50th and 99th percentiles were selected to represent the best median and worst future water demand scenarios due to the randomness feature of the monte carlo simulation the minimum and maximum values from the samples are usually sensitive to the sample size thus the 1st and 99th percentiles are more suitable and additionally they can represent most of the uncertainty range of the simulation the 1st percentile value represents we have a 99 confidence level that future water demand will be higher than this value for convenient illustration the 1st 50th and 99th percentiles are referred as the minimum median and maximum hereafter once the total water demand data for the entire city of dallas for a future year is determined it is distributed to the 7 reservoirs proportionally based on the historical water use pattern seasonal variation is prescribed based on the 5 year historical data from 2007 to 2011 fig 3 shows the continuous increase of total water demand i e non stationarity in water demand the median water demand increases from 1 63 106 m3 d in 2010 to 3 35 106 m3 d in 2095 along with the magnitude the uncertainty range the difference between minimum and maximum is also increasing in 2020 the uncertainty range is 1 32 105 m3 d which increases to 1 84 106 m3 d in 2095 3 3 hydrological and water management simulations as explained in the introduction a thorough understanding of the interplay between natural and managed water systems is critically lacking this is because there are few distributed models that fully integrate natural hydrological processes and systematic water management practices to close this knowledge gap a newly developed model was employed in this study the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model with reservoirs dhsvm res zhao et al 2016b is a physically based fully distributed model that has explicit reservoir operation functions incorporated fig 4 built upon the high spatial temporal resolution dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the model is suitable for investigating hydrologic regimes over heterogeneous domains under extreme events and or a changing environment specifically dhsvm res has two features which are essential for studying integrated natural and managed water systems under conditions of non stationarity first it explicitly represents the effects of urban land cover on hydrological processes using fractional impervious area and detention storage cuo et al 2008 second the reservoir module is capable of simulating the management of a water system e g multi reservoirs using either real or optimized operation rules zhao et al 2016b in channel water withdrawals reservoir storage withdrawals reservoir water release and return flows e g flow from wastewater treatment plants can be all simulated at their real world locations within the model in this study we used historical monthly water use observations from twdb and prescribed reservoir operation rules from the u s army corps of engineers for the water management simulations because most wastewater treatment plants for dallas are located downstream of the simulated watersheds fig 1 return flow is not included in this study the hydrological and water management simulations involved three steps first the dhsvm res model was calibrated and validated using historical observations including streamflow station data and reservoir storage data from multiple locations we simulated each of the 4 subbasins fig 1 at a 200 meter resolution and a 3 hour time step using observed meteorological forcing data livneh et al 2013 to focus on the non stationarities of availability and demand a fixed lulc map i e national land cover database 2006 was used because the urban growth is mostly located in the downstream regions of the study area fig 1 impacts of lulc change on reservoir storage and supply reliability are very limited the next step involved scenario simulations the meteorological data during the selected drought events section 3 1 were used to drive dhsvm res for each drought event the reservoir release was calculated based on the projected water demand data for example the most severe drought projected for period 1 by mpi esm mr lasts from march 2037 to december 2039 thus the predicted water demand for this time period section 3 2 was used for the dhsvm res simulation associated with this drought event in this study the 1950s drought from march 1954 to november 1956 was used as a baseline drought event because all reservoirs in the dallas region were constructed after the 1950s drought there was no corresponding water use data for this drought thus we used three designed water demand scenarios i e 2010 2050 and 2090 water demand data to take into account the uncertainty due to population and wupcd changes outputs from period 1 2000 2049 and period 2 2050 2099 were compared with the baseline 1950s drought to assess the long term trend finally several mitigation strategies to promote water supply resilience were tested using dhsvm res to identify the optimal solution for mitigating drought impact 4 results and discussions 4 1 dhsvm res calibration and validation the model was calibrated from 2005 to 2011 and validated from 1980 to 2004 fig 5 to best represent the subbasin hydrological processes and reduce the risk of overfitting we chose to calibrate and validate for multiple streamflow monitoring locations based on data availability and watershed characteristics 8 usgs gages were selected the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse were used as the calibration criteria overall the simulated outputs including reservoir water elevation and streamflow are in good agreement with the observed ones for reservoir water elevation the r2 value ranges from 0 60 to 0 95 and the nse ranges from 0 46 to 0 95 the low nse for ray hubbard might be caused by the incomplete water use data it is worth noting that the model can also capture the reservoir impoundment activities in an accurate manner which can be useful for evaluating new reservoir operations for streamflow simulations the r2 ranges from 0 70 to 0 85 and the nse ranges from 0 43 to 0 84 these good levels of agreement benefit from the hyper resolution and the explicit water management system simulations of dhsvm res 4 2 impacts of non stationary water availability and demand on system supply resilience both reduced availability from multi year drought events and increasing demand from population growth will significantly affect the water supply resilience as discussed in detail in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the hydrological model was used to simulate the water availability under future drought events extracted from a gcm ensemble while monte carlo simulations were adopted to calculate the growing demand from population growth and wupcd changes to quantify the water supply resilience in dallas we employed two metrics the relative storage and the water supply reliability because city planners manage the 7 reservoirs as a system to meet the water needs of the dallas area we evaluated these metrics for the system rather than individual reservoirs thus the relative storage is defined as the total storage divided by the total conservation storage over the 7 reservoirs in the study domain similarly the water supply reliability is defined as the total water supply divided by the total water demand for each month the overall supply reliability for a projected drought event is calculated by simply averaging the monthly values both metrics were shown as percentage values to facilitate the analysis we focused on the temporal evolution of the droughts with the assumption that the reservoir storage initial state is at the top of the conservation pool for every reservoir at the beginning of each drought event fig 6 a shows the relative storage from the ensemble of droughts during period 1 and period 2 as well as the relative storage from the 1950s drought under 2010 2050 and 2090 demands for these simulations the corresponding median values of the projected water demand were used clearly the average drought duration in period 2 36 25 months is significantly longer than that in period 1 21 75 months due to the larger severity and longer duration the average relative storage during a drought drops from 69 7 to 53 6 16 1 difference from period 1 to period 2 fig 6b shows water supply reliability from the ensemble of droughts during the two periods during period 1 the reservoirs can still provide a sufficient amount of water to the city under severe drought water supply reliability for most droughts can maintain a level of 100 yet with respect to period 2 the water supply reliability decreases dramatically due to both longer drought durations and larger water demand during the first year of the drought all of these 7 reservoirs can still maintain 100 supply reliability however the reliability value of one event drops to 26 after 50 months which indicates that some potential extreme long term droughts will cause devastating economic and ecological consequences comparing period 1 with period 2 the average water supply reliability during a drought drops from 95 9 to 81 7 14 2 difference there is also a significant difference in the first decision point i e the first time water reliability drops under 100 between period 1 and period 2 the median value for these 8 models decreases from 24 months to 14 months from period 1 to period 2 this decrease is mainly caused by water demand increase for the 1950 s drought the first decision point decreases from 29 months to 20 months to 13 months as the water demand changes from the 2010 water demand to the 2050 demand to the 2090 demand typically supply reliability is assessed under a worst case scenario associated with a return period or under a large sample of events in this study we mainly focused on the most severe droughts which are the worst scenarios that water managers are typically concerned with therefore the reliability values are relatively low 4 3 uncertainties associated with the non stationary water availability and demand both sides of the non stationarities water availability and demand involve considerable uncertainties for the availability side uncertainties can be attributed to climate models greenhouse gas emission scenarios downscaling methods and hydrological models among these uncertainties associated with gcm structures are generally the largest kay et al 2009 prudhomme davies 2009a b bennett et al 2012 by choosing 8 gcm models the uncertainties from different gcm structures can be represented in this study on average this uncertainty can result in a 13 3 variation of relative storage fig 6a and an 18 7 variation of supply reliability fig 6b for period 2 with respect to the demand side primary sources of uncertainties include population growth rate and wupcd change rate billings jones 2011 the uncertainties from population growth and wupcd changes can be represented using results from the monte carlo simulation fig 3 using the projected minimum median maximum water demands in dhsvm res the seasonality of relative storage and supply reliability was generated fig 7 fig 7 shows how these water demand uncertainties represented by the minimum median maximum demand values as shown in fig 3 propagate to the dhsvm res simulated relative storage and supply reliability under the ensemble of drought events for storage clear seasonality can be observed with september having the lowest value this is mainly caused by high summer water consumption beginning in june in addition the high evaporation rate in the summer months also exacerbates the reservoir storage depletion this lowest storage level also leads to the lowest supply reliability in the same month fig 7b compared to period 1 period 2 shows a much larger uncertainty range for both relative storage and water supply reliability for example the storage uncertainty range for september in period 2 is 9 from 54 to 63 while it is 2 72 74 in period 1 similar to the results in fig 6 supply reliability in period 1 is always close to 100 with the exception of august and september because the demand uncertainty during period 1 is small it has little effect on the storage and supply reliability however in period 2 demand uncertainty will have a significant impact the resultant uncertainty range of supply reliability in september for period 2 is 19 71 90 as discussed above both availability and water demand have notable uncertainties thus it is essential to identify which of these parts plays a more dominant role with regard to water supply resilience we compared the water resilience level in terms of relative storage and reliability driven by each gcm and water demand scenario fig 8 for relative storage the uncertainty range associated with gcms is from 51 to 73 while that from the increasing water demand is from 59 to 69 water supply reliability is in the 77 98 uncertainty range with gcms and the water demand uncertainty range is from 83 to 97 in general water availability non stationarity shows a slightly larger uncertainty range it is worth noting that these range values were calculated from an ensemble mean averaged either from the 8 gcms or from the 3 demand scenarios because the study site for this research is the city of dallas one of the fastest growing large cities in the u s the uncertainty range results from water demand non stationarity are considerably significant however the gcm based uncertainty is larger 4 4 mitigation strategy evaluations in order to improve the water supply reliability dwu has proposed several mitigation strategies such as additional conservation integrating a new water source and water use redistribution in this study the efficiency of these mitigation strategies was tested using dhsvm res 1 additional conservation additional conservation mainly includes improving water use technology and reducing leakage and outdoor water use the estimated saving percentage of total water use is 7 twdb 2016 these additional conservation practices are proposed on top of the traditional conservation measures especially during drought events the traditional and long term conservation measures e g public awareness policy intervention were incorporated into the wupcd projections r u in eq 1 which tempers down the overall demand increase due to population growth 2 integrating a new water source lake palestine is a reservoir located in the nearby neches river basin and is proposed to supply water to dallas in the future palestine is estimated to be able to provide 3 86 105 m3 d for dwu however the long distance to dallas requires intensive construction of pipelines for water transfer 3 water use redistribution the current water use distribution among these reservoirs is based on the travel distance to the city instead of the water availability conservation storage for each reservoir for example lake tawakoni has the largest conservation storage which accounts for 23 8 of the total storage from the 7 reservoirs yet it only contributes 10 9 of the total water supply redistributing the water use among these reservoirs based on reservoir storage can significantly improve the water supply reliability 4 combination strategy a combination of aforementioned 3 strategies was also tested we compared the efficiency of these strategies over the longest potential future drought projected from gfdl esm2m during period 2 i e the most extreme drought with the business as usual scenario i e no mitigation strategies fig 9 shows that reservoir storage is continuously depleted during the drought for all of the strategies the strategy by redistributing the water use shows the lowest relative storage consequently even though more water can be supplied in the beginning reliability will drop significantly around month 50 both additional conservation and new water source strategies show a slight increase of supply reliability when all of these three strategies are combined supply reliability shows the most improvement the average supply reliability during the drought for business as usual is 77 8 while it is 81 0 81 8 87 3 and 93 7 for strategy 1 through strategy 4 these relative low reliability values are mainly caused by the chosen gcm i e gfdl esm2m which projects the worst drought in the future in this example demonstration a non parametric kolmogorov smirnov test was carried out to test whether the supply reliability is significantly improved using these strategies as compared with the baseline run p values for the tests fig 9b show that both redistribution and combined strategies can significantly improve the supply reliability however the redistribution strategy shows no improvement for the extreme condition and has even worse supply reliability around month 50 therefore compared with the individual strategies the combined strategy is the most appropriate option to efficiently increase the water supply reliability there are two limitations worth noting in the strategy evaluations first we tested these strategies only based on hydrologic factors without considering economic factors although we acknowledge that hydrologic evaluation needs to be complemented with economic analysis before supporting decision making for example an economic evaluation would allow for the design of a step wise curtailment of the water supply as the drought intensifies in order to improve the water supply reliability in the long term and inform cost benefit evaluation for additional infrastructure or contracts second we used uniform mitigation strategies in a drought event however water managers might use adaptive management changing strategies based on the strategy performance in real world situations which will improve supply reliability gao et al 2016 the representativeness of the results from this study is limited by several assumptions first we assumed that the initial reservoir level is at the top of the conservation pool at the onset of the drought although this makes the analysis straight forward it tends to underestimate water stress another assumption is the simplified representation of the urban water demand eq 1 based on population growth and wupcd changes however other factors such as economic development drought specific increase in landscape water demand water conservation and efficiency measures can significantly affect our estimates although population growth and wupcd have the largest impact finally dallas fully depends on surface water and therefore the groundwater contribution less than 3 of total water supply twdb 2016 was not considered in this study however techniques such as the managed aquifer recharge mar method can help to store water in the underlying trinity aquifer system gao et al 2014 similar to the function of surface water reservoirs the aquifer could help improving the supply reliability for dallas in the future in addition groundwater should be incorporated in other study areas where it plays a significant part in the water supply system 5 conclusions the resilience of water supply systems is affected by water availability and water demand both of which are characterized with non stationarity in this study by applying dhsvm res which integrates detailed hydrology with water management operations under selected multi year drought scenarios in the city of dallas we quantified how the combined non stationarity and uncertainties in multi year drought severities and water demand growth will impact the future water supply resilience reduced availability is induced by the future droughts derived from gcm projections and growing demand is calculated using monte carlo simulation by taking into account the population growth and wupcd change uncertainties using reservoir relative storage and water supply reliability as resilience metrics the conclusions of this study are 1 both non stationarities in water availability associated with drought changes and demand associated with demand growth have significant impacts on the water supply resilience droughts in period 2 2050 2099 are much more severe with longer duration than those in period 1 2000 2049 consequently water supply becomes less reliable in period 2 with no curtailments or changes in operations supply reliability could drop to 26 after a 4 year drought the first decision point at which reliability drops under 100 decreases from 24 months to 14 months from period 1 to period 2 2 both uncertainties associated with availability and demand non stationarity are large and their combination affects the projected future water resilience estimates for water availability the primary source of uncertainties is gcm structure in this study it was found that the gcm model ensemble which contains the 8 best performing models for drought simulation in the region results in an average of 22 uncertainty range in relative storage and an average of 21 uncertainty range in supply reliability when taking period 2 as an example for water demand the uncertainties are from population growth and wupcd reduction and result in a 10 range in relative storage and 14 in supply reliability over the second period both uncertainties are of the same order of magnitude which should further motivate water supply resources adequacy studies to explicitly consider both as none clearly dominates potential decision making 3 none of the tested individual water management strategies i e additional conservation integrating a new water source and water use redistribution alone would be sufficient to significantly improve the water supply resilience for the city of dallas under combined uncertainties in multi year drought induced water availability decrease and population growth induced water demand increase a combination of these adaptation strategies is more appropriate for more robust long term water supply resilience with the feedback to water availability represented this fully integrated framework can help inform economic analysis to select the best mitigation strategy this study demonstrates an end to end approach for evaluating water supply resilience under multiple sources of non stationarity in an urbanized watershed it bridges the gap between climate projections demographic projections high resolution hydrological modeling water management operations and best management practices the current framework allows for representing water availability and associated uncertainties in space and time in a consistent manner instead of deriving synthetic uncorrelated flow at each reservoir the simulation

7124,the future resilience of water supply systems is unprecedentedly challenged by non stationary processes such as fast population growth and a changing climate a thorough understanding of how these non stationarities impact water supply resilience is vital to support sustainable decision making particularly for large cities in arid and or semi arid regions in this study a novel modeling framework which integrates hydrological processes and water management was established over a representative water limited metropolitan area to evaluate the impacts of water availability and water demand on reservoir storage and water supply reliability in this framework climate change induced drought events were selected from statistically downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 outputs under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 scenario while future water demand was estimated by the product of projected future population and per capita water use compared with the first half of the 21st century 2000 2049 reservoir storage and water supply reliability during the second half century 2050 2099 are projected to reduce by 16 1 and 14 2 respectively while both future multi year droughts and population growth will lower water supply resilience the uncertainty associated with future climate projection is larger than that associated with urbanization to reduce the drought risks a combination of mitigation strategies e g additional conservation integrating new water sources and water use redistribution was found to be the most efficient approach and can significantly improve water supply reliability by as much as 15 9 keywords water supply resilience non stationarity droughts climate change demand growth 1 introduction resilient water supply systems

koutsoyiannis montanari 2015 however this assumption is challenged by ongoing global environmental changes such as climate change population growth and land use land cover lulc change milly et al 2008 gao bryan 2017 zhao et al 2016a subsequently the sustainability of our water resources management systems is at unprecedented risk dovers handmer 1992 hirsch 2011 to manage a water supply system sustainably the key is to balance water availability with water demand yet both availability and demand are susceptible to non stationarity on the availability side there are multiple non stationary factors such as climate change flow regulation lulc change and increasing groundwater withdrawals kundzewicz et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 mcdonald et al 2014 barlow leake 2012 among these climate change induced precipitation alteration is expected to result in the largest impact on water availability milly et al 2005 schewe et al 2014 in the past several decades both observations and model simulations have shown increasing aridity trends across the globe due to the changing climate dai 2013 moreover with enhanced evapotranspiration loss due to increasing global temperatures droughts are likely to be more severe with longer duration parry 2007 on the demand side both the net growth and migration of population challenge the stationarity assumption global freshwater consumption has increased nearly six fold from 1900 to 1995 as a result of population growth shiklomanov 1999 specifically regional water demand has surged due to urbanization population redistribution for many regions in the world how to best provide sufficient water for the world s growing cities has become the most difficult and urgent problem for water management house peters chang 2011 results from mcdonald et al 2011 suggest that there were 150 million people in city areas suffering from perennial water shortage in the year 2000 this number will increase to 1 billion by 2050 due to population growth however evaluating future water supply resilience in a non stationary fashion is critically difficult primarily due to three challenges the first challenge is that the current modeling tools are inadequate to represent the dynamic feedback between hydrologic variabilities and water management decisions currently natural hydrological processes and water management activities are modeled in a separate or not fully integrated manner muttiah wurbs 2002 portland water bureau 2002 o hara georgakakos 2008 matonse et al 2013 despite in depth thoughts and processes existing in both types of models i e natural rainfall runoff versus operational reservoir management models the connections were usually loosely made through a few selected surface water controlling points this simplification would inevitably lead to inaccurate simulation of water availability and demand as well as their dynamic two way interactions zhao et al 2016b a few models such as the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 2001 model and the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 are capable of addressing processes on both sides however such models are usually lumped semi lumped and are insufficient to represent dynamic features such as enhanced open water evaporation through reservoirs therefore full integration of the spatially distributed hydrological processes with water management activities should be prioritized for model development and employment the second challenge is that droughts are intrinsically difficult to predict especially in the long term future given the large uncertainties considering its low probability and our limited observational records future drought scenarios that fully rely on historical observations frick et al 1990 bekele knapp 2010 may underestimate the severity and trend of future droughts in the context of notable thermodynamical and dynamical global changes emori brown 2005 seager et al 2010 even for the historical period there are still disagreements about the trends of global drought dai 2013 sheffield et al 2012 in order to evaluate water supply resilience more reliably there is a need to utilize ensemble based future drought projections to support our decision making the third challenge is that both availability and demand estimates involve large uncertainties which add another layer of complexity to the water supply resilience evaluation yet uncertainty analysis is important for policy makers who make important decisions under an environment of risk thus quantification of uncertainties associated with non stationarities is critical for water resilience evaluation to our knowledge there have been very few studies that focus on water supply resilience under multi year droughts using fully distributed hydrological models dynamically coupled with water management systems amarasinghe et al 2016 watts et al 2012 collet et al 2015 most of these studies mainly tested the system resilience based on historical or artificially designed droughts and not on the expected future droughts derived from state of the art climate models therefore in this study we used a novel modeling framework which integrates hydrological processes and water management decisions zhao et al 2016b to overcome these limitations and dynamically evaluated water supply resilience under the impacts of two most significant sources of non stationarities potential multi year droughts and the growing demand from an increasing population we specifically want to answer three scientific questions 1 how do sources of non stationarities from both availability especially under multi year droughts and demand influence the resilience of a water supply system 2 how do uncertainties associated with these sources of non stationarities compare and which side i e availability or demand is dominant 3 what are the possible mitigation strategies to improve water supply resilience in this paper we use a case study to demonstrate a holistic approach for evaluating the future water resilience of large cities under an environment of non stationarity by bridging the gap between hydrological modeling water management practices climate change studies and population demographic projections in section 2 the selected study area the city of dallas is introduced the detailed methodology is explained in section 3 in section 4 the model calibration validation results are first demonstrated and then the future water supply and demand are compared and analyzed under various drought scenarios with the goal of answering the aforementioned scientific questions section 5 discusses the conclusions and the general applicability of this approach 2 study area the city of dallas in texas fig 1 was selected as our pilot study area to demonstrate the modeling framework which is applicable to any surface water dominated urban water supply system dallas is the ninth largest city in the u s in terms of population size from 1950 to 2010 dallas has experienced very fast urbanization both inside of the city boundaries and in the surrounding suburbs within the city alone the population has increased from 0 43 million to 1 20 million during this time period with this rapid urbanization process the capability of existing water systems to handle increasing future demand becomes a main concern for water resources planners in the area because of the limited groundwater resources the water supply of dallas fully depends on surface water which is highly variable both seasonally and inter annually during the severe 1950s statewide drought dallas municipal water supply was fully depleted the city s major water source lake dallas only had a capacity of 2 39 108 m3 this was quickly depleted once the drought started and the city had to purchase salty water from the distant red river to survive because of the severe water stress induced by this drought policy makers launched extensive reservoir construction projects to reduce future drought impacts on the city fig 1 in the trinity river basin four lakes were gradually constructed grapevine lake impounded in 1952 lavon lake 1953 lake ray hubbard 1969 and ray roberts lake 1987 lake dallas was also expanded to 5 38 108 m3 and renamed as lewisville lake 1955 in addition the city of dallas contracted with the sabine river authority for additional water supply from lake tawakoni 1960 and lake fork 1980 in 2010 these seven multi purpose reservoirs were capable of providing about 1 89 106 m3 d for dallas dallas water utilities dwu is responsible for the municipal water supply for the city and for 27 wholesale customer cities the total population served by dwu from the connected reservoirs was 2 40 million in 2010 with a total water demand of 1 63 106 m3 d texas commission on environmental quality 2017 even though the combined capacity of these seven reservoirs is sufficient to satisfy dallas water demand at 1 63 106 m3 d the real time reservoir storage varies considerably due to climate variability and other factors how this water supply system will respond in a non stationary environment is an unsolved question for the policy makers climate change and the associated increase in severity and frequency of extreme events that affect future water availability are increasing this challenge venkataraman et al 2016 meanwhile the city will also be stressed by increasing water demand from population growth which will be exacerbated by decreasing water availability due to more frequent drought conditions therefore to better support policy making for the sustainable development of the city of dallas it is essential to quantify the resilience of the water supply system in the context of demographic growth and future potential droughts 3 methodology 3 1 drought quantification under future climate conditions in a changing climate drought projections that only use historical data are no longer appropriate for representing the non stationary system in the past decades general circulation models gcms have been substantially improved with regard to both model algorithms and spatiotemporal resolutions ipcc et al 2013 even though these physically based models provide quite different projections for the future they offer a range of possible conditions by simulating the evolution of the physical processes therefore they are widely used for drought evaluation under a non stationary climate ghosh mujumdar 2007 touma et al 2015 there are several drought indexes that are commonly used for quantification of different drought types e g atmospheric hydrological and agricultural in this study we employed the widely used palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 to quantify meteorological drought as it uses the available water content awc of the soil to calculate other basic hydrologic terms such as potential evapotranspiration pet potential runoff soil recharge and soil loss it is capable of accurately capturing the drought characteristics impacting the surface water based supply system of dallas for the pet calculation currently there are several algorithms available thornthwaite 1948 hamon 1960 priestley and taylor 1972 monteith 1965 and others among these approaches the penman monteith approach monteith 1965 is considered the most accurate because it uses precipitation radiative forcing wind speed and humidity data to estimate pet instead of only using temperature for example such as the thornthwaite s method the pdsi generated from penman monteith pet calculations pdsi pm has shown to be a more accurate representation of historical droughts than the more commonly used pdsi from thornthwaite s pet method sheffield et al 2012 from this perspective pdsi pm is more physically based and thus more appropriate in this case study than other indexes such as the standardized precipitation index and the aridity index dai 2011 thus in this study we employed pdsi pm to better represent the drought processes statistically downscaled meteorological forcings were adopted from the downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 climate and hydrology projections reclamation 2013 however not all gcms from cmip5 are suitable for application on any given target watershed chiew et al 2009 by comparing the cumulative probabilities between the gcm based pdsi pm and the observation based pdsi pm during the historical period 1950 1999 8 models out of 19 were selected to provide future drought scenarios given their abilities to better represent the historical drought patterns supporting information representative concentration pathway rcp 8 5 was selected as an example to demonstrate the drought quantification framework compared with other rcps rcp 8 5 offers a larger uncertainty range for testing the water supply resilience the comparison between rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is in the supporting information drought quantification was conducted in two steps first pdsi pm time series were calculated for each of the 8 gcms in order to choose the drought events of interest from the time series a threshold under which droughts are defined was applied in the original study conducted by palmer 1965 0 50 was used as a threshold based on a case study in central iowa and kansas however this value was rather arbitrarily selected and was not identified based on physical meaning alley 1984 thus a location specific pdsi pm threshold is more appropriate for quantifying the beginning and ending of droughts burke et al 2006 ryu et al 2014 svoboda et al 2015 in this study we used the 20th percentile of historical pdsi pm values as the threshold second the most severe droughts were selected based on the cumulative pdsi pm deficit for two future periods fig 2 and table 1 period 1 is from 2000 to 2049 and period 2 is from 2050 to 2099 we used the most severe droughts because they can better test the resilience of the water supply system and therefore provide the worst possible situation that can in turn help to adjust current policy both fig 2 and table 1 suggested significant non stationarity in future water availability introduced by prolonged droughts from period 1 to period 2 the average drought duration has increased from 23 months to 36 months similarly the drought severity which is the cumulative pdsi pm deficit has increased from 36 5 to 84 1 specifically the most severe drought in period 2 lasts for 61 months resulting in a severity of 181 3 3 2 water demand under growing population water demand is the total amount of water needed by consumers to ensure the regular operations of a society the water demand should be satisfied regardless of the external circumstances e g flood or drought however there are a number of factors that can influence water demand especially with respect to population growth and changes in water use per capita per day wupcd some other influential factors include economic activities lulc change water price water leakage water recycling and others since water demand is affected by many factors each with associated uncertainties its future projection is usually limited for example many climate studies use fixed values for these parameters and provide multiple or even single scenarios for the water demand wu et al 2015 ranatunga et al 2014 laghari et al 2012 furthermore there are no quantified uncertainties associated with the demand scenarios this dramatically restricts the application of these studies in the policy making process historically the city planners have been managing the water supply reservoirs as a system therefore we made future projections based on the total water use from these 7 reservoirs instead of making an individual projection for each one of them using the 2007 2011 water use data as the initial condition a monte carlo simulation was utilized to estimate future water demand in order to obtain the most likely demand values with their associated confidence intervals it is assumed that the future water demand is primarily affected by population and wupcd for population we defined an increase rate r n which follows a normal distribution an approach used in many studies hone 1999 nam reilly 2013 the average population increase rate r n is set to 1 32 yr for the city of dallas according to the dallas city council 2014 with respect to wupcd there is a decreasing trend due to technology improvement and policy intervention over the past 30 years texas water development board twdb 2016 in 2011 the average wupcd for dallas was about 745 l which has reduced by 235 l since 2000 however compared with other us cities such as new york city which currently has a wupcd of 450 l there is a large potential to further reduce the dallas water demand per capita thus twdb projected a continuous reduction of wupcd for dallas the average decrease rate is 0 45 yr twdb 2016 the decreasing rate of wupcd r u is also assumed to follow a normal distribution to account for possible uncertainties billings jones 2011 the parameters of these two normal distributions were estimated according to the dallas city council 2014 other factors such as water supply leakage and rainfall harvest which are considered to be water conservation practices see section 4 3 are not represented in eq 1 1 wd n 0 1 r n t u 0 1 r u t 2 r n d norm μ n σ n a n m i n b n m a x 3 r u d norm μ u σ u a u m i n b u m a x where wd is total water demand n 0 is the initial population r n is the population growth rate u 0 is the initial wupcd and r u is the wupcd decrease rate both r n and r u follow normal distributions eqs 2 and 3 where μ σ a and b are the mean standard deviation lower boundary and upper boundary for the normal distribution both r n and r u are assumed to be statistically independent a total of 10 000 samples were generated through monte carlo simulation to support the analysis after computing the probability distribution of wd the 1st 50th and 99th percentiles were selected to represent the best median and worst future water demand scenarios due to the randomness feature of the monte carlo simulation the minimum and maximum values from the samples are usually sensitive to the sample size thus the 1st and 99th percentiles are more suitable and additionally they can represent most of the uncertainty range of the simulation the 1st percentile value represents we have a 99 confidence level that future water demand will be higher than this value for convenient illustration the 1st 50th and 99th percentiles are referred as the minimum median and maximum hereafter once the total water demand data for the entire city of dallas for a future year is determined it is distributed to the 7 reservoirs proportionally based on the historical water use pattern seasonal variation is prescribed based on the 5 year historical data from 2007 to 2011 fig 3 shows the continuous increase of total water demand i e non stationarity in water demand the median water demand increases from 1 63 106 m3 d in 2010 to 3 35 106 m3 d in 2095 along with the magnitude the uncertainty range the difference between minimum and maximum is also increasing in 2020 the uncertainty range is 1 32 105 m3 d which increases to 1 84 106 m3 d in 2095 3 3 hydrological and water management simulations as explained in the introduction a thorough understanding of the interplay between natural and managed water systems is critically lacking this is because there are few distributed models that fully integrate natural hydrological processes and systematic water management practices to close this knowledge gap a newly developed model was employed in this study the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model with reservoirs dhsvm res zhao et al 2016b is a physically based fully distributed model that has explicit reservoir operation functions incorporated fig 4 built upon the high spatial temporal resolution dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 the model is suitable for investigating hydrologic regimes over heterogeneous domains under extreme events and or a changing environment specifically dhsvm res has two features which are essential for studying integrated natural and managed water systems under conditions of non stationarity first it explicitly represents the effects of urban land cover on hydrological processes using fractional impervious area and detention storage cuo et al 2008 second the reservoir module is capable of simulating the management of a water system e g multi reservoirs using either real or optimized operation rules zhao et al 2016b in channel water withdrawals reservoir storage withdrawals reservoir water release and return flows e g flow from wastewater treatment plants can be all simulated at their real world locations within the model in this study we used historical monthly water use observations from twdb and prescribed reservoir operation rules from the u s army corps of engineers for the water management simulations because most wastewater treatment plants for dallas are located downstream of the simulated watersheds fig 1 return flow is not included in this study the hydrological and water management simulations involved three steps first the dhsvm res model was calibrated and validated using historical observations including streamflow station data and reservoir storage data from multiple locations we simulated each of the 4 subbasins fig 1 at a 200 meter resolution and a 3 hour time step using observed meteorological forcing data livneh et al 2013 to focus on the non stationarities of availability and demand a fixed lulc map i e national land cover database 2006 was used because the urban growth is mostly located in the downstream regions of the study area fig 1 impacts of lulc change on reservoir storage and supply reliability are very limited the next step involved scenario simulations the meteorological data during the selected drought events section 3 1 were used to drive dhsvm res for each drought event the reservoir release was calculated based on the projected water demand data for example the most severe drought projected for period 1 by mpi esm mr lasts from march 2037 to december 2039 thus the predicted water demand for this time period section 3 2 was used for the dhsvm res simulation associated with this drought event in this study the 1950s drought from march 1954 to november 1956 was used as a baseline drought event because all reservoirs in the dallas region were constructed after the 1950s drought there was no corresponding water use data for this drought thus we used three designed water demand scenarios i e 2010 2050 and 2090 water demand data to take into account the uncertainty due to population and wupcd changes outputs from period 1 2000 2049 and period 2 2050 2099 were compared with the baseline 1950s drought to assess the long term trend finally several mitigation strategies to promote water supply resilience were tested using dhsvm res to identify the optimal solution for mitigating drought impact 4 results and discussions 4 1 dhsvm res calibration and validation the model was calibrated from 2005 to 2011 and validated from 1980 to 2004 fig 5 to best represent the subbasin hydrological processes and reduce the risk of overfitting we chose to calibrate and validate for multiple streamflow monitoring locations based on data availability and watershed characteristics 8 usgs gages were selected the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse were used as the calibration criteria overall the simulated outputs including reservoir water elevation and streamflow are in good agreement with the observed ones for reservoir water elevation the r2 value ranges from 0 60 to 0 95 and the nse ranges from 0 46 to 0 95 the low nse for ray hubbard might be caused by the incomplete water use data it is worth noting that the model can also capture the reservoir impoundment activities in an accurate manner which can be useful for evaluating new reservoir operations for streamflow simulations the r2 ranges from 0 70 to 0 85 and the nse ranges from 0 43 to 0 84 these good levels of agreement benefit from the hyper resolution and the explicit water management system simulations of dhsvm res 4 2 impacts of non stationary water availability and demand on system supply resilience both reduced availability from multi year drought events and increasing demand from population growth will significantly affect the water supply resilience as discussed in detail in sections 3 1 and 3 2 the hydrological model was used to simulate the water availability under future drought events extracted from a gcm ensemble while monte carlo simulations were adopted to calculate the growing demand from population growth and wupcd changes to quantify the water supply resilience in dallas we employed two metrics the relative storage and the water supply reliability because city planners manage the 7 reservoirs as a system to meet the water needs of the dallas area we evaluated these metrics for the system rather than individual reservoirs thus the relative storage is defined as the total storage divided by the total conservation storage over the 7 reservoirs in the study domain similarly the water supply reliability is defined as the total water supply divided by the total water demand for each month the overall supply reliability for a projected drought event is calculated by simply averaging the monthly values both metrics were shown as percentage values to facilitate the analysis we focused on the temporal evolution of the droughts with the assumption that the reservoir storage initial state is at the top of the conservation pool for every reservoir at the beginning of each drought event fig 6 a shows the relative storage from the ensemble of droughts during period 1 and period 2 as well as the relative storage from the 1950s drought under 2010 2050 and 2090 demands for these simulations the corresponding median values of the projected water demand were used clearly the average drought duration in period 2 36 25 months is significantly longer than that in period 1 21 75 months due to the larger severity and longer duration the average relative storage during a drought drops from 69 7 to 53 6 16 1 difference from period 1 to period 2 fig 6b shows water supply reliability from the ensemble of droughts during the two periods during period 1 the reservoirs can still provide a sufficient amount of water to the city under severe drought water supply reliability for most droughts can maintain a level of 100 yet with respect to period 2 the water supply reliability decreases dramatically due to both longer drought durations and larger water demand during the first year of the drought all of these 7 reservoirs can still maintain 100 supply reliability however the reliability value of one event drops to 26 after 50 months which indicates that some potential extreme long term droughts will cause devastating economic and ecological consequences comparing period 1 with period 2 the average water supply reliability during a drought drops from 95 9 to 81 7 14 2 difference there is also a significant difference in the first decision point i e the first time water reliability drops under 100 between period 1 and period 2 the median value for these 8 models decreases from 24 months to 14 months from period 1 to period 2 this decrease is mainly caused by water demand increase for the 1950 s drought the first decision point decreases from 29 months to 20 months to 13 months as the water demand changes from the 2010 water demand to the 2050 demand to the 2090 demand typically supply reliability is assessed under a worst case scenario associated with a return period or under a large sample of events in this study we mainly focused on the most severe droughts which are the worst scenarios that water managers are typically concerned with therefore the reliability values are relatively low 4 3 uncertainties associated with the non stationary water availability and demand both sides of the non stationarities water availability and demand involve considerable uncertainties for the availability side uncertainties can be attributed to climate models greenhouse gas emission scenarios downscaling methods and hydrological models among these uncertainties associated with gcm structures are generally the largest kay et al 2009 prudhomme davies 2009a b bennett et al 2012 by choosing 8 gcm models the uncertainties from different gcm structures can be represented in this study on average this uncertainty can result in a 13 3 variation of relative storage fig 6a and an 18 7 variation of supply reliability fig 6b for period 2 with respect to the demand side primary sources of uncertainties include population growth rate and wupcd change rate billings jones 2011 the uncertainties from population growth and wupcd changes can be represented using results from the monte carlo simulation fig 3 using the projected minimum median maximum water demands in dhsvm res the seasonality of relative storage and supply reliability was generated fig 7 fig 7 shows how these water demand uncertainties represented by the minimum median maximum demand values as shown in fig 3 propagate to the dhsvm res simulated relative storage and supply reliability under the ensemble of drought events for storage clear seasonality can be observed with september having the lowest value this is mainly caused by high summer water consumption beginning in june in addition the high evaporation rate in the summer months also exacerbates the reservoir storage depletion this lowest storage level also leads to the lowest supply reliability in the same month fig 7b compared to period 1 period 2 shows a much larger uncertainty range for both relative storage and water supply reliability for example the storage uncertainty range for september in period 2 is 9 from 54 to 63 while it is 2 72 74 in period 1 similar to the results in fig 6 supply reliability in period 1 is always close to 100 with the exception of august and september because the demand uncertainty during period 1 is small it has little effect on the storage and supply reliability however in period 2 demand uncertainty will have a significant impact the resultant uncertainty range of supply reliability in september for period 2 is 19 71 90 as discussed above both availability and water demand have notable uncertainties thus it is essential to identify which of these parts plays a more dominant role with regard to water supply resilience we compared the water resilience level in terms of relative storage and reliability driven by each gcm and water demand scenario fig 8 for relative storage the uncertainty range associated with gcms is from 51 to 73 while that from the increasing water demand is from 59 to 69 water supply reliability is in the 77 98 uncertainty range with gcms and the water demand uncertainty range is from 83 to 97 in general water availability non stationarity shows a slightly larger uncertainty range it is worth noting that these range values were calculated from an ensemble mean averaged either from the 8 gcms or from the 3 demand scenarios because the study site for this research is the city of dallas one of the fastest growing large cities in the u s the uncertainty range results from water demand non stationarity are considerably significant however the gcm based uncertainty is larger 4 4 mitigation strategy evaluations in order to improve the water supply reliability dwu has proposed several mitigation strategies such as additional conservation integrating a new water source and water use redistribution in this study the efficiency of these mitigation strategies was tested using dhsvm res 1 additional conservation additional conservation mainly includes improving water use technology and reducing leakage and outdoor water use the estimated saving percentage of total water use is 7 twdb 2016 these additional conservation practices are proposed on top of the traditional conservation measures especially during drought events the traditional and long term conservation measures e g public awareness policy intervention were incorporated into the wupcd projections r u in eq 1 which tempers down the overall demand increase due to population growth 2 integrating a new water source lake palestine is a reservoir located in the nearby neches river basin and is proposed to supply water to dallas in the future palestine is estimated to be able to provide 3 86 105 m3 d for dwu however the long distance to dallas requires intensive construction of pipelines for water transfer 3 water use redistribution the current water use distribution among these reservoirs is based on the travel distance to the city instead of the water availability conservation storage for each reservoir for example lake tawakoni has the largest conservation storage which accounts for 23 8 of the total storage from the 7 reservoirs yet it only contributes 10 9 of the total water supply redistributing the water use among these reservoirs based on reservoir storage can significantly improve the water supply reliability 4 combination strategy a combination of aforementioned 3 strategies was also tested we compared the efficiency of these strategies over the longest potential future drought projected from gfdl esm2m during period 2 i e the most extreme drought with the business as usual scenario i e no mitigation strategies fig 9 shows that reservoir storage is continuously depleted during the drought for all of the strategies the strategy by redistributing the water use shows the lowest relative storage consequently even though more water can be supplied in the beginning reliability will drop significantly around month 50 both additional conservation and new water source strategies show a slight increase of supply reliability when all of these three strategies are combined supply reliability shows the most improvement the average supply reliability during the drought for business as usual is 77 8 while it is 81 0 81 8 87 3 and 93 7 for strategy 1 through strategy 4 these relative low reliability values are mainly caused by the chosen gcm i e gfdl esm2m which projects the worst drought in the future in this example demonstration a non parametric kolmogorov smirnov test was carried out to test whether the supply reliability is significantly improved using these strategies as compared with the baseline run p values for the tests fig 9b show that both redistribution and combined strategies can significantly improve the supply reliability however the redistribution strategy shows no improvement for the extreme condition and has even worse supply reliability around month 50 therefore compared with the individual strategies the combined strategy is the most appropriate option to efficiently increase the water supply reliability there are two limitations worth noting in the strategy evaluations first we tested these strategies only based on hydrologic factors without considering economic factors although we acknowledge that hydrologic evaluation needs to be complemented with economic analysis before supporting decision making for example an economic evaluation would allow for the design of a step wise curtailment of the water supply as the drought intensifies in order to improve the water supply reliability in the long term and inform cost benefit evaluation for additional infrastructure or contracts second we used uniform mitigation strategies in a drought event however water managers might use adaptive management changing strategies based on the strategy performance in real world situations which will improve supply reliability gao et al 2016 the representativeness of the results from this study is limited by several assumptions first we assumed that the initial reservoir level is at the top of the conservation pool at the onset of the drought although this makes the analysis straight forward it tends to underestimate water stress another assumption is the simplified representation of the urban water demand eq 1 based on population growth and wupcd changes however other factors such as economic development drought specific increase in landscape water demand water conservation and efficiency measures can significantly affect our estimates although population growth and wupcd have the largest impact finally dallas fully depends on surface water and therefore the groundwater contribution less than 3 of total water supply twdb 2016 was not considered in this study however techniques such as the managed aquifer recharge mar method can help to store water in the underlying trinity aquifer system gao et al 2014 similar to the function of surface water reservoirs the aquifer could help improving the supply reliability for dallas in the future in addition groundwater should be incorporated in other study areas where it plays a significant part in the water supply system 5 conclusions the resilience of water supply systems is affected by water availability and water demand both of which are characterized with non stationarity in this study by applying dhsvm res which integrates detailed hydrology with water management operations under selected multi year drought scenarios in the city of dallas we quantified how the combined non stationarity and uncertainties in multi year drought severities and water demand growth will impact the future water supply resilience reduced availability is induced by the future droughts derived from gcm projections and growing demand is calculated using monte carlo simulation by taking into account the population growth and wupcd change uncertainties using reservoir relative storage and water supply reliability as resilience metrics the conclusions of this study are 1 both non stationarities in water availability associated with drought changes and demand associated with demand growth have significant impacts on the water supply resilience droughts in period 2 2050 2099 are much more severe with longer duration than those in period 1 2000 2049 consequently water supply becomes less reliable in period 2 with no curtailments or changes in operations supply reliability could drop to 26 after a 4 year drought the first decision point at which reliability drops under 100 decreases from 24 months to 14 months from period 1 to period 2 2 both uncertainties associated with availability and demand non stationarity are large and their combination affects the projected future water resilience estimates for water availability the primary source of uncertainties is gcm structure in this study it was found that the gcm model ensemble which contains the 8 best performing models for drought simulation in the region results in an average of 22 uncertainty range in relative storage and an average of 21 uncertainty range in supply reliability when taking period 2 as an example for water demand the uncertainties are from population growth and wupcd reduction and result in a 10 range in relative storage and 14 in supply reliability over the second period both uncertainties are of the same order of magnitude which should further motivate water supply resources adequacy studies to explicitly consider both as none clearly dominates potential decision making 3 none of the tested individual water management strategies i e additional conservation integrating a new water source and water use redistribution alone would be sufficient to significantly improve the water supply resilience for the city of dallas under combined uncertainties in multi year drought induced water availability decrease and population growth induced water demand increase a combination of these adaptation strategies is more appropriate for more robust long term water supply resilience with the feedback to water availability represented this fully integrated framework can help inform economic analysis to select the best mitigation strategy this study demonstrates an end to end approach for evaluating water supply resilience under multiple sources of non stationarity in an urbanized watershed it bridges the gap between climate projections demographic projections high resolution hydrological modeling water management operations and best management practices the current framework allows for representing water availability and associated uncertainties in space and time in a consistent manner instead of deriving synthetic uncorrelated flow at each reservoir the simulation results can be beneficial for the city managers to improve the water supply resilience especially under extreme conditions acknowledgements both gz and hg were supported by the u s national science
