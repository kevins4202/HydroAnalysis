19400,colored dissolved organic matter cdom has been widely studied as part of efforts to improve understanding of the aquatic carbon cycle by laboratory in situ and remote sensing methods we studied ecoregion scale differences in cdom and dissolved organic carbon doc to understand variability in organic matter composition and the use of cdom as a proxy for doc data from 299 lakes across the u s upper midwest showed that cdom measured as absorptivity at 440 nm a 440 correlated strongly with doc r2 0 81 n 412 colored lakes in the northern lakes and forests nlf ecoregion drove this relationship lakes in the north central hardwood forests nchf had low color most had a 440 3 m 1 and weaker cdom doc relationships r2 0 47 spectral slopes and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva indicated relatively low aromaticity and non terrestrial dom sources in low color lakes multiple regression analyses that included total dissolved nitrogen tdn and cdom but not chlorophyll a improved doc estimates in low color lakes suggesting a dominant contribution of non planktonic sources of low color dom in these lakes our results show that cdom is a reliable regional proxy for doc in lakes where forests and wetlands dominate the landscape and the dom is primarily terrestrial in origin mapping of lake doc at broad spatial scales by satellite derived cdom has lower accuracy in low color lakes

griffin et al 2018 kutser et al 2015 olmanson et al 2016 and in situ sensors in streams pellerin et al 2012 sobczak and raymond 2015 dom originates from a variety of sources including natural autochthonous and allochthonous sources as well as anthropogenic sources such as wastewater effluent and agricultural and urban runoff cdom largely derives from leachate of decayed terrestrial and aquatic vegetation in waters with relatively low cdom levels autochthonous production of organic matter by phytoplankton and aquatic macrophytes is an important cdom source dom consists of many diverse molecules sipler et al 2017 and aromatic compounds are important components of cdom hur et al 2009 yang et al 2015 which is strongly related to the fraction of hydrophobic organic acids by absorbing light in ultraviolet and visible wavelengths cdom plays a major role in lake functioning by reducing the depth at which photosynthesis can occur karlsson et al 2015 koizumi et al 2018 thrane

based models relating laboratory measured cdom to satellite reflectance can result in large datasets that track cdom through time and space kutser 2012 these empirical models rely upon relationships between reflectance in the visible or near infrared spectrum to absorption at uv or blue wavelengths which are influenced by both the quantity and composition of dom as ongoing work in our lab shows remote sensing cdom models generally must be calibrated on regional to local scales as differences in atmospheric corrections and water quality parameters such as suspended solids mineralogy particle size and algal communities make it difficult to transfer models between regions brezonik et al 2015 griffin et al 2018 although cdom itself is an inherently important variable due to its effects on light and photochemistry karlsson et al 2009 cdom is widely used to estimate doc for study of freshwater carbon cycling chen et al 2017 spencer et al 2012 tehrani et al 2013 in many riverine systems estimation of doc from cdom works well stedmon et al 2011 yamashita et al 2011 although important exceptions occur especially in large impounded rivers e g the st lawrence columbia and colorado rivers spencer et al 2012 lakes and lake influenced rivers may have weaker cdom doc relationships owing to production of low color autochthonous dom from phytoplankton and macrophytes as well inputs of low color dom from wastewater effluent or agricultural run off to surface waters may shift the cdom doc relationship from that found in forested watersheds here we examine ecoregional variability in cdom properties using a multi year multi season dataset of lake samples across two north temperate ecoregions in the u s upper midwest the north central hardwood forests nchf and northern lakes and forests nlf we aimed to determine general conditions in which cdom may be used as a reliable proxy for doc on broad regional scales our results indicate that cdom and doc are strongly related in highly colored lakes and the nlf generally but doc in low color lakes cannot be predicted reliably from cdom alone 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection and processing we collected 412 samples from 2014 to 2016 from 299 lake sites in the nlf and nchf which span the upper midwest states of minnesota wisconsin and michigan usa fig 1 the nlf is heavily forested 49 with many wetlands 27 and areas of open water 5 as calculated from the 2011 national land cover data set homer et al 2015 developed land accounts for 4 of the nlf and agriculture covers another 7 of the land surface in contrast 48 of the nchf is used for agricultural purposes and 9 is urban while wetlands only account for 10 of land cover and forests account for 26 many lakes were sampled repeatedly 2 6 times over the course of three years water was collected from 0 25 m below the lake surface using acid washed and triple rinsed polycarbonate or high density polyethylene hdpe bottles the bulk of the lake water samples 301 out of 412 were collected by university of minnesota personnel with the remainder collected by partner organizations samples for chlorophyll and dissolved constituents were filtered within 24 h of collection the dissolved fraction was obtained by filtering the water through 0 45 μm geotech high capacity capsule filters samples for doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were acidified using 2 m hcl and stored in pre ashed 20 ml glass bottles at 4 c filtered water for measurement of cdom absorbance spectra was stored in pre ashed 40 ml amber glass bottles with no headspace samples for dissolved inorganic carbon dic were filtered and stored in pre ashed 20 ml glass bottles with no headspace chlorophyll a was isolated from the water by vacuum filtering onto 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate filters and stored frozen until analysis for the sampling done by partner organizations water samples were filtered in the field with syringe mounted whatman gf f filters and doc and tdn samples were placed in hdpe bottles and then frozen for storage other dissolved constituents were stored in the same manner as the umn samples as described above samples collected by partner organizations were shipped overnight to the university of minnesota for subsequent analyses chlorophyll a was not collected by the partner organizations 2 2 sample analysis doc and tdn were measured on a shimadzu toc l csn analyzer after acidification and sparging dic was calculated as the difference in carbon between doc and non acidified water samples analyzed on the shimadzu uv visible light absorbance of filtered water samples λ 200 800 nm was measured using a shimadzu 1601uv pc dual beam spectrophotometer through 1 or 5 cm quartz cuvettes against a nanopure water blank absorbance values were converted to absorptivity absorption coefficients using 1 a λ 2 303a λ l where a is the absorption coefficient at a given wavelength λ a is absorbance at wavelength λ and l is the cell path length m absorbance scans were blank corrected before conversion specific uv absorbance suva was calculated by dividing uv absorbance a at 254 nm by doc concentration in mg l after correcting for the cell path length spectral slope parameters s were calculated using a nonlinear fit of an exponential function to absorption in the ranges 275 295 nm 350 400 nm and 400 460 nm as in the following equation 2 a λ a λ ref e s λ λref where a is the absorption coefficient at a given wavelength λ λ ref is a reference wavelength and s is the slope fitting parameter s r was calculated as the ratio of s 275 295 to s350 400 chlorophyll a chl a was measured using standard fluorometric methods after 90 acetone extraction a subset of samples was analyzed for nitrate nitrite no3 no2 and ammonium using a lachat quickchem fia hach company with a detection limit of 10 μg l n 36 2 3 data analysis data analyses were performed in r using base code and packages caret segmented and metrics doc and a 440 failed shapiro wilks normality tests and were thus natural log transformed for regression analyses figures were made in r using ggplot2 and gridextra except for fig 1 which was created in arcgis v10 5 1 3 results lakes in the nlf generally had higher cdom values and greater variability in cdom quantity and compositional parameters than nchf lakes table 1 for example the mean standard deviation a 440 for nlf lakes was 6 05 7 03 m 1 n 313 compared with 1 45 1 08 m 1 n 107 for nchf lakes similarly suva an indicator of aromaticity was higher and more variable in the nlf lakes 3 09 1 35 l mg c 1 m 1 than in the nchf lakes 2 09 0 69 l mg c 1 m 1 nchf lakes generally contained higher chl a concentrations table 1 and a greater range of tdn concentrations than nlf lakes these results summarize all the individual measurements including those for 58 lakes sampled multiple times across years and or seasons log transformed cdom a 440 was strongly and linearly related to log transformed doc across the entire dataset r2 0 81 table 2 fig 2 3 ln doc 1 946 0 388 lna 440 high variability was observed in low color waters a 440 3 m 1 an a 440 of 3 m 1 was used to divide waters into low and high colored groups based on visual inspection of the doc a 440 relationship this threshold is approximately where waters become visibly brown or tea colored to the human eye although a piecewise regression analysis did not yield a significant breakpoint where the slope of the doc a 440 relationship changed the two groups a 440 3 and 3 m 1 nonetheless showed strikingly different relationships between doc and a 440 in addition similar piecewise regression analyses of s 275 295 and suva vs a 440 showed significant inflection points at 2 67 and 3 44 m 1 respectively when only lakes with a 440 exceeding 3 m 1 were considered r2 increased to 0 90 and the slope increased from 0 388 in equation 3 to 0 569 in contrast for a 440 3 m 1 doc and a 440 were only moderately correlated r2 0 44 with a lower slope 0 285 than either of the above regressions table 2 fig 2 nchf lakes were predominantly low in color with 95 samples having a 440 3 m 1 and only 10 samples with a 440 3 m 1 maximum a 440 of 5 3 m 1 further analysis of differences between ecoregions within low color samples showed differences in intercept and rmse but the slopes of doc versus cdom relationships were not significantly different between the two ecoregions ancova p 0 4646 additional optical characteristics such as suva and spectral slopes also showed differences in organic matter quality between low and high color lakes optical characteristics within the uv b and uv c regions correlated more closely with a 440 than with doc fig 3 suva was correlated more strongly with natural log transformed a 440 r2 0 89 than with log transformed doc r2 0 67 s 275 295 similarly showed a more robust relationship with log transformed a 440 r2 0 85 than with log transformed doc r2 0 57 fig 3 in contrast spectral slopes for uv a and visible wavelengths s 350 400 and s 400 460 had low r2 values for both log transformed a 440 and doc ranging from 0 03 to 0 14 s r the ratio of s 275 295 and s 350 400 moderately correlated with a 440 and doc r2 0 62 and 0 43 respectively as might be expected for a parameter that relies on both uv b and uv a wavelengths fig s1 low color samples ranged widely in spectral slope values particularly for slopes at longer wavelengths fig 2 s1 above 3 m 1 however most of these longer wavelength optical characteristics were stable or showed small positive increases we also explored whether other limnological properties such as dic chl a and tdn provided useful information on dom properties dic did not correlate with cdom or doc and was not a significant parameter in multiple regressions to predict doc with other variables chl a was not strongly related to cdom doc or suva when all samples were considered together but separating the nlf and nchf samples produced clear differences in chl a patterns with the three parameters fig 4 for nlf sites chl a did not correlate with cdom doc and suva r2 0 05 0 05 0 12 respectively and chl a concentrations changed little across the ranges of these organic matter metrics chl a varied widely across nchf sites but regressions between organic matter spectral characteristics and chl a remained weak for example a 440 had the weakest relationship with chl a for nchf samples r2 0 07 p 0 014 while that for doc was slightly higher r2 0 13 p 0 001 because doc can be a product of both allochthonous usually colored and autochthonous low colored dom sources we considered whether a multiple regression using both chl a and cdom would improve doc predictions compared to equation 3 table 3 for 264 samples where chl a a 440 and doc were all available chl a was only a weakly significant parameter in multiple regression p 0 0339 compared to equation 3 including chlorophyll a with cdom to predict doc increased r2 marginally from 0 81 to 0 84 in low colored lakes chl a was significant p 0 0001 but the r2 did not change with its inclusion in a multiple regression chl a was not a significant predictor of doc in highly colored lakes p 0 522 nitrate and ammonium concentrations were low in the subset analyzed with many samples falling below the detection limit of 10 μg l 72 and 69 respectively these results show that tdn was dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen as expected during summer conditions in lake surface waters finlay et al 2013 overall concentrations of tdn were moderate to low 1 5 mg l as with chl a the tdn a 440 relationship was different for nlf and nchf sites in the nlf tdn increased with a 440 fig 4c r2 0 68 slope 0 0267 p 0 0001 the a 440 tdn relationship explained less of the tdn variance in the nchf and had a much higher slope fig 4d r2 0 29 slope 0 151 p 0 0001 when tdn and cdom were used in a multiple regression analyses for doc r2 improved to 0 92 for the whole data set and tdn was a highly significant parameter p 0 0001 table 3 when only sites with a 440 3 m 1 were used a large increase in r2 from 0 44 to 0 77 was found when tdn was included highly colored sites showed only slight improvement in accuracy with the inclusion of tdn in part because of the already strong relationship between a440 and doc two term and three term models have also been used to predict doc in freshwater and marine environments a variety of parameters have been used including absorbance at 254 270 and or 350 nm carter et al 2012 tipping et al 2009 absorptivity at 275 and 295 nm fichot and benner 2011 and inclusion of spectral slopes asmala et al 2012 we used a 254 in addition to a 440 because wavelengths in the uv c spectrum resulted in the most robust models in previous studies the two term absorptivity models increased r2 by 0 05 0 09 relative to a single term model for groups of low color high color and all lakes table 3 nonetheless two term models using tdn and a 440 were more effective at estimating doc than using absorption at two different wavelengths particularly for low color lakes 4 discussion the central goal of this study was to assess the regional variability in cdom doc relationships across a wide range of lakes and examine factors that control such variability overall cdom and doc were highly correlated particularly in lakes with a 440 3 m 1 in less colored lakes particularly in the mixed land cover conditions of the nchf the composition of dom varied more widely leading to weaker relationships between cdom and doc cdom has become widely used as a proxy for doc in freshwater systems brezonik et al 2015 spencer et al 2012 but its validity has yet to be widely evaluated in lakes li et al 2016 massicotte et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2013 using a large database of lake measurements from three upper midwest states we found clear differences in dom composition associated with cdom levels and two large ecoregions low color lakes in both ecoregions show a greater diversity of spectral characteristics and relatively weak relationships between cdom and doc than highly colored lakes table 2 thus mapping lake carbon pools using satellite remote sensing of cdom is most reliable for lakes of a440 3 m 1 low color dom in lakes can be sourced from both anthropogenic landscapes and autochthonous production widespread wetland drainage dahl 1990 land use change and hydrological management practices e g tile drainage leads to decreased inputs of highly colored dom to aquatic systems from the landscape dalzell et al 2011 giling et al 2014 li et al 2018 allochthonous organic matter inputs from agricultural or urban landscapes may be substantial hosen et al 2014 xenopoulos et al 2003 but overall the organic matter in such systems lacks abundant aromatic light absorbing compounds tsui and finlay 2011 landscape modification has also led to increasing eutrophication of midwestern lakes with substantial autochthonous production of low color dom from both phytoplankton and macrophytes meili 1992 sommaruga and augustin 2006 zhang et al 2009 only 12 colored lakes had chl a concentrations exceeding 10 μg l reflecting low standing stocks of algal biomass and productivity typical of oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes in contrast 30 of low color lakes had chl a levels exceeding 10 μg l fig 4 indicating potentially substantial production of low color autochthonous dom through processes such as cell lysis zooplankton grazing and microbial exudates in the lakes studied here tdn is dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen don and is strongly related to doc concentrations fig 4 in low color lakes the doc tdn ratio averaged 17 3 in line with the c n ratio of autochthonous dom from both phytoplankton and macrophytes qu et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 the higher average c n ratio of 28 0 for colored lakes a 440 3 m 1 is indicative of greater terrestrial dom inputs in addition to phytoplankton abundant macrophytes in many lakes could have produced substantial amounts of low color autochthonous dom ginger et al 2017 lapierre and frenette 2009 mann and wetzel 1996 chl a primarily an indicator of phytoplankton biomass thus by itself cannot explain the variability in cdom doc relationships introduced by macrophytic dom the low c n ratio of dom from both phytoplankton and macrophytes contributes to the power of tdn in multiple regression with cdom to predict doc table 3 previous studies accounted for the presence of low color doc in natural waters by using two term models often absorbance at 254 nm and 350 nm carter et al 2012 although other wavelengths could be used fichot and benner 2011 as with spectral slope values or ratios e g a 250 a 365 as in peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 two term models allow for variations in absorbance to reflect both the total amount and composition of organic matter compositional changes even as doc remains constant would lead to shifts in absorbance at one wavelength relative to another adams et al 2018 such two term models generally are most effective when using absorption in uv wavelengths which limits their use in remote sensing contexts both field observations and experimental mesocosm results adams et al 2018 have shown that these two term models can be effective when phytoplankton are the major source of doc the limited significance of chl a in our own models suggests however that additional sources of low color dom are important from either macrophytes or anthropogenic run off the optical characteristics of these sources have not yet been as thoroughly characterized as more humic end members or phytoplankton derived dom further forest type is an important factor in determining cdom doc relationships that cannot be explained by chl a for instance li et al 2018 found that doc cdom ratios were consistent in evergreen leaf leachate but could vary widely in leachate from deciduous plants the transition from mixed broadleaf forest to evergreen forests between the nchf and nlf could thus also drive the differences in cdom doc relationships between the two ecoregions fe previously has also been implicated in increasing absorptivity in boreal waters e g weyhenmeyer et al 2014 but such interference does explain cdom doc variance in low color lakes of the upper midwest where fe is also typically low eilers et al 1988 poulin et al 2014 unpublished data additionally asmala et al 2012 demonstrated fe was only important in two term doc predictive models if absorption at 520 nm or more was used as the second term microbial transformation and removal of dom also may influence cdom doc relationships mann et al 2012 ostapenia et al 2009 compositional characteristics of dom in the nchf such as low c n ratios high s 275 295 and low suva suggest that this dom is labile and can be quickly removed from the waterscape frey et al 2016 such preferential removal of low color dom can shift cdom doc relationships as recalcitrant humic material tends to remain in the water column and undergoes further microbial degradation or photochemical processing only slowly as described in many river systems creed et al 2015 stackpoole et al 2017 microbial degradation may have driven some of the large variability in dom composition within low color lakes where labile and semi labile dom may have been consumed at varying rates evidence from the upper mississippi river however indicates that terrestrially derived doc is preserved even as the doc is transported downstream voss et al 2017 in a drainage basin that overlaps with both the nchf and nlf photochemical processes often play important roles in transforming dom from both terrestrial and microbial sources in lake rich environments in contrast to microbial processing which leads to the loss of low color dom photobleaching leads to preferential loss of cdom relative to overall doc concentrations in lake epilimnia berto et al 2013 osburn et al 2009 the highly connected waterscape of the nlf may lead to long exposure of dom to solar radiation the importance of photodegradation to dom loss on a watershed or ecoregional scales has yet to be quantified for the upper great lakes region s 275 295 has been previously used as an indicator of photobleaching helms et al 2008 if photobleaching were a strong driver of dom composition we would expect marked variability in s 275 295 relative to doc in colored lakes and indeed s 275 295 had a weaker relationship with doc than with cdom in waters with a 440 3 m 1 indicating that photochemical reactions might influence dom composition despite this s275 295 and sr both remain unchanging where a 440 exceeds 3 m 1 contrary to what would be expected if photobleaching was a significant driver of changes in dom composition in highly colored lakes additionally consistency of the relationship between doc and cdom above 3 m 1 across our dataset suggests that photobleaching had limited influence on colored lakes solar irradiation can also lead to the formation of humic like substances from proteinaceous material in clear shallow lakes where uv b is not absorbed by other material berto et al 2013 bianco et al 2014 such processes may be important in oligotrophic groundwater fed lakes like dean and schwalb 2002 but are unlikely to be major factors controlling cdom in most lakes within our study region the composition of dom and thus a 440 doc relationships also has temporal components such as the introduction of photo labile humic microbial dom to the epilimnion during spring turnover osburn et al 2001 indeed our sampling included the unusual hydrological year of 2016 where record breaking precipitation throughout minnesota led to extensive flooding and mobilization of sediments and nutrients our intra annual sampling of minnesota lakes showed that a 440 doc relationships remained mostly stable table s2 reflecting the idea that the drivers of cdom levels act on longer timescales than the drivers of suspended solids or chlorophyll a levels in lakes stadelmann et al 2001 a few sites did show large changes in dom composition over the course of the summer and fall staring lake in suburban minneapolis showed large deviations from the doc expected based on equation 3 with residuals as much as 6 mg l staring lake has undergone significant restoration efforts including carp removal which may have contributed to changing patterns of autochthonous production in most lakes however storage effects and long residence times mute the hydrological and biogeochemical signals that might be expected in response to storm or snow melt events strock et al 2016 5 conclusions can cdom be used as a proxy for doc in temperate lakes cdom doc relationships in lakes are products of variability in watershed land use hydrological connectivity and autochthonous production our results show that autochthonous production and anthropogenic influences on landscapes lead to large variations in doc relative to cdom in low color temperate lakes doc in low colored lakes showed only moderate correlations with a 440 in both the nlf and nchf ecoregions incorporating tdn data into predictive models for low color lakes improved estimates of doc in both ecoregions although chl a was not predictive low color doc may thus be derived from macrophytes and phytoplankton within a lake or external anthropogenic sources such as wastewater and urban run off real time mapping of doc from cdom in low color lakes is thus limited without ancillary water quality data in visibly colored lakes a 440 3 m

estimation of doc from cdom works well stedmon et al 2011 yamashita et al 2011 although important exceptions occur especially in large impounded rivers e g the st lawrence columbia and colorado rivers spencer et al 2012 lakes and lake influenced rivers may have weaker cdom doc relationships owing to production of low color autochthonous dom from phytoplankton and macrophytes as well inputs of low color dom from wastewater effluent or agricultural run off to surface waters may shift the cdom doc relationship from that found in forested watersheds here we examine ecoregional variability in cdom properties using a multi year multi season dataset of lake samples across two north temperate ecoregions in the u s upper midwest the north central hardwood forests nchf and northern lakes and forests nlf we aimed to determine general conditions in which cdom may be used as a reliable proxy for doc on broad regional scales our results indicate that cdom and doc are strongly related in highly colored lakes and the nlf generally but doc in low color lakes cannot be predicted reliably from cdom alone 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection and processing we collected 412 samples from 2014 to 2016 from 299 lake sites in the nlf and nchf which span the upper midwest states of minnesota wisconsin and michigan usa fig 1 the nlf is heavily forested 49 with many wetlands 27 and areas of open water 5 as calculated from the 2011 national land cover data set homer et al 2015 developed land accounts for 4 of the nlf and agriculture covers another 7 of the land surface in contrast 48 of the nchf is used for agricultural purposes and 9 is urban while wetlands only account for 10 of land cover and forests account for 26 many lakes were sampled repeatedly 2 6 times over the course of three years water was collected from 0 25 m below the lake surface using acid washed and triple rinsed polycarbonate or high density polyethylene hdpe bottles the bulk of the lake water samples 301 out of 412 were collected by university of minnesota personnel with the remainder collected by partner organizations samples for chlorophyll and dissolved constituents were filtered within 24 h of collection the dissolved fraction was obtained by filtering the water through 0 45 μm geotech high capacity capsule filters samples for doc and total dissolved nitrogen tdn were acidified using 2 m hcl and stored in pre ashed 20 ml glass bottles at 4 c filtered water for measurement of cdom absorbance spectra was stored in pre ashed 40 ml amber glass bottles with no headspace samples for dissolved inorganic carbon dic were filtered and stored in pre ashed 20 ml glass bottles with no headspace chlorophyll a was isolated from the water by vacuum filtering onto 0 22 μm cellulose nitrate filters and stored frozen until analysis for the sampling done by partner organizations water samples were filtered in the field with syringe mounted whatman gf f filters and doc and tdn samples were placed in hdpe bottles and then frozen for storage other dissolved constituents were stored in the same manner as the umn samples as described above samples collected by partner organizations were shipped overnight to the university of minnesota for subsequent analyses chlorophyll a was not collected by the partner organizations 2 2 sample analysis doc and tdn were measured on a shimadzu toc l csn analyzer after acidification and sparging dic was calculated as the difference in carbon between doc and non acidified water samples analyzed on the shimadzu uv visible light absorbance of filtered water samples λ 200 800 nm was measured using a shimadzu 1601uv pc dual beam spectrophotometer through 1 or 5 cm quartz cuvettes against a nanopure water blank absorbance values were converted to absorptivity absorption coefficients using 1 a λ 2 303a λ l where a is the absorption coefficient at a given wavelength λ a is absorbance at wavelength λ and l is the cell path length m absorbance scans were blank corrected before conversion specific uv absorbance suva was calculated by dividing uv absorbance a at 254 nm by doc concentration in mg l after correcting for the cell path length spectral slope parameters s were calculated using a nonlinear fit of an exponential function to absorption in the ranges 275 295 nm 350 400 nm and 400 460 nm as in the following equation 2 a λ a λ ref e s λ λref where a is the absorption coefficient at a given wavelength λ λ ref is a reference wavelength and s is the slope fitting parameter s r was calculated as the ratio of s 275 295 to s350 400 chlorophyll a chl a was measured using standard fluorometric methods after 90 acetone extraction a subset of samples was analyzed for nitrate nitrite no3 no2 and ammonium using a lachat quickchem fia hach company with a detection limit of 10 μg l n 36 2 3 data analysis data analyses were performed in r using base code and packages caret segmented and metrics doc and a 440 failed shapiro wilks normality tests and were thus natural log transformed for regression analyses figures were made in r using ggplot2 and gridextra except for fig 1 which was created in arcgis v10 5 1 3 results lakes in the nlf generally had higher cdom values and greater variability in cdom quantity and compositional parameters than nchf lakes table 1 for example the mean standard deviation a 440 for nlf lakes was 6 05 7 03 m 1 n 313 compared with 1 45 1 08 m 1 n 107 for nchf lakes similarly suva an indicator of aromaticity was higher and more variable in the nlf lakes 3 09 1 35 l mg c 1 m 1 than in the nchf lakes 2 09 0 69 l mg c 1 m 1 nchf lakes generally contained higher chl a concentrations table 1 and a greater range of tdn concentrations than nlf lakes these results summarize all the individual measurements including those for 58 lakes sampled multiple times across years and or seasons log transformed cdom a 440 was strongly and linearly related to log transformed doc across the entire dataset r2 0 81 table 2 fig 2 3 ln doc 1 946 0 388 lna 440 high variability was observed in low color waters a 440 3 m 1 an a 440 of 3 m 1 was used to divide waters into low and high colored groups based on visual inspection of the doc a 440 relationship this threshold is approximately where waters become visibly brown or tea colored to the human eye although a piecewise regression analysis did not yield a significant breakpoint where the slope of the doc a 440 relationship changed the two groups a 440 3 and 3 m 1 nonetheless showed strikingly different relationships between doc and a 440 in addition similar piecewise regression analyses of s 275 295 and suva vs a 440 showed significant inflection points at 2 67 and 3 44 m 1 respectively when only lakes with a 440 exceeding 3 m 1 were considered r2 increased to 0 90 and the slope increased from 0 388 in equation 3 to 0 569 in contrast for a 440 3 m 1 doc and a 440 were only moderately correlated r2 0 44 with a lower slope 0 285 than either of the above regressions table 2 fig 2 nchf lakes were predominantly low in color with 95 samples having a 440 3 m 1 and only 10 samples with a 440 3 m 1 maximum a 440 of 5 3 m 1 further analysis of differences between ecoregions within low color samples showed differences in intercept and rmse but the slopes of doc versus cdom relationships were not significantly different between the two ecoregions ancova p 0 4646 additional optical characteristics such as suva and spectral slopes also showed differences in organic matter quality between low and high color lakes optical characteristics within the uv b and uv c regions correlated more closely with a 440 than with doc fig 3 suva was correlated more strongly with natural log transformed a 440 r2 0 89 than with log transformed doc r2 0 67 s 275 295 similarly showed a more robust relationship with log transformed a 440 r2 0 85 than with log transformed doc r2 0 57 fig 3 in contrast spectral slopes for uv a and visible wavelengths s 350 400 and s 400 460 had low r2 values for both log transformed a 440 and doc ranging from 0 03 to 0 14 s r the ratio of s 275 295 and s 350 400 moderately correlated with a 440 and doc r2 0 62 and 0 43 respectively as might be expected for a parameter that relies on both uv b and uv a wavelengths fig s1 low color samples ranged widely in spectral slope values particularly for slopes at longer wavelengths fig 2 s1 above 3 m 1 however most of these longer wavelength optical characteristics were stable or showed small positive increases we also explored whether other limnological properties such as dic chl a and tdn provided useful information on dom properties dic did not correlate with cdom or doc and was not a significant parameter in multiple regressions to predict doc with other variables chl a was not strongly related to cdom doc or suva when all samples were considered together but separating the nlf and nchf samples produced clear differences in chl a patterns with the three parameters fig 4 for nlf sites chl a did not correlate with cdom doc and suva r2 0 05 0 05 0 12 respectively and chl a concentrations changed little across the ranges of these organic matter metrics chl a varied widely across nchf sites but regressions between organic matter spectral characteristics and chl a remained weak for example a 440 had the weakest relationship with chl a for nchf samples r2 0 07 p 0 014 while that for doc was slightly higher r2 0 13 p 0 001 because doc can be a product of both allochthonous usually colored and autochthonous low colored dom sources we considered whether a multiple regression using both chl a and cdom would improve doc predictions compared to equation 3 table 3 for 264 samples where chl a a 440 and doc were all available chl a was only a weakly significant parameter in multiple regression p 0 0339 compared to equation 3 including chlorophyll a with cdom to predict doc increased r2 marginally from 0 81 to 0 84 in low colored lakes chl a was significant p 0 0001 but the r2 did not change with its inclusion in a multiple regression chl a was not a significant predictor of doc in highly colored lakes p 0 522 nitrate and ammonium concentrations were low in the subset analyzed with many samples falling below the detection limit of 10 μg l 72 and 69 respectively these results show that tdn was dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen as expected during summer conditions in lake surface waters finlay et al 2013 overall concentrations of tdn were moderate to low 1 5 mg l as with chl a the tdn a 440 relationship was different for nlf and nchf sites in the nlf tdn increased with a 440 fig 4c r2 0 68 slope 0 0267 p 0 0001 the a 440 tdn relationship explained less of the tdn variance in the nchf and had a much higher slope fig 4d r2 0 29 slope 0 151 p 0 0001 when tdn and cdom were used in a multiple regression analyses for doc r2 improved to 0 92 for the whole data set and tdn was a highly significant parameter p 0 0001 table 3 when only sites with a 440 3 m 1 were used a large increase in r2 from 0 44 to 0 77 was found when tdn was included highly colored sites showed only slight improvement in accuracy with the inclusion of tdn in part because of the already strong relationship between a440 and doc two term and three term models have also been used to predict doc in freshwater and marine environments a variety of parameters have been used including absorbance at 254 270 and or 350 nm carter et al 2012 tipping et al 2009 absorptivity at 275 and 295 nm fichot and benner 2011 and inclusion of spectral slopes asmala et al 2012 we used a 254 in addition to a 440 because wavelengths in the uv c spectrum resulted in the most robust models in previous studies the two term absorptivity models increased r2 by 0 05 0 09 relative to a single term model for groups of low color high color and all lakes table 3 nonetheless two term models using tdn and a 440 were more effective at estimating doc than using absorption at two different wavelengths particularly for low color lakes 4 discussion the central goal of this study was to assess the regional variability in cdom doc relationships across a wide range of lakes and examine factors that control such variability overall cdom and doc were highly correlated particularly in lakes with a 440 3 m 1 in less colored lakes particularly in the mixed land cover conditions of the nchf the composition of dom varied more widely leading to weaker relationships between cdom and doc cdom has become widely used as a proxy for doc in freshwater systems brezonik et al 2015 spencer et al 2012 but its validity has yet to be widely evaluated in lakes li et al 2016 massicotte et al 2017 wilkinson et al 2013 using a large database of lake measurements from three upper midwest states we found clear differences in dom composition associated with cdom levels and two large ecoregions low color lakes in both ecoregions show a greater diversity of spectral characteristics and relatively weak relationships between cdom and doc than highly colored lakes table 2 thus mapping lake carbon pools using satellite remote sensing of cdom is most reliable for lakes of a440 3 m 1 low color dom in lakes can be sourced from both anthropogenic landscapes and autochthonous production widespread wetland drainage dahl 1990 land use change and hydrological management practices e g tile drainage leads to decreased inputs of highly colored dom to aquatic systems from the landscape dalzell et al 2011 giling et al 2014 li et al 2018 allochthonous organic matter inputs from agricultural or urban landscapes may be substantial hosen et al 2014 xenopoulos et al 2003 but overall the organic matter in such systems lacks abundant aromatic light absorbing compounds tsui and finlay 2011 landscape modification has also led to increasing eutrophication of midwestern lakes with substantial autochthonous production of low color dom from both phytoplankton and macrophytes meili 1992 sommaruga and augustin 2006 zhang et al 2009 only 12 colored lakes had chl a concentrations exceeding 10 μg l reflecting low standing stocks of algal biomass and productivity typical of oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes in contrast 30 of low color lakes had chl a levels exceeding 10 μg l fig 4 indicating potentially substantial production of low color autochthonous dom through processes such as cell lysis zooplankton grazing and microbial exudates in the lakes studied here tdn is dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen don and is strongly related to doc concentrations fig 4 in low color lakes the doc tdn ratio averaged 17 3 in line with the c n ratio of autochthonous dom from both phytoplankton and macrophytes qu et al 2013 zhou et al 2016 the higher average c n ratio of 28 0 for colored lakes a 440 3 m 1 is indicative of greater terrestrial dom inputs in addition to phytoplankton abundant macrophytes in many lakes could have produced substantial amounts of low color autochthonous dom ginger et al 2017 lapierre and frenette 2009 mann and wetzel 1996 chl a primarily an indicator of phytoplankton biomass thus by itself cannot explain the variability in cdom doc relationships introduced by macrophytic dom the low c n ratio of dom from both phytoplankton and macrophytes contributes to the power of tdn in multiple regression with cdom to predict doc table 3 previous studies accounted for the presence of low color doc in natural waters by using two term models often absorbance at 254 nm and 350 nm carter et al 2012 although other wavelengths could be used fichot and benner 2011 as with spectral slope values or ratios e g a 250 a 365 as in peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 two term models allow for variations in absorbance to reflect both the total amount and composition of organic matter compositional changes even as doc remains constant would lead to shifts in absorbance at one wavelength relative to another adams et al 2018 such two term models generally are most effective when using absorption in uv wavelengths which limits their use in remote sensing contexts both field observations and experimental mesocosm results adams et al 2018 have shown that these two term models can be effective when phytoplankton are the major source of doc the limited significance of chl a in our own models suggests however that additional sources of low color dom are important from either macrophytes or anthropogenic run off the optical characteristics of these sources have not yet been as thoroughly characterized as more humic end members or phytoplankton derived dom further forest type is an important factor in determining cdom doc relationships that cannot be explained by chl a for instance li et al 2018 found that doc cdom ratios were consistent in evergreen leaf leachate but could vary widely in leachate from deciduous plants the transition from mixed broadleaf forest to evergreen forests between the nchf and nlf could thus also drive the differences in cdom doc relationships between the two ecoregions fe previously has also been implicated in increasing absorptivity in boreal waters e g weyhenmeyer et al 2014 but such interference does explain cdom doc variance in low color lakes of the upper midwest where fe is also typically low eilers et al 1988 poulin et al 2014 unpublished data additionally asmala et al 2012 demonstrated fe was only important in two term doc predictive models if absorption at 520 nm or more was used as the second term microbial transformation and removal of dom also may influence cdom doc relationships mann et al 2012 ostapenia et al 2009 compositional characteristics of dom in the nchf such as low c n ratios high s 275 295 and low suva suggest that this dom is labile and can be quickly removed from the waterscape frey et al 2016 such preferential removal of low color dom can shift cdom doc relationships as recalcitrant humic material tends to remain in the water column and undergoes further microbial degradation or photochemical processing only slowly as described in many river systems creed et al 2015 stackpoole et al 2017 microbial degradation may have driven some of the large variability in dom composition within low color lakes where labile and semi labile dom may have been consumed at varying rates evidence from the upper mississippi river however indicates that terrestrially derived doc is preserved even as the doc is transported downstream voss et al 2017 in a drainage basin that overlaps with both the nchf and nlf photochemical processes often play important roles in transforming dom from both terrestrial and microbial sources in lake rich environments in contrast to microbial processing which leads to the loss of low color dom photobleaching leads to preferential loss of cdom relative to overall doc concentrations in lake epilimnia berto et al 2013 osburn et al 2009 the highly connected waterscape of the nlf may lead to long exposure of dom to solar radiation the importance of photodegradation to dom loss on a watershed or ecoregional scales has yet to be quantified for the upper great lakes region s 275 295 has been previously used as an indicator of photobleaching helms et al 2008 if photobleaching were a strong driver of dom composition we would expect marked variability in s 275 295 relative to doc in colored lakes and indeed s 275 295 had a weaker relationship with doc than with cdom in waters with a 440 3 m 1 indicating that photochemical reactions might influence dom composition despite this s275 295 and sr both remain unchanging where a 440 exceeds 3 m 1 contrary to what would be expected if photobleaching was a significant driver of changes in dom composition in highly colored lakes additionally consistency of the relationship between doc and cdom above 3 m 1 across our dataset suggests that photobleaching had limited influence on colored lakes solar irradiation can also lead to the formation of humic like substances from proteinaceous material in clear shallow lakes where uv b is not absorbed by other material berto et al 2013 bianco et al 2014 such processes may be important in oligotrophic groundwater fed lakes like dean and schwalb 2002 but are unlikely to be major factors controlling cdom in most lakes within our study region the composition of dom and thus a 440 doc relationships also has temporal components such as the introduction of photo labile humic microbial dom to the epilimnion during spring turnover osburn et al 2001 indeed our sampling included the unusual hydrological year of 2016 where record breaking precipitation throughout minnesota led to extensive flooding and mobilization of sediments and nutrients our intra annual sampling of minnesota lakes showed that a 440 doc relationships remained mostly stable table s2 reflecting the idea that the drivers of cdom levels act on longer timescales than the drivers of suspended solids or chlorophyll a levels in lakes stadelmann et al 2001 a few sites did show large changes in dom composition over the course of the summer and fall staring lake in suburban minneapolis showed large deviations from the doc expected based on equation 3 with residuals as much as 6 mg l staring lake has undergone significant restoration efforts including carp removal which may have contributed to changing patterns of autochthonous production in most lakes however storage effects and long residence times mute the hydrological and biogeochemical signals that might be expected in response to storm or snow melt events strock et al 2016 5 conclusions can cdom be used as a proxy for doc in temperate lakes cdom doc relationships in lakes are products of variability in watershed land use hydrological connectivity and autochthonous production our results show that autochthonous production and anthropogenic influences on landscapes lead to large variations in doc relative to cdom in low color temperate lakes doc in low colored lakes showed only moderate correlations with a 440 in both the nlf and nchf ecoregions incorporating tdn data into predictive models for low color lakes improved estimates of doc in both ecoregions although chl a was not predictive low color doc may thus be derived from macrophytes and phytoplankton within a lake or external anthropogenic sources such as wastewater and urban run off real time mapping of doc from cdom in low color lakes is thus limited without ancillary water quality data in visibly colored lakes a 440 3 m

19401,the treatment of distilled water with varying amounts of dissolved sodium bicarbonate representing alkalinity is considered using an atmospheric pressure electrical discharge the discharge ignited between a capillary tube used as powered electrode and a ground electrode wrapped around the beaker holding the treated water consists of streamers propagating in ambient air and striking the water surface the streamer interaction with water is shown to lead to a decrease in ph and an increase in nitrate concentration the ph variation with time is shown to be similar to a titration curve for acid base neutralization with final ph values around 3 for 22 min of treatment the nitrate ion concentration increase with time is consistent with a two rate system level model that is characterized by two asymptotic rates for n o 3 creation by the plasma the two asymptotic rates are calibrated to be about 2 7 μmol min and 22 5 μmol min with the transition between the two rates occurring at the breakeven time that is representative of the time required for all dissolved bicarbonate to be consumed by the plasma treatment the increase in rate of n o 3 creation at the breakeven time is attributed to the increase in conductivity of the treated solution once all bicarbonate is consumed thereby modifying the plasma properties another system level model that is based on the observed ph variation is also considered for comparison with measured data while both system level models have some discrepancies with the measurements the two rate model based on the nitrate ion concentration is concluded to be more useful for determining the n o 3 formation rates in the context of irrigation water enrichment the discrepancies are attributed to the simplicity of the system level models considered here where the effect of the plasma is completely represented by the creation of just one chemical species in h n o 3 thereby neglecting potentially important species such as h n o 2 and h 2 o 2 nevertheless the proposed system level model could greatly assist in the design of plasma treatment systems with specified alkalinity ph and nitrate ion levels for irrigation water graphical abstract image 1 keywords irrigation water plasma alkalinity dielectric barrier discharge 1 introduction the rapidly growing world population with an estimated 11 billion in 2100 gerland et al 2014 has led to a great emphasis on food security and food production as two major problems that need to be tackled this in turn has contributed to an increased importance of irrigation water management and the need to potentially grow crops in regions that do not have suitable soil or water resources the acidity or alkalinity of the irrigation water valdez aguilar and reed 2007 and soil is an important parameter that determines the suitability for agriculture specifically ph measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in the water soil and should be between 5 5 and 6 5 for most crops to ensure good irrigation water quality simsek and gunduz 2007 the soil and irrigation water ph play a crucial role in determining the outcomes of plant growth zebarth et al 2015 the alkalinity determined by the concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate ions and expressed in units of ppm or mg l or milliequivalents l should also be limited to ensure healthy crops while the tolerable levels of alkalinity are specific to the crop and the container size a general rule of thumb is to limit the bicarbonate levels to 120 mg l and carbonate levels to 15 mg l respectively while the source of irrigation water is region specific the united states geological survey usgs website indicates dieter et al 2018 that out of the 118 000 million gallons per day of irrigation water 60 900 million gallons 52 per day came from surface water with the remaining coming from ground water the principle source of alkalinity in both surface and ground water is the carbon dioxide present in atmosphere in particular unsaturated soil zone subsurface region between land and water table air can contain significant amounts of carbon dioxide that can increase alkalinity of ground water other sources of alkalinity include run off water over landscape rich in limestone here it is worth reiterating the difference between alkaline directly related to ph and alkalinity measure of a solution s ability to neutralize acids in the context of this work primarily dealing with alkalinity of irrigation water the chief contributors are considered to be carbonate and bicarbonate ions even though hydroxyl ion o h contributes to total alkalinity it is not expected to significantly affect the alkalinity of irrigation water in other words the term alkalinity in the entire manuscript refers to carbonate alkalinity as opposed to total alkalinity however it is worth mentioning that the plasma assisted approach can also be used to reduce hydroxide alkalinity while ph and alkalinity values are extremely region specific it is worth mentioning some statistics for ph in various surface water stations in california out of the 28 california stations at which ph measurements are reported by usgs 27 stations have a ph level higher than 7 0 with one station reporting a neutral ph a common approach to decreasing the ph as well as alkalinity to tolerable limits is acidification enoch and olesen 1993 whipker et al 1996 albano et al 2017 or the process of injecting acids into the irrigation water the hydrogen ions in the acid will react with the bicarbonate carbonate ions thereby producing carbon dioxide and water as given below 1 h h c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o 2 2 h c o 3 2 c o 2 h 2 o candidate acids for lowering ph and alkalinity of irrigation water include sulphuric acid nitric acid and phosphoric acid with the specific choice depending on various factors including safety cost and potential side effects to name a few for example nitric acid inspite of possessing several advantages including addition of nitrate n o 3 ions that assist plant growth is seldom used because of difficulties associated with handling concentrated nitric acid it is worth mentioning that the addition of acid to water with bicarbonate carbonate ions will lead to the formation of a corresponding salt based on the acid and the cation attached to the bicarbonate ion as a by product but this has not been reported to be a major concern for plant growth magnetic treatment of irrigation water has also been considered as a candidate for soils with high alkalinity content bogatin et al 1999 maheshwari and grewal 2009 in this context the use of electrical discharges ignited by the application of high voltage in ambient air promises to be an attractive alternative for on the fly acid generation and ph alkalinity reduction in fact nature presents an excellent example of a similar process wherein lightning strikes lead to nitrogen fixation and enhanced soil fertility albeit in limited quantities because of their short duration the electrical discharges considered in this work can be classified as low temperature laboratory plasmas in contrast to fully ionized plasmas that are encountered in space as well as nuclear fusion low temperature plasmas exhibit significant degrees of non equilibrium characterized by hot electrons and cold ions neutrals and are often referred to as non thermal plasmas the hot electrons of plasmas ignited in ambient air have sufficient energy to break the nitrogen and oxygen bonds and triggering a whole host of reactions leading to the formation of dissolved n o 3 ions amongst a whole host of other species in the solution which in turn can neutralize the bicarbonate ions the interaction of atmospheric pressure plasmas with various biological substances has become an active area of research this includes the use of atmospheric pressure non thermal plasmas for water purification malik et al 2001 malik 2010 and wastewater treatment wang et al 2012 tyszler et al 2006 surface modification for tissue engineering chu et al 2002 chen and su 2011 intranuovo et al 2014 agriculture mitsugi et al 2014 ji et al 2016 li et al 2016 park et al 2018 bacterial inactivation traylor et al 2011 and wound healing bekeschus et al 2016 lee et al 2016a b to name a few specifically the role of plasmas in the area of water treatment has been growing exponentially with researchers studying the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics magureanu et al 2015 2011 2010 banaschik et al 2015 and cyanide hijosa valsero et al 2013 enhancement of irrigation water park et al 2013 ji et al 2016 sivachandiran and khacef 2017 judée et al 2017 to name a few the noticeable fact in previous representative work is the wide variety of plasma sources utilized to achieve the required effect plasma ignition has been pursued and demonstrated in the gas phase in the liquid phase foster et al 2010 as well as multiphase with plasma formation in either gas phase with dispersed droplets or liquid phase with gas bubbles sommers and foster 2014 in spite of the large number of publications dealing with various aspects of plasma liquid interaction bruggeman et al 2016 the interaction with alkaline water that contains dissolved bicarbonates carbonates from the perspective of enriching irrigation water has not been considered in detail before a robust energy efficient technology for decreasing alkalinity in surface water would greatly benefit irrigation water quality thereby ensuring ideal growth conditions for the crop an on demand technique using limited raw materials such as the one proposed here would also ensure that there is no need to handle or transport acids utilized for neutralizing in this context the primary goal of the current work is to study the interaction of an atmospheric pressure electrical discharge set up with varying concentrations of sodium bicarbonate dissolved in distilled water apart from decreasing the alkalinity by reacting with bicarbonate the h n o 3 produced due to plasma treatment also assists in increasing the nitrate concentration thereby leading to an enrichment of the irrigation water while the experimental study focuses on measuring ph and nitrate concentration as a function of plasma treatment time the other objective of the current work includes the formulation of a system level model that describes the treatment process thereby assisting in the design and scale up of these plasma treatment systems one aspect of the current work that is worth emphasizing is the use of only sodium bicarbonate to increase the alkalinity and ph of distilled water in reality the alkalinity in irrigation water has contributions from both carbonate and bicarbonate ions this work chose to introduce only of these ions to increase alkalinity with the expectation of simplifying the experimental approach apart from reducing the design space in terms of testing various bicarbonate to carbonate ratios therefore the use of sodium bicarbonate as opposed to sodium carbonate or a combination of both was only by choice however it has been reported somridhivej and boyd 2016 that bicarbonate ion is the primary contributor to alkalinity under near neutral ph 8 3 conditions and this fact motivated our choice also it should be mentioned that the system level model will remain the same even in the presence of sodium carbonate with the only difference being the initial concentration of carbonate ions the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the experimental set up in detail with section 3 describing the system level model section 4 presents the results and discusses the same with section 5 reserved for conclusions 2 experimental set up and diagnostics a dielectric barrier discharge dbd setup was used for all water treatment experiments reported in the current work the primary characteristic of a dbd reactor is the presence of a dielectric layer between the electrical discharge and at least one of the two electrodes there are a wide range of possible sub configurations that satisfy this requirement thereby resulting in the possibility of multiple dbd systems that have been used for various applications ranging from ozone generation eliasson et al 1987 yao et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 to flow control corke et al 2010 a review of the different dbd configurations that have been used for water treatment is presented by vanraes vanraes 2016 while a similar effect could possibly be achieved by various other plasma sources a dbd was used in the current work largely due to the simplicity of the set up in fact prior studies dealing with plasma water interaction have reported configurations where the water itself was used as the ground electrode while it is hard to conclude that one configuration is better than the other without in depth studies comparing the various configurations under identical conditions we believe that a dbd configuration similar to the one used in this work is better for deployment in the field if the system is scaled up to treat flowing water broadly speaking our dbd configuration comprises of a powered electrode and a ground electrode separated by a dielectric material quartz beaker even with the chosen configuration there are several possible sub configurations that one could envision including the presence of a dielectric layer on the high voltage electrode here it should be reiterated that a comparison of the various dbd configurations to identify the optimal configuration is beyond the scope of this paper and is worthy of study we utilized a stainless steel capillary tube as the powered electrode the outer diameter of the powered electrode was 3 mm with a wall thickness of 0 5 mm thereby corresponding to an inner diameter of 2 mm the length of the capillary tube is 49 cm it should be mentioned that the length of the powered electrode has no significant role to play in the plasma properties and was chosen to be long enough to facilitate the installation as described below and shown in figs 1 and 2 the stainless steel capillary tube powered electrode was mounted vertically using a quartz tube with rubber stoppers at both ends the rubber stoppers were equipped with holes wide enough in order to hold the stainless steel electrode in place argon gas was flowed through the stainless steel electrode using an elbow connection and 1 8 in plastic tubing the primary purpose of flowing argon gas was to assist with the plasma ignition since it has a lower breakdown voltage than air the n o 3 that is produced in the treated solution is completely from the surrounding ambient air while the use of argon will increase costs associated with the process it helped in lowering the breakdown voltage which was considered to be important for the laboratory studies performed in this work the use of air nitrogen or oxygen as the gas flowing through the capillary tube is certainly worth exploring from a cost perspective the use of a tunable mixture of nitrogen and oxygen could strongly influence the rate of n o 3 creation in the treated water the flow rate of the argon gas was controlled using a brooks instrument flow meter the flow rate of argon was fixed at 8 slm for all treatment studies presented in this work a beaker filled with 250 ml of distilled water with varying quantities of dissolved sodium bicarbonate was placed under the stainless steel electrode with the stainless steel electrode lined up with the axis of the beaker the beaker was wrapped with a copper electrode serving as the ground electrode with the top of the electrode coinciding with the water level in the beaker the distance between the bottom of the stainless steel electrode and the water surface was fixed at 29 mm the stainless steel electrode was powered using the pvm500 high voltage power supply from information unlimited this power supply is rated for power levels ranging from 10 w to 300 w a voltage amplitude of 20 kv and a current amplitude of 18 ma the frequency of the input excitation can be varied from 20 khz to 70 khz this power supply has been used in similar dbd reactors in nanomaterial synthesis applications ghosh et al 2015 cole et al 2017 the electrical parameters of the discharge were measured using a high voltage probe with the current measurements performed by measuring the voltage across a 1 k ω resistor connected in series with the dbd load since the resistor has a known constant resistance the current through the resistor is directly proportional to the voltage measured across the resistor since the resistor is in series with the plasma load the current through the resistor is same as the current through the plasma load also while the applied voltage and current through the dbd load were measured independently the phase difference was not explicitly measured as a result the exact input power for each of the cases is unknown even though it was ensured that the applied voltage was the same for all treatment studies reported in this work also while the solution was not stirred during the treatment the solution was mechanically stirred for about 30 s prior to each ph n o 3 measurement to ensure complete mixing in the bulk it is also worth mentioning that the plasma liquid interaction induces some natural stirring during the treatment this ensured that there were no concentration gradients in the solution that could lead to incorrect measurements by the sensors the ph measurements of the treated water were performed using a health wiser ph meter with an accuracy of 0 05 and a resolution of 0 01 the nitrate ion concentration measurements were performed using a horiba scientific nitrate meter with an accuracy of 10 the resolution of the nitrate meter depends on the nitrate level and is 1 ppm in the range 0 99 ppm and 10 ppm in the range 100 990 ppm as outlined in the user manual of the nitrate meter the measurement of n o 3 is affected by the presence of several interfering ions including i 1000 c l 4 b r 90 c l o 4 0 3 and n o 2 70 with the corresponding selectivity coefficients percentage error in measurements indicated in the parentheses among the ions which affect the n o 3 measurements the most n o 2 is the only ion that is certainly being introduced in the solution by the plasma and therefore is relevant to the current work there are no sources of any of the other ions in the current work while the presence of an equal concentration of n o 2 leads to an over prediction in the n o 3 concentration by approximately 70 the results plots presented here do not make this correction and is worth mentioning at this stage specifically we make a reasonable assumption that the ratio of nitrate to nitrite ions created by the dbd plasma does not vary during the treatment time this assumption is reasonable since the operating parameters of the dbd plasma are not changed during the duration of treatment while the current work does not quantify this ratio the two rate model could potentially be enhanced using suitable lower rates of n o 3 creation and appropriate n o 2 creation rates both n o 3 and n o 2 ions will contribute to the consumption of the bicarbonate ion thereby modifying the ph in fact it is reasonable to expect that the n o 3 and n o 2 ion concentrations are comparable since modeling studies predict very similar number densities for both n o 2 and n o that are the major sources for n o 3 and n o 2 respectively therefore the n o 3 results reported here could be over predicted by about 70 error corresponding to equal concentrations of n o 2 and n o 3 in the solution in spite of the possibility of this error we would like to emphasize that the two rate model and the conclusions associated with it will all remain the same qualitatively while the two rates reported here for pre breakeven and post breakeven times may have to be fine tuned quantitatively in future as more data becomes available it might even be possible that both rates need to be scaled down by the same level if our assumption of constant nitrate to nitrite ion creation rate is true finally while we discuss about the interplay of n o 2 and n o 3 ions for the measurements reported in this work it is worth mentioning that n o 2 is a potentially useful species for plant growth in fact as part of the nitrogen cycle the ammonium ions an important component of solid fertilizers are converted to nitrite ions by the nitrosomonas bacteria grunditz and dalhammar 2001 these nitrite ions are then converted to nitrate ions by the nitrobacter bacteria grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the nitrate ions are directly absorbed by the plants both nitrobacter and nitrosomonas bacteria are present in the soil and assist in the process of nitrification of ammonium ions the creation of nitrite ions in the treated solution therefore is a positive influence that will eventually lead to nitrates being absorbed by the plants 3 system level model the experimental data obtained in this work were interpreted and analyzed using a system level model that considers the treated water as a control volume with the plasma discharge leading to the formation of dissolved h n o 3 in solution one possible reaction mechanism for the formation of h n o 3 in the treated water stems from the creation of n o 2 in air plasma this n o 2 can combine with the o h radical that is formed at the interface by the electron impact dissociation of water molecule the associated reactions are given by bruggeman et al 2016 3 e h 2 o h o h e 4 n o 2 o h h n o 3 while it is well established that a large number of species is created by plasma discharges ignited in ambient air van gaens and bogaerts 2013 a system level model is extremely useful in obtaining an overall perspective of the influence of plasma on the treated water in this context it needs to be pointed out that n o is another important species that is created by the discharge that will lead to the formation of h n o 2 through a similar reaction mechanism as described above the h n o 2 can react with o 3 leading to the formation of h n o 3 and is given by the reaction 5 o 3 h n o 2 o 2 h n o 3 as discussed earlier modeling studies of a plasma jet in humid air reported van gaens and bogaerts 2013 that the concentrations of n o and n o 2 are comparable for the conditions considered in their work which in turn indicates that both h n o 2 and h n o 3 are created by plasma treatment of water however the system level model considered in the current work emphasizes primarily on the creation of n o 3 with the focus being on irrigation water enrichment for plant growth the simplification of the system level model with n o 3 being the only species considered will be evident in the comparison with experiments where the ph and n o 3 are not completely consistent with each other in other words a whole host of other species including h n o 2 and h 2 o 2 will also contribute to the ph decrease that is observed in the experiments it should be emphasized that developing more detailed models and simulations of plasma liquid interaction is an active area of research lindsay et al 2015 2016 levko et al 2018 and the system level model is not intended as a replacement for those in depth studies in fact the system level model proposed in this work can certainly be improved by the inclusion of a few other species such as h n o 2 in order to determine the ph and n o 3 at a given instant of time t 0 the system level model requires the mass of sodium bicarbonate m n a h c o 3 added to the given volume of distilled water v w along with the total concentration of n o 3 created in the solution by the plasma from t 0 to t t 0 if the rate of creation of n o 3 d n o 3 d t in mol min is known the n o 3 concentration in the water at time t 0 is computed as 6 n o 3 t 0 1 v j 1 n d n o 3 d t j δ t j where v is the volume of treated water the time interval between t 0 and t t 0 is divided into n possibly variable time intervals if there was no dissolved n a h c o 3 in the water then h in the current simplified framework where only h n o 3 is considered would be the same as n o 3 but under the current conditions we need to account for additional reactions involving n a h c o 3 when added to water the sodium bicarbonate dissolves completely leading to the formation of corresponding sodium and bicarbonate ions given by the reaction 7 n a h c o 3 s h 2 o l n a a q h c o 3 a q once free in solution h c o 3 can act as both an acid giving up a proton and a base reacting with a proton due to its amphiprotic nature cairns 2012 8 h c o 3 h h 2 c o 3 9 h c o 3 c o 3 2 h where the equilibrium constants associated with the above reactions are given by cairns 2012 10 k a 1 4 46 10 7 h c o 3 h h 2 c o 3 11 k a 2 4 69 10 11 h c o 3 2 h c o 3 while the carbonate ion can interact with the hydroxyl radical to form the carbonate ion radical and the hydroxide ion this reaction is not considered here and could be one important contribution of the carbonate ion once again the emphasis here is to focus on making some predictions on the process of irrigation water enrichment without increasing the complexity of the model finally the model accounts for the autoionization of water through the reaction 12 h 2 o l h o h with the equilibrium constant given by 13 k w h o h while the nominal value of k w 10 14 this work used k w 10 2 p h initial where p h initial is the initial ph of the distilled water without dissolved n a h c o 3 and plasma treatment the chemical species involved in the system level model therefore include h c o 3 c o 3 2 h o h n a h 2 c o 3 with eq 10 eq 11 and eq 13 providing three equations three additional equations are obtained from the charge balance mass balance of carbon and mass balance of sodium in the system the charge balance condition is given by 14 n o 3 h c o 3 2 c o 3 2 o h h n a the carbon mass balance utilizes the fact that all carbon in the system is provided by the added n a h c o 3 and is given by 15 m n a h c o 3 m n a h c o 3 v w h 2 c o 3 h c o 3 c o 3 2 where m n a h c o 3 is the molar mass of n a h c o 3 the sodium mass balance provides 16 n a m n a h c o 3 m n a h c o 3 v w combining eq 10 eq 11 eq 13 eq 14 eq 15 eq 16 we get a non linear equation for h given by 17 h 2 m n a h c o 3 m n a h c o 3 v w k a 1 h 2 h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 1 2 k a 1 h h k w n o 3 h 0 in the context of this work the n o 3 created by the plasma is not controllable and is used as a free parameter in order to interpret the measured ph and n o 3 in the treated water therefore n o 3 t is known through eq 6 once the h is solved using eq 17 the ph is obtained as 18 p h log h it should be emphasized that the carbonate alkalinity in the system h c o 3 c o 3 2 can be determined once h is known 4 results and discussion this section presents the results obtained for the plasma treatment of distilled water with dissolved sodium bicarbonate and analyzes the results using two system level models one based on calibration using ph data and the other based on the nitrate concentration measurements the experiments involved dissolving a predetermined mass of sodium bicarbonate in 250 ml of distilled water followed by its treatment using the atmospheric pressure streamer discharge set up described earlier the two quantities measured in this work include the hydrogen ion concentration ph and the nitrate ion concentration as indicated in the experimental description section the mass of dissolved sodium bicarbonate varied from 0 mg pure distilled water to 50 mg 200 mg l alkalinity with the plasma treatment time fixed at 22 min the ph and nitrate concentration were measured at intervals of 1 min except during the first minute when measurements were made at 15 s 30 s and 45 s before presenting the treatment results we first present some data on the electrical characteristics of the atmospheric pressure streamer discharge used for the water treatment fig 3 shows the atmospheric pressure streamer discharges in action during a typical water treatment experiment fig 4 shows the time history of the current flowing through the circuit prior to plasma ignition it can be seen clearly that the signal is sinusoidal with a time period of about 0 035 ms thereby translating to a frequency of about 28 khz the values of current are not shown since the actual water treatment studies were performed without the including resistance therefore these current values may not be representative of the actual current values encountered during the treatment however we do not expect the qualitative time history of current to change with the inclusion of the 1 k ω resistor and therefore the current waveforms shown here are expected to be same as the waveforms during treatment even though the voltage history is not shown here it was sinusoidal with a voltage amplitude of about 16 kv in contrast fig 5 shows the time history of current after the streamers are ignited and the differences are immediately obvious specifically a single cycle can further be divided into sinusoidal sub cycles with the amplitude increasing from one sub cycle to another the instant at which the streamers strike the surface of water is characterized by a spike in the time history of current typical of dbd reactors ghosh et al 2015 once the streamer reaches the water surface charge is deposited on the surface thereby leading to the creation of electric fields that will in turn result in a situation wherein the current through the plasma cannot be sustained this is accompanied by a decrease in current magnitude the subsequently increasing amplitude of the current waveform could possibly be due to processes in the liquid and at the interface but requires more conclusive evidence fig 6 shows the measured ph as a function of treatment time for various quantities of dissolved sodium bicarbonate in distilled water including 0 mg 1 mg 2 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 20 mg and 50 mg the initial ph of the distilled water without any dissolved bicarbonate is about 6 which increases to a maximum of 8 with the addition of sodium bicarbonate table 1 summarizes the ph values of the distilled water before and after the addition of sodium bicarbonate it should be noted that the ph of distilled water even before the addition of bicarbonate is not an absolute constant and demonstrates small variations this variation in the ph can be attributed to the fact that the experiments were not performed at the same time with for example the 0 mg and 10 mg cases performed several days apart also the distilled water for different experiments may have come from different bottles with different levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide exposure the average initial ph was 6 15 with a standard deviation of 0 2 this initial ph is an input parameter to our system level model as will be reiterated while summarizing results from the model fig 6 shows that the plasma treatment leads to a reduction in the ph with the shape of the curve being similar to a titration curve between the weak base sodium bicarbonate solution and a strong acid in particular while treatment of distilled water without any added sodium bicarbonate demonstrates a rapid reduction in ph right from the start of treatment 15 mg of dissolved sodium bicarbonate leads to an initial period of slow decrease in ph followed by a rapid reduction when almost all bicarbonate is consumed by the treatment the presence of bicarbonate leads to a time delay in the ph reduction the similarity in the shape of the plasma treatment response to a titrative curve is attributed as described in detail earlier to the formation of h n o 3 that consumes the bicarbonate ions leading to the formation of sodium nitrate the primary difference between a typical titration curve and the plots presented here is in the x coordinate while traditional titration curves are presented with volume of acid added as the x coordinate the results presented here have the treatment time as the x coordinate however it is worth mentioning that the two situations are analogous with an increase in treatment time directly leading to an increase in the concentration of n o 3 created in the solution by the plasma thereby being equivalent to an increase in the volume of acid added in order to present data supporting this claim the nitrate concentration measured as a function of time is shown in fig 7 the nitrate concentration increases with plasma treatment time for all dissolved masses of sodium bicarbonate with the overall rate of increase decreasing with increasing initial alkalinity of the treated water in order to interpret the observed data and potentially make predictions for other initial concentrations of bicarbonate we utilize the system level model that was described in section 3 to reiterate the system model takes in the rate of creation of n o 3 in the treated water by the plasma streamers and predicts the ph and n o 3 as a function of time while the rate of injection of n o 3 is a function of plasma operating parameters it is not directly controllable and depends on various geometrical and electrical parameters including those of the treated water as a result the rate of injection of n o 3 d n o 3 d t is used as a fitting parameter in order to interpret the measured data for ph and n o 3 three different approaches were adopted to explain the measured data with the only difference between the three approaches being the calibration of the d n o 3 d t parameter for the first approach we calibrated the d n o 3 d t parameter using the ph measurements in this approach we assumed a constant d n o 3 d t value during the time interval between any two ph measurements typically 1 min for most of our data points and solved for the d n o 3 d t value that led to agreement between the system level model predictions and the ph measurements in other words this process began with the initial ph value which is same as the final ph value of the previous time interval and computed the d n o 3 d t value during that time interval the time interval between any two measurements was always one minute except during the first minute of treatment when additional measurements at 15 s intervals were performed this process allowed for the d n o 3 d t fed into the system level model to vary during the 22 min of treatment and is referred to as the ph calibrated model one of the assumptions in this approach is that n o 3 ion is the primary contributor for ph reduction in the treated solution which is not completely true and will result in certain discrepancies that will be discussed below while the above approach is excellent for fitting measured data exactly we also compare measurements and system level model predictions using the average d n o 3 d t value based on the variable d n o 3 d t obtained as part of the ph calibrated approach to reiterate this second approach is referred to as ph calibrated average and utilizes a constant time averaged d n o 3 d t as input to the system level model finally our third approach is based on n o 3 data and is built on the fact that two constant d n o 3 d t regions approximately linear variation in n o 3 could be observed in all n o 3 measurements as a function of time the third approach uses a constant d n o 3 d t rate until a certain time during treatment referred to as the breakeven time and a different increased constant d n o 3 d t rate for times after the breakeven time physically the breakeven time could be viewed as an estimate of the time required to consume all sodium bicarbonate initially dissolved in the distilled water this is also representative of a characteristic time that points to the change in the electrical properties conductivity of the treated solution which in turn could contribute to the change in d n o 3 d t this is explained in greater detail while analyzing the results of the treatment experiments presented in this work as a result of the use of two constant d n o 3 d t rates in the third approach we refer to it as the two rate model each of the model approaches outlined above were used to interpret and analyze the ph and n o 3 variation with time for various masses of dissolved sodium bicarbonate figs 8 10 summarize the results obtained for treatment of pure distilled water with 0 mg of dissolved sodium bicarbonate fig 8 shows the variation of d n o 3 d t rate as calibrated using the measured ph variation with time along with the average value of d n o 3 d t over the 22 min duration the average d n o 3 d t rate was determined to be 9 65 μmol min indicating that the streamers inject an estimated 212 3 μmol of n o 3 into the treated water fig 9 shows the comparison of measured and predicted ph variation with time and as expected the model predictions using a variable d n o 3 d t rate ph calibrated model agrees well with the measured ph also the ph calibrated average model uses the average d n o 3 d t rate of 9 65 μmol min based on the ph calibrated model the predictions of the ph calibrated average model and the ph calibrated model are both comparable with each other indicating that using the average d n o 3 d t value leads to a good description of the ph reduction due to plasma treatment however when comparing the predictions of n o 3 using both ph calibrated and ph calibrated average models with the measurements the agreement is less impressive in particular both models lead to severe under prediction of n o 3 on closer observation of the measured n o 3 concentrations in fig 10 it is clear that the variation is almost linear with a variation of 128 mg l over 22 min with the volume of treated water being 250 ml this is equivalent to the creation of 32 mg of n o 3 ions over 22 min or equivalently about 1 455 mg of n o 3 ions every minute using d n o 3 d t 22 5 μ mol min agrees well with the experimental data it should be mentioned that the two rate model for the case of no dissolved n a h c o 3 essentially corresponds to a single rate model with the breakeven time of 0 s since there is no n a h c o 3 to be consumed and there is no change in conductivity associated with the transition from a sodium bicarbonate solution to a sodium nitrate solution to a nitric acid solution as can be seen from fig 10 an n o 3 formation rate of 22 5 μmol min for the entire treatment time agrees well with the measured n o 3 the corresponding ph variation as shown in fig 9 leads to good overall agreement even though it over estimates the ph reduction leading to an eventually lower ph 2 71 than the measurements 3 06 the comparisons presented above for the 0 mg case were repeated for various initial masses of n a h c o 3 with representative results presented below figs 11 and 12 compare the results obtained using all three models with the measured ph and n o 3 for 5 mg of dissolved sodium bicarbonate as expected the ph calibrated model agrees well with the measured ph variation since the rate of n o 3 creation rate is suitably varied with time to enable good agreement with the average d n o 3 d t of 7 5 μmol min the ph calibrated average model also leads to good overall agreement even though the region of rapid decrease in measured ph is predicted with a slight delay by the ph calibrated average model with d n o 3 d t rates of 2 7 μmol min until a breakeven time of 9 min and 22 5 μmol min after that the two rate model leads to significant under prediction of the ph decrease until the breakeven time after which the agreement is much better as in the case of 0 mg the final ph value predicted by the two rate model is lower than the measured ph on the other hand the agreement with measured n o 3 is excellent for the two rate model it should be emphasized that the rate of n o 3 formation after the breakeven time is same as the n o 3 formation rate used for the 0 mg case thereby highlighting the consistency of n o 3 creation across multiple cases figs 13 and 14 present the comparisons for 10 mg of dissolved n a h c o 3 with similar findings as the 5 mg case once again the two rate model used d n o 3 d t values of 2 7 μmol min and 22 5 μmol min before and after the breakeven times it should be noted that these rates are same as those used for previously considered cases the breakeven time was observed to be 15 min and was the only parameter changed in the two rate model as for the 5 mg case the ph calibrated average model delays the onset of the rapid reduction of ph with the two rate model leading to an even larger time delay similar trends were observed for the 15 20 and 50 mg cases not shown here with the breakeven time being about 20 min for the 15 mg and over the treatment time for 20 and 50 mg cases in other words the 20 and 50 mg cases were both explained well with a constant rate of 2 7 μmol min over the entire treatment time one of the physical explanations for the different pre breakeven and post breakeven rates of n o 3 creation could be attributed to the significantly different electrical properties for example conductivity of the solution with and without the presence of sodium bicarbonate while the exact conductivities of the solutions considered here were not measured it is known that sodium nitrate has a slightly higher conductivity haynes 2014 than sodium bicarbonate whereas nitric acid has a significantly higher conductivity than both sodium nitrate and sodium bicarbonate even when present in extremely small quantities therefore during the initial phase when sodium bicarbonate is being consumed to form sodium nitrate the low conductivity of the solution can be attributed to lower rates of n o 3 creation by the plasma on the other hand once all the sodium bicarbonate is converted to sodium nitrate any additional treatment should lead to the formation of h n o 3 which presumably increases the conductivity and increases the rate of creation of n o 3 ions in the solution future studies should measure the conductivity of the solution in order to validate these hypotheses and obtain a more rigorous system level model it should be noted that no obvious visual changes in the plasma were detected before and after the breakeven times thereby emphasizing the need for more accurate plasma diagnostic methods including quantitative current measurements as opposed to qualitative measurements of the current work to quantify the change in plasma properties and validating the proposed hypothesis this is an important future direction associated with the current work that could potentially help understand the nitrate creation rates in other solutions with significantly different conductivities table 2 summarizes various parameters based on ph and n o 3 calibrations for all masses of n a h c o 3 considered in this work with all the measured results and system level model predictions presented it is imperative to point out certain aspects of the comparisons the atmospheric pressure streamer discharge certainly injects a whole host of species into the treated water with dissolved n a h c o 3 however the system level model assumes the primary species to be n o 3 with the rate of formation of n o 3 in the solution being one of the crucial input parameters that is calibrated using the measurements utilizing the measured concentration of n o 3 ions for this calibration is expected to be more accurate on the contrary the calibration of d n o 3 d t using ph measurements is likely to be less accurate since most of the other species with primary contributors being n o h 2 o 2 and o h created by the plasma play a role in affecting the ph of the treated water therefore relating the ph change directly to the rate of n o 3 formation is likely to be less accurate as a result we hypothesize that the d n o 3 d t calibrated directly from the n o 3 two rate model is more representative of the effect of the plasma in terms of irrigation water enrichment the minor deviations between the predictions of the two rate model and the measurements could partly be attributed to the asymptotic d n o 3 d t rates that are being used thereby not providing a completely accurate description of the transition between the two rates before and after the breakeven time respectively the proposed two rate model could potentially be improved by including a finite transition period as opposed to the instantaneous transition of the two rate model during which the d n o 3 d t varies linearly between 2 7 μmol min to 22 5 μmol min however this would include an additional fitting parameter the transition duration apart from the durations for the two asymptotic rates the requirement for more parameters while providing greater flexibility to explain the data also leads to greater uncertainties therefore this approach was not pursued in the current work the other reason for the possible deviation between measured ph and the prediction of the two rate model is the simplistic nature of the model where n o 3 is assumed to be the primary species injected it is likely that additional species as discussed above account for part of the ph decrease but are not accounted for in the current analysis thereby leading to the deviation the other point worthy of discussion is the observed variation of breakeven times as seen in table 2 while the breakeven times for the 1 mg 2 mg and 5 mg cases being the same could be misleading it is likely caused by the nature of the asymptotic analysis where the breakeven time is determined as the intersection point of the asymptotes it is clear from the measured n o 3 fig 7 data that the 1 mg 2 mg and 5 mg cases overlap during times less than 5 min and times greater than 15 min the breakeven times determined from the intersection of the asymptotes can be compared with an estimate of the time that would be required to consume the given mass of n a h c o 3 in conjunction with the pre breakeven n o 3 creation rate of 2 7 μmol min the chemical reaction that describes the consumption of n a h c o 3 by h n o 3 is given by 19 n a h c o 3 h n o 3 n a n o 3 h 2 o c o 2 where 1 mole 84 g of n a h c o 3 is consumed by 1 mole 62 g of n o 3 as a result 1 mg of n a h c o 3 requires 0 738 mg of n o 3 to be completely consumed at an injection rate of 2 7 μmol min 167 4 μg min the time for consumption is obtained as 4 41 min for the 1 mg case thereby reiterating the fact that the breakeven time provides a good order of magnitude estimate of the time required to consume all bicarbonate for 10 mg this analysis would predict 44 2 min to consume all n a h c o 3 which is greater than the breakeven time of about 15 min indicating that the rate of injection begins at the pre breakeven asymptotic rate and then gradually increases to the post breakeven asymptotic rate of 22 5 μmol min therefore utilizing the pre breakeven asymptotic rate for the entire duration for which n a h c o 3 is consumed leads to deviation from the observed breakeven time also as seen in table 2 the ph calibrated average n o 3 rates demonstrate significant variation across various cases thereby making the ph calibrated average model infeasible for use as a predictive system level model to design scaled up versions of the proposed set up with multiple dbd reactors treating flowing water as a final set of measurements the ph and n o 3 of the treated solutions was monitored for 14 days with the results for n o 3 presented in figs 15 and 16 fig 15 shows the variation of n o 3 for the first 60 min post treatment by the plasma where it is clearly seen that the n o 3 increases with time after treatment for all masses of dissolved sodium bicarbonate while this could seem contradictory we hypothesize that it could be due to conversion of nitrite introduced by the plasma to nitrate fig 16 presents the results for n o 3 over a period of 14 days 336 h post treatment where it is seen that the presence of n a h c o 3 leads to a slightly different behavior while the nitrate concentration continues to increase throughout the 14 day period for the 0 mg case the cases with a small quantity of bicarbonate reach a constant nitrate concentration within a few days on the other hand the 15 mg 20 mg and 50 mg cases eventually lead to a reduction in the nitrate ion concentration the ph not shown here for all of these cases did not change over the period of 14 days while the post treatment study could be seen as redundant for the application of irrigation water enrichment where the plasma treatment will likely happen right before using it on the crops one of the benefits of analyzing the post treatment effects over such a long period is the possibility of transporting the treated water from a central treatment plant 5 conclusions the treatment of bicarbonate dissolved distilled water using an atmospheric pressure streamer discharge was studied using experiments combined with a system level model interpretation of the observations the discharge was ignited using a capillary tube as powered electrode with the ground electrode wrapped around the beaker filled with solution to be treated measurements of the current flowing through the discharge indicated propagation of streamers that interacted with the treated solution to create n o 3 among other species the ph and n o 3 were measured as a function of treatment time for various masses of dissolved sodium bicarbonate the ph variation with treatment time was shown to be similar to a traditional titration curve of reaction between an acid and base with an initial period of slow variation followed by a steep reduction in ph before settling down at values between 3 and 4 on the other hand the n o 3 variation with time demonstrates an increase characterized by two different asymptotic slopes corresponding to pre breakeven and post breakeven behavior the early and long term rates of n o 3 addition by the plasma was consistent across all cases considered thereby motivating the two rate model as one of the system level models to explain the measurements the breakeven time was representative of the time required to consume all bicarbonate dissolved in the solution thereby leading to a change in the electrical properties of the solution including conductivity the enhanced conductivity was hypothesized to lead to increased n o 3 creation rates when no bicarbonate was present in the solution the interplay between n o 2 and n o 3 ions may have contributed to over prediction of the n o 3 that might result in a need to scale down the rates reported here but the two rate model will still be valid albeit with modified rates for pre breakeven and post breakeven times while the two rate model was based on the n o 3 measurements the other model considered in this work was based on the ph measurements where the n o 3 creation rate was predicted based on the observed ph variation the discrepancies between the measurements and the system level model indicates that the current model does not account for certain species such as n o 2 that contribute to the ph reduction nevertheless the two rate model is likely to provide a good first estimate of the influence of the plasma for reducing alkalinity of irrigation water specifically the two rate model could be used to scale up for example using an array of such dbd reactors in a flow set up the system for reducing the alkalinity or increasing the nitrate concentration to desired levels for example if a certain grower wants to increase the nitrate concentration by a certain amount the number of such reactors required and the corresponding flow rate that will determine time of exposure to the streamers will be design parameters that the two rate model will help choose finally the ph and n o 3 modifications induced by the plasma were shown to last for at least 14 days with the n o 3 concentration increasing post treatment for limited masses of sodium bicarbonate while the results presented here are certainly promising additional work is required in several directions including quantifying the energy associated per unit increase in nitrate ion concentration per unit volume of water while a comparative study between various dbd configurations will certainly be helpful nanosecond dbds with a rapid rise time in voltage may help to minimize energy consumption which will certainly make the approach compete with solid fertilizer technologies nevertheless the simplicity of the set up could possibly result in this technology being extremely suited to developing countries with abundance of solar power but a lack of resources to import or generate traditional fertilizers future work should also document the effectiveness of the treated water for irrigation by utilizing it for crop growth and comparing the results with untreated water and solid fertilizers 
19401,the treatment of distilled water with varying amounts of dissolved sodium bicarbonate representing alkalinity is considered using an atmospheric pressure electrical discharge the discharge ignited between a capillary tube used as powered electrode and a ground electrode wrapped around the beaker holding the treated water consists of streamers propagating in ambient air and striking the water surface the streamer interaction with water is shown to lead to a decrease in ph and an increase in nitrate concentration the ph variation with time is shown to be similar to a titration curve for acid base neutralization with final ph values around 3 for 22 min of treatment the nitrate ion concentration increase with time is consistent with a two rate system level model that is characterized by two asymptotic rates for n o 3 creation by the plasma the two asymptotic rates are calibrated to be about 2 7 μmol min and 22 5 μmol min with the transition between the two rates occurring at the breakeven time that is representative of the time required for all dissolved bicarbonate to be consumed by the plasma treatment the increase in rate of n o 3 creation at the breakeven time is attributed to the increase in conductivity of the treated solution once all bicarbonate is consumed thereby modifying the plasma properties another system level model that is based on the observed ph variation is also considered for comparison with measured data while both system level models have some discrepancies with the measurements the two rate model based on the nitrate ion concentration is concluded to be more useful for determining the n o 3 formation rates in the context of irrigation water enrichment the discrepancies are attributed to the simplicity of the system level models considered here where the effect of the plasma is completely represented by the creation of just one chemical species in h n o 3 thereby neglecting potentially important species such as h n o 2 and h 2 o 2 nevertheless the proposed system level model could greatly assist in the design of plasma treatment systems with specified alkalinity ph and nitrate ion levels for irrigation water graphical abstract image 1 keywords irrigation water plasma alkalinity dielectric barrier discharge 1 introduction the rapidly growing world population with an estimated 11 billion in 2100 gerland et al 2014 has led to a great emphasis on food security and food production as two major problems that need to be tackled this in turn has contributed to an increased importance of irrigation water management and the need to potentially grow crops in regions that do not have suitable soil or water resources the acidity or alkalinity of the irrigation water valdez aguilar and reed 2007 and soil is an important parameter that determines the suitability for agriculture specifically ph measures the concentration of hydrogen ions in the water soil and should be between 5 5 and 6 5 for most crops to ensure good irrigation water quality simsek and gunduz 2007 the soil and irrigation water ph play a crucial role in determining the outcomes of plant growth zebarth et al 2015 the alkalinity determined by the concentration of bicarbonate and carbonate ions and expressed in units of ppm or mg l or milliequivalents l should also be limited to ensure healthy crops while the tolerable levels of alkalinity are specific to the crop and the container size a general rule of thumb is to limit the bicarbonate levels to 120 mg l and carbonate levels to 15 mg l respectively while the source of irrigation water is region specific the united states geological survey usgs website indicates dieter et al 2018 that out of the 118 000 million gallons per day of irrigation water 60 900 million gallons 52 per day came from surface water with the remaining coming from ground water the principle source of alkalinity in both surface and ground water is the carbon dioxide present in atmosphere in particular unsaturated soil zone subsurface region between land and water table air can contain significant amounts of carbon dioxide that can increase alkalinity of ground water other sources of alkalinity include run off water over landscape rich in limestone here it is worth reiterating the difference between alkaline directly related to ph and alkalinity measure of a solution s ability to neutralize acids in the context of this work primarily dealing with alkalinity of irrigation water the chief contributors are considered to be carbonate and bicarbonate ions even though hydroxyl ion o h contributes to total alkalinity it is not expected to significantly affect the alkalinity of irrigation water in other words the term alkalinity in the entire manuscript refers to carbonate alkalinity as opposed to total alkalinity however it is worth mentioning that the plasma assisted approach can also be used to reduce hydroxide alkalinity while ph and alkalinity values are extremely region specific it is worth mentioning some statistics for ph in various surface water stations in california out of the 28 california stations at which ph measurements are reported by usgs 27 stations have a ph level higher than 7 0 with one station reporting a neutral ph a common approach to decreasing the ph as well as alkalinity to tolerable limits is acidification enoch and olesen 1993 whipker et al 1996 albano et al 2017 or the process of injecting acids into the irrigation water the hydrogen ions in the acid will react with the bicarbonate carbonate ions thereby producing carbon dioxide and water as given below 1 h h c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o 2 2 h c o 3 2 c o 2 h 2 o candidate acids for lowering ph and alkalinity of irrigation water include sulphuric acid nitric acid and phosphoric acid with the specific choice depending on various factors including safety cost and potential side effects to name a few for example nitric acid inspite of possessing several advantages including addition of nitrate n o 3 ions that assist plant growth is seldom used because of difficulties associated with handling concentrated nitric acid it is worth mentioning that the addition of acid to water with bicarbonate carbonate ions will lead to the formation of a corresponding salt based on the acid and the cation attached to the bicarbonate ion as a by product but this has not been reported to be a major concern for plant growth magnetic treatment of irrigation water has also been considered as a candidate for soils with high alkalinity content bogatin et al 1999 maheshwari and grewal 2009 in this context the use of electrical discharges ignited by the application of high voltage in ambient air promises to be an attractive alternative for on the fly acid generation and ph alkalinity reduction in fact nature presents an excellent example of a similar process wherein lightning strikes lead to nitrogen fixation and enhanced soil fertility albeit in limited quantities because of their short duration the electrical discharges considered in this work can be classified as low temperature laboratory plasmas in contrast to fully ionized plasmas that are encountered in space as well as nuclear fusion low temperature plasmas exhibit significant degrees of non equilibrium characterized by hot electrons and cold ions neutrals and are often referred to as non thermal plasmas the hot electrons of plasmas ignited in ambient air have sufficient energy to break the nitrogen and oxygen bonds and triggering a whole host of reactions leading to the formation of dissolved n o 3 ions amongst a whole host of other species in the solution which in turn can neutralize the bicarbonate ions the interaction of atmospheric pressure plasmas with various biological substances has become an active area of research this includes the use of atmospheric pressure non thermal plasmas for water purification malik et al 2001 malik 2010 and wastewater treatment wang et al 2012 tyszler et al 2006 surface modification for tissue engineering chu et al 2002 chen and su 2011 intranuovo et al 2014 agriculture mitsugi et al 2014 ji et al 2016 li et al 2016 park et al 2018 bacterial inactivation traylor et al 2011 and wound healing bekeschus et al 2016 lee et al 2016a b to name a few specifically the role of plasmas in the area of water treatment has been growing exponentially with researchers studying the degradation of pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics magureanu et al 2015 2011 2010 banaschik et al 2015 and cyanide hijosa valsero et al 2013 enhancement of irrigation water park et al 2013 ji et al 2016 sivachandiran and khacef 2017 judée et al 2017 to name a few the noticeable fact in previous representative work is the wide variety of plasma sources utilized to achieve the required effect plasma ignition has been pursued and demonstrated in the gas phase in the liquid phase foster et al 2010 as well as multiphase with plasma formation in either gas phase with dispersed droplets or liquid phase with gas bubbles sommers and foster 2014 in spite of the large number of publications dealing with various aspects of plasma liquid interaction bruggeman et al 2016 the interaction with alkaline water that contains dissolved bicarbonates carbonates from the perspective of enriching irrigation water has not been considered in detail before a robust energy efficient technology for decreasing alkalinity in surface water would greatly benefit irrigation water quality thereby ensuring ideal growth conditions for the crop an on demand technique using limited raw materials such as the one proposed here would also ensure that there is no need to handle or transport acids utilized for neutralizing in this context the primary goal of the current work is to study the interaction of an atmospheric pressure electrical discharge set up with varying concentrations of sodium bicarbonate dissolved in distilled water apart from decreasing the alkalinity by reacting with bicarbonate the h n o 3 produced due to plasma treatment also assists in increasing the nitrate concentration thereby leading to an enrichment of the irrigation water while the experimental study focuses on measuring ph and nitrate concentration as a function of plasma treatment time the other objective of the current work includes the formulation of a system level model that describes the treatment process thereby assisting in the design and scale up of these plasma treatment systems one aspect of the current work that is worth emphasizing is the use of only sodium bicarbonate to increase the alkalinity and ph of distilled water in reality the alkalinity in irrigation water has contributions from both carbonate and bicarbonate ions this work chose to introduce only of these ions to increase alkalinity with the expectation of simplifying the experimental approach apart from reducing the design space in terms of testing various bicarbonate to carbonate ratios therefore the use of sodium bicarbonate as opposed to sodium carbonate or a combination of both was only by choice however it has been reported somridhivej and boyd 2016 that bicarbonate ion is the primary contributor to alkalinity under near neutral ph 8 3 conditions and this fact motivated our choice also it should be mentioned that the system level model will remain the same even in the presence of sodium carbonate with the only difference being the initial concentration of carbonate ions the remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the experimental set up in detail with section 3 describing the system level model section 4 presents the results and discusses the same with section 5 reserved for conclusions 2 experimental set up and diagnostics a dielectric barrier discharge dbd setup was used for all water treatment experiments reported in the current work the primary characteristic of a dbd reactor is the presence of a dielectric layer between the electrical discharge and at least one of the two electrodes there are a wide range of possible sub configurations that satisfy this requirement thereby resulting in the possibility of multiple dbd systems that have been used for various applications ranging from ozone generation eliasson et al 1987 yao et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 to flow control corke et al 2010 a review of the different dbd configurations that have been used for water treatment is presented by vanraes vanraes 2016 while a similar effect could possibly be achieved by various other plasma sources a dbd was used in the current work largely due to the simplicity of the set up in fact prior studies dealing with plasma water interaction have reported configurations where the water itself was used as the ground electrode while it is hard to conclude that one configuration is better than the other without in depth studies comparing the various configurations under identical conditions we believe that a dbd configuration similar to the one used in this work is better for deployment in the field if the system is scaled up to treat flowing water broadly speaking our dbd configuration comprises of a powered electrode and a ground electrode separated by a dielectric material quartz beaker even with the chosen configuration there are several possible sub configurations that one could envision including the presence of a dielectric layer on the high voltage electrode here it should be reiterated that a comparison of the various dbd configurations to identify the optimal configuration is beyond the scope of this paper and is worthy of study we utilized a stainless steel capillary tube as the powered electrode the outer diameter of the powered electrode was 3 mm with a wall thickness of 0 5 mm thereby corresponding to an inner diameter of 2 mm the length of the capillary tube is 49 cm it should be mentioned that the length of the powered electrode has no significant role to play in the plasma properties and was chosen to be long enough to facilitate the installation as described below and shown in figs 1 and 2 the stainless steel capillary tube powered electrode was mounted vertically using a quartz tube with rubber stoppers at both ends the rubber stoppers were equipped with holes wide enough in order to hold the stainless steel electrode in place argon gas was flowed through the stainless steel electrode using an elbow connection and 1 8 in plastic tubing the primary purpose of flowing argon gas was to assist with the plasma ignition since it has a lower breakdown voltage than air the n o 3 that is produced in the treated solution is completely from the surrounding ambient air while the use of argon will increase costs associated with the process it helped in lowering the breakdown voltage which was considered to be important for the laboratory studies performed in this work the use of air nitrogen or oxygen as the gas flowing through the capillary tube is certainly worth exploring from a cost perspective the use of a tunable mixture of nitrogen and oxygen could strongly influence the rate of n o 3 creation in the treated water the flow rate of the argon gas was controlled using a brooks instrument flow meter the flow rate of argon was fixed at 8 slm for all treatment studies presented in this work a beaker filled with 250 ml of distilled water with varying quantities of dissolved sodium bicarbonate was placed under the stainless steel electrode with the stainless steel electrode lined up with the axis of the beaker the beaker was wrapped with a copper electrode serving as the ground electrode with the top of the electrode coinciding with the water level in the beaker the distance between the bottom of the stainless steel electrode and the water surface was fixed at 29 mm the stainless steel electrode was powered using the pvm500 high voltage power supply from information unlimited this power supply is rated for power levels ranging from 10 w to 300 w a voltage amplitude of 20 kv and a current amplitude of 18 ma the frequency of the input excitation can be varied from 20 khz to 70 khz this power supply has been used in similar dbd reactors in nanomaterial synthesis applications ghosh et al 2015 cole et al 2017 the electrical parameters of the discharge were measured using a high voltage probe with the current measurements performed by measuring the voltage across a 1 k ω resistor connected in series with the dbd load since the resistor has a known constant resistance the current through the resistor is directly proportional to the voltage measured across the resistor since the resistor is in series with the plasma load the current through the resistor is same as the current through the plasma load also while the applied voltage and current through the dbd load were measured independently the phase difference was not explicitly measured as a result the exact input power for each of the cases is unknown even though it was ensured that the applied voltage was the same for all treatment studies reported in this work also while the solution was not stirred during the treatment the solution was mechanically stirred for about 30 s prior to each ph n o 3 measurement to ensure complete mixing in the bulk it is also worth mentioning that the plasma liquid interaction induces some natural stirring during the treatment this ensured that there were no concentration gradients in the solution that could lead to incorrect measurements by the sensors the ph measurements of the treated water were performed using a health wiser ph meter with an accuracy of 0 05 and a resolution of 0 01 the nitrate ion concentration measurements were performed using a horiba scientific nitrate meter with an accuracy of 10 the resolution of the nitrate meter depends on the nitrate level and is 1 ppm in the range 0 99 ppm and 10 ppm in the range 100 990 ppm as outlined in the user manual of the nitrate meter the measurement of n o 3 is affected by the presence of several interfering ions including i 1000 c l 4 b r 90 c l o 4 0 3 and n o 2 70 with the corresponding selectivity coefficients percentage error in measurements indicated in the parentheses among the ions which affect the n o 3 measurements the most n o 2 is the only ion that is certainly being introduced in the solution by the plasma and therefore is relevant to the current work there are no sources of any of the other ions in the current work while the presence of an equal concentration of n o 2 leads to an over prediction in the n o 3 concentration by approximately 70 the results plots presented here do not make this correction and is worth mentioning at this stage specifically we make a reasonable assumption that the ratio of nitrate to nitrite ions created by the dbd plasma does not vary during the treatment time this assumption is reasonable since the operating parameters of the dbd plasma are not changed during the duration of treatment while the current work does not quantify this ratio the two rate model could potentially be enhanced using suitable lower rates of n o 3 creation and appropriate n o 2 creation rates both n o 3 and n o 2 ions will contribute to the consumption of the bicarbonate ion thereby modifying the ph in fact it is reasonable to expect that the n o 3 and n o 2 ion concentrations are comparable since modeling studies predict very similar number densities for both n o 2 and n o that are the major sources for n o 3 and n o 2 respectively therefore the n o 3 results reported here could be over predicted by about 70 error corresponding to equal concentrations of n o 2 and n o 3 in the solution in spite of the possibility of this error we would like to emphasize that the two rate model and the conclusions associated with it will all remain the same qualitatively while the two rates reported here for pre breakeven and post breakeven times may have to be fine tuned quantitatively in future as more data becomes available it might even be possible that both rates need to be scaled down by the same level if our assumption of constant nitrate to nitrite ion creation rate is true finally while we discuss about the interplay of n o 2 and n o 3 ions for the measurements reported in this work it is worth mentioning that n o 2 is a potentially useful species for plant growth in fact as part of the nitrogen cycle the ammonium ions an important component of solid fertilizers are converted to nitrite ions by the nitrosomonas bacteria grunditz and dalhammar 2001 these nitrite ions are then converted to nitrate ions by the nitrobacter bacteria grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the nitrate ions are directly absorbed by the plants both nitrobacter and nitrosomonas bacteria are present in the soil and assist in the process of nitrification of ammonium ions the creation of nitrite ions in the treated solution therefore is a positive influence that will eventually lead to nitrates being absorbed by the plants 3 system level model the experimental data obtained in this work were interpreted and analyzed using a system level model that considers the treated water as a control volume with the plasma discharge leading to the formation of dissolved h n o 3 in solution one possible reaction mechanism for the formation of h n o 3 in the treated water stems from the creation of n o 2 in air plasma this n o 2 can combine with the o h radical that is formed at the interface by the electron impact dissociation of water molecule the associated reactions are given by bruggeman et al 2016 3 e h 2 o h o h e 4 n o 2 o h h n o 3 while it is well established that a large number of species is created by plasma discharges ignited in ambient air van gaens and bogaerts 2013 a system level model is extremely useful in obtaining an overall perspective of the influence of plasma on the treated water in this context it needs to be pointed out that n o is another important species that is created by the discharge that will lead to the formation of h n o 2 through a similar reaction mechanism as described above the h n o 2 can react with o 3 leading to the formation of h n o 3 and is given by the reaction 5 o 3 h n o 2 o 2 h n o 3 as discussed earlier modeling studies of a plasma jet in humid air reported van gaens and bogaerts 2013 that the concentrations of n o and n o 2 are comparable for the conditions considered in their work which in turn indicates that both h n o 2 and h n o 3 are created by plasma treatment of water however the system level model considered in the current work emphasizes primarily on the creation of n o 3 with the focus being on irrigation water enrichment for plant growth the simplification of the system level model with n o 3 being the only species considered will be evident in the comparison with experiments where the ph and n o 3 are not completely consistent with each other in other words a whole host of other species including h n o 2 and h 2 o 2 will also contribute to the ph decrease that is observed in the experiments it should be emphasized that developing more detailed models and simulations of plasma liquid interaction is an active area of research lindsay et al 2015 2016 levko et al 2018 and the system level model is not intended as a replacement for those in depth studies in fact the system level model proposed in this work can certainly be improved by the inclusion of a few other species such as h n o 2 in order to determine the ph and n o 3 at a given instant of time t 0 the system level model requires the mass of sodium bicarbonate m n a h c o 3 added to the given volume of distilled water v w along with the total concentration of n o 3 created in the solution by the plasma from t 0 to t t 0 if the rate of creation of n o 3 d n o 3 d t in mol min is known the n o 3 concentration in the water at time t 0 is computed as 6 n o 3 t 0 1 v j 1 n d n o 3 d t j δ t j where v is the volume of treated water the time interval between t 0 and t t 0 is divided into n possibly variable time intervals if there was no dissolved n a h c o 3 in the water then h in the current simplified framework where only h n o 3 is considered would be the same as n o 3 but under the current conditions we need to account for additional reactions involving n a h c o 3 when added to water the sodium bicarbonate dissolves completely leading to the formation of corresponding sodium and bicarbonate ions given by the reaction 7 n a h c o 3 s h 2 o l n a a q h c o 3 a q once free in solution h c o 3 can act as both an acid giving up a proton and a base reacting with a proton due to its amphiprotic nature cairns 2012 8 h c o 3 h h 2 c o 3 9 h c o 3 c o 3 2 h where the equilibrium constants associated with the above reactions are given by cairns 2012 10 k a 1 4 46 10 7 h c o 3 h h 2 c o 3 11 k a 2 4 69 10 11 h c o 3 2 h c o 3 while the carbonate ion can interact with the hydroxyl radical to form the carbonate ion radical and the hydroxide ion this reaction is not considered here and could be one important contribution of the carbonate ion once again the emphasis here is to focus on making some predictions on the process of irrigation water enrichment without increasing the complexity of the model finally the model accounts for the autoionization of water through the reaction 12 h 2 o l h o h with the equilibrium constant given by 13 k w h o h while the nominal value of k w 10 14 this work used k w 10 2 p h initial where p h initial is the initial ph of the distilled water without dissolved n a h c o 3 and plasma treatment the chemical species involved in the system level model therefore include h c o 3 c o 3 2 h o h n a h 2 c o 3 with eq 10 eq 11 and eq 13 providing three equations three additional equations are obtained from the charge balance mass balance of carbon and mass balance of sodium in the system the charge balance condition is given by 14 n o 3 h c o 3 2 c o 3 2 o h h n a the carbon mass balance utilizes the fact that all carbon in the system is provided by the added n a h c o 3 and is given by 15 m n a h c o 3 m n a h c o 3 v w h 2 c o 3 h c o 3 c o 3 2 where m n a h c o 3 is the molar mass of n a h c o 3 the sodium mass balance provides 16 n a m n a h c o 3 m n a h c o 3 v w combining eq 10 eq 11 eq 13 eq 14 eq 15 eq 16 we get a non linear equation for h given by 17 h 2 m n a h c o 3 m n a h c o 3 v w k a 1 h 2 h 2 k a 1 h k a 1 k a 2 1 2 k a 1 h h k w n o 3 h 0 in the context of this work the n o 3 created by the plasma is not controllable and is used as a free parameter in order to interpret the measured ph and n o 3 in the treated water therefore n o 3 t is known through eq 6 once the h is solved using eq 17 the ph is obtained as 18 p h log h it should be emphasized that the carbonate alkalinity in the system h c o 3 c o 3 2 can be determined once h is known 4 results and discussion this section presents the results obtained for the plasma treatment of distilled water with dissolved sodium bicarbonate and analyzes the results using two system level models one based on calibration using ph data and the other based on the nitrate concentration measurements the experiments involved dissolving a predetermined mass of sodium bicarbonate in 250 ml of distilled water followed by its treatment using the atmospheric pressure streamer discharge set up described earlier the two quantities measured in this work include the hydrogen ion concentration ph and the nitrate ion concentration as indicated in the experimental description section the mass of dissolved sodium bicarbonate varied from 0 mg pure distilled water to 50 mg 200 mg l alkalinity with the plasma treatment time fixed at 22 min the ph and nitrate concentration were measured at intervals of 1 min except during the first minute when measurements were made at 15 s 30 s and 45 s before presenting the treatment results we first present some data on the electrical characteristics of the atmospheric pressure streamer discharge used for the water treatment fig 3 shows the atmospheric pressure streamer discharges in action during a typical water treatment experiment fig 4 shows the time history of the current flowing through the circuit prior to plasma ignition it can be seen clearly that the signal is sinusoidal with a time period of about 0 035 ms thereby translating to a frequency of about 28 khz the values of current are not shown since the actual water treatment studies were performed without the including resistance therefore these current values may not be representative of the actual current values encountered during the treatment however we do not expect the qualitative time history of current to change with the inclusion of the 1 k ω resistor and therefore the current waveforms shown here are expected to be same as the waveforms during treatment even though the voltage history is not shown here it was sinusoidal with a voltage amplitude of about 16 kv in contrast fig 5 shows the time history of current after the streamers are ignited and the differences are immediately obvious specifically a single cycle can further be divided into sinusoidal sub cycles with the amplitude increasing from one sub cycle to another the instant at which the streamers strike the surface of water is characterized by a spike in the time history of current typical of dbd reactors ghosh et al 2015 once the streamer reaches the water surface charge is deposited on the surface thereby leading to the creation of electric fields that will in turn result in a situation wherein the current through the plasma cannot be sustained this is accompanied by a decrease in current magnitude the subsequently increasing amplitude of the current waveform could possibly be due to processes in the liquid and at the interface but requires more conclusive evidence fig 6 shows the measured ph as a function of treatment time for various quantities of dissolved sodium bicarbonate in distilled water including 0 mg 1 mg 2 mg 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 20 mg and 50 mg the initial ph of the distilled water without any dissolved bicarbonate is about 6 which increases to a maximum of 8 with the addition of sodium bicarbonate table 1 summarizes the ph values of the distilled water before and after the addition of sodium bicarbonate it should be noted that the ph of distilled water even before the addition of bicarbonate is not an absolute constant and demonstrates small variations this variation in the ph can be attributed to the fact that the experiments were not performed at the same time with for example the 0 mg and 10 mg cases performed several days apart also the distilled water for different experiments may have come from different bottles with different levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide exposure the average initial ph was 6 15 with a standard deviation of 0 2 this initial ph is an input parameter to our system level model as will be reiterated while summarizing results from the model fig 6 shows that the plasma treatment leads to a reduction in the ph with the shape of the curve being similar to a titration curve between the weak base sodium bicarbonate solution and a strong acid in particular while treatment of distilled water without any added sodium bicarbonate demonstrates a rapid reduction in ph right from the start of treatment 15 mg of dissolved sodium bicarbonate leads to an initial period of slow decrease in ph followed by a rapid reduction when almost all bicarbonate is consumed by the treatment the presence of bicarbonate leads to a time delay in the ph reduction the similarity in the shape of the plasma treatment response to a titrative curve is attributed as described in detail earlier to the formation of h n o 3 that consumes the bicarbonate ions leading to the formation of sodium nitrate the primary difference between a typical titration curve and the plots presented here is in the x coordinate while traditional titration curves are presented with volume of acid added as the x coordinate the results presented here have the treatment time as the x coordinate however it is worth mentioning that the two situations are analogous with an increase in treatment time directly leading to an increase in the concentration of n o 3 created in the solution by the plasma thereby being equivalent to an increase in the volume of acid added in order to present data supporting this claim the nitrate concentration measured as a function of time is shown in fig 7 the nitrate concentration increases with plasma treatment time for all dissolved masses of sodium bicarbonate with the overall rate of increase decreasing with increasing initial alkalinity of the treated water in order to interpret the observed data and potentially make predictions for other initial concentrations of bicarbonate we utilize the system level model that was described in section 3 to reiterate the system model takes in the rate of creation of n o 3 in the treated water by the plasma streamers and predicts the ph and n o 3 as a function of time while the rate of injection of n o 3 is a function of plasma operating parameters it is not directly controllable and depends on various geometrical and electrical parameters including those of the treated water as a result the rate of injection of n o 3 d n o 3 d t is used as a fitting parameter in order to interpret the measured data for ph and n o 3 three different approaches were adopted to explain the measured data with the only difference between the three approaches being the calibration of the d n o 3 d t parameter for the first approach we calibrated the d n o 3 d t parameter using the ph measurements in this approach we assumed a constant d n o 3 d t value during the time interval between any two ph measurements typically 1 min for most of our data points and solved for the d n o 3 d t value that led to agreement between the system level model predictions and the ph measurements in other words this process began with the initial ph value which is same as the final ph value of the previous time interval and computed the d n o 3 d t value during that time interval the time interval between any two measurements was always one minute except during the first minute of treatment when additional measurements at 15 s intervals were performed this process allowed for the d n o 3 d t fed into the system level model to vary during the 22 min of treatment and is referred to as the ph calibrated model one of the assumptions in this approach is that n o 3 ion is the primary contributor for ph reduction in the treated solution which is not completely true and will result in certain discrepancies that will be discussed below while the above approach is excellent for fitting measured data exactly we also compare measurements and system level model predictions using the average d n o 3 d t value based on the variable d n o 3 d t obtained as part of the ph calibrated approach to reiterate this second approach is referred to as ph calibrated average and utilizes a constant time averaged d n o 3 d t as input to the system level model finally our third approach is based on n o 3 data and is built on the fact that two constant d n o 3 d t regions approximately linear variation in n o 3 could be observed in all n o 3 measurements as a function of time the third approach uses a constant d n o 3 d t rate until a certain time during treatment referred to as the breakeven time and a different increased constant d n o 3 d t rate for times after the breakeven time physically the breakeven time could be viewed as an estimate of the time required to consume all sodium bicarbonate initially dissolved in the distilled water this is also representative of a characteristic time that points to the change in the electrical properties conductivity of the treated solution which in turn could contribute to the change in d n o 3 d t this is explained in greater detail while analyzing the results of the treatment experiments presented in this work as a result of the use of two constant d n o 3 d t rates in the third approach we refer to it as the two rate model each of the model approaches outlined above were used to interpret and analyze the ph and n o 3 variation with time for various masses of dissolved sodium bicarbonate figs 8 10 summarize the results obtained for treatment of pure distilled water with 0 mg of dissolved sodium bicarbonate fig 8 shows the variation of d n o 3 d t rate as calibrated using the measured ph variation with time along with the average value of d n o 3 d t over the 22 min duration the average d n o 3 d t rate was determined to be 9 65 μmol min indicating that the streamers inject an estimated 212 3 μmol of n o 3 into the treated water fig 9 shows the comparison of measured and predicted ph variation with time and as expected the model predictions using a variable d n o 3 d t rate ph calibrated model agrees well with the measured ph also the ph calibrated average model uses the average d n o 3 d t rate of 9 65 μmol min based on the ph calibrated model the predictions of the ph calibrated average model and the ph calibrated model are both comparable with each other indicating that using the average d n o 3 d t value leads to a good description of the ph reduction due to plasma treatment however when comparing the predictions of n o 3 using both ph calibrated and ph calibrated average models with the measurements the agreement is less impressive in particular both models lead to severe under prediction of n o 3 on closer observation of the measured n o 3 concentrations in fig 10 it is clear that the variation is almost linear with a variation of 128 mg l over 22 min with the volume of treated water being 250 ml this is equivalent to the creation of 32 mg of n o 3 ions over 22 min or equivalently about 1 455 mg of n o 3 ions every minute using d n o 3 d t 22 5 μ mol min agrees well with the experimental data it should be mentioned that the two rate model for the case of no dissolved n a h c o 3 essentially corresponds to a single rate model with the breakeven time of 0 s since there is no n a h c o 3 to be consumed and there is no change in conductivity associated with the transition from a sodium bicarbonate solution to a sodium nitrate solution to a nitric acid solution as can be seen from fig 10 an n o 3 formation rate of 22 5 μmol min for the entire treatment time agrees well with the measured n o 3 the corresponding ph variation as shown in fig 9 leads to good overall agreement even though it over estimates the ph reduction leading to an eventually lower ph 2 71 than the measurements 3 06 the comparisons presented above for the 0 mg case were repeated for various initial masses of n a h c o 3 with representative results presented below figs 11 and 12 compare the results obtained using all three models with the measured ph and n o 3 for 5 mg of dissolved sodium bicarbonate as expected the ph calibrated model agrees well with the measured ph variation since the rate of n o 3 creation rate is suitably varied with time to enable good agreement with the average d n o 3 d t of 7 5 μmol min the ph calibrated average model also leads to good overall agreement even though the region of rapid decrease in measured ph is predicted with a slight delay by the ph calibrated average model with d n o 3 d t rates of 2 7 μmol min until a breakeven time of 9 min and 22 5 μmol min after that the two rate model leads to significant under prediction of the ph decrease until the breakeven time after which the agreement is much better as in the case of 0 mg the final ph value predicted by the two rate model is lower than the measured ph on the other hand the agreement with measured n o 3 is excellent for the two rate model it should be emphasized that the rate of n o 3 formation after the breakeven time is same as the n o 3 formation rate used for the 0 mg case thereby highlighting the consistency of n o 3 creation across multiple cases figs 13 and 14 present the comparisons for 10 mg of dissolved n a h c o 3 with similar findings as the 5 mg case once again the two rate model used d n o 3 d t values of 2 7 μmol min and 22 5 μmol min before and after the breakeven times it should be noted that these rates are same as those used for previously considered cases the breakeven time was observed to be 15 min and was the only parameter changed in the two rate model as for the 5 mg case the ph calibrated average model delays the onset of the rapid reduction of ph with the two rate model leading to an even larger time delay similar trends were observed for the 15 20 and 50 mg cases not shown here with the breakeven time being about 20 min for the 15 mg and over the treatment time for 20 and 50 mg cases in other words the 20 and 50 mg cases were both explained well with a constant rate of 2 7 μmol min over the entire treatment time one of the physical explanations for the different pre breakeven and post breakeven rates of n o 3 creation could be attributed to the significantly different electrical properties for example conductivity of the solution with and without the presence of sodium bicarbonate while the exact conductivities of the solutions considered here were not measured it is known that sodium nitrate has a slightly higher conductivity haynes 2014 than sodium bicarbonate whereas nitric acid has a significantly higher conductivity than both sodium nitrate and sodium bicarbonate even when present in extremely small quantities therefore during the initial phase when sodium bicarbonate is being consumed to form sodium nitrate the low conductivity of the solution can be attributed to lower rates of n o 3 creation by the plasma on the other hand once all the sodium bicarbonate is converted to sodium nitrate any additional treatment should lead to the formation of h n o 3 which presumably increases the conductivity and increases the rate of creation of n o 3 ions in the solution future studies should measure the conductivity of the solution in order to validate these hypotheses and obtain a more rigorous system level model it should be noted that no obvious visual changes in the plasma were detected before and after the breakeven times thereby emphasizing the need for more accurate plasma diagnostic methods including quantitative current measurements as opposed to qualitative measurements of the current work to quantify the change in plasma properties and validating the proposed hypothesis this is an important future direction associated with the current work that could potentially help understand the nitrate creation rates in other solutions with significantly different conductivities table 2 summarizes various parameters based on ph and n o 3 calibrations for all masses of n a h c o 3 considered in this work with all the measured results and system level model predictions presented it is imperative to point out certain aspects of the comparisons the atmospheric pressure streamer discharge certainly injects a whole host of species into the treated water with dissolved n a h c o 3 however the system level model assumes the primary species to be n o 3 with the rate of formation of n o 3 in the solution being one of the crucial input parameters that is calibrated using the measurements utilizing the measured concentration of n o 3 ions for this calibration is expected to be more accurate on the contrary the calibration of d n o 3 d t using ph measurements is likely to be less accurate since most of the other species with primary contributors being n o h 2 o 2 and o h created by the plasma play a role in affecting the ph of the treated water therefore relating the ph change directly to the rate of n o 3 formation is likely to be less accurate as a result we hypothesize that the d n o 3 d t calibrated directly from the n o 3 two rate model is more representative of the effect of the plasma in terms of irrigation water enrichment the minor deviations between the predictions of the two rate model and the measurements could partly be attributed to the asymptotic d n o 3 d t rates that are being used thereby not providing a completely accurate description of the transition between the two rates before and after the breakeven time respectively the proposed two rate model could potentially be improved by including a finite transition period as opposed to the instantaneous transition of the two rate model during which the d n o 3 d t varies linearly between 2 7 μmol min to 22 5 μmol min however this would include an additional fitting parameter the transition duration apart from the durations for the two asymptotic rates the requirement for more parameters while providing greater flexibility to explain the data also leads to greater uncertainties therefore this approach was not pursued in the current work the other reason for the possible deviation between measured ph and the prediction of the two rate model is the simplistic nature of the model where n o 3 is assumed to be the primary species injected it is likely that additional species as discussed above account for part of the ph decrease but are not accounted for in the current analysis thereby leading to the deviation the other point worthy of discussion is the observed variation of breakeven times as seen in table 2 while the breakeven times for the 1 mg 2 mg and 5 mg cases being the same could be misleading it is likely caused by the nature of the asymptotic analysis where the breakeven time is determined as the intersection point of the asymptotes it is clear from the measured n o 3 fig 7 data that the 1 mg 2 mg and 5 mg cases overlap during times less than 5 min and times greater than 15 min the breakeven times determined from the intersection of the asymptotes can be compared with an estimate of the time that would be required to consume the given mass of n a h c o 3 in conjunction with the pre breakeven n o 3 creation rate of 2 7 μmol min the chemical reaction that describes the consumption of n a h c o 3 by h n o 3 is given by 19 n a h c o 3 h n o 3 n a n o 3 h 2 o c o 2 where 1 mole 84 g of n a h c o 3 is consumed by 1 mole 62 g of n o 3 as a result 1 mg of n a h c o 3 requires 0 738 mg of n o 3 to be completely consumed at an injection rate of 2 7 μmol min 167 4 μg min the time for consumption is obtained as 4 41 min for the 1 mg case thereby reiterating the fact that the breakeven time provides a good order of magnitude estimate of the time required to consume all bicarbonate for 10 mg this analysis would predict 44 2 min to consume all n a h c o 3 which is greater than the breakeven time of about 15 min indicating that the rate of injection begins at the pre breakeven asymptotic rate and then gradually increases to the post breakeven asymptotic rate of 22 5 μmol min therefore utilizing the pre breakeven asymptotic rate for the entire duration for which n a h c o 3 is consumed leads to deviation from the observed breakeven time also as seen in table 2 the ph calibrated average n o 3 rates demonstrate significant variation across various cases thereby making the ph calibrated average model infeasible for use as a predictive system level model to design scaled up versions of the proposed set up with multiple dbd reactors treating flowing water as a final set of measurements the ph and n o 3 of the treated solutions was monitored for 14 days with the results for n o 3 presented in figs 15 and 16 fig 15 shows the variation of n o 3 for the first 60 min post treatment by the plasma where it is clearly seen that the n o 3 increases with time after treatment for all masses of dissolved sodium bicarbonate while this could seem contradictory we hypothesize that it could be due to conversion of nitrite introduced by the plasma to nitrate fig 16 presents the results for n o 3 over a period of 14 days 336 h post treatment where it is seen that the presence of n a h c o 3 leads to a slightly different behavior while the nitrate concentration continues to increase throughout the 14 day period for the 0 mg case the cases with a small quantity of bicarbonate reach a constant nitrate concentration within a few days on the other hand the 15 mg 20 mg and 50 mg cases eventually lead to a reduction in the nitrate ion concentration the ph not shown here for all of these cases did not change over the period of 14 days while the post treatment study could be seen as redundant for the application of irrigation water enrichment where the plasma treatment will likely happen right before using it on the crops one of the benefits of analyzing the post treatment effects over such a long period is the possibility of transporting the treated water from a central treatment plant 5 conclusions the treatment of bicarbonate dissolved distilled water using an atmospheric pressure streamer discharge was studied using experiments combined with a system level model interpretation of the observations the discharge was ignited using a capillary tube as powered electrode with the ground electrode wrapped around the beaker filled with solution to be treated measurements of the current flowing through the discharge indicated propagation of streamers that interacted with the treated solution to create n o 3 among other species the ph and n o 3 were measured as a function of treatment time for various masses of dissolved sodium bicarbonate the ph variation with treatment time was shown to be similar to a traditional titration curve of reaction between an acid and base with an initial period of slow variation followed by a steep reduction in ph before settling down at values between 3 and 4 on the other hand the n o 3 variation with time demonstrates an increase characterized by two different asymptotic slopes corresponding to pre breakeven and post breakeven behavior the early and long term rates of n o 3 addition by the plasma was consistent across all cases considered thereby motivating the two rate model as one of the system level models to explain the measurements the breakeven time was representative of the time required to consume all bicarbonate dissolved in the solution thereby leading to a change in the electrical properties of the solution including conductivity the enhanced conductivity was hypothesized to lead to increased n o 3 creation rates when no bicarbonate was present in the solution the interplay between n o 2 and n o 3 ions may have contributed to over prediction of the n o 3 that might result in a need to scale down the rates reported here but the two rate model will still be valid albeit with modified rates for pre breakeven and post breakeven times while the two rate model was based on the n o 3 measurements the other model considered in this work was based on the ph measurements where the n o 3 creation rate was predicted based on the observed ph variation the discrepancies between the measurements and the system level model indicates that the current model does not account for certain species such as n o 2 that contribute to the ph reduction nevertheless the two rate model is likely to provide a good first estimate of the influence of the plasma for reducing alkalinity of irrigation water specifically the two rate model could be used to scale up for example using an array of such dbd reactors in a flow set up the system for reducing the alkalinity or increasing the nitrate concentration to desired levels for example if a certain grower wants to increase the nitrate concentration by a certain amount the number of such reactors required and the corresponding flow rate that will determine time of exposure to the streamers will be design parameters that the two rate model will help choose finally the ph and n o 3 modifications induced by the plasma were shown to last for at least 14 days with the n o 3 concentration increasing post treatment for limited masses of sodium bicarbonate while the results presented here are certainly promising additional work is required in several directions including quantifying the energy associated per unit increase in nitrate ion concentration per unit volume of water while a comparative study between various dbd configurations will certainly be helpful nanosecond dbds with a rapid rise time in voltage may help to minimize energy consumption which will certainly make the approach compete with solid fertilizer technologies nevertheless the simplicity of the set up could possibly result in this technology being extremely suited to developing countries with abundance of solar power but a lack of resources to import or generate traditional fertilizers future work should also document the effectiveness of the treated water for irrigation by utilizing it for crop growth and comparing the results with untreated water and solid fertilizers

november 2012 experiment when chambers were incubated sequentially under aerobic followed by anaerobic conditions significant difference between aerobic and anaerobic conditions was assessed using a paired by chamber student s t test n 4 since experimental treatments anaerobic aerobic in this incubation were not independent variability in fluxes for replicate chambers was reported as standard deviation cumming et al 2007 for the may 2013 experiment with quadruplicate independent experimental treatments anaerobic aerobic anoxic with nitrate anaerobic with al significant difference between treatments was assessed using a student s t test n 4 and variability in fluxes for replicate chambers was reported as standard error the conventional value of p 0 05 was used to signify a statistically significant difference between treatments 3 results sediment in both reservoirs had high water content low to moderate organic content and elevated thg concentrations table 1 sediment sampled in almaden lake had higher thg and total sulfur content relative to guadalupe reservoir sediment in almaden lake exhibited spatial heterogeneity in thg content varying from 7 6 to 34 6 μg g dw sediment collected at the deep stations in each study site did not show substantially different hg fractionation characteristics table 1 almaden lake was more enriched with elemental hg 45 versus 41 while guadalupe reservoir was more enriched with organo chelated hg 20 versus 13 in experiment 1 sequential aerobic anaerobic incubation with sediment from both sites flux of compounds of interest in almaden lake and guadalupe reservoir chambers were generally different under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions table 2 fig 2 at both sites mean fluxes of mehg ammonia mn fe and srp were higher under anaerobic conditions mean anaerobic mehg flux rate was 11 4 ng m2 d in almaden lake and 22 3 ng m2 d in guadalupe reservoir during the 18 d anaerobic phase mean mehg concentration in chamber water increased from 0 25 to 1 98 ng l in almaden lake chambers and from 0 88 to 4 01 ng l in guadalupe reservoir chambers patterns of mn and fe release were similar at both sites with typical concentrations 200 μg l during the aerobic phase and 3000 μg l mn and 500 μg l fe at the end of the anaerobic phase almaden lake exhibited higher fluxes and higher chamber water concentration of ammonia and srp patterns of some fluxes showed compelling differences between the two sites in almaden lake chambers mehg thg fe and sulfate fluxes were negative during the aerobic phase in guadalupe reservoir chambers fluxes of these compounds were generally positive during the aerobic phase for example mean aerobic fluxes of thg and sulfate were 154 ng m2 d and 90 3 mg m2 d in almaden lake chambers comparable values were 119 ng m2 d and 66 9 mg m2 d in guadalupe reservoir chambers in addition thg efflux was higher under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions in guadalupe reservoir chambers we observed an apparent correlation between sulfate uptake and mehg flux for individual chambers under anaerobic conditions table 3 fig 3 with the small sample size n 4 the correlation between these two variables was not statistically significant though the p value approached significance for almaden lake p 0 066 anaerobic mehg flux in chambers from both sites also correlated with anaerobic ammonia and mn fluxes but not anaerobic thg flux table 3 in experiment 2 experimental treatment incubations with almaden lake sediment only mean mehg flux for day 0 9 was lower in all treatments aerobic anoxic al addition relative to the anaerobic control mean aerobic 5 0 ng m2 d and anoxic 1 7 ng m2 d mehg fluxes were two orders of magnitude less than the anaerobic control 174 ng m2 d table 4 fig 4 mean day 0 9 mehg flux in al treated chambers 105 ng m2 d was similar in magnitude to the anaerobic control high variability of mehg fluxes in anaerobic controls during day 0 9 mehg flux in anaerobic chamber 3 was over twice the mean value complicated statistical comparisons between treatments excluding the extreme chamber 3 value mehg flux in aerobic and anoxic treatments were significantly different p 0 01 from anaerobic control mehg concentrations in chamber water at the end of the day 0 9 phase for the four treatments anaerobic aerobic anoxic al were 13 43 1 5 0 4 8 6 28 ng l respectively the long term effects of aeration on ammonia oxidation was apparent in the negative day 9 24 ammonia flux in aerobic chambers 14 2 ng m2 d aerobic chambers also showed negative mn flux 10 5 ng m2 d during day 0 9 fluxes of both ammonia and mn during these phases were positive in anaerobic controls table 4 in contrast to aerobic conditions anoxic nitrate rich conditions did not repress ammonia or mn efflux from sediment 4 discussion 4 1 flux patterns of methylmercury and ancillary constituents in both experiments 1 and 2 mehg flux from sediment was higher under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions tables 2 and 4 similar observations have been reported for a range of aquatic sediments by numerous researchers delaune et al 2004 galicinao et al 2018 holmes and lean 2006 martin doimeadios et al 2004 ullrich et al 2001 our results support the contention that an aerobic sediment water interface impedes production and release of mehg from profundal sediment but a key observation in this study was that mehg flux under anaerobic conditions was not sustained over the duration of the anaerobic incubation in experiment 2 anaerobic chambers and anaerobic with al addition chambers both exhibited uptake of mehg negative flux between days 9 24 after substantial release between days 0 9 table 4 this indicates that the anaerobic profundal sediment water interface shifted from a source of mehg to overlaying water to a sink perhaps as redox potential dropped the temporal pattern we observed is analogous to the spatial pattern found in surficial sediment by many researchers in which subsurface peak mehg concentrations corresponded with moderately reduced conditions ullrich et al 2001 above and below the mehg maximum mehg production is impaired by aerobic conditions and highly reduced sulfidic conditions respectively several potential mechanisms could explain low or negative mehg efflux under highly reduced conditions one simple explanation is impaired activity of sulfate reducing bacteria due to a lack of sulfate and or labile organic matter holmer and storkholm 2001 another potential explanation is enhanced demethylation relative to methylation perhaps via the oxidative demethylation pathway known to occur under anaerobic conditions hsu kim et al 2013 yielding a low or negative net methylation rate reduced hg ii bioavailability at high sulfide concentrations through the formation of charged hg ii reduced sulfur complexes that impede passive diffusion of hg ii into cells benoit et al 2003 ullrich et al 2001 or through interactions between hg ii metal sulfide nanoparticles and natural organic matter that depress facilitated or active transport of hg ii into methylating organisms in the highly heterogeneous environment of sediment pore water hsu kim et al 2013 may also play a role the precipitation of fe sulfide under highly reduced conditions a phenomenon we observed in some chambers as the formation of a black precipitate in chamber water could affect mehg production fe sulfide formation may act as a sorption sink for hg ii han et al 2007 merritt and amirbahman 2007 or as a sink for sulfide with a resulting drop in the formation of hg ii reduced sulfur complexes gagnon et al 1997 han et al 2008 both of which could lower hg ii bioavailability for methylation the observation that mehg flux from anaerobic sediment in experiment 2 was not steady explains the relatively low anaerobic mehg efflux measured in experiment 1 for almaden lake in the anaerobic treatment of experiment 2 the first 9 day anaerobic phase yielded a mean mehg flux of 174 ng m2 d while the following 13 day anaerobic phase yielded a flux of 95 ng m2 d in experiment 1 the 17 day anaerobic phase yielded a mean mehg flux of 11 ng m2 d it appears that this 17 day duration captured a period where net methylation methylation minus demethylation was still positive but after periods of elevated mehg flux under mildly reducing conditions from an experimental perspective these results highlight the need to pay careful attention to experimental design e g incubation duration sampling frequency and data interpretation when performing batch incubations to assess hg fluxes in aquatic sediment in contrast to conventional pollutants such as phosphate and ammonia mehg should not be thought of as a conservative compound that steadily accumulates in the anaerobic profundal zone of lakes and reservoirs this concept is supported by results of hg stable isotope experiments that show mehg have half lives on the order of days in anaerobic aquatic sediments hintelmann et al 2000 martin doimeadios et al 2004 in experiment 1 anaerobic flux rates of mehg in replicate chambers from both sites exhibited high variability with relative standard deviations ranging from around 40 50 table 2 sampling sites in almaden lake were spread out across the relatively small impoundment and exhibited heterogeneous thg concentrations in sediment table 1 thus this high variability is not surprising samples in guadalupe reservoir were all taken at a single deep water site yet these chambers responded somewhat differently to experimental incubation while high variability in replicate experimental treatments is generally undesirable the variability in experiment 1 allowed us to observe the well recognized linkage between sulfate reduction and hg methylation gilmour et al 1992 jeremiason et al 2006 ullrich et al 2001 in chamber incubations from both study sites there was an apparent correlation between mehg flux from sediment and sediment uptake of sulfate under anaerobic conditions fig 3 sulfate uptake rates 10 200 mg m2 d measured in the chamber experiments were similar those reported for other eutrophic freshwater sediments holmer and storkholm 2001 rates of anaerobic sulfate uptake were higher in almaden lake chambers and corresponded with higher sulfate concentrations 37 mg l in chamber water at the start of the anaerobic phase compared to guadalupe reservoir 22 mg l as well as higher total sulfur content in sediment table 1 but anaerobic mehg flux was lower in almaden lake chambers even though these sediments had higher thg content than guadalupe reservoir these results support the sulfate goldilocks model in which mehg production peaks at intermediate sulfate concentrations that in turn yield moderate sulfide levels that promote hg ii bioavailability benoit et al 1999 gilmour et al 1992 1998 ullrich et al 2001 the sulfate concentrations noted above are comparable to those cited by gilmour and henry 1991 of 20 50 mg l below which sulfate limits srb activity thereby limiting methylation and above which sulfide production interferes with methylation with regards to ancillary constituents in experiments 1 and 2 a shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions generally resulted in increased sediment efflux of srp ammonia mn and fe tables 2 and 4 the primary mechanism for p release from anaerobic sediment is the biological reduction of phosphate containing fe oxides with the resulting diffusion of dissolved fe and phosphate from sediment pore water to overlaying water boström et al 1988 golterman 2001 søndergaard et al 2003 lake sediment can also release p under aerobic conditions mainly via mineralization of organic matter combined with low sediment retention capacity for p lake sediment with low fe p molar ratios 10 a coarse indicator of p sorption capacity tends to exhibit elevated rates aerobic p release jensen et al 1992 schauser et al 2006 welch and cooke 1995 fe p ratios for our study sites were fairly high 20 suggesting that the sites have low potential for aerobic p release indeed mean aerobic p release rates at both sites while measurable were a small fraction 6 of mean anaerobic release rates sediment from both sites showed the classic response to aerobic versus anaerobic conditions for nitrogen beutel 2006 and redox sensitive metals mn and fe davison 1993 aerobic conditions exhibited depressed or negative ammonia flux in both experiments 1 and 2 tables 2 and 4 ammonia loss was coupled with positive nitrate flux in experiment 1 confirming aerobic conditions stimulated the conversion of ammonia to nitrate via biological nitrification in contrast the lack of oxygen under anaerobic conditions in both experiments 1 and 2 resulted in the efflux of ammonia liberated from decaying organic matter mn and fe release from anaerobic aquatic sediment is generally attributed to microbial reductive dissolution of metal oxides in surficial sediment davison 1993 mn oxides are especially sensitive to moderate drops in redox at the sediment water interface and readily dissolve and flux out of profundal sediment into overlaying water primarily as mn ii fe release from sediment occurs at lower redox than mn and tends to be more sustained than mn release these dynamics are demonstrated in the anaerobic treatment in experiment 2 in which mn flux was high in the first phase of the incubation and low in the second while fe flux was low in the first phase and high in the second table 4 4 2 magnitude of anaerobic flux of methylmercury and ancillary constituents the magnitude of anaerobic flux of mehg observed in this study was comparable to a handful of studies of hg contaminated freshwater lakes mean anaerobic mehg flux in experiment 1 was 11 4 ng m2 d in almaden lake and 22 3 ng m2 d in guadalupe reservoir table 2 mean anaerobic mehg flux for the almaden lake in experiment 2 was 174 ng m2 d for days 0 9 table 4 kuwabara et al 2000 2002 2003 measured anaerobic mehg flux ranging from 3 to 30 ng m2 d in experimental chambers with sediment from lahontan reservoir nevada which is impacted by historical hg mining along the carson river in onondaga lake new york a large urban lake with a history of intense hg pollution anaerobic mehg efflux measured both in the lake and with experimental chambers was around 140 ng m2 d galicinao et al 2018 anaerobic mehg fluxes ranging from 100 to 350 ng m2 d were measured in hodges reservoir a hypereutrophic reservoir in san diego california with no history of significant hg pollution using similar methods to this study beutel et al 2018 over seasonal time scales mass balance studies by watras et al 1996 in temperate freshwater lakes yielded areal mehg production rates ranging from 0 5 to 5 g mehg km2 yr 1 4 14 ng m2 d anaerobic mehg fluxes measured in this study were on the low side of those reported for coastal marine sediment 10 1000 ng m2 d many of which were contaminated with hg benoit et al 2009 marine sediment typically exhibits elevated levels of biological sulfate reduction that enhance hg methylation and promotes mehg efflux from sediment hammerschmidt and fitzgerald 2004 in almaden lake results for mehg flux in the first anaerobic phase of the experimental treatment incubations 174 ng m2 d agreed closely with in lake estimates of mehg buildup in anoxic bottom water in 2017 165 ng m2 d in lake estimates of bottom water mehg buildup in guadalupe reservoir ranged from 80 to 140 ng m2 d in 2012 and 2013 and were higher than fluxes measured in this study as discussed in the previous section this may be related to the relatively long duration of the experiment and the likelihood that mehg fluxes in the chamber incubations decreased with time as redox dropped and sulfidic conditions grew more intense while sediment from almaden lake had higher levels of thg table 1 the magnitude of anaerobic mehg flux was higher in guadalupe reservoir compared to almaden lake table 2 in addition there was no correlation between sediment thg and anaerobic hg fluxes for the four stations sampled at almaden lake this observation agrees with the general understanding that mehg cycling in aquatic sediment rather than being controlled by thg concentrations is affected by numerous interrelated factors including microbial activity hg ii bioavailability and environmental conditions such as temperature redox and ph kelly et al 1995 ullrich et al 2001 compared to almaden lake sediment in guadalupe reservoir had a higher fraction of thg in the organo chelated fraction which according to bloom et al 2003 is susceptible to methylation this may have reinforced the effects of moderate sulfate concentrations discussed above resulting in relatively higher mehg efflux from guadalupe reservoir sediment in addition to hg fluxes we measured fluxes of nutrients and redox sensitive metals mn and fe in experiment 1 mean anaerobic p flux was higher in almaden lake 17 6 mg p m2 d compared to guadalupe reservoir 5 1 mg p m2 d typical anaerobic p release rates range from 2 10 10 15 and 15 27 mg p m2 d for mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems respectively nurnberg 1994 mean anaerobic ammonia fluxes were also higher in almaden 29 0 mg n m2 d in experiment 1 32 9 mg n m2 d in first phase of experiment 2 compared to guadalupe 16 6 mg n m2 d in experiment 1 typical anaerobic ammonia release rates range from 5 10 10 20 and 20 mg n m2 d for mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems respectively beutel 2006 these results suggest that from the perspective of sediment nutrient cycling almaden lake is more eutrophic than guadalupe reservoir supporting observations include higher rates of sulfate uptake fig 3 and loi table 1 in almaden lake sediment the richer sediment in almaden lake may in part account for the relatively low mehg flux compared to guadalupe reservoir observed in experiment 1 table 2 since almaden sediment would go anaerobic and highly reduced more rapidly as discussed earlier highly reduced conditions can be associated with impeded mehg production in aquatic sediment anaerobic release rates of mn and fe measured in experiments 1 and 2 were around 20 mg m2 d for mn and 1 7 mg m2 d for fe at both study sites metal release rates from anaerobic lake sediment are not common in the literature rates reported for other california reservoirs range from 15 60 mg m2 d for mn and 5 20 mg m2 d for fe beutel et al 2007 beutel unpublished and are similar to those reported in this study anaerobic mn fluxes exceeded fe fluxes at our study sites even though fe sediment concentration exceeded mn concentration by an order of magnitude table 1 unlike mn ii fe ii can be lost from the water phase via precipitation with s2 to form solid fes davison 1993 this mechanism likely explains the relatively low magnitude of anaerobic fe compared to mn flux as well as the observed sediment enrichment in fe and depletion of mn 4 3 contrasting response of study sites to aerobic conditions sediment from both sites responded in a similar fashion during experiment 1 with the flux of redox sensitive compounds thg mehg ammonia mn srp lower under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions but under aerobic conditions the two sites showed contrasting patterns of the release of thg fe and sulfate table 2 during aerobic conditions almaden lake chambers showed the anticipated pattern of thg and fe uptake as aerobic conditions enhanced fe oxidation and thg loss from water perhaps through enhanced sorption to metal oxides in surficial sediment chadwick et al 2006 regnell et al 2001 sulfate flux in aerobic almaden lake chambers was negative indicating that even though surficial sediment was aerobic sediment was a net sink for sulfate likely via microbial sulfate reduction in deep anaerobic sediment in contrast the aerobic flux of thg fe and sulfate in guadalupe reservoir chambers were all positive and mehg flux while relatively low was also positive mn and ammonia fluxes were negative confirming that surficial sediment in guadalupe reservoir chambers was aerobic and supported both mn and ammonia oxidation and subsequent loss from chamber water the observed increase in thg fe and sulfate in aerobic guadalupe reservoir chambers suggests the oxidative dissolution of hg bearing sulfide minerals in surficial sediment in contrast with almaden lake which is a quarry pond contaminated by sediment input from the upstream mining area guadalupe reservoir was constructed on top of a cinnabar processing area and continues to capture sediment from upstream mining areas though mitigation efforts have been implemented to limit erosion both cinnabar α hgs and metacinnabar β hgs release hg ii and sulfate under aerobic conditions barnett et al 2001 holley et al 2007 while pyrite fes2 releases fe and sulfate moses et al 1987 in the case of hgs dissolution most of the hg ii released from oxidative dissolution is sorbed onto hgs surfaces holley et al 2007 hg ii sorption combined with release of sulfide from other metal sulfide minerals e g fes2 can result in hg ii concentrations in solution that are orders of magnitude lower than sulfate concentrations this phenomenon was reflected in the aerobic phase of experiment 1 for guadalupe reservoir sediment in which hg ii flux 113 5 ng m2 d was much lower than sulfate flux 66 9 mg m2 d in addition to a positive thg flux there was also a positive mehg flux from aerobic guadalupe reservoir sediment anaerobic mechanisms that promote mehg release from surficial sediment were presumably repressed under aerobic conditions thus the mehg source may have been desorption from the surface of oxidized cinnabar metacinnabar and or pyrite minerals rather than production via microbial sulfate reduction or release from reduced metal oxides our results described above are potentially significant because they suggest that oxygenation of sediment rich in hg mining waste could liberate rather than repress hg ii release since sulfate is co released with hg ii methylation could be stimulated if anaerobic conditions are reestablished in clear lake california oxidative dissolution of upstream mine waste rich in hgs has been implicated in stimulating mehg production in the lake suchanek et al 2008 a review of monthly water quality trends in guadalupe reservoir bottom water shows relatively elevated concentrations of thg and sulfate in december and january during well oxygenated conditions but these months coincide with periods of high external loading during winter storm events which could account for the elevated concentrations 4 4 effects of experimental treatments on methylmercury flux as discussed above in section 4 2 many researchers have documented enhanced mehg production in aquatic sediments and water samples under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions which tends to enhance methylation rates by anaerobic bacteria ullrich et al 2001 in agreement with these observation we saw substantial increases in mehg flux in almaden lake chambers under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic and anoxic nitrate rich conditions in experiment 2 table 4 fig 4 water quality monitoring at both study sites conclusively shows that mehg buildup in profundal waters is tightly coupled with anaerobic conditions mccord et al 2016 bi monthly data from almaden lake in 2008 shows low mehg in bottom water when both dissolved oxygen and nitrate are present a slight increase in mehg concentration 1 ng l when dissolved oxygen is depleted and a continual release of mehg up to 30 ng l once oxygen and nitrate are both depleted fig 5 aerobic chambers also showed significantly lower fluxes of ammonia day 9 24 and mn day 0 9 relative to anaerobic chambers confirming the oxidative nature of the aerobic chambers this contrasts with anoxic chambers which had fluxes of ammonia and mn similar in magnitude to anaerobic chambers scvwd has implemented hypolimnetic oxygenation the engineered addition of dissolved oxygen to bottom waters using pure oxygen gas that does not substantially perturb thermal stratification beutel and horne 1999 at several of its hg impacted reservoirs oxygenation appears to have decreased the rate of mehg buildup in bottom waters at some sites including guadalupe reservoir but drops in water column mehg have not yet been conclusively linked to decreases in fish tissue hg mccord et al 2016 the addition of nitrate to onondaga lake a heavily polluted lake in new york usa has coincided with lower hg levels in bottom waters and zooplankton matthews et al 2013 d matthews personal communication 2018 nitrate addition has the potential benefit of excluding recolonization of the profundal zone with aerobic biota potentially limiting hg bioaccumulation into the food web effler and matthews 2008 but this may be counterproductive in ecosystems where enhancement of the cold water fishery is desired mobley et al 2012 moore et al 2012 müller and stadelmann 2004 oxygen addition has several other potential advantages over nitrate the ratio of oxidant potential to storage volume is much higher when comparing liquid oxygen to liquid calcium nitrate beutel et al 2014 as observed in this study oxygen also appears to better repress sediment release of mn a compound that complicates potable water treatment betancourt et al 2010 and ammonia a potent nutrient and toxin in surface waters beutel 2006 oxygen enhances the microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrate which may work synergistically with oxygen to oxidize profundal surficial sediment and repress mehg release beutel et al 2017 in the context of this study which documented the apparent release of hg ii from sediment due to oxidative dissolution of hg bearing sulfide minerals under aerobic conditions further study is needed to assess if nitrate addition to mine contaminated sediment reduces the potential for oxidative dissolution while promoting redox related mechanisms that repress mehg release the addition of buffered sodium aluminate and the subsequent development of a layer of al oxide floc at the sediment water interface did not substantially decrease mehg efflux compared to anaerobic conditions in experiment 2 to the best of our knowledge this is the first assessment of the impact of al addition on mehg production in profundal reservoir sediment in typical lake and reservoir applications for the control of internal p loading alum is added in combination with a buffering compound such as sodium aluminate sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate in lakes with low alkalinity 50 mg l as caco3 cooke et al 2005 we used buffered sodium aluminate to avoid the stimulatory effects of sulfate on mehg production associated with alum perhaps an underappreciated side effect of lake alum treatments kehrl 2010 a potential explanation for the lack of treatment effect is that mehg formed a soluble complex with reduced sulfur perhaps in the form of metal sulfide nanoparticles gorski et al 2006 hsu kim et al 2013 or mehgsh regnell et al 2001 in the low redox sulfidic conditions of the anaerobic chamber incubation resistant to sorption by al oxide results do not preclude the efficacy of al oxide in sequestering mehg diffusing from profundal sediment under more moderate redox levels with low sulfide conditions that may be more conducive to mehg sorption by al oxide 5 conclusion in situ management approaches are needed to effectively combat hg bioaccumulation in lakes and reservoirs to protect human and wildlife health two compelling approaches to managing mehg production and release from anaerobic sediment is oxidant addition and sorbent addition oxidant addition works by poising redox potential at the sediment water interface which can depress mehg buildup in overlying water by repressing activity of sulfate reducing bacteria by eliminating sulfidic compounds that enhance hg ii bioavailability and by enhancing hg sorption to native fe and mn oxides sorbent addition works by providing a sorption barrier to the efflux of hydrophobic compounds including to a certain extent hg ii and mehg this study showed that the addition of two potent oxidants oxygen and nitrate resulted in substantial decreases in the efflux of mehg from profundal reservoir sediment contaminated with hg oxygen addition also diminished sediment efflux of other water quality constituents of concern including ammonia phosphate and mn these results indicate that the in situ addition of oxygen and nitrate but not al are effective management strategies at repressing mehg buildup in the profundal zone of eutrophic lakes provided the oxidant is present directly at the sediment water interface but whether drops in profundal water column mehg translate into meaningful decreases in fish tissue hg the ultimate regulatory endpoint in hg contaminated systems is still uncertain and likely site specific oxygen addition at the sediment water interface in particular can have multiple water quality benefits in addition to repressing mehg release from sediment such as enhanced cold water habitat for fish and zooplankton lower internal nutrient loading and repression of mn buildup in bottom waters the study reinforced several themes related to hg cycling in aquatic ecosystems including the linkage between mehg production and sulfate reduction and the fact that thg content of aquatic sediment does not dictate the magnitude of mehg production novel findings include the potential for mine impacted profundal sediment to release hg ii and sulfate under aerobic conditions via oxidative dissolution of hg bearing sulfide minerals the observation that profundal sediment shifted from being a mehg source to sink at chamber incubations progressed and the fact that al addition a common management strategy to repress sediment release of phosphate in lakes and reservoirs was not effective in repressing mehg efflux potential areas of future research include the role of highly reduced redox conditions in shutting down mehg production in profundal sediment the use of sodium aluminate to repress mehg release from profundal sediment under low sulfide conditions the use of nitrate in lieu of oxygen when treating mine contaminated sediment vulnerable to oxidative dissolution and the implications of reductions of mehg in the profundal zone on the ultimate bioaccumulation of hg into fish acknowledgements this study was supported

19402,extensive contamination of aquatic ecosystems with mercury hg has led to a growing interest in developing in situ management strategies to repress hg bioaccumulation in aquatic biota in reservoirs this study used experimental chamber incubations to assess the impact of three potential treatments oxygen addition nitrate addition and aluminum addition to reduce the flux of toxic methylmercury mehg from profundal reservoir sediment the study sites almaden lake and guadalupe reservoir are located downstream of the historic new almaden mining district in santa clara valley california usa in the first experiment experiment 1 replicate chambers from both sites were incubated sequentially under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at both sites mean anaerobic fluxes of mehg were higher than aerobic fluxes almaden 11 0 vs 2 3 ng m2 d guadalupe 22 3 vs 5 5 ng m2 d and anaerobic mehg fluxes correlated with rates of sediment sulfate uptake highlighting the linkage between mehg production and microbial sulfate reduction under aerobic conditions sediment from guadalupe reservoir released hg ii iron and sulfate suggesting the oxidative dissolution of hg bearing sulfide minerals a follow up study at almaden lake experiment 2 found that mean mehg fluxes under aerobic conditions 5 ng m2 d and anoxic nitrate rich conditions 1 7 ng m2 d were lower than anaerobic conditions 174 ng m2 d but aluminum addition had little effect 105 ng m2 d on mehg flux in both anaerobic and aluminum treated chambers mehg flux turned negative during the second half of the incubation suggesting that highly reduced sulfidic conditions lowered net methylation possibly by enhancing demethylation or repressing hg ii bioavailability for methylation keywords mercury methylmercury sediment profundal reservoir 1 introduction widespread mercury hg contamination in the environment poses a significant threat to human and ecological health inorganic hg predominantly from widespread atmospheric deposition but also from point sources including mine and industrial sites is transformed to methylmercury mehg by sulfate reducing bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria in

that overcome limitations associated with conventional approaches to remediation of hg contaminated sediment beutel et al 2008 2014 galicinao et al 2018 gilmour et al 2013 matthews et al 2013 mccord

be used to promote enhanced natural recovery and meet regulatory demands to speed up natural remediation processes usepa 2005 another consideration is that source control while important for the long term control of hg contamination in aquatic ecosystems does not affect near term impacts of legacy hg contamination that is already present in the environment randall and chattopadhyay 2013 wang et al

isotherms for a range of sorbents gomez eyles et al 2013 reported that activated carbon was effective at sorbing both inorganic hg and mehg while biochar was effective at sorbing mehg the objective of this study was to assess the effects of oxygen nitrate and aluminum al addition at the sediment water interface on mehg release from profundal sediment in two hg contaminated reservoirs the evaluated

hydroxide could enhance mehg sorption the study sites were almaden lake and guadalupe reservoir located in the guadalupe river watershed near san jose california as noted above the watershed and its waterbodies are significantly contaminated with hg because of historical hg mining making it an ideal site to assess the impact of in situ strategies to repress mehg production at the profundal

sediment cores minimally disturbed sediment water interface samples were collected in november 2012 from almaden lake and guadalupe reservoir and again in may 2013 from almaden lake avoiding times of intense bottom water anoxia that generally occur from june through october figs s1 and s2 sediment collection and incubation methods discussed in brief here are described in beutel 2006 beutel et al 2007 and beutel et al 2008 a sediment water interface sample was initially collected with an ekman dredge which plugged due to the cohesive nature of the organic lake sediment the dredge was brought to the surface and a minimally disturbed sample consisting of 6 8 cm of sediment and 4 6 cm of overlaying water was collected in a cylindrical polycarbonate chamber the chamber was 25 cm in height and 9 5 cm in diameter chambers were gently filled with bottom water and transported to the laboratory for experimentation in november 2012 four sediment water interface chambers were each collected at almaden lake and guadalupe reservoir at almaden lake sediment samples were collected at four deep water sampling stations used by scvwd stations 1 2 3 5 in guadalupe reservoir all four samples were collected at one site in the deepest region of the lake the chambers were incubated in the dark at the in situ bottom water temperature of 14 c chambers were incubated over two sequential phases an aerobic phase for 10 days by bubbling with air and an anaerobic phase for 18 days by bubbling with nitrogen gas n2 with a trace amount of carbon dioxide co2 to buffer ph water samples were collected

research council ottawa on canada used to access ongoing recovery we also assessed speciation of thg in sediment from study sites using a selective sequential extraction based on bloom et al 2003 solvents of increasing strength were used to separate sediment hg into five fractions 1 water soluble labile fraction extracted with deionized water 2 human stomach acid soluble fraction extracted

fraction extracted with 12 m nitric acid and 5 mercuric sulfide fraction extracted with aqua regia and considered to be largely inert following the methods outlined by bloom et al 2003 each sequential extraction lasted 18 4 h samples were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min and an aliquot of supernatant was analyzed for thg as detailed above via usepa method 1631 the concentration of sediment thg mg kg was calculated considering the volume of extractant and dry weight of sediment 2 4 data analysis water quality data collected in sediment water interface chambers was assessed in terms of flux mg m2 d calculated as the change in concentration g m3 multiplied by the water column height water volume divided by sediment surface area m and divided by time between sampling d for the november 2012 experiment when chambers were incubated sequentially under aerobic followed by anaerobic conditions significant difference between aerobic and anaerobic conditions was assessed using a paired by chamber student s t test n 4 since experimental treatments anaerobic aerobic in this incubation were not independent variability in fluxes for replicate chambers was reported as standard deviation cumming et al 2007 for the may 2013 experiment with quadruplicate independent experimental treatments anaerobic aerobic anoxic with nitrate anaerobic with al significant difference between treatments was assessed using a student s t test n 4 and variability in fluxes for replicate chambers was reported as standard error the conventional value of p 0 05 was used to signify a statistically significant difference between treatments 3 results sediment in both reservoirs had high water content low to moderate organic content and elevated thg concentrations table 1 sediment sampled in almaden lake had higher thg and total sulfur content relative to guadalupe reservoir sediment in almaden lake exhibited spatial heterogeneity in thg content varying from 7 6 to 34 6 μg g dw sediment collected at the deep stations in each study site did not show substantially different hg fractionation characteristics table 1 almaden lake was more enriched with elemental hg 45 versus 41 while guadalupe reservoir was more enriched with organo chelated hg 20 versus 13 in experiment 1 sequential aerobic anaerobic incubation with sediment from both sites flux of compounds of interest in almaden lake and guadalupe reservoir chambers were generally different under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions table 2 fig 2 at both sites mean fluxes of mehg ammonia mn fe and srp were higher under anaerobic conditions mean anaerobic mehg flux rate was 11 4 ng m2 d in almaden lake and 22 3 ng m2 d in guadalupe reservoir during the 18 d anaerobic phase mean mehg concentration in chamber water increased from 0 25 to 1 98 ng l in almaden lake chambers and from 0 88 to 4 01 ng l in guadalupe reservoir chambers patterns of mn and fe release were similar at both sites with typical concentrations 200 μg l during the aerobic phase and 3000 μg l mn and 500 μg l fe at the end of the anaerobic phase almaden lake exhibited higher fluxes and higher chamber water concentration of ammonia and srp patterns of some fluxes showed compelling differences between the two sites in almaden lake chambers mehg thg fe and sulfate fluxes were negative during the aerobic phase in guadalupe reservoir chambers fluxes of these compounds were generally positive during the aerobic phase for example mean aerobic fluxes of thg and sulfate were 154 ng m2 d and 90 3 mg m2 d in almaden lake chambers comparable values were 119 ng m2 d and 66 9 mg m2 d in guadalupe reservoir chambers in addition thg efflux was higher under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions in guadalupe reservoir chambers we observed an apparent correlation between sulfate uptake and mehg flux for individual chambers under anaerobic conditions table 3 fig 3 with the small sample size n 4 the correlation between these two variables was not statistically significant though the p value approached significance for almaden lake p 0 066 anaerobic mehg flux in chambers from both sites also correlated with anaerobic ammonia and mn fluxes but not anaerobic thg flux table 3 in experiment 2 experimental treatment incubations with almaden lake sediment only mean mehg flux for day 0 9 was lower in all treatments aerobic anoxic al addition relative to the anaerobic control mean aerobic 5 0 ng m2 d and anoxic 1 7 ng m2 d mehg fluxes were two orders of magnitude less than the anaerobic control 174 ng m2 d table 4 fig 4 mean day 0 9 mehg flux in al treated chambers 105 ng m2 d was similar in magnitude to the anaerobic control high variability of mehg fluxes in anaerobic controls during day 0 9 mehg flux in anaerobic chamber 3 was over twice the mean value complicated statistical comparisons between treatments excluding the extreme chamber 3 value mehg flux in aerobic and anoxic treatments were significantly different p 0 01 from anaerobic control mehg concentrations in chamber water at the end of the day 0 9 phase for the four treatments anaerobic aerobic anoxic al were 13 43 1 5 0 4 8 6 28 ng l respectively the long term effects of aeration on ammonia oxidation was apparent in the negative day 9 24 ammonia flux in aerobic chambers 14 2 ng m2 d aerobic chambers also showed negative mn flux 10 5 ng m2 d during day 0 9 fluxes of both ammonia and mn during these phases were positive in anaerobic controls table 4 in contrast to aerobic conditions anoxic nitrate rich conditions did not repress ammonia or mn efflux from sediment 4 discussion 4 1 flux patterns of methylmercury and ancillary constituents in both experiments 1 and 2 mehg flux from sediment was higher under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions tables 2 and 4 similar observations have been reported for a range of aquatic sediments by numerous researchers delaune et al 2004 galicinao et al 2018 holmes and lean 2006 martin doimeadios et al 2004 ullrich et al 2001 our results support the contention that an aerobic sediment water interface impedes production and release of mehg from profundal sediment but a key observation in this study was that mehg flux under anaerobic conditions was not sustained over the duration of the anaerobic incubation in experiment 2 anaerobic chambers and anaerobic with al addition chambers both exhibited uptake of mehg negative flux between days 9 24 after substantial release between days 0 9 table 4 this indicates that the anaerobic profundal sediment water interface shifted from a source of mehg to overlaying water to a sink perhaps as redox potential dropped the temporal pattern we observed is analogous to the spatial pattern found in surficial sediment by many researchers in which subsurface peak mehg concentrations corresponded with moderately reduced conditions ullrich et al 2001 above and below the mehg maximum mehg production is impaired by aerobic conditions and highly reduced sulfidic conditions respectively several potential mechanisms could explain low or negative mehg efflux under highly reduced conditions one simple explanation is impaired activity of sulfate reducing bacteria due to a lack of sulfate and or labile organic matter holmer and storkholm 2001 another potential explanation is enhanced demethylation relative to methylation perhaps via the oxidative demethylation pathway known to occur under anaerobic conditions hsu kim et al 2013 yielding a low or negative net methylation rate reduced hg ii bioavailability at high sulfide concentrations through the formation of charged hg ii reduced sulfur complexes that impede passive diffusion of hg ii into cells benoit et al 2003 ullrich et al 2001 or through interactions between hg ii metal sulfide nanoparticles and natural organic matter that depress facilitated or active transport of hg ii into methylating organisms in the highly heterogeneous environment of sediment pore water hsu kim et al 2013 may also play a role the precipitation of fe sulfide under highly reduced conditions a phenomenon we observed in some chambers as the formation of a black precipitate in chamber water could affect mehg production fe sulfide formation may act as a sorption sink for hg ii han et al 2007 merritt and amirbahman 2007 or as a sink for sulfide with a resulting drop in the formation of hg ii reduced sulfur complexes gagnon et al 1997 han et al 2008 both of which could lower hg ii bioavailability for methylation the observation that mehg flux from anaerobic sediment in experiment 2 was not steady explains the relatively low anaerobic mehg efflux measured in experiment 1 for almaden lake in the anaerobic treatment of experiment 2 the first 9 day anaerobic phase yielded a mean mehg flux of 174 ng m2 d while the following 13 day anaerobic phase yielded a flux of 95 ng m2 d in experiment 1 the 17 day anaerobic phase yielded a mean mehg flux of 11 ng m2 d it appears that this 17 day duration captured a period where net methylation methylation minus demethylation was still positive but after periods of elevated mehg flux under mildly reducing conditions from an experimental perspective these results highlight the need to pay careful attention to experimental design e g incubation duration sampling frequency and data interpretation when performing batch incubations to assess hg fluxes in aquatic sediment in contrast to conventional pollutants such as phosphate and ammonia mehg should not be thought of as a conservative compound that steadily accumulates in the anaerobic profundal zone of lakes and reservoirs this concept is supported by results of hg stable isotope experiments that show mehg have half lives on the order of days in anaerobic aquatic sediments hintelmann et al 2000 martin doimeadios et al 2004 in experiment 1 anaerobic flux rates of mehg in replicate chambers from both sites exhibited high variability with relative standard deviations ranging from around 40 50 table 2 sampling sites in almaden lake were spread out across the relatively small impoundment and exhibited heterogeneous thg concentrations in sediment table 1 thus this high variability is not surprising samples in guadalupe reservoir were all taken at a single deep water site yet these chambers responded somewhat differently to experimental incubation while high variability in replicate experimental treatments is generally undesirable the variability in experiment 1 allowed us to observe the well recognized linkage between sulfate reduction and hg methylation gilmour et al 1992 jeremiason et al 2006 ullrich et al 2001 in chamber incubations from both study sites there was an apparent correlation between mehg flux from sediment and sediment uptake of sulfate under anaerobic conditions fig 3 sulfate uptake rates 10 200 mg m2 d measured in the chamber experiments were similar those reported for other eutrophic freshwater sediments holmer and storkholm 2001 rates of anaerobic sulfate uptake were higher in almaden lake chambers and corresponded with higher sulfate concentrations 37 mg l in chamber water at the start of the anaerobic phase compared to guadalupe reservoir 22 mg l as well as higher total sulfur content in sediment table 1 but anaerobic mehg flux was lower in almaden lake chambers even though these sediments had higher thg content than guadalupe reservoir these results support the sulfate goldilocks model in which mehg production peaks at intermediate sulfate concentrations that in turn yield moderate sulfide levels that promote hg ii bioavailability benoit et al 1999 gilmour et al 1992 1998 ullrich et al 2001 the sulfate concentrations noted above are comparable to those cited by gilmour and henry 1991 of 20 50 mg l below which sulfate limits srb activity thereby limiting methylation and above which sulfide production interferes with methylation with regards to ancillary constituents in experiments 1 and 2 a shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions generally resulted in increased sediment efflux of srp ammonia mn and fe tables 2 and 4 the primary mechanism for p release from anaerobic sediment is the biological reduction of phosphate containing fe oxides with the resulting diffusion of dissolved fe and phosphate from sediment pore water to overlaying water boström et al 1988 golterman 2001 søndergaard et al 2003 lake sediment can also release p under aerobic conditions mainly via mineralization of organic matter combined with low sediment retention capacity for p lake sediment with low fe p molar ratios 10 a coarse indicator of p sorption capacity tends to exhibit elevated rates aerobic p release jensen et al 1992 schauser et al 2006 welch and cooke 1995 fe p ratios for our study sites were fairly high 20 suggesting that the sites have low potential for aerobic p release indeed mean aerobic p release rates at both sites while measurable were a small fraction 6 of mean anaerobic release rates sediment from both sites showed the classic response to aerobic versus anaerobic conditions for nitrogen beutel 2006 and redox sensitive metals mn and fe davison 1993 aerobic conditions exhibited depressed or negative ammonia flux in both experiments 1 and 2 tables 2 and 4 ammonia loss was coupled with positive nitrate flux in experiment 1 confirming aerobic conditions stimulated the conversion of ammonia to nitrate via biological nitrification in contrast the lack of oxygen under anaerobic conditions in both experiments 1 and 2 resulted in the efflux of ammonia liberated from decaying organic matter mn and fe release from anaerobic aquatic sediment is generally attributed to microbial reductive dissolution of metal oxides in surficial sediment davison 1993 mn oxides are especially sensitive to moderate drops in redox at the sediment water interface and readily dissolve and flux out of profundal sediment into overlaying water primarily as mn ii fe release from sediment occurs at lower redox than mn and tends to be more sustained than mn release these dynamics are demonstrated in the anaerobic treatment in experiment 2 in which mn flux was high in the first phase of the incubation and low in the second while fe flux was low in the first phase and high in the second table 4 4 2 magnitude of anaerobic flux of methylmercury and ancillary constituents the magnitude of anaerobic flux of mehg observed in this study was comparable to a handful of studies of hg contaminated freshwater lakes mean anaerobic mehg flux in experiment 1 was 11 4 ng m2 d in almaden lake and 22 3 ng m2 d in guadalupe reservoir table 2 mean anaerobic mehg flux for the almaden lake in experiment 2 was 174 ng m2 d for days 0 9 table 4 kuwabara et al 2000 2002 2003 measured anaerobic mehg flux ranging from 3 to 30 ng m2 d in experimental chambers with sediment from lahontan reservoir nevada which is impacted by historical hg mining along the carson river in onondaga lake new york a large urban lake with a history of intense hg pollution anaerobic mehg efflux measured both in the lake and with experimental chambers was around 140 ng m2 d galicinao et al 2018 anaerobic mehg fluxes ranging from 100 to 350 ng m2 d were measured in hodges reservoir a hypereutrophic reservoir in san diego california with no history of significant hg pollution using similar methods to this study beutel et al 2018 over seasonal time scales mass balance studies by watras et al 1996 in temperate freshwater lakes yielded areal mehg production rates ranging from 0 5 to 5 g mehg km2 yr 1 4 14 ng m2 d anaerobic mehg fluxes measured in this study were on the low side of those reported for coastal marine sediment 10 1000 ng m2 d many of which were contaminated with hg benoit et al 2009 marine sediment typically exhibits elevated levels of biological sulfate reduction that enhance hg methylation and promotes mehg efflux from sediment hammerschmidt and fitzgerald 2004 in almaden lake results for mehg flux in the first anaerobic phase of the experimental treatment incubations 174 ng m2 d agreed closely with in lake estimates of mehg buildup in anoxic bottom water in 2017 165 ng m2 d in lake estimates of bottom water mehg buildup in guadalupe reservoir ranged from 80 to 140 ng m2 d in 2012 and 2013 and were higher than fluxes measured in this study as discussed in the previous section this may be related to the relatively long duration of the experiment and the likelihood that mehg fluxes in the chamber incubations decreased with time as redox dropped and sulfidic conditions grew more intense while sediment from almaden lake had higher levels of thg table 1 the magnitude of anaerobic mehg flux was higher in guadalupe reservoir compared to almaden lake table 2 in addition there was no correlation between sediment thg and anaerobic hg fluxes for the four stations sampled at almaden lake this observation agrees with the general understanding that mehg cycling in aquatic sediment rather than being controlled by thg concentrations is affected by numerous interrelated factors including microbial activity hg ii bioavailability and environmental conditions such as temperature redox and ph kelly et al 1995 ullrich et al 2001 compared to almaden lake sediment in guadalupe reservoir had a higher fraction of thg in the organo chelated fraction which according to bloom et al 2003 is susceptible to methylation this may have reinforced the effects of moderate sulfate concentrations discussed above resulting in relatively higher mehg efflux from guadalupe reservoir sediment in addition to hg fluxes we measured fluxes of nutrients and redox sensitive metals mn and fe in experiment 1 mean anaerobic p flux was higher in almaden lake 17 6 mg p m2 d compared to guadalupe reservoir 5 1 mg p m2 d typical anaerobic p release rates range from 2 10 10 15 and 15 27 mg p m2 d for mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems respectively nurnberg 1994 mean anaerobic ammonia fluxes were also higher in almaden 29 0 mg n m2 d in experiment 1 32 9 mg n m2 d in first phase of experiment 2 compared to guadalupe 16 6 mg n m2 d in experiment 1 typical anaerobic ammonia release rates range from 5 10 10 20 and 20 mg n m2 d for mesotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic systems respectively beutel 2006 these results suggest that from the perspective of sediment nutrient cycling almaden lake is more eutrophic than guadalupe reservoir supporting observations include higher rates of sulfate uptake fig 3 and loi table 1 in almaden lake sediment the richer sediment in almaden lake may in part account for the relatively low mehg flux compared to guadalupe reservoir observed in experiment 1 table 2 since almaden sediment would go anaerobic and highly reduced more rapidly as discussed earlier highly reduced conditions can be associated with impeded mehg production in aquatic sediment anaerobic release rates of mn and fe measured in experiments 1 and 2 were around 20 mg m2 d for mn and 1 7 mg m2 d for fe at both study sites metal release rates from anaerobic lake sediment are not common in the literature rates reported for other california reservoirs range from 15 60 mg m2 d for mn and 5 20 mg m2 d for fe beutel et al 2007 beutel unpublished and are similar to those reported in this study anaerobic mn fluxes exceeded fe fluxes at our study sites even though fe sediment concentration exceeded mn concentration by an order of magnitude table 1 unlike mn ii fe ii can be lost from the water phase via precipitation with s2 to form solid fes davison 1993 this mechanism likely explains the relatively low magnitude of anaerobic fe compared to mn flux as well as the observed sediment enrichment in fe and depletion of mn 4 3 contrasting response of study sites to aerobic conditions sediment from both sites responded in a similar fashion during experiment 1 with the flux of redox sensitive compounds thg mehg ammonia mn srp lower under aerobic versus anaerobic conditions but under aerobic conditions the two sites showed contrasting patterns of the release of thg fe and sulfate table 2 during aerobic conditions almaden lake chambers showed the anticipated pattern of thg and fe uptake as aerobic conditions enhanced fe oxidation and thg loss from water perhaps through enhanced sorption to metal oxides in surficial sediment chadwick et al 2006 regnell et al 2001 sulfate flux in aerobic almaden lake chambers was negative indicating that even though surficial sediment was aerobic sediment was a net sink for sulfate likely via microbial sulfate reduction in deep anaerobic sediment in contrast the aerobic flux of thg fe and sulfate in guadalupe reservoir chambers were all positive and mehg flux while relatively low was also positive mn and ammonia fluxes were negative confirming that surficial sediment in guadalupe reservoir chambers was aerobic and supported both mn and ammonia oxidation and subsequent loss from chamber water the observed increase in thg fe and sulfate in aerobic guadalupe reservoir chambers suggests the oxidative dissolution of hg bearing sulfide minerals in surficial sediment in contrast with almaden lake which is a quarry pond contaminated by sediment input from the upstream mining area guadalupe reservoir was constructed on top of a cinnabar processing area and continues to capture sediment from upstream mining areas though mitigation efforts have been implemented to limit erosion both cinnabar α hgs and metacinnabar β hgs release hg ii and sulfate under aerobic conditions barnett et al 2001 holley et al 2007 while pyrite fes2 releases fe and sulfate moses et al 1987 in the case of hgs dissolution most of the hg ii released from oxidative dissolution is sorbed onto hgs surfaces holley et al 2007 hg ii sorption combined with release of sulfide from other metal sulfide minerals e g fes2 can result in hg ii concentrations in solution that are orders of magnitude lower than sulfate concentrations this phenomenon was reflected in the aerobic phase of experiment 1 for guadalupe reservoir sediment in which hg ii flux 113 5 ng m2 d was much lower than sulfate flux 66 9 mg m2 d in addition to a positive thg flux there was also a positive mehg flux from aerobic guadalupe reservoir sediment anaerobic mechanisms that promote mehg release from surficial sediment were presumably repressed under aerobic conditions thus the mehg source may have been desorption from the surface of oxidized cinnabar metacinnabar and or pyrite minerals rather than production via microbial sulfate reduction or release from reduced metal oxides our results described above are potentially significant because they suggest that oxygenation of sediment rich in hg mining waste could liberate rather than repress hg ii release since sulfate is co released with hg ii methylation could be stimulated if anaerobic conditions are reestablished in clear lake california oxidative dissolution of upstream mine waste rich in hgs has been implicated in stimulating mehg production in the lake suchanek et al 2008 a review of monthly water quality trends in guadalupe reservoir bottom water shows relatively elevated concentrations of thg and sulfate in december and january during well oxygenated conditions but these months coincide with periods of high external loading during winter storm events which could account for the elevated concentrations 4 4 effects of experimental treatments on methylmercury flux as discussed above in section 4 2 many researchers have documented enhanced mehg production in aquatic sediments and water samples under anaerobic versus aerobic conditions which tends to enhance methylation rates by anaerobic bacteria ullrich et al 2001 in agreement with these observation we saw substantial increases in mehg flux in almaden lake chambers under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic and anoxic nitrate rich conditions in experiment 2 table 4 fig 4 water quality monitoring at both study sites conclusively shows that mehg buildup in profundal waters is tightly coupled with anaerobic conditions mccord et al 2016 bi monthly data from almaden lake in 2008 shows low mehg in bottom water when both dissolved oxygen and nitrate are present a slight increase in mehg concentration 1 ng l when dissolved oxygen is depleted and a continual release of mehg up to 30 ng l once oxygen and nitrate are both depleted fig 5 aerobic chambers also showed significantly lower fluxes of ammonia day 9 24 and mn day 0 9 relative to anaerobic chambers confirming the oxidative nature of the aerobic chambers this contrasts with anoxic chambers which had fluxes of ammonia and mn similar in magnitude to anaerobic chambers scvwd has implemented hypolimnetic oxygenation the engineered addition of dissolved oxygen to bottom waters using pure oxygen gas that does not substantially perturb thermal stratification beutel and horne 1999 at several of its hg impacted reservoirs oxygenation appears to have decreased the rate of mehg buildup in bottom waters at some sites including guadalupe reservoir but drops in water column mehg have not yet been conclusively linked to decreases in fish tissue hg mccord et al 2016 the addition of nitrate to onondaga lake a heavily polluted lake in new york usa has coincided with lower hg levels in bottom waters and zooplankton matthews et al 2013 d matthews personal communication 2018 nitrate addition has the potential benefit of excluding recolonization of the profundal zone with aerobic biota potentially limiting hg bioaccumulation into the food web effler and matthews 2008 but this may be counterproductive in ecosystems where enhancement of the cold water fishery is desired mobley et al 2012 moore et al 2012 müller and stadelmann 2004 oxygen addition has several other potential advantages over nitrate the ratio of oxidant potential to storage volume is much higher when comparing liquid oxygen to liquid calcium nitrate beutel et al 2014 as observed in this study oxygen also appears to better repress sediment release of mn a compound that complicates potable water treatment betancourt et al 2010 and ammonia a potent nutrient and toxin in surface waters beutel 2006 oxygen enhances the microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrate which may work synergistically with oxygen to oxidize profundal surficial sediment and repress mehg release beutel et al 2017 in the context of this study which documented the apparent release of hg ii from sediment due to oxidative dissolution of hg bearing sulfide minerals under aerobic conditions further study is needed to assess if nitrate addition to mine contaminated sediment reduces the potential for oxidative dissolution while promoting redox related mechanisms that repress mehg release the addition of buffered sodium aluminate and the subsequent development of a layer of al oxide floc at the sediment water interface did not substantially decrease mehg efflux compared to anaerobic conditions in experiment 2 to the best of our knowledge this is the first assessment of the impact of al addition on mehg production in profundal reservoir sediment in typical lake and reservoir applications for the control of internal p loading alum is added in combination with a buffering compound such as sodium aluminate sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate in lakes with low alkalinity 50 mg l as caco3 cooke et al 2005 we used buffered sodium aluminate to avoid the stimulatory effects of sulfate on mehg production associated with alum perhaps an underappreciated side effect of lake alum treatments kehrl 2010 a potential explanation for the lack of treatment effect is that mehg formed a soluble complex with reduced sulfur perhaps in the form of metal sulfide nanoparticles gorski et al 2006 hsu kim et al 2013 or mehgsh regnell et al 2001 in the low redox sulfidic conditions of the anaerobic chamber incubation resistant to sorption by al oxide results do not preclude the efficacy of al oxide in sequestering mehg diffusing from profundal sediment under more moderate redox levels with low sulfide conditions that may be more conducive to mehg sorption by al oxide 5 conclusion in situ management approaches are needed to effectively combat hg bioaccumulation in lakes and reservoirs to protect human and wildlife health two compelling approaches to managing mehg production and release from anaerobic sediment is oxidant addition and sorbent addition oxidant addition works by poising redox potential at the sediment water interface which can depress mehg buildup in overlying water by repressing activity of sulfate reducing bacteria by eliminating sulfidic compounds that enhance hg ii bioavailability and by enhancing hg sorption to native fe and mn oxides sorbent addition works by providing a sorption barrier to the efflux of hydrophobic compounds including to a certain extent hg ii and mehg this study showed that the addition of two potent oxidants oxygen and nitrate resulted in substantial decreases in the efflux of mehg from profundal reservoir sediment contaminated with hg oxygen addition also diminished sediment efflux of other water quality constituents of concern including ammonia phosphate and mn these results indicate that the in situ addition of oxygen and nitrate but not al are effective management strategies at repressing mehg buildup in the profundal zone of eutrophic lakes provided the oxidant is present directly at the sediment water interface but whether drops in profundal water column mehg translate into meaningful decreases in fish tissue hg the ultimate regulatory endpoint in hg contaminated systems is still uncertain and likely site specific oxygen addition at the sediment water interface in particular can have multiple water quality benefits in addition to repressing mehg release from sediment such as enhanced cold water habitat for fish and zooplankton lower internal nutrient loading and repression of mn buildup in bottom waters the study reinforced several themes related to hg cycling in aquatic ecosystems including the linkage between mehg production and sulfate reduction and the fact that thg content of aquatic sediment does not dictate the magnitude of mehg production novel findings include the potential for mine impacted profundal sediment to release hg ii and sulfate under aerobic conditions via oxidative dissolution of hg bearing sulfide minerals the observation that profundal sediment shifted from being a mehg source to sink at chamber incubations progressed and the fact that al addition a common management strategy to repress sediment release of phosphate in lakes and reservoirs was not effective in repressing mehg efflux potential areas of future research include the role of highly reduced redox conditions in shutting down mehg production in profundal sediment the use of sodium aluminate to repress mehg release from profundal sediment under low sulfide conditions the use of nitrate in lieu of oxygen when treating mine contaminated sediment vulnerable to oxidative dissolution and the implications of reductions of mehg in the profundal zone on the ultimate bioaccumulation of hg into fish acknowledgements this study was supported

19403,on site biological hand washing water treatment can improve global access to safe hand washing water but requires a thorough understanding of the chemical composition of the water to be treated and an effective treatment strategy this study first presents a detailed characterization of the individual inputs to hand washing water we demonstrate i that soap is likely the most significant input in hand washing water representing 90 of mass loading and ii that inputs to hand washing water have low concentrations of biologically essential macro and micro nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium copper zinc molybdenum and cobalt with respect to carbon which may impair biological carbon removal this study next formulates a recipe that recreates a representative composition of hand washing water and develops a procedure to identify and supplement nutrients in which this recipe is estimated to be deficient batch testing of the nutrient supplemented hand washing water with an inoculum of planktonic bacteria demonstrated improved assimilable organic carbon removal 99 vs 86 removal and produced lower final dissolved organic carbon concentrations 1 7 mgc l vs 3 5 mgc l compared to realistic nutrient deficient washing water supplementing nutrients did promote cell growth 50x higher final total cell count full scale testing in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi system treating 75 l day of nutrient supplemented hand washing water showed that long term operation 100 days can deliver effective carbon removal 95 without detrimental fouling or other disruptions caused by cell growth this work demonstrates that biological treatment in a bambi system operated with appropriate nutrient balancing offers an effective solution for decentralized treatment of light greywater graphical abstract image 1 keywords soap nitrogen micro nutrients biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi gravity driven membrane gdm handwashing 1 introduction biological treatment processes are essential to meeting current discharge oriented wastewater treatment objectives and we must also look to biological processes to provide water recycling capability to meet the expanding water demands of the future the wastewater stream that can most easily be recovered and recycled for high quality water demands is greywater and more specifically light greywater derived from hand washing and showering due primarily to reduced organic and nutrient loading compared to other wastewater types eriksson et al 2002 effective biological treatment of greywater or any other wastewater requires a balance between biologically essential nutrients the microbial communities that perform the treatment require a variety of essential nutrients for growth and maintenance functions and the exhaustion of an essential nutrient may limit the removal of other nutrients from the wastewater grady et al 2011 effective biological treatment of wastewaters that are not initially nutrient balanced can be achieved by supplementing the deficient nutrients jefferson et al 2001 lechevallier et al 1991 previous studies have estimated nutrient requirements and demonstrated improvements in carbon removal during wastewater treatment following nutrient supplementation burgess et al 1999 jefferson et al 2001 other studies have demonstrated effective biological treatment of greywater without any nutrient supplementation gross et al 2007 whether or not supplementing nutrients improves treatment will depend on the specific source and nutrient composition of the water to be treated while tremendous variations have been observed in greywater samples collected in different parts of the world al jayyousi 2003 friedler 2004 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 part of the variation is based on which inputs are included in the broad category of greywater such as kitchen sink and laundry sources light greywater inputs such as bath shower or hand washing generally contain significantly less dissolved organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus than dark greywater inputs such as kitchen sinks dishwashers or washing machines friedler 2004 therefore understanding the relative volume contributions of specific inputs and the nutrient composition of each specific input impacts design choices for treatment and reuse strategies specifically with respect to meeting nutrient requirements for biological systems no existing study has systematically investigated the quantities and composition of different material inputs to greywater analyzing both the biological compatibility of the carbon and the concentrations provided of other biologically essential nutrients 1 1 understanding the inputs and composition of hand washing water the composition of any wastewater is the sum of materials in the initial water and all the materials that are added during usage in the case of hand washing water the additional materials consist of soap whatever dirt or undesirable materials are intentionally washed off the hands but also traces of personal care products and skin cells existing literature can contribute to our understanding of hand washing water inputs by two different approaches existing literature investigating greywater or greywater treatment often present chemical characterization of real world hand washing water these studies generally do not investigate the quantity or composition of contributing sources or fully analyze the influent water though they can provide information about what the individual contributions can add up to the organic carbon oc is generally expressed as total organic carbon toc or dissolved organic carbon doc but not biologically compatible assimilable organic carbon aoc the second tool we have in existing literature to understand hand washing water inputs is the collection of recipes for synthetic greywater that have been designed in part to recreate the chemical and physical characteristics of measured greywater often with some though incomplete consideration for individual inputs 1 1 1 measurements from real world hand washing water while numerous studies have measured the chemical and physical characteristics of combined greywater measurements specifically for hand washing water are scarce results from studies that have reported measurements from hand washing sinks are summarized in table 1 additional information on each study is presented in supporting information section s 1 the reported bod of hand washing water varies between 100 and 252 mgo2 l and the cod between 110 and 587 mgo2 l as the concentrations of ammonium and other non carbon oxidizable constituents are low in hand washing water between 0 39 mg nh4 n l and 1 15 mgnh4 n l we assume that bod and cod values are dominated by the oxidation of the carbon the bod cod ratio can thus also be used to estimate the biodegradability of the carbon the bod cod ratios for the studies presented in table 1 range from 0 3 to 0 9 but average 0 6 which is 50 higher than the ratio of 0 4 reported for typical domestic wastewaters tchobanoglous et al 2014 total nitrogen tn toc ratios for measured hand washing water range between 0 007 and 0 16 mgn mgc which is lower than the tn toc ratio of 0 21 mgn mgc for typical domestic wastewaters tchobanoglous et al 2014 high phosphorus concentrations up to 48 8 mgp l can potentially be explained by the use of phosphorus based detergents phosphate based detergents are currently banned in many regions including the european union and the united states indicating that only the concentrations reported by jefferson et al 2004 and al jayyousi 2003 should be used as references the phosphorus p toc ratio from jefferson et al 2004 is only 0 001 mgp mgc which is much lower than the p toc ratio of 0 03 mgp mgc for a typical domestic wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2014 to this date only little data are available on micro nutrients in hand washing water jamrah et al 2008 reported concentrations of potassium zinc lead copper and nickel friedler 2004 analyzed samples for silver chromium nickel cadmium manganese copper lead and zinc but found most concentrations to be below the detectable limit we have not identified any study that reports concentrations for all the nutrients regarded as being always or mostly essential for biological treatment egli 2009 even the two studies friedler 2004 jamrah et al 2008 which provide the most detailed micro nutrient analysis do not differentiate the nutrients contributed during hand washing from the nutrients already contained in the water before washing what we can say is that we expect greywater may be more easily biodegradable than municipal wastewater but contains lower nutrient to carbon ratios for essential nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus 1 1 2 synthetic artificial greywater and hand washing water laboratory testing of greywater treatment systems often utilizes synthetic wastewater to provide a consistent feed material diaper et al 2008 hourlier et al 2010 while no synthetic greywater recipe is known specifically for hand washing water many synthetic greywater recipes exist for combined greywater or greywater from unspecified inputs table 2 presents several recipes the main inputs considered in these greywater recipes are detergents soap shampoo and laundry personal care products organic matter e g from dirt kitchen sinks and human body inorganic matter e g from dirt and microbial contamination some of the recipes also include buffers to maintain a stable ph and some salts to mimic a realistic composition of real greywater most greywater recipes use commercial soaps shampoos and detergents to recreate these contributions diaper et al 2008 jefferson et al 2001 surendran and wheatley 1998 hourlier et al 2010 however used sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and glycerol to recreate the contributions of soap and shampoo few synthetic greywater recipes account for the contributions of personal care products diaper et al 2008 used commercially available sunscreen moisturizer toothpaste and deodorant and hourlier et al 2010 added glycerol to represent moisturizing agents organics are added in various forms like cellulose lactic acid humic acid or oil two greywater recipes also add inorganic matter in the form of kaolin clay diaper et al 2008 nghiem et al 2006 many recipes add sodium hydrogen carbonate as a natural buffer as it is usually also present in tap water diaper et al 2008 hourlier et al 2010 jefferson et al 2001 surendran and wheatley 1998 sodium calcium phosphate and ammonium have also been added separately to recreate concentrations in measured greywater future work with synthetic greywater requires understanding how existing recipes can be improved but also what they do well the main drawbacks of existing recipes are a general lack of information regarding i the specific type of greywater heavy vs light and specific inputs kitchen sink or no with in sink grinder or no the recipe intents to mimic ii a complete understanding of how the amounts and types of ingredients used in the synthetic recipes were selected iii the exact composition of the added ingredients and iv a lack of attention to the quantities and the availabilities of biologically relevant nutrients a generic or a non specific synthetic recipe for greywater that may mimic kitchen waste will not as accurately reflect realistic performance in a treatment system as would a recipe designed specifically for hand washing water some recipes have taken steps to link ingredients to inputs such as hand soap skin organic and inorganic dirt and personal care products but not in a complete or quantifiable fashion being complete and quantifiable is necessary to more accurately create a synthetic recipe to reflect a specific input once we build an understanding of inputs we must build a recipe out of reproducible reagents as many existing synthetic greywater recipes use commercial products with compositions that can vary depending on the geographic region and over time they cannot be reproduced accurately the importance of reproducible ingredients has also been stressed in the work of abed and scholz 2016 however their recipe also relies on secondary treatment effluent to supply micronutrients the work of jefferson et al 2001 has indeed noted the importance of nutrients in greywater treatment and this attention must continue additional information for each recipe in the table and the work of abed and scholz 2016 is presented in supporting information section s 2 1 2 nutrient requirements for biological treatment one approach to estimate nutrient requirement for a biological system is based on the elemental composition of the microbial cells egli 2009 harvested biomass can be analyzed for carbon content by conventional toc measurements and elemental composition can be measured in ash following incineration the ratio of elements in the biomass provides an estimate of the ratio of elements in the feed water needed to produce this biomass this approach however does not i account for carbon which is utilized by the cell but not incorporated into biomass or ii account for variation in nutrient composition and demands between different cell types in a diverse population during aerobic degradation in activated sludge systems only between 0 3 and 0 5 units of cell carbon are produced per unit of substrate carbon in high load conditions as the remaining part is oxidized to carbon dioxide during cellular respiration gallert and winter 2005 the elemental composition of different bacterial species have been observed to vary by a factor of almost one hundred rouf 1964 while additional requirements for carbon in energy production indicate that biomass composition would overestimate requirements for other nutrients the true yield of carbon must be less than one the variability observed between the composition of different bacterial species makes it difficult to conclusively estimate the nutrient requirements for a given system comparing the nutrient to carbon ratios for essential nutrients observed in a greywater to the same ratios observed in the elemental composition of cell biomass provides an estimate as to the nutrient balance or limitation of that greywater egli 2009 reports an average nitrogen to carbon ratio in generic bacterial cell biomass of 0 24 mgn mgc the nitrogen to carbon ratios reported in table 1 for four measured hand washing water compositions do not meet this requirement indicating that hand washing water may be deficient in nitrogen and warrants investigation for other nutrients as well 1 3 biologically activated membrane bioreactor one promising biological treatment system that has demonstrated strong performance recycling wastewater chemically similar to greywater is called a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi bambi systems feature an ultrafiltration membrane module immersed in a tank of the water to be treated a biofilm develops on the surface of this membrane that then consumes contaminants from the water as it passes through the biofilm and through the membrane the permeate water is pumped to a storage reservoir to be reused post treatment systems such as granular activated carbon or chlorine production through electrolysis may be necessary to combat the growth of bacteria in the water during storage nguyen et al 2017 unlike conventional membrane bioreactor mbr systems this membrane system does not require any cleaning over the course of standard operation and does not require high pressure to drive water though the system bambi systems are operated in a gravity driven membrane gdm configuration resulting in stable flux without backwashing or other fouling controls chomiak et al 2015 peter varbanets et al 2010 2011 the only pressure needed in a gdm system is supplied by the head of the water treatment in a bambi is predominantly biological and therefore also requires a balance of nutrients household scale bambi systems have demonstrated 95 removal of organic carbon from a wastewater similar in organic loading to hand washing water but contaminated with feces and urine künzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 the contamination of feces and urine in this wastewater ravndal et al 2015 were sufficient to provide a nutrient balance with respect to carbon the specific nutrient requirements of a bambi system have not been previously investigated 1 4 goals of this study the first goal of this study is to understand the quantities and compositions of different inputs to hand washing greywater and how these compositions relate to nutrient balancing requirements of biological treatment this analysis must address both the biological compatibility of the carbon and also the macro and micro nutrient content of each contributing input and construct a strategy to supplement deficient nutrients the second goal is to understand the impact of nutrient balancing on mechanisms of carbon removal and also to evaluate long term performance and stability of a bambi system treating a synthetic hand washing water with nutrient supplement 2 material and methods 2 1 batch testing batch testing consisted of preparing separate 500 ml volumes of representative and nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing waters in sterile 1 l erlenmeyer flasks the representative hand washing water was designed to recreate a generic hand washing water composition the nutrient balanced hand washing water recreated the representative hand washing water composition but then supplemented the nutrients in which we estimate it to be deficient for biological treatment the specific composition of the two hand washing water solutions result from the analysis presented in section 3 1 and are described in detail within that section the recipe of laboratory ingredients that create each solution are presented in supporting information section s 3 for batch testing each recipe was diluted to a concentration of 10 mgc l doc to reduce inhibitory effects of environmental shock on the bacteria and other effects from having too much surfactant the chloride concentration was maintained though following the dilution with nacl to 100 mgcl l each flask was then inoculated with 10 ml of bacterial inoculum supporting information section s 4 incubated at 30 c and mixed at 120 rpm in the dark with monitoring of doc aoc growth potential gp and total cell count tcc 2 2 full scale testing in bambi the bambi system consisted of a 58 cm tall standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra ontario canada featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany placed into a 52 l wastewater linear low density polyethylene tank fig 1 the bambi was fed 75 l day of nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water in 50 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day each feeding event consisted of pumping directly into the bambi a 20x concentrated feed sp quick peristaltic pump head and 5001 pumpdrive with pharmed tubing heidolph instruments schwabach germany and an appropriate dilution of non chlorinated tap water tauchpumpe typ 04 barwig wasserversorgung bad karlshafen germany the concentrated feed was stored at 4 c and mixed at 10 rpm the general recipe for the feed is presented in supporting information section s 3 however for full scale testing tap water was used instead of deionized water this resulted in some nutrients needing to be added in lesser part or not at all to match the same target minimum concentrations aeration was provided to the bambi at a rate of 20 l min directly below the membrane module through aeration tubing air curtain 90 cm guangdong risheng shenzhen china producing bubbles approximately 3 4 mm in diameter water that passed through the biofilm and through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir and then pumped tauchpumpe typ 04 from the reservoir to a clean water storage tank every 5 min the water level in the bambi was maintained at approximately 42 l which corresponded to approximately 75 of the membrane surface area being submerged in the water this water level also corresponded with a maximum hydraulic pressure at the bottom of the membrane of approximately 40 mbar feeding and permeate pumps were activated using process control hardware endress hauser ag reinach bl switzerland and automation software codesys 3s smart software solutions gmbh kempten germany and citectscada schneider electric rueil malmaison france this bambi was initially inoculated with 0 5 l of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant after approximately 6 weeks of operation steady state performance was achieved the system was then operated for a period of 100 days and doc ammonium and nitrate were measured the bambi system is intended to completely recycle water in future testing however this initial testing was conducted in a once through configuration permitting greater control of the nutrient levels in the system 2 3 chemical measurements doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l kyoto japan the sum of ammonium and ammonia was measured with gas diffusion flow injection foss hillerød demark nitrite nitrate and chloride were measured by ion chromatography metrohm 881 herisau switzerland nitrogen and sulfur concentrations in soap humic acid and personal care products were measured with a euroea3000 elemental analyzer eurovector pavia italy calcium potassium magnesium and phosphorus were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry spectro arcos kleve germany concentrations of all other elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry t7500ce icp ms agilent santa clara usa aoc and gp measurement procedures were based on the work of hammes and egli 2005 and prest et al 2016 all details of aoc and gp procedures are described in great detail in supporting information section s 5 however aoc and gp both measure the amount of bacterial growth that can be supported by the carbon and other nutrients in the water in the case of aoc the water sample is spiked with nutrients to ensure carbon limitation in gp testing growth is based on nutrient limitation within the sample 3 results and discussion the results and discussion section is organized into two main parts the first part sections 3 1 quantifies the mass inputs to hand washing water and assesses each input for nutrient balance with respect to biological treatment requirements and presents a supplementing strategy to correct nutrient imbalance the second part sections 3 2 and 3 3 investigates first the differences in mechanism and performance between biological treatment with the realistic nutrient deficient and nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing waters in batch testing then the long term performance of the nutrient balanced solution was investigated in a full scale bambi system 3 1 quantifying and characterizing inputs to hand washing water and synthetic recipes the main identified inputs into hand washing water were soap dirt dried skin and moisturizer representative volumes of liquid soap and washing water per hand washing event have been measured as 1 5 ml soap and 1 l water larson et al 1987 consumer oriented hand soaps do not often include a list of ingredients and their concentrations to overcome this uncertainty in the composition of commercial soaps a custom liquid soap recipe was developed using exclusively biodegradable ingredients the components and their relative contributions were selected based on compatible ingredients we do observe in commercial soap products detailed representative formulations for soap products presented by hargreaves 2003 and the synthetic greywater composition constructed by hourlier et al 2010 and other existing synthetic greywater recipes presented in section 1 1 2 our custom eawag soap recipe utilized sodium dodecyl sulfate sds ch3 ch2 11so4na as the sole surfactant glycerol c3h8o3 as a moisturizer 1 sodium chloride nacl as a stabilizing agent and lactic acid ch3ch oh cooh to reduce the ph to approximately 6 5 the final soap recipe was 140 g l sds 50 g l glycerol 10 g l nacl and 0 7 g l lactic acid this soap was then included in the synthetic hand washing water at a ratio of 1 5 ml l larson et al 1987 the processes for estimating the mass contributions from dirt skin and moisturizer are based on measurements in the literature and estimation explained in the supporting information section s 6 table 3 summarizes the mass concentrations of all the inputs to hand washing water by evaluating the relative mass contributions of different hand washing water inputs we see that soap is tremendously dominant representing over 90 of the dry mass of inputs to the water looking then at individual components of the soap sds and glycerol are the most significant ingredients respectively 69 8 and 24 9 of the total soap dry mass table 4 and thus also dominant in hand washing greywater the toc aoc and concentrations of other nutrients present in each individual contributing material were characterized individually and are presented in table 5 three commercial soaps are compared with the custom soap developed for this study also examined are the composition of dirt and skin along with commercially available personal care products that are expected to be present in the hand washing water sunscreen and skin moisturizer and tap water while we acknowledge there could be great variation in the composition of dirt to be washed off hands we are representing dirt in this study with a compiled dust and a commercially harvested humic acid all values for soaps sunscreens and humic acid were measured in our laboratory values for dust and skin were assembled from literature sources explained in greater detail in supporting information section s 7 the elemental composition of tap water is presented for the city of zürich switzerland city of zürich 2016 with an aoc value as measured by hammes et al 2006 for each input source the theoretical concentration required of each element to balance the toc from that input was calculated and compared to the actual concentration of that element the estimated nutrient requirements to balance a given concentration of carbon was calculated directly from the elemental composition of biomass compiled from egli 2015 rouf 1964 as introduced in section 1 2 and described in greater detail in supporing information section s 8 the four examined soaps presented large variations in toc ranging between 24 600 and 93 400 mgc l even greater variation was observed in aoc concentrations there was no microbial growth at all in one of the commercial soaps while more than half the organic carbon was assimilated in a second commercial soap and in our custom made soap in terms of nutrient balance the soaps as well as all other inputs were determined to contribute insufficient nutrients to balance the carbon only sulfur was present in sufficient concentrations to meet the nutrient requirements in all soaps while nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur contents in dust are insufficient to balance the organic carbon in dust all other elements exceed the concentrations required for biological nutrient balance for the humic acid mixture in contrast none of the elements were present in sufficient quantities to balance the carbon an aoc assay on a 1 mgc l solution of the humic acid mixture yielded a 0 5 reduction in the toc similarly to dust and humic acid skin contains a high proportion of carbon compared to all other elements only calcium is estimated to be present in a concentration sufficient to balance the carbon the examined sunscreens and moisturizer had similar compositions in terms of carbon 100 000 mg kg and other nutrients however aoc to doc ratios were tremendously lower in the sunscreens than in the moisturizer which may be due to the presence of various ingredients toxic to microorganisms like titanium dioxide in the sunscreens similarly to the examined soaps sunscreens and moisturizer were nutrient deficient with respect to carbon table 6 combines the results from tables 3 and 5 presenting the elemental contribution of all individual inputs reflecting the relative mass contributions of each input elements present in concentrations below the detection limit were assumed to be completely absent in the hand washing water input the three most right columns of table 6 present the elemental compositions of a representative hand washing water the estimated biological nutrient requirements to balance the carbon content of the representative water and a nutrient balanced version of the representative water which is supplemented with the nutrients in which we estimate it to be deficient the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the realistic hand washing water are based on real world measurements conducted in hand washing water jefferson et al 2004 and the target concentrations for all other elements using measurements conducted in combined greywater jefferson et al 2001 these values are generally consistent with the diversity of measurements presented in section 1 1 1 the nutrient balanced composition is based on supplementing any deficient nutrients to satisfy the nutrient balancing requirements comparing the assembled compositions based on the sum of identified inputs to the representative composition based on measured values demonstrates a general pairwise similarity for the concentration of most nutrients the assembled and representative compositions also both show in yellow highlights in table 6 similar nutrient deficiencies we observe each to be deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus and many micro nutrients such deficiencies are expected though as we have demonstrated in table 5 deficiencies in all contributing inputs table 6 also demonstrates the significance of operating a treatment system with recycling or without the nutrient contribution of the initial water stock could become less significant over time in a recycling system we estimate substantially lower concentrations of some nutrients e g calcium magnesium and potassium in systems that continuously recycle water as opposed to systems that treat the water once and then receive new water with each usage as tap water is however itself not nutrient balanced some nutrients must still be supplemented in each case to achieve biological nutrient balance however the amounts required could be different for other nutrients such as calcium or magnesium the inclusion of tap water may greatly exceed the biological requirements 3 2 impacts of nutrient imbalance during short term experiments the impacts of nutrient balancing were examined in batch testing with one solution formulated to match a representative hand washing water composition and a second solution matching the components of the representative hand washing water but including additional nutrients in which we believe the representative solution to be biologically deficient each solution was adjusted to contain 10 mgc l toc to reduce inhibition from excessive surfactant an inoculum of bacteria was added to flasks of each solution and incubated for 10 days changes in the doc aoc gp and tcc values are presented in fig 2 to measure aoc a sample of water is incubated with a bacterial inoculum and spiked with a sufficient concentrations of all other nutrients to ensure that carbon will be limiting to measure growth potential in contrast the sample is incubated without any additional nutrients and therefore growth can be limited by whatever nutrient is limiting in the sample not only carbon though some bacteria in the inoculum were acclimated to grow on the carbon supplied in the hand washing water no growth was observed until approximately 24 h of incubation following this apparent lag phase doc aoc growth potential and tcc values for the nutrient balanced hand washing water all transitioned from initial values to approximately final values within one sample interval 16 h both doc and aoc stabilized at concentrations of approximately 1 7 and 0 09 mgc l respectively 76 and 99 reductions of the initial concentrations the growth potential in the nutrient balanced hand washing water followed the same evolution as the aoc confirming that the nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water did contain sufficient concentrations of other nutrients to balance the carbon content of the water the decreases in organic carbon aoc and growth potential observed in the batch reactor with nutrient balancing was accompanied by growth of bacterial cells finally stabilizing at a tcc of 6 4 107 cells ml testing with the representative hand washing water resulted in a more gradual reduction in organic carbon and a higher final concentration in doc of 3 5 mgc l 54 reduction and aoc of 1 2 mgc l 86 reduction the growth potential of the representative hand washing water was only 15 of the growth potential in the nutrient balanced hand washing water this limited growth potential resulted in limited cell growth in the experimental flask with final concentrations of only 1 106 cells ml net cell growth did not continue after 1 day of growth following 1 day lag however greater than 80 of aoc remained in the flask and then 80 of this remaining aoc would be ultimately consumed reductions in aoc in the absence of net growth may be largely attributed to cellular maintenance functions these two types of processes growth and maintenance functions have been thoroughly explored for different demands in terms of carbon and energy but in our context can be considered to be different mechanisms of carbon removal while the growth based removal in the nutrient balanced batch test produced rapid minutes or hours reductions in organic carbon the maintenance based removal required days 6 to reach ultimate removal values 3 3 long term testing with nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water at full scale nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water was tested in a household scale bambi fig 3 presents concentrations of doc ammonium and nitrate in the reactor permeate over 100 days of stable operation the concentrations of doc and total nitrogen in the feed water were 130 mgc l and 31 mgn l 10 mgn l of which as ammonium respectively the membrane permeate displayed doc averages of 4 8 3 2 mgn l ammonium at or close to the quantification level of 0 2 mgn l and nitrate averages of 3 5 1 5 mgn l a small disruption occurred on day 43 where the ammonium concentration increased to 2 7 mgn l this was caused by a temporary interruption in the aeration which limited ammonium conversion but aeration was restored before carbon concentrations in the permeate were significantly impacted ammonium concentrations were again below detection 0 2 mgn l at the following sample point the ammonium concentration in the permeate was more sensitive to this loss of aeration than the carbon in the permeate which was not clearly impacted this behavior may indicate that the normally low ammonium concentration we observe in the permeate may also be dependent on nitrification and this nitrification was significantly limited while the aeration was off our nutrient balancing strategy may be overestimating nitrogen demands of the system if our nitrogen supplement can support both nitrification processes and effective carbon removal through cell growth and maintenance with ammonium generally removed we expect the ultimate fate of nitrogen that enters the system to be either i integrated into biomass through growth ii removed through denitrification or iii reflected in the 3 5 mgn l nitrate that exits bambi in the permeate additional testing could be conducted to better understand how much nitrogen is incorporated into biomass and how much is removed through denitrification the presence of nitrate in the permeate also supports the possibility that we are adding more nitrogen than the system truly requires what our results do clearly show is that our system is able to achieve 95 removal of the carbon and 90 removal of the nitrogen we do add which is an strong position from which to explore further optimization while we believe that as in the batch test nutrient balancing may also promote cell growth in the bambi system any growth and accumulation of biomass that occurred during our test did not negatively impact the performance in terms of water quality or reduction in membrane flux constructive comparisons can be drawn between these residence times within the bambi and the residence times required for carbon removal in the batch tests the residence time in the full scale bambi is only 11 h and the residence time within the biofilm may be only 10 15 min the shorter timescale 16 h for treatment within the nutrient balanced batch experiment is likely more reflective of the 11 h residence time within the bambi in the nutrient balanced batch test we observed growth accompanying the carbon removal to a much greater extent than in the batch test without the nutrient balancing if the impacts of nutrient balancing in the full scale bambi system are similar to what we see in the batch tests we might also expect significant cell growth to occur in the bambi and we might expect that the rate of carbon removal in the bambi might be significantly reduced if the system were operated without nutrient balancing 3 4 nutrient balancing in practice while we have presented variation in literature values for greywater compositions of light greywater measured in different parts of the world section 1 1 1 we have also identified that the dominant inputs to hand washing water are themselves nutrient deficient section 3 1 therefore it is likely that despite any variation in the composition of hand washing water nutrient deficiency may be omnipresent nutrient supplementing can correct nutrient imbalance however the value of this approach is dependent on i the composition and degree of imbalance in of the water ii the mechanisms of biological carbon removal in the treatment system and iii the required performance in terms of removal the representative hand washing water we assembled without nutrient supplement still contained 10 mgn l and sufficient gp to produce 106 cells ml therefore some organic carbon was removed through a growth based mechanism and some was removed through a cellular maintenance based mechanism supplementing the realistic composition with nutrients shifts the relative carbon removal system towards growth and achieves more carbon removal in less time requirements of removal rate and ultimate removal to be achieved are application driven full scale bambi reactors in previous studies treating a similar nutrient balanced wastewater achieved 95 carbon removal künzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 and produced water that was suitable for hand washing after limited anti microbial post treatment nguyen et al 2017 it is possible though that water treated by a biological system without nutrient balancing might produce a water quality that is acceptable for less demanding applications such as toilet flushing or more intensive post treatment may enable usage for more demanding applications while post treatment can improve water quality optimizing a treatment system to increase the treatment rate for maintenance based removal may be challenging effective strategies for nutrient balancing must identify which nutrients to add how much but also when to supplement estimating nutrient requirements with respect to carbon from generic ash content likely overestimates the true demand the bambi in this study was operated as a once through system however accurate nutrient balancing is likely more critical in a recycling system where excess nutrients could accumulate over time promoting growth through nutrient balancing may also reduce the start up time of biofilm systems such as bambi or to help maintain effluent quality during periods of extra waste loading this study has focused exclusively on hand washing water however to expand the application of the bambi or other biological greywater treatment systems we would need to understand the nutrient content of these inputs and the biological compatibility of any additional carbon loading including water from a kitchen sink may contribute a significant amount of nutrients into the system however soap which can be controlled by the users may no longer be the dominant input into water from a kitchen sink treating greywater from a kitchen sink may also introduce tremendous variability in loading between different locations and at the same location over time part of what makes designing a treatment system exclusively for hand washing water a bit less complex than a system that treats all the greywater from a house involves minimizing variability we have estimated in this study that soap is the dominate 90 of dry loading input to hand washing water when we consider a real world application of our bambi system with nutrient balancing the soap would also dominate the loading on the system if the dosage of supplemental nutrients is linked to the usage of the soap possibly by supplementing nutrients directly into the soap itself then the nutrient balance we prescribe for the system can be generally conserved we suggest then that the performance we achieve in our full scale bambi testing with artificial greywater is likely reflective of performance with real greywater because the impact of the materials actually washed off the hands is much less significant than the impacts of the inputs that can be controlled soap and nutrient supplement variability in loading uncertainty in compositions of inputs environmental conditions and many other influences can all impact our ability to realize a treatment strategy in the real world however we must also consider that each of these influences and our ability to engineer solutions through process design including nutrient balancing may ultimately require different strategies in different systems further research is required to better understand the link between the balance of nutrients and the performance of a biological system specifically in the context of promoting either a growth or a maintenance based conversion of carbon this work however demonstrates that these pursuits can be rewarding and that understanding when to supplement and perhaps when not to can have tremendous impacts on the performance of biological systems treating wastewater with nutrient imbalances 4 conclusions hand washing soap is the dominant ingredient in hand washing water accounting for 90 dry mass loading both hand washing soap and the resultant hand washing greywater are generally estimated to be biologically deficient in terms of nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients relative to carbon supplementing nutrients into hand washing water to match estimated biological nutrient requirements increases the removal rates of organic carbon and specifically aoc and achieves lower final organic carbon and aoc concentrations in batch testing with suspended culture but also promotes cell growth long term operation 100 days of a bambi system fed nutrient balanced hand washing water can deliver effective carbon removal 95 without detrimental

19403,on site biological hand washing water treatment can improve global access to safe hand washing water but requires a thorough understanding of the chemical composition of the water to be treated and an effective treatment strategy this study first presents a detailed characterization of the individual inputs to hand washing water we demonstrate i that soap is likely the most significant input in hand washing water representing 90 of mass loading and ii that inputs to hand washing water have low concentrations of biologically essential macro and micro nutrients nitrogen phosphorus potassium copper zinc molybdenum and cobalt with respect to carbon which may impair biological carbon removal this study next formulates a recipe that recreates a representative composition of hand washing water and develops a procedure to identify and supplement nutrients in which this recipe is estimated to be deficient batch testing of the nutrient supplemented hand washing water with an inoculum of planktonic bacteria demonstrated improved assimilable organic carbon removal 99 vs 86 removal and produced lower final dissolved organic carbon concentrations 1 7 mgc l vs 3 5 mgc l compared to realistic nutrient deficient washing water supplementing nutrients did promote cell growth 50x higher final total cell count full scale testing in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi system treating 75 l day of nutrient supplemented hand washing water showed that long term operation 100 days can deliver effective carbon removal 95 without detrimental fouling or other disruptions caused by cell growth this work demonstrates that biological treatment in a bambi system operated with appropriate nutrient balancing offers an effective solution for decentralized treatment of light greywater graphical abstract image 1 keywords soap nitrogen micro nutrients biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi gravity driven membrane gdm handwashing 1 introduction biological treatment processes are essential to meeting current discharge oriented wastewater treatment objectives and we must also look to biological processes to provide water recycling capability to meet the expanding water demands of the future the wastewater stream that can most easily be recovered and recycled for high quality water demands is greywater and more specifically light greywater derived from hand washing and showering due primarily to reduced organic and nutrient loading compared to other wastewater types eriksson et al 2002 effective biological treatment of greywater or any other wastewater requires a balance between biologically essential nutrients the microbial communities that perform the treatment require a variety of essential nutrients for growth and maintenance functions and the exhaustion of an essential nutrient may limit the removal of other nutrients from the wastewater grady et al 2011 effective biological treatment of wastewaters that are not initially nutrient balanced can be achieved by supplementing the deficient nutrients jefferson et al 2001 lechevallier et al 1991 previous studies have estimated nutrient requirements and demonstrated improvements in carbon removal during wastewater treatment following nutrient supplementation burgess et al 1999 jefferson et al 2001 other studies have demonstrated effective biological treatment of greywater without any nutrient supplementation gross et al 2007 whether or not supplementing nutrients improves treatment will depend on the specific source and nutrient composition of the water to be treated while tremendous variations have been observed in greywater samples collected in different parts of the world al jayyousi 2003 friedler 2004 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 part of the variation is based on which inputs are included in the broad category of greywater such as kitchen sink and laundry sources light greywater inputs such as bath shower or hand washing generally contain significantly less dissolved organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus than dark greywater inputs such as kitchen sinks dishwashers or washing machines friedler 2004 therefore understanding the relative volume contributions of specific inputs and the nutrient composition of each specific input impacts design choices for treatment and reuse strategies specifically with respect to meeting nutrient requirements for biological systems no existing study has systematically investigated the quantities and composition of different material inputs to greywater analyzing both the biological compatibility of the carbon and the concentrations provided of other biologically essential nutrients 1 1 understanding the inputs and composition of hand washing water the composition of any wastewater is the sum of materials in the initial water and all the materials that are added during usage in the case of hand washing water the additional materials consist of soap whatever dirt or undesirable materials are intentionally washed off the hands but also traces of personal care products and skin cells existing literature can contribute to our understanding of hand washing water inputs by two different approaches existing literature investigating greywater or greywater treatment often present chemical characterization of real world hand washing water these studies generally do not investigate the quantity or composition of contributing sources or fully analyze the influent water though they can provide information about what the individual contributions can add up to the organic carbon oc is generally expressed as total organic carbon toc or dissolved organic carbon doc but not biologically compatible assimilable organic carbon aoc the second tool we have in existing literature to understand hand washing water inputs is the collection of recipes for synthetic greywater that have been designed in part to recreate the chemical and physical characteristics of measured greywater often with some though incomplete consideration for individual inputs 1 1 1 measurements from real world hand washing water while numerous studies have measured the chemical and physical characteristics of combined greywater measurements specifically for hand washing water are scarce results from studies that have reported measurements from hand washing sinks are summarized in table 1 additional information on each study is presented in supporting information section s 1 the reported bod of hand washing water varies between 100 and 252 mgo2 l and the cod between 110 and 587 mgo2 l as the concentrations of ammonium and other non carbon oxidizable constituents are low in hand washing water between 0 39 mg nh4 n l and 1 15 mgnh4 n l we assume that bod and cod values are dominated by the oxidation of the carbon the bod cod ratio can thus also be used to estimate the biodegradability of the carbon the bod cod ratios for the studies presented in table 1 range from 0 3 to 0 9 but average 0 6 which is 50 higher than the ratio of 0 4 reported for typical domestic wastewaters tchobanoglous et al 2014 total nitrogen tn toc ratios for measured hand washing water range between 0 007 and 0 16 mgn mgc which is lower than the tn toc ratio of 0 21 mgn mgc for typical domestic wastewaters tchobanoglous et al 2014 high phosphorus concentrations up to 48 8 mgp l can potentially be explained by the use of phosphorus based detergents phosphate based detergents are currently banned in many regions including the european union and the united states indicating that only the concentrations reported by jefferson et al 2004 and al jayyousi 2003 should be used as references the phosphorus p toc ratio from jefferson et al 2004 is only 0 001 mgp mgc which is much lower than the p toc ratio of 0 03 mgp mgc for a typical domestic wastewater tchobanoglous et al 2014 to this date only little data are available on micro nutrients in hand washing water jamrah et al 2008 reported concentrations of potassium zinc lead copper and nickel friedler 2004 analyzed samples for silver chromium nickel cadmium manganese copper lead and zinc but found most concentrations to be below the detectable limit we have not identified any study that reports concentrations for all the nutrients regarded as being always or mostly essential for biological treatment egli 2009 even the two studies friedler 2004 jamrah et al 2008 which provide the most detailed micro nutrient analysis do not differentiate the nutrients contributed during hand washing from the nutrients already contained in the water before washing what we can say is that we expect greywater may be more easily biodegradable than municipal wastewater but contains lower nutrient to carbon ratios for essential nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus 1 1 2 synthetic artificial greywater and hand washing water laboratory testing of greywater treatment systems often utilizes synthetic wastewater to provide a consistent feed material diaper et al 2008 hourlier et al 2010 while no synthetic greywater recipe is known specifically for hand washing water many synthetic greywater recipes exist for combined greywater or greywater from unspecified inputs table 2 presents several recipes the main inputs considered in these greywater recipes are detergents soap shampoo and laundry personal care products organic matter e g from dirt kitchen sinks and human body inorganic matter e g from dirt and microbial contamination some of the recipes also include buffers to maintain a stable ph and some salts to mimic a realistic composition of real greywater most greywater recipes use commercial soaps shampoos and detergents to recreate these contributions diaper et al 2008 jefferson et al 2001 surendran and wheatley 1998 hourlier et al 2010 however used sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and glycerol to recreate the contributions of soap and shampoo few synthetic greywater recipes account for the contributions of personal care products diaper et al 2008 used commercially available sunscreen moisturizer toothpaste and deodorant and hourlier et al 2010 added glycerol to represent moisturizing agents organics are added in various forms like cellulose lactic acid humic acid or oil two greywater recipes also add inorganic matter in the form of kaolin clay diaper et al 2008 nghiem et al 2006 many recipes add sodium hydrogen carbonate as a natural buffer as it is usually also present in tap water diaper et al 2008 hourlier et al 2010 jefferson et al 2001 surendran and wheatley 1998 sodium calcium phosphate and ammonium have also been added separately to recreate concentrations in measured greywater future work with synthetic greywater requires understanding how existing recipes can be improved but also what they do well the main drawbacks of existing recipes are a general lack of information regarding i the specific type of greywater heavy vs light and specific inputs kitchen sink or no with in sink grinder or no the recipe intents to mimic ii a complete understanding of how the amounts and types of ingredients used in the synthetic recipes were selected iii the exact composition of the added ingredients and iv a lack of attention to the quantities and the availabilities of biologically relevant nutrients a generic or a non specific synthetic recipe for greywater that may mimic kitchen waste will not as accurately reflect realistic performance in a treatment system as would a recipe designed specifically for hand washing water some recipes have taken steps to link ingredients to inputs such as hand soap skin organic and inorganic dirt and personal care products but not in a complete or quantifiable fashion being complete and quantifiable is necessary to more accurately create a synthetic recipe to reflect a specific input once we build an understanding of inputs we must build a recipe out of reproducible reagents as many existing synthetic greywater recipes use commercial products with compositions that can vary depending on the geographic region and over time they cannot be reproduced accurately the importance of reproducible ingredients has also been stressed in the work of abed and scholz 2016 however their recipe also relies on secondary treatment effluent to supply micronutrients the work of jefferson et al 2001 has indeed noted the importance of nutrients in greywater treatment and this attention must continue additional information for each recipe in the table and the work of abed and scholz 2016 is presented in supporting information section s 2 1 2 nutrient requirements for biological treatment one approach to estimate nutrient requirement for a biological system is based on the elemental composition of the microbial cells egli 2009 harvested biomass can be analyzed for carbon content by conventional toc measurements and elemental composition can be measured in ash following incineration the ratio of elements in the biomass provides an estimate of the ratio of elements in the feed water needed to produce this biomass this approach however does not i account for carbon which is utilized by the cell but not incorporated into biomass or ii account for variation in nutrient composition and demands between different cell types in a diverse population during aerobic degradation in activated sludge systems only between 0 3 and 0 5 units of cell carbon are produced per unit of substrate carbon in high load conditions as the remaining part is oxidized to carbon dioxide during cellular respiration gallert and winter 2005 the elemental composition of different bacterial species have been observed to vary by a factor of almost one hundred rouf 1964 while additional requirements for carbon in energy production indicate that biomass composition would overestimate requirements for other nutrients the true yield of carbon must be less than one the variability observed between the composition of different bacterial species makes it difficult to conclusively estimate the nutrient requirements for a given system comparing the nutrient to carbon ratios for essential nutrients observed in a greywater to the same ratios observed in the elemental composition of cell biomass provides an estimate as to the nutrient balance or limitation of that greywater egli 2009 reports an average nitrogen to carbon ratio in generic bacterial cell biomass of 0 24 mgn mgc the nitrogen to carbon ratios reported in table 1 for four measured hand washing water compositions do not meet this requirement indicating that hand washing water may be deficient in nitrogen and warrants investigation for other nutrients as well 1 3 biologically activated membrane bioreactor one promising biological treatment system that has demonstrated strong performance recycling wastewater chemically similar to greywater is called a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi bambi systems feature an ultrafiltration membrane module immersed in a tank of the water to be treated a biofilm develops on the surface of this membrane that then consumes contaminants from the water as it passes through the biofilm and through the membrane the permeate water is pumped to a storage reservoir to be reused post treatment systems such as granular activated carbon or chlorine production through electrolysis may be necessary to combat the growth of bacteria in the water during storage nguyen et al 2017 unlike conventional membrane bioreactor mbr systems this membrane system does not require any cleaning over the course of standard operation and does not require high pressure to drive water though the system bambi systems are operated in a gravity driven membrane gdm configuration resulting in stable flux without backwashing or other fouling controls chomiak et al 2015 peter varbanets et al 2010 2011 the only pressure needed in a gdm system is supplied by the head of the water treatment in a bambi is predominantly biological and therefore also requires a balance of nutrients household scale bambi systems have demonstrated 95 removal of organic carbon from a wastewater similar in organic loading to hand washing water but contaminated with feces and urine künzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 the contamination of feces and urine in this wastewater ravndal et al 2015 were sufficient to provide a nutrient balance with respect to carbon the specific nutrient requirements of a bambi system have not been previously investigated 1 4 goals of this study the first goal of this study is to understand the quantities and compositions of different inputs to hand washing greywater and how these compositions relate to nutrient balancing requirements of biological treatment this analysis must address both the biological compatibility of the carbon and also the macro and micro nutrient content of each contributing input and construct a strategy to supplement deficient nutrients the second goal is to understand the impact of nutrient balancing on mechanisms of carbon removal and also to evaluate long term performance and stability of a bambi system treating a synthetic hand washing water with nutrient supplement 2 material and methods 2 1 batch testing batch testing consisted of preparing separate 500 ml volumes of representative and nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing waters in sterile 1 l erlenmeyer flasks the representative hand washing water was designed to recreate a generic hand washing water composition the nutrient balanced hand washing water recreated the representative hand washing water composition but then supplemented the nutrients in which we estimate it to be deficient for biological treatment the specific composition of the two hand washing water solutions result from the analysis presented in section 3 1 and are described in detail within that section the recipe of laboratory ingredients that create each solution are presented in supporting information section s 3 for batch testing each recipe was diluted to a concentration of 10 mgc l doc to reduce inhibitory effects of environmental shock on the bacteria and other effects from having too much surfactant the chloride concentration was maintained though following the dilution with nacl to 100 mgcl l each flask was then inoculated with 10 ml of bacterial inoculum supporting information section s 4 incubated at 30 c and mixed at 120 rpm in the dark with monitoring of doc aoc growth potential gp and total cell count tcc 2 2 full scale testing in bambi the bambi system consisted of a 58 cm tall standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra ontario canada featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany placed into a 52 l wastewater linear low density polyethylene tank fig 1 the bambi was fed 75 l day of nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water in 50 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day each feeding event consisted of pumping directly into the bambi a 20x concentrated feed sp quick peristaltic pump head and 5001 pumpdrive with pharmed tubing heidolph instruments schwabach germany and an appropriate dilution of non chlorinated tap water tauchpumpe typ 04 barwig wasserversorgung bad karlshafen germany the concentrated feed was stored at 4 c and mixed at 10 rpm the general recipe for the feed is presented in supporting information section s 3 however for full scale testing tap water was used instead of deionized water this resulted in some nutrients needing to be added in lesser part or not at all to match the same target minimum concentrations aeration was provided to the bambi at a rate of 20 l min directly below the membrane module through aeration tubing air curtain 90 cm guangdong risheng shenzhen china producing bubbles approximately 3 4 mm in diameter water that passed through the biofilm and through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir and then pumped tauchpumpe typ 04 from the reservoir to a clean water storage tank every 5 min the water level in the bambi was maintained at approximately 42 l which corresponded to approximately 75 of the membrane surface area being submerged in the water this water level also corresponded with a maximum hydraulic pressure at the bottom of the membrane of approximately 40 mbar feeding and permeate pumps were activated using process control hardware endress hauser ag reinach bl switzerland and automation software codesys 3s smart software solutions gmbh kempten germany and citectscada schneider electric rueil malmaison france this bambi was initially inoculated with 0 5 l of activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant after approximately 6 weeks of operation steady state performance was achieved the system was then operated for a period of 100 days and doc ammonium and nitrate were measured the bambi system is intended to completely recycle water in future testing however this initial testing was conducted in a once through configuration permitting greater control of the nutrient levels in the system 2 3 chemical measurements doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc l kyoto japan the sum of ammonium and ammonia was measured with gas diffusion flow injection foss hillerød demark nitrite nitrate and chloride were measured by ion chromatography metrohm 881 herisau switzerland nitrogen and sulfur concentrations in soap humic acid and personal care products were measured with a euroea3000 elemental analyzer eurovector pavia italy calcium potassium magnesium and phosphorus were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry spectro arcos kleve germany concentrations of all other elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry t7500ce icp ms agilent santa clara usa aoc and gp measurement procedures were based on the work of hammes and egli 2005 and prest et al 2016 all details of aoc and gp procedures are described in great detail in supporting information section s 5 however aoc and gp both measure the amount of bacterial growth that can be supported by the carbon and other nutrients in the water in the case of aoc the water sample is spiked with nutrients to ensure carbon limitation in gp testing growth is based on nutrient limitation within the sample 3 results and discussion the results and discussion section is organized into two main parts the first part sections 3 1 quantifies the mass inputs to hand washing water and assesses each input for nutrient balance with respect to biological treatment requirements and presents a supplementing strategy to correct nutrient imbalance the second part sections 3 2 and 3 3 investigates first the differences in mechanism and performance between biological treatment with the realistic nutrient deficient and nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing waters in batch testing then the long term performance of the nutrient balanced solution was investigated in a full scale bambi system 3 1 quantifying and characterizing inputs to hand washing water and synthetic recipes the main identified inputs into hand washing water were soap dirt dried skin and moisturizer representative volumes of liquid soap and washing water per hand washing event have been measured as 1 5 ml soap and 1 l water larson et al 1987 consumer oriented hand soaps do not often include a list of ingredients and their concentrations to overcome this uncertainty in the composition of commercial soaps a custom liquid soap recipe was developed using exclusively biodegradable ingredients the components and their relative contributions were selected based on compatible ingredients we do observe in commercial soap products detailed representative formulations for soap products presented by hargreaves 2003 and the synthetic greywater composition constructed by hourlier et al 2010 and other existing synthetic greywater recipes presented in section 1 1 2 our custom eawag soap recipe utilized sodium dodecyl sulfate sds ch3 ch2 11so4na as the sole surfactant glycerol c3h8o3 as a moisturizer 1 sodium chloride nacl as a stabilizing agent and lactic acid ch3ch oh cooh to reduce the ph to approximately 6 5 the final soap recipe was 140 g l sds 50 g l glycerol 10 g l nacl and 0 7 g l lactic acid this soap was then included in the synthetic hand washing water at a ratio of 1 5 ml l larson et al 1987 the processes for estimating the mass contributions from dirt skin and moisturizer are based on measurements in the literature and estimation explained in the supporting information section s 6 table 3 summarizes the mass concentrations of all the inputs to hand washing water by evaluating the relative mass contributions of different hand washing water inputs we see that soap is tremendously dominant representing over 90 of the dry mass of inputs to the water looking then at individual components of the soap sds and glycerol are the most significant ingredients respectively 69 8 and 24 9 of the total soap dry mass table 4 and thus also dominant in hand washing greywater the toc aoc and concentrations of other nutrients present in each individual contributing material were characterized individually and are presented in table 5 three commercial soaps are compared with the custom soap developed for this study also examined are the composition of dirt and skin along with commercially available personal care products that are expected to be present in the hand washing water sunscreen and skin moisturizer and tap water while we acknowledge there could be great variation in the composition of dirt to be washed off hands we are representing dirt in this study with a compiled dust and a commercially harvested humic acid all values for soaps sunscreens and humic acid were measured in our laboratory values for dust and skin were assembled from literature sources explained in greater detail in supporting information section s 7 the elemental composition of tap water is presented for the city of zürich switzerland city of zürich 2016 with an aoc value as measured by hammes et al 2006 for each input source the theoretical concentration required of each element to balance the toc from that input was calculated and compared to the actual concentration of that element the estimated nutrient requirements to balance a given concentration of carbon was calculated directly from the elemental composition of biomass compiled from egli 2015 rouf 1964 as introduced in section 1 2 and described in greater detail in supporing information section s 8 the four examined soaps presented large variations in toc ranging between 24 600 and 93 400 mgc l even greater variation was observed in aoc concentrations there was no microbial growth at all in one of the commercial soaps while more than half the organic carbon was assimilated in a second commercial soap and in our custom made soap in terms of nutrient balance the soaps as well as all other inputs were determined to contribute insufficient nutrients to balance the carbon only sulfur was present in sufficient concentrations to meet the nutrient requirements in all soaps while nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur contents in dust are insufficient to balance the organic carbon in dust all other elements exceed the concentrations required for biological nutrient balance for the humic acid mixture in contrast none of the elements were present in sufficient quantities to balance the carbon an aoc assay on a 1 mgc l solution of the humic acid mixture yielded a 0 5 reduction in the toc similarly to dust and humic acid skin contains a high proportion of carbon compared to all other elements only calcium is estimated to be present in a concentration sufficient to balance the carbon the examined sunscreens and moisturizer had similar compositions in terms of carbon 100 000 mg kg and other nutrients however aoc to doc ratios were tremendously lower in the sunscreens than in the moisturizer which may be due to the presence of various ingredients toxic to microorganisms like titanium dioxide in the sunscreens similarly to the examined soaps sunscreens and moisturizer were nutrient deficient with respect to carbon table 6 combines the results from tables 3 and 5 presenting the elemental contribution of all individual inputs reflecting the relative mass contributions of each input elements present in concentrations below the detection limit were assumed to be completely absent in the hand washing water input the three most right columns of table 6 present the elemental compositions of a representative hand washing water the estimated biological nutrient requirements to balance the carbon content of the representative water and a nutrient balanced version of the representative water which is supplemented with the nutrients in which we estimate it to be deficient the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the realistic hand washing water are based on real world measurements conducted in hand washing water jefferson et al 2004 and the target concentrations for all other elements using measurements conducted in combined greywater jefferson et al 2001 these values are generally consistent with the diversity of measurements presented in section 1 1 1 the nutrient balanced composition is based on supplementing any deficient nutrients to satisfy the nutrient balancing requirements comparing the assembled compositions based on the sum of identified inputs to the representative composition based on measured values demonstrates a general pairwise similarity for the concentration of most nutrients the assembled and representative compositions also both show in yellow highlights in table 6 similar nutrient deficiencies we observe each to be deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus and many micro nutrients such deficiencies are expected though as we have demonstrated in table 5 deficiencies in all contributing inputs table 6 also demonstrates the significance of operating a treatment system with recycling or without the nutrient contribution of the initial water stock could become less significant over time in a recycling system we estimate substantially lower concentrations of some nutrients e g calcium magnesium and potassium in systems that continuously recycle water as opposed to systems that treat the water once and then receive new water with each usage as tap water is however itself not nutrient balanced some nutrients must still be supplemented in each case to achieve biological nutrient balance however the amounts required could be different for other nutrients such as calcium or magnesium the inclusion of tap water may greatly exceed the biological requirements 3 2 impacts of nutrient imbalance during short term experiments the impacts of nutrient balancing were examined in batch testing with one solution formulated to match a representative hand washing water composition and a second solution matching the components of the representative hand washing water but including additional nutrients in which we believe the representative solution to be biologically deficient each solution was adjusted to contain 10 mgc l toc to reduce inhibition from excessive surfactant an inoculum of bacteria was added to flasks of each solution and incubated for 10 days changes in the doc aoc gp and tcc values are presented in fig 2 to measure aoc a sample of water is incubated with a bacterial inoculum and spiked with a sufficient concentrations of all other nutrients to ensure that carbon will be limiting to measure growth potential in contrast the sample is incubated without any additional nutrients and therefore growth can be limited by whatever nutrient is limiting in the sample not only carbon though some bacteria in the inoculum were acclimated to grow on the carbon supplied in the hand washing water no growth was observed until approximately 24 h of incubation following this apparent lag phase doc aoc growth potential and tcc values for the nutrient balanced hand washing water all transitioned from initial values to approximately final values within one sample interval 16 h both doc and aoc stabilized at concentrations of approximately 1 7 and 0 09 mgc l respectively 76 and 99 reductions of the initial concentrations the growth potential in the nutrient balanced hand washing water followed the same evolution as the aoc confirming that the nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water did contain sufficient concentrations of other nutrients to balance the carbon content of the water the decreases in organic carbon aoc and growth potential observed in the batch reactor with nutrient balancing was accompanied by growth of bacterial cells finally stabilizing at a tcc of 6 4 107 cells ml testing with the representative hand washing water resulted in a more gradual reduction in organic carbon and a higher final concentration in doc of 3 5 mgc l 54 reduction and aoc of 1 2 mgc l 86 reduction the growth potential of the representative hand washing water was only 15 of the growth potential in the nutrient balanced hand washing water this limited growth potential resulted in limited cell growth in the experimental flask with final concentrations of only 1 106 cells ml net cell growth did not continue after 1 day of growth following 1 day lag however greater than 80 of aoc remained in the flask and then 80 of this remaining aoc would be ultimately consumed reductions in aoc in the absence of net growth may be largely attributed to cellular maintenance functions these two types of processes growth and maintenance functions have been thoroughly explored for different demands in terms of carbon and energy but in our context can be considered to be different mechanisms of carbon removal while the growth based removal in the nutrient balanced batch test produced rapid minutes or hours reductions in organic carbon the maintenance based removal required days 6 to reach ultimate removal values 3 3 long term testing with nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water at full scale nutrient balanced synthetic hand washing water was tested in a household scale bambi fig 3 presents concentrations of doc ammonium and nitrate in the reactor permeate over 100 days of stable operation the concentrations of doc and total nitrogen in the feed water were 130 mgc l and 31 mgn l 10 mgn l of which as ammonium respectively the membrane permeate displayed doc averages of 4 8 3 2 mgn l ammonium at or close to the quantification level of 0 2 mgn l and nitrate averages of 3 5 1 5 mgn l a small disruption occurred on day 43 where the ammonium concentration increased to 2 7 mgn l this was caused by a temporary interruption in the aeration which limited ammonium conversion but aeration was restored before carbon concentrations in the permeate were significantly impacted ammonium concentrations were again below detection 0 2 mgn l at the following sample point the ammonium concentration in the permeate was more sensitive to this loss of aeration than the carbon in the permeate which was not clearly impacted this behavior may indicate that the normally low ammonium concentration we observe in the permeate may also be dependent on nitrification and this nitrification was significantly limited while the aeration was off our nutrient balancing strategy may be overestimating nitrogen demands of the system if our nitrogen supplement can support both nitrification processes and effective carbon removal through cell growth and maintenance with ammonium generally removed we expect the ultimate fate of nitrogen that enters the system to be either i integrated into biomass through growth ii removed through denitrification or iii reflected in the 3 5 mgn l nitrate that exits bambi in the permeate additional testing could be conducted to better understand how much nitrogen is incorporated into biomass and how much is removed through denitrification the presence of nitrate in the permeate also supports the possibility that we are adding more nitrogen than the system truly requires what our results do clearly show is that our system is able to achieve 95 removal of the carbon and 90 removal of the nitrogen we do add which is an strong position from which to explore further optimization while we believe that as in the batch test nutrient balancing may also promote cell growth in the bambi system any growth and accumulation of biomass that occurred during our test did not negatively impact the performance in terms of water quality or reduction in membrane flux constructive comparisons can be drawn between these residence times within the bambi and the residence times required for carbon removal in the batch tests the residence time in the full scale bambi is only 11 h and the residence time within the biofilm may be only 10 15 min the shorter timescale 16 h for treatment within the nutrient balanced batch experiment is likely more reflective of the 11 h residence time within the bambi in the nutrient balanced batch test we observed growth accompanying the carbon removal to a much greater extent than in the batch test without the nutrient balancing if the impacts of nutrient balancing in the full scale bambi system are similar to what we see in the batch tests we might also expect significant cell growth to occur in the bambi and we might expect that the rate of carbon removal in the bambi might be significantly reduced if the system were operated without nutrient balancing 3 4 nutrient balancing in practice while we have presented variation in literature values for greywater compositions of light greywater measured in different parts of the world section 1 1 1 we have also identified that the dominant inputs to hand washing water are themselves nutrient deficient section 3 1 therefore it is likely that despite any variation in the composition of hand washing water nutrient deficiency may be omnipresent nutrient supplementing can correct nutrient imbalance however the value of this approach is dependent on i the composition and degree of imbalance in of the water ii the mechanisms of biological carbon removal in the treatment system and iii the required performance in terms of removal the representative hand washing water we assembled without nutrient supplement still contained 10 mgn l and sufficient gp to produce 106 cells ml therefore some organic carbon was removed through a growth based mechanism and some was removed through a cellular maintenance based mechanism supplementing the realistic composition with nutrients shifts the relative carbon removal system towards growth and achieves more carbon removal in less time requirements of removal rate and ultimate removal to be achieved are application driven full scale bambi reactors in previous studies treating a similar nutrient balanced wastewater achieved 95 carbon removal künzle et al 2015 ravndal et al 2015 and produced water that was suitable for hand washing after limited anti microbial post treatment nguyen et al 2017 it is possible though that water treated by a biological system without nutrient balancing might produce a water quality that is acceptable for less demanding applications such as toilet flushing or more intensive post treatment may enable usage for more demanding applications while post treatment can improve water quality optimizing a treatment system to increase the treatment rate for maintenance based removal may be challenging effective strategies for nutrient balancing must identify which nutrients to add how much but also when to supplement estimating nutrient requirements with respect to carbon from generic ash content likely overestimates the true demand the bambi in this study was operated as a once through system however accurate nutrient balancing is likely more critical in a recycling system where excess nutrients could accumulate over time promoting growth through nutrient balancing may also reduce the start up time of biofilm systems such as bambi or to help maintain effluent quality during periods of extra waste loading this study has focused exclusively on hand washing water however to expand the application of the bambi or other biological greywater treatment systems we would need to understand the nutrient content of these inputs and the biological compatibility of any additional carbon loading including water from a kitchen sink may contribute a significant amount of nutrients into the system however soap which can be controlled by the users may no longer be the dominant input into water from a kitchen sink treating greywater from a kitchen sink may also introduce tremendous variability in loading between different locations and at the same location over time part of what makes designing a treatment system exclusively for hand washing water a bit less complex than a system that treats all the greywater from a house involves minimizing variability we have estimated in this study that soap is the dominate 90 of dry loading input to hand washing water when we consider a real world application of our bambi system with nutrient balancing the soap would also dominate the loading on the system if the dosage of supplemental nutrients is linked to the usage of the soap possibly by supplementing nutrients directly into the soap itself then the nutrient balance we prescribe for the system can be generally conserved we suggest then that the performance we achieve in our full scale bambi testing with artificial greywater is likely reflective of performance with real greywater because the impact of the materials actually washed off the hands is much less significant than the impacts of the inputs that can be controlled soap and nutrient supplement variability in loading uncertainty in compositions of inputs environmental conditions and many other influences can all impact our ability to realize a treatment strategy in the real world however we must also consider that each of these influences and our ability to engineer solutions through process design including nutrient balancing may ultimately require different strategies in different systems further research is required to better understand the link between the balance of nutrients and the performance of a biological system specifically in the context of promoting either a growth or a maintenance based conversion of carbon this work however demonstrates that these pursuits can be rewarding and that understanding when to supplement and perhaps when not to can have tremendous impacts on the performance of biological systems treating wastewater with nutrient imbalances 4 conclusions hand washing soap is the dominant ingredient in hand washing water accounting for 90 dry mass loading both hand washing soap and the resultant hand washing greywater are generally estimated to be biologically deficient in terms of nitrogen phosphorus and other nutrients relative to carbon supplementing nutrients into hand washing water to match estimated biological nutrient requirements increases the removal rates of organic carbon and specifically aoc and achieves lower final organic carbon and aoc concentrations in batch testing with suspended culture but also promotes cell growth long term operation 100 days of a bambi system fed nutrient balanced hand washing water can deliver effective carbon removal 95 without detrimental

19404,a novel aao sbspr anaerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch sidestream phosphorus recovery process was developed for phosphorus p recovery and nutrient removal from municipal wastewater meanwhile an operational strategy based on the p mass balance for the process was proposed where p recovery rate was coupled with sludge retention time srt so as to reduce the impact of p recovery on p content in activated sludge and maintain a stable operation of the process the results show that the proposed operational strategy is helpful for the stable operation of the aao sbspr process and up to 65 of the influent p was recovered with the phosphate removal efficiency of 99 1 both p recovery and extended srt had limited influence on the p release and uptake rates of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos the results of high throughput sequencing analysis indicated that the relative abundance of accumulibacter increased while srt was extended under high p recovery rate moreover significant promotion of simultaneous nitrogen removal and p uptake was observed where the ratio of anoxic p uptake to the total p uptake of the whole process increased from 41 7 in the aao process to 77 5 in the aao sbspr process combined with the increase of total nitrogen tn removal efficiency from 71 9 to 80 4 the p recovery process is also beneficial for the reduction of sludge production and nitrification process as srt was extended for high p recovery rate overall the aao sbspr process together with the operational strategy proposed in this study provides a promising and practical alternative for p recovery from municipal wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery aao sbspr process operational strategy p mass balance sludge retention time nutrient removal 1 introduction phosphorus p is a nonmetal of the nitrogen group which is essential to all life on the earth it is widely used as a raw material in many areas including household applications and agricultural applications accounting for 95 of the global phosphate production such as fertilizer industry to increase the crop yield phosphorus based pesticide and animal feed supplements cisse and mrabet 2004 desmidt et al 2015 however it was reported that the economically available phosphate mineral reserves can only be maintained for 30 years after which the global demand for phosphate will exceed supply and lead to global p scarcity cordell et al 2009 on the other hand the presence of p in natural water bodies has a great impact on aquatic ecosystems excessive p can lead to eutrophication of water bodies resulting in a sharp drop in biodiversity in the water and contamination of drinking water sources therefore to protect the water bodies from p induced pollution techniques such as chemical precipitation and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr have been used in wastewater treatment plant wwtp to remove p meanwhile approximately 10 20 of the total global p demand could be satisfied if the p was recovered from municipal wastewater yuan et al 2012 basically there are two ways to recover p from the municipal wwtps with nutrient removal one way focuses on recovering p from the sludge line after the anaerobic digestion and the other way recovers p from the wastewater treatment line in general as approximately 90 95 of the influent p load is finally incorporated into the sludge the potential of p recovery from sludge or sewage sludge ash is higher than that from water line whose maximum p recovery potential ranged in 50 70 levlin and hultman 2003 cordell et al 2009 petzet and cornel 2011 however the methods for recovering p from sludge line have some disadvantages such as the uncontrolled precipitation of struvite inside the anaerobic digester besides the presence of calcium and or magnesium ions as well as the silicate hinder the transition of p from the solid phase to the liquid phase wild et al 1996 these problems result in a large variation of p recovery rate 0 75 from the sludge line strickland 1999 petzet and cornel 2011 whereas the p recovery rate from the wastewater treatment line is stable which is around 60 70 according to levlin and hultman 2003 furthermore the cost of recovering p from water line is almost half of that from the sludge line strickland 1999 balmer 2004 cordell et al 2009 therefore recovering p from water line is considered to be a more economical strategy and it could be easily implemented in the municipal wwtp if well designed one option to recover p from the water line is to generate p rich supernatant using sidestream treatment the sidestream treatment often affiliates to ebpr process in municipal wwtps the main mechanism of ebpr process is to enrich p into the biomass as polyphosphate poly p by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos where the p content in activated sludge could reach up to 5 7 in a full scale wwtp metcalf eddy tchobanoglous burton stensel 2003 the p concentrated solution can be acquired by sidestream treatment where an anaerobic condition is usually provided to release p from biomass to the liquid phase in recent years many of such recovery processes have been reported levlin hultman 2003 cordell et al 2009 desmidt et al 2015 these processes may include the conventional ebpr processes such as university of capetown uct and anaerobic anoxic oxic aao as the mainstream process to enrich p in biomass and the p rich supernatant is generated either by sidestream treatment or directly diverged from the anaerobic tank of the mainstream processes levlin and hultman 2003 however regardless of various configurations of the p recovery processes many researchers had found that there is a negative correlation between p recovery rate and the p content in activated sludge xia et al 2014 lv et al 2014 acevedo et al 2015 which is contrary to the stable operation of the mainstream ebpr systems excessive extraction of p may lead to the depletion of the poly p in biomass which is an important energy source for paos and an indicator of the performance of ebpr systems henze et al 2008 consequently deterioration of the ebpr systems may occur due to the proliferation of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos lv et al 2014 moreover as reported by barat and van loosdrecht 2006 excessive extraction of p may also be detrimental to the nitrification process in the mainstream system therefore a balance between p recovery rate and the stable operation of the mainstream ebpr process should be explored in this study a novel aao sbspr anaerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch sidestream phosphorus recovery process was proposed in which a conventional aao mainstream line was coupled with a sidestream p recovery line the sidestream p recovery process was operated in a batch mode the aao sbspr process was designed based on p mass balance strategy with consideration of p recovery rate srt and the p content in activated sludge at high p recovery rate in order to alleviate the conflict between the p extraction and p content in sludge the srt of the p recovery process was extended to reduce the loss of p from the system several operation modes were applied to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed operational strategy and the p mass balance equation was validated by the experimental data acquired from those operation modes the performance of the p recovery and nutrient removal for each operation mode as well as the microbial community were also investigated the aim of this research is to demonstrate the applicability of the novel aao sbspr process based on the proposed operational strategy at a laboratory scale and to provide a new perspective on the transition of municipal wwtp from traditional biological nutrient removal process into a nutrient recovery process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the composition of the synthetic municipal wastewater fed to the aao and aao sbspr processes were as follows 150 mg l sodium acetate 117 mgcod l 50 mg l glucose 53 mgcod l 150 mg l peptone approximately provide 170 mgcod l and 25 mgn l 90 mg l nh4cl 23 mgn l 31 mg l kh2po4 7 mgp l 123 mg l mgso4 7h2o 125 mg l cacl2 and 1 0 ml mineral medium solution the details of the medium can be found in smolders et al 1994 the synthetic wastewater was maintained between ph 7 8 by adding nahco3 influent cod tn tp and nh4 n concentrations are presented in table 1 2 2 operation of the aao and aao sbspr processes fig 1 shows the configuration of the aao sbspr process the process consisted of two parts the mainstream aao reactor for nutrient removal and sidestream sequencing batch reactors sbr for p recovery during the operation of the process part of the sludge in the secondary clarifier was pumped into the sidestream p release reactor prr and in the meantime part of the influent was also diverged into the prr to provide the carbon source for p release under anaerobic conditions after p was released to the liquid phase the sludge was allowed to settle to obtain the p enriched supernatant which was then pumped to the chemical precipitation reactor where p was recovered by adding ca oh 2 the settled sludge was recycled back to the anoxic tank of the aao reactor the supernatant of the chemical precipitation reactor after p recovery was pumped back to the influent of the aao reactor to further remove the residual cod nitrogen n and other contaminants three lab scale parallel aao sbspr systems were set up in this study the working volume of the aao reactor was 10 l the volume ratio of the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks was 1 1 3 the volume of the secondary clarifier was 4 l the total volume of prr was 5 l prr was operated in sequencing batch mode with a 24 h cycle per day sludge filling period 2 5 h wastewater filling period 0 5 h providing cod for p release anaerobic reaction period with stirring 3 h settling period 3 h supernatant decanting period 0 5 h sludge recycling period 2 5 h idle period 12 h the total influent flowrate to either the aao or the aao sbspr process was kept at 20 l d with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h for the aao reactor the internal recycle rate and sludge recycle rate of the aao system were 300 and 80 of the influent flowrate respectively the do concentration in the aerobic tank of the aao reactor ranged from 1 5 to 2 5 mg l the three parallel systems were first operated in conventional aao configuration without sidestream p recovery module the seed activated sludge was obtained from a full scale municipal wwtp in shanghai when the stable performance of n and p removal was achieved the p recovery sidestream module was integrated into the aao mainstream line and the system was operated as the aao sbspr configuration mode the excess sludge was discharged from the systems by discarding a certain amount of mixed liquor from the aerobic tank either in the aao process or in the aao sbspr process for the aao sbspr process the excess sludge was wasted after the sludge in prr was recycled to the aao reactor the influent cod p and n loads of the aao sbspr process remained unchanged compared to the aao process both the aao and aao sbspr processes were operated in a temperature controlled room at 20 c to reduce the negative impact of the sidestream p recovery on the intracellular poly p content of paos the aao sbspr process was operated according to a strategy where the p recovery rate was correlated with srt of the aao sbspr process based on the p mass balance of the process the relationship between p recovery rate and srt as well as the p content in activated sludge of the aao sbspr process can be described by eq 1 the deduction of eq 1 can be found in supplementary data 1 r 100 1 c p eff c p 0 p s y δ s c p 0 1 k d srt where r is p recovery rate cp 0 and cp eff are influent and effluent total p concentration respectively mg l ps is the p content in activated sludge mgp mgvss y is the yield coefficient of activated sludge 1 d s is cod removed by the aao or aao sbspr process mg l kd is endogenous decay coefficient of the activated sludge 1 d it can be seen from eq 1 that the p content in activated sludge will decrease while increasing the p recovery rate r at a certain srt therefore to reduce the amount of the p leaving the system by excess sludge discharge srt was increased with the increase of p recovery rate a target p recovery rate was assigned to the three parallel systems which were 45 50 and 60 and the srt was extended from 15 d of the aao process to 25 d 35 d and 50 d respectively table 1 in addition for the aao sbspr process operated at srt of 35 d the target p recovery rates of 60 and 65 were also carried out table 1 the target p recovery rate in each operation mode was attempted to achieve by taking a certain volume of the p enriched supernatant from the prr to the chemical precipitation reactor for p recovery the volume of the supernatant was calculated based on the influent p load which was kept unchanged during the whole experiments the target p recovery rate and the po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant as the fluctuation of the po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant of prr was inevitable during the operation the volume of the supernatant taken from the prr to the chemical precipitation reactor was not constant and had to be determined in every run of the prr moreover eq 1 was also validated by monitoring the related parameters of the aao and aao sbspr systems after steady state was reached the phosphate in the supernatant was precipitated with ca oh 2 after the ph value was adjusted to 10 the p removal efficiency in the chemical precipitation reactor was above 99 which means almost all the p in the supernatant could be recovered the variation of ph in the anaerobic tank of the aao reactor before and after the p recovery was presented in fig s6 the elevation of ph in the anaerobic tank in the three systems was limited and thus its impact on the operation of the process was negligible 2 3 batch test batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the ebpr activities of the aao process and the aao sbspr process 800 ml mixed liquor samples were taken from the aerobic tank of the aao reactor in the aao process and aao sbspr processes at srt of 35 d and 50 d with target p recovery rate of 60 after the processes reached the steady state then the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded the remaining sludge was washed by the mineral medium described in section 2 1 three times and finally diluted to a volume of 800 ml before the beginning of the anaerobic phase the sludge was sparged with nitrogen for at least 15 min to attain anaerobic conditions sodium acetate was used as carbon source in the anaerobic phase and the initial cod was between 300 and 400 mg l after the anaerobic phase the sludge was divided into two equal parts one was exposed to aerobic condition with oxygen level closed to saturation and the other was exposed to anoxic condition where 25 mgn l kno3 was added and nitrogen was sparged to create the anoxic condition samples were periodically taken for analysis of acetate phosphate and nitrate concentration in the supernatant samples were also taken at the beginning and end of each phase for the determination of the mlss and mlvss the ph value and temperature during the batch experiments were kept at 7 0 0 2 and 20 c respectively 2 4 parameter monitoring and chemical analysis the performance of all the reactors was monitored regularly by measuring cod tn nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the influent and effluent as well as mlss and mlvss in the aerobic tank of the aao reactor daily po4 3 p concentration in the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks of the aao reactor were also measured these parameters combined with the po4 3 p concentration in influent effluent and prr were used for the calculation of po4 3 p mass balance in each tank of the aao reactor to produce anaerobic p release rate anoxic and aerobic p uptake rates of the whole process method of the mass balance calculation for each tank of aao reactor could be found in punrattanasin 1997 in addition total phosphorus in the influent effluent supernatant of prr only for aao sbspr process and excess sludge was measured for the validation of p mass balance of the whole processes cod tn ammonium nitrate phosphate mlss mlvss ph and do were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 hac was measured using a gas chromatography 6890 n agilent usa equipped with a flame ionization detector and a db wax125 column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 mm and the analytical procedure was the same as in our previous study li et al 2015 2 5 microbial community analysis the activated sludge samples were taken from the aao process and aao sbspr processes at srt of 35 d and 50 d with target p recovery rate of 60 after the systems reached the steady state then high throughput illumina miseq sequencing analysis for these sludge samples was conducted at genewiz inc beijing china a soil dna kit cwbio china was used for dna extraction dna samples were quantified using a qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen usa and dna quality was checked on a 0 8 agarose gel a sequencing library was constructed using a metavx library preparation kit genewiz usa briefly 5 50 ng dna was used to generate amplicons that covered the variable v3 and v4 regions of bacteria and archaea 16s rdna indexed adapters were then added to the ends of the 16s rdna amplicons by limited cycle polymerase chain reaction pcr dna libraries were validated using a bioanalyzer 2100 agilent usa and quantified by qubit and real time pcr 7500 applied biosystems usa dna libraries were multiplexed and loaded onto an illumina miseq instrument illumina usa sequencing was performed using a 2 250 paired end configuration image analysis and base calling were conducted using the miseq control software on the miseq instrument reads were analyzed using the trimmomatic and mothur software to remove low quality sequences and denoise the sequencing reads which included sequences less than 400 bp or more than 480 bp in length with an average quality score of less than 25 containing ambiguous characters and or without the correct primer sequence a workflow script in qiime 1 5 was used to identify operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 sequence identity level representative sequences from each otu were identified in qiime using the ribosomal database project classification method with the assignment of taxonomic identities using the greengenes 16s rdna gene database 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationships among p recovery rate srt and p content in activated sludge as p recovery rate was targeted under different srts based on p mass balance eq 1 the experimental results show that the target p recovery rate in each operation modes was steadily achieved fig 2 fig 3 presents the profiles of several contaminants in one operation cycle of the sidestream prr srt 35 d target p recovery rate 50 under the anaerobic condition in prr the p in the activated sludge was gradually released into the supernatant and cod was taken up and stored intracellularly the slight decrease of the tn concentration was caused by the denitrification as some of the no3 n was introduced to the prr along with the sludge there was no significant change of nh4 n indicating the sludge cells were not solubilized and the release of p was due to the polyphosphate decomposition in paos based on the p mass balance survey table s1 the mass percentages of p in the effluent excess sludge and recovery of the influent p under the steady state in each operation mode as well as the p content in activated sludge of the aao reactor are shown in fig 4 the p content in activated sludge decreased from the average 0 062 mgp mgvss in the aao process to 0 043 mgp mgvss in the aao sbspr process at the target p recovery rate of 65 which was still much higher than that in the conventional activated sludge processes 0 02 mgp mgvss metcalf and eddy et al 2003 this indicates that the poly p content in the biomass was not depleted although a high p recovery rate was imposed moreover when target p recovery rate increased from 50 to 60 at srt of 35 d p content declined from 0 052 mgp mgvss to 0 048 mgp mgvss fig 4 however only a slight decline of the p content in activated sludge was observed from 0 048 mgp mgvss to 0 047 mgp mgvss when the srt increased from 35 d to 50 d at the target p recovery rate of 60 which suggests that p content in sludge was more easily affected by p recovery rate than by srt according to the study of acevedo et al 2015 at short srt high p recovery rate even could result in the complete depletion of the poly p of the activated sludge moreover xia et al 2014 and lv et al 2014 observed that short srt and high p recovery rate led to the excessive deprivation of poly p content and lost of the characteristics of the ebpr systems after long term operation our present study shows that poly p content in sludge was less affected by the long srt considering that poly p content is very important to the ebpr system it is obvious that increasing srt is more favorable at high p recovery rate to maintain enough poly p content for the stable operation of the p recovery process to further describe the quantitative relationships among p recovery rate srt and p content in activated sludge eq 1 was proposed and tested for validity by using the experimental data acquired in each operation mode under steady state a good fitness of the actual p recovery rates and calculated ones was achieved fig s1a meanwhile fig 5 presents the calculated p recovery rate at different srt and p content in activated sludge based on eq 1 from the perspective of p recovery it can be seen that high p recovery rate is more easily achieved at long srt without undermining the p content in activated sludge for instance at srt of 35 d and calculated p recovery rate of 60 the p content in activated sludge is 0 046 mgp mgvss the solid circle in fig 5 if the srt is kept constant and the calculated p recovery rate further increases to 65 the p content in activated sludge will decrease to 0 039 mgp mgvss solid square in fig 5 however if the srt is increased to 50 d 65 of the calculated p recovery rate can be achieved without p content reduction 0 052 mgp mgvss solid triangle in fig 5 3 2 nutrient removal performance of the aao sbspr process 3 2 1 p removal performance the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p tn nh4 n as well as cod in each operation mode after the long term steady operation are presented in fig 6 both the increase of p recovery rate and srt had little effect on the performance of p removal even though srt was maintained at 50 d the removal efficiency of po4 3 p still reached 98 5 usually for the mainstream ebpr process low srt is favored as the biomass yield of paos is high and more p could be stored as poly p in paos and removed from the system along with the excess sludge the srt of the ebpr process usually varied between 3 and 7 d and could be further extended to 20 25 d if n removal is considered henze et al 2008 increasing srt of the mainstream system means the potential of p removal by sludge wasting is reduced as the biomass production decreases however for the p recovery process proposed in this study the p removal was achieved by both the discharge of surplus biomass and chemical precipitation p was temporarily stored in the biomass as poly p in the mainstream line and then released in prr and removed recovery by chemical precipitation in the sidestream line which resulted in low p load in the mainstream line therefore less paos were required compared with the conventional ebpr process according to smolders et al 1996 the concentration of paos required in the sidestream recovery system was only ten percent of the conventional ebpr system which means that the sidestream p recovery system could be operated under low p content in order to further understand the p removal performance of the aao sbspr processes batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the activity of the paos the stoichiometric parameters acquired by the batch experiments in different operation modes are presented in table 2 evolutions of the hac po4 3 p and no3 n during the batch experiments are shown in fig s2 anaerobic p release rate is an effective indicator of ebpr system according to lv et al 2014 with the increase of p recovery rate anaerobic p release rate along with p content in activated sludge will decrease significantly which deteriorated the p removal in the recovery system however the results of our batch experiments show that the anaerobic p release rates in both the aao and aao sbspr processes were similar to those 20 50 mgp mgvss h observed in conventional ebpr processes kuba et al 1993 only a slight decrease of the anaerobic p release rate was observed from 32 9 mgp gvss h in the aao process to 31 2 mgp gvss h and 29 6 mgp gvss h in the aao sbspr process at srt of 35 d and 50 d respectively this indicates that the activity of paos in the aao sbspr systems was not significantly affected by p recovery in addition gaos could compete with paos for uptake of the carbon source which may lead to the proliferation of the gaos and failure of the ebpr system therefore the ratio of po4 3 p release to vfa uptake p c is used to indicate the activities of paos and gaos in mixed pao gao cultures at a given ph filipe et al 2001 oehmen et al 2006 data in table 2 show that the p c ratio decreased with the increase of the target p recovery rate which is similar to the observations by lv et al 2014 and acevedo et al 2015 this was mainly caused by the decline of p content in activated sludge induced by high p recovery besides the p c ratio still reached 0 35 mmolp mmolc at srt of 50 d with target p recovery rate of 60 which is higher than the gaos oriented system where p c ratio ranged from 0 to 0 02 mmolp mmolc zeng et al 2003 for the conventional ebpr system the p c ratio usually ranges from 0 16 to 0 84 mmolp mmolc and p c ratio below 0 5 mmolp mmolc may indicate a mixed culture of gaos and paos pereira et al 1996 hu et al 2003 however in this study the decrease of the p c ratio may not be caused by the presence of the gaos the following high throughput sequencing analysis indicated that a shift from polyphosphate accumulating metabolism pam to glycogen accumulating metabolism gam occurred this is in accordance with the observations reported by acevedo et al 2012 and welles et al 2015 that paos were able to behave like gaos when poly p depletion occurred or decreased due to p recovery acevedo et al 2015 to further understand the influence of p recovery rate and srt on paos in the aao sbspr process high throughput sequencing analysis of 16s rrna was conducted to investigate the evolution of the microbial community in different operation mode table 3 presents the relative abundance of some important functional microbes at genus level in the aao process and the aao sbspr process distribution of the sequences at phylum and class levels are presented in fig s3 two types of bacteria candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis accumulibacter and acinetobacter which are believed to be paos and prevailed in many full scale ebpr systems were detected the relative abundance of accumulibacter increased even though p recovery was imposed on the systems according to lv et al 2014 high p recovery rate led to depletion of the poly p content in biomass which resulted in suppression of the uptake of the acetate under anaerobic phase thus after long term operation of the p recovery process the fraction of paos decreased significantly and finally was outcompeted by the gaos which caused the failure of the ebpr system however in this study the known members of gaos candidatus competibacter and defluviicoccus were not detected which proved that the decrease of the p c ratio was mainly caused by the shift from pam to gam of paos but not the proliferation of the gaos moreover it seems that the relative abundance of paos was not affected by the increase of srt this result is different from the observation of rodrigo et al 1999 and whang and park 2006 that short srt was beneficial to the growth of the paos while long srt favored the growth of gaos according to the studies of whang and park 2006 and onnis hayden et al 2013 increasing srt will result in the decrease of the anaerobic p release rate of paos which makes it less competitive with gaos in acetate uptake under anaerobic condition and finally leads to the wash out of paos from the system in the present study the anaerobic p release rate acetate uptake rate and p c ratio of paos indeed decreased as p recovery rate and srt increased table 2 however the relative abundance of accumulibacter was not influenced this is probably due to the fact that paos had a relatively low endogenous decay rate and were more predominant at longer srt as suggested by lee et al 2007 it should be pointed out that the adaption of paos to long srt does not necessarily lead to the good performance of the p removal if the p is removed by only discharging the excess sludge like in the conventional ebpr systems as the biomass production is reduced at long srt the p removal performance will definitely become worse even though the abundance of the paos may not be affected the results of the batch experiments and microbial community analysis suggest that p recovery had limited influence on the paos under the operational strategy proposed in this study and stable p removal efficiency under long srt and high p recovery rate was secured 3 2 2 nitrogen removal performance the removal efficiencies of tn were promoted with the increase in p recovery rate and srt fig 6 the average tn removal efficiency was 71 9 in the aao process for aao sbspr process the tn removal efficiency increased from 74 7 to 76 8 while the target p recovery rate increased from 50 to 65 at srt of 35 d when the target p recovery rate was kept at 60 and srt increased from 35 d to 50 d tn removal efficiency notably increased from 75 7 to 80 4 the improvement of the tn removal was probably due to the enhancement of the simultaneous p and n removal accomplished by the denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dnpaos this could be proved by the fact that the ratio of anoxic p uptake to the total p uptake of the whole process increased from 41 7 in the aao process to 77 5 in the aao sbspr process at target p recovery rate of 65 fig 7 despite the decrease of overall p uptake in the whole process caused by the decline of p content in activated sludge hu et al 2001 reported that in ebpr system with n removal the anoxic p uptake was affected by the amount of biomass recycled to the anoxic tank in this study biomass pumped to the prr was raised with the increase of target p recovery rate to make sure that there was enough p released to the supernatant of prr where carbon substrate was taken up and stored in the sludge cell as pha polyhydroxyalkanoates then the pha rich sludge was recycled back to the anoxic tank in the mainstream aao reactor therefore the promotion of anoxic p uptake in the aao sbspr process was probably caused by the increase in biomass returned from prr to the anoxic tank of the aao reactor this is supported by the good correlation between the ratio of anoxic p uptake to the total p uptake of the whole process and the biomass pumped to the prr in the aao sbspr process fig s4 meanwhile long srt also facilitates the anoxic p uptake tsuneda et al 2006 this is because long srt favors the growth of dnpaos owing to its low biomass yield coefficient kuba et al 1996a in addition the results of the batch experiments shown in table 2 indicate that both the anoxic p uptake rate pur and denitrification rate during the anoxic phase were increased in the aao sbspr mode and the values of these kinetic rates are similar with those in other studies where dnpaos were enriched kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 tsuneda et al 2006 the increase of the ratio of anoxic pur to aerobic pur in batch experiments also indicates the increased fraction of dnpaos in total paos table 2 moreover as part of the dnpaos could not directly utilize nitrate as the electron acceptor some nitrate reducing bacteria strains belong to genera dechloromonas were often found in the dnpaos predominant systems to provide nitrite for the dnpaos zeng et al 2003 kim et al 2013 and the relative abundance of dechloromonas increased along with the increase of the dnpaos kim et al 2013 the same phenomenon was also observed in this study as shown in table 3 it should also be noted that the promotion of the anoxic p uptake could reduce the need for a carbon source for denitrification which intrinsically led to the improvement of both p and n removal in this study it is well known that there is a competition for the carbon source between n and p removal in ebpr system and up to 50 reduction of the cod could be achieved by simultaneously n and p removal using dnpaos kuba et al 1996b consequently the carbon source saved by the anoxic p uptake at long srt and high p recovery rate was utilized by the conventional denitrifying bacteria which benefited n removal meanwhile with the increase of p recovery rate more p was removed by the chemical precipitation recovery and less p was involved in the metabolic cycle in paos this could be proved by the fact that both the total amount of p release and p uptake in the aao sbspr process were significantly decreased at higher p recovery rate and longer srt fig 7 thus the total cod involved in the metabolic cycle of paos declined smolders et al 1996 also demonstrated that 2 mghac cod mgp is required theoretically for p removal in a sidestream p recovery system which is much less than 20 mghac cod mgp in conventional ebpr systems in this case more carbon source was saved in the aao sbspr process at high p recovery rate and can be used for denitrification it is well known that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were involved in the complete nitrification process as both of them have longer doubling times and slower growth rates compared to heterotrophic bacteria long srt is favorable for the nitrification process metcalf and eddy et al 2003 peng and zhu 2006 in this study as srt was extended to coordinate with high p recovery rate the remarkable enhancement of the nitrification process was observed at high p recovery rate both the ammonia oxidation rate aor and nitrite oxidation rate nor in the aao sbspr process were increased compared with the aao process particularly the nor under long srt table s2 which was confirmed by the increase of the relative abundance of nitrospira like nob as shown in table 3 meanwhile the relative abundance of nitrosomonas like aob was quite stable table 3 the nob has smaller endogenous decay coefficient compared with aob which may lead to the increase of nob aob ratio under long srt as suggested by dold et al 2005 and liu and wang 2014 moreover the adverse effect of the p recovery on the nitrification process reported by barat et al 2006 was not observed in this study these results indicate that the operational strategy proposed in this study is also beneficial for the nitrification process 3 3 other benefits of the aao sbspr process and further improvement strategies it is well known that increasing srt or decreasing sludge loading rate can reduce sludge production in wastewater treatment processes wei et al 2003 therefore another benefit of the operational strategy proposed in this study for the p recovery process is the reduction of the waste sludge as a result of long srt the concentration of the mixed liquor increased while the yobs decreased with the increase of srt in the aao sbspr process table 4 the yobs of the aao process was 0 29 kgvss kgcod which is close to the yobs of the conventional activated sludge process ranged from 0 4 to 0 7 kgvss kgcod metcalf and eddy et al 2003 however this parameter decreased to 0 12 kgvss kgcod when srt of the aao sbspr process increased to 50 d which resulted in 58 sludge reduction with respect to yobs under long srt more energy was used for endogenous respiration but not for the growth of the biomass production of excess sludge is one of the most serious challenges in the biological wastewater treatment process and treatment and disposal of sewage sludge could account for even up to 60 of the total cost of a wwtp saby et al 2003 an ideal way to solve this problem is to reduce sludge production during the wastewater treatment rather than the post treatment of the waste sludge the p mass balance equation eq 1 proposed and validated in this study also facilitates the selection of the operational parameters of the p recovery process the p recovery rate could be calculated in advance by specifying the parameters in eq 1 for example according to eq 1 for the operation mode with srt of 50 d if the p content in activated sludge further decreased to 0 035 mgp mgvss still above the 0 02 mgp mgvss the p recovery rate could increase to approximately 70 which is the theoretical maximum p recovery rate of the sidestream p recovery process levlin and hultman 2003 in contrast the potential p recovery rate is quite limited at short srt for aao sbspr process with srt between 10 and 20 d the calculated p recovery rates will fall within 30 55 as shown in fig 5 higher p recovery rates can only be achieved by extending the srt of the process moreover it can be seen from eq 1 that the influent p concentration also has an effect on the p recovery rate higher p recovery rate could be achieved if the influent p concentration is high even at short srt fig s5 however low influent p concentration will reduce p recovery potential understanding the influence of the influent p concentration is crucial to the application of this p recovery process in the full scale municipal wwtp as low influent p concentration as well as large variation of the influent p concentration often occur due to seasonal change of the wastewater and storm weather therefore p recovery rate and srt should be carefully selected based on the actual influent water quality to maintain an appropriate p content level in activated sludge and a stable operation of the process the p content in the precipitates after adding ca oh 2 was measured the phosphorus content of the recovered product was 13 8 0 5 wt or 31 6 1 6 wt as p2o5 table s3 operation mode srt 35 d target p recovery rate 50 which is close to the p content in hydroxyapatite hap 18 9 g p g hap as the phosphate rock is defined as high grade phosphate rock when p2o5 content is higher than 30 abouzeid 2008 the product obtained in this study can be a valuable p product the phosphate concentration in the supernatant of prr is also critical to p recovery as it may affect the quality of the recovered product besides as reported by yuan et al 2012 the techniques of p recovery through chemical precipitation are only economically feasible with p concentration above 50 mg l as shown in fig 7 the amount of p released in the anaerobic tank of the aao reactor decreased as p recovery rate and srt increased which will inevitably lead to the decrease of p content in sludge and further cause a low po4 3 p concentration in sidestream supernatant therefore optimization of the sidestream prr is essential to p recovery as proposed by kodera et al 2013 and wong et al 2013 p concentrated solutions could be achieved by repeatedly using the same organic substrate stream until the p concentration in supernatant reached a plateau meanwhile the high phosphate concentration could also be achieved by increasing the biomass density in the prr and reducing the volume of the organic substrate stream from influent used for anaerobic p release external carbon source such as acetate may be used to enhance p release in prr and reduce the volume of the supernatant and thus result in a high po4 3 p concentration 4 conclusions 1 a novel aao sbspr process was proposed to recover p from municipal wastewater and up to 65 of the influent p can be recovered an operational strategy based on the p mass balance for the process was proposed and validated the strategy linked the p recovery rate with srt which could effectively reduce the impact of p recovery on p content in activated sludge and achieve a stable operation of the process under high p recovery rate 2 high p recovery rate and long srt had limited influence on the kinetic rates and population of paos in the aao sbspr process and good p removal performance was achieved 3 anoxic p uptake was promoted under high p recovery rate and long srt and more carbon substrate was saved in this condition which improved the performance of n removal of the p recovery process meanwhile acceleration of the nitrification process was also observed under long srt and high p recovery rate 4 excess sludge production was minimized under long srt and high p recovery rate the p mass balance equation proposed in this study can facilitate the selection of the operational parameters for the p recovery process 5 further improvement in enhancing p recovery rate of the process is proposed acknowledgments this work was supported by the national hi tech research

19404,a novel aao sbspr anaerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch sidestream phosphorus recovery process was developed for phosphorus p recovery and nutrient removal from municipal wastewater meanwhile an operational strategy based on the p mass balance for the process was proposed where p recovery rate was coupled with sludge retention time srt so as to reduce the impact of p recovery on p content in activated sludge and maintain a stable operation of the process the results show that the proposed operational strategy is helpful for the stable operation of the aao sbspr process and up to 65 of the influent p was recovered with the phosphate removal efficiency of 99 1 both p recovery and extended srt had limited influence on the p release and uptake rates of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos the results of high throughput sequencing analysis indicated that the relative abundance of accumulibacter increased while srt was extended under high p recovery rate moreover significant promotion of simultaneous nitrogen removal and p uptake was observed where the ratio of anoxic p uptake to the total p uptake of the whole process increased from 41 7 in the aao process to 77 5 in the aao sbspr process combined with the increase of total nitrogen tn removal efficiency from 71 9 to 80 4 the p recovery process is also beneficial for the reduction of sludge production and nitrification process as srt was extended for high p recovery rate overall the aao sbspr process together with the operational strategy proposed in this study provides a promising and practical alternative for p recovery from municipal wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery aao sbspr process operational strategy p mass balance sludge retention time nutrient removal 1 introduction phosphorus p is a nonmetal of the nitrogen group which is essential to all life on the earth it is widely used as a raw material in many areas including household applications and agricultural applications accounting for 95 of the global phosphate production such as fertilizer industry to increase the crop yield phosphorus based pesticide and animal feed supplements cisse and mrabet 2004 desmidt et al 2015 however it was reported that the economically available phosphate mineral reserves can only be maintained for 30 years after which the global demand for phosphate will exceed supply and lead to global p scarcity cordell et al 2009 on the other hand the presence of p in natural water bodies has a great impact on aquatic ecosystems excessive p can lead to eutrophication of water bodies resulting in a sharp drop in biodiversity in the water and contamination of drinking water sources therefore to protect the water bodies from p induced pollution techniques such as chemical precipitation and enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr have been used in wastewater treatment plant wwtp to remove p meanwhile approximately 10 20 of the total global p demand could be satisfied if the p was recovered from municipal wastewater yuan et al 2012 basically there are two ways to recover p from the municipal wwtps with nutrient removal one way focuses on recovering p from the sludge line after the anaerobic digestion and the other way recovers p from the wastewater treatment line in general as approximately 90 95 of the influent p load is finally incorporated into the sludge the potential of p recovery from sludge or sewage sludge ash is higher than that from water line whose maximum p recovery potential ranged in 50 70 levlin and hultman 2003 cordell et al 2009 petzet and cornel 2011 however the methods for recovering p from sludge line have some disadvantages such as the uncontrolled precipitation of struvite inside the anaerobic digester besides the presence of calcium and or magnesium ions as well as the silicate hinder the transition of p from the solid phase to the liquid phase wild et al 1996 these problems result in a large variation of p recovery rate 0 75 from the sludge line strickland 1999 petzet and cornel 2011 whereas the p recovery rate from the wastewater treatment line is stable which is around 60 70 according to levlin and hultman 2003 furthermore the cost of recovering p from water line is almost half of that from the sludge line strickland 1999 balmer 2004 cordell et al 2009 therefore recovering p from water line is considered to be a more economical strategy and it could be easily implemented in the municipal wwtp if well designed one option to recover p from the water line is to generate p rich supernatant using sidestream treatment the sidestream treatment often affiliates to ebpr process in municipal wwtps the main mechanism of ebpr process is to enrich p into the biomass as polyphosphate poly p by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos where the p content in activated sludge could reach up to 5 7 in a full scale wwtp metcalf eddy tchobanoglous burton stensel 2003 the p concentrated solution can be acquired by sidestream treatment where an anaerobic condition is usually provided to release p from biomass to the liquid phase in recent years many of such recovery processes have been reported levlin hultman 2003 cordell et al 2009 desmidt et al 2015 these processes may include the conventional ebpr processes such as university of capetown uct and anaerobic anoxic oxic aao as the mainstream process to enrich p in biomass and the p rich supernatant is generated either by sidestream treatment or directly diverged from the anaerobic tank of the mainstream processes levlin and hultman 2003 however regardless of various configurations of the p recovery processes many researchers had found that there is a negative correlation between p recovery rate and the p content in activated sludge xia et al 2014 lv et al 2014 acevedo et al 2015 which is contrary to the stable operation of the mainstream ebpr systems excessive extraction of p may lead to the depletion of the poly p in biomass which is an important energy source for paos and an indicator of the performance of ebpr systems henze et al 2008 consequently deterioration of the ebpr systems may occur due to the proliferation of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos lv et al 2014 moreover as reported by barat and van loosdrecht 2006 excessive extraction of p may also be detrimental to the nitrification process in the mainstream system therefore a balance between p recovery rate and the stable operation of the mainstream ebpr process should be explored in this study a novel aao sbspr anaerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch sidestream phosphorus recovery process was proposed in which a conventional aao mainstream line was coupled with a sidestream p recovery line the sidestream p recovery process was operated in a batch mode the aao sbspr process was designed based on p mass balance strategy with consideration of p recovery rate srt and the p content in activated sludge at high p recovery rate in order to alleviate the conflict between the p extraction and p content in sludge the srt of the p recovery process was extended to reduce the loss of p from the system several operation modes were applied to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed operational strategy and the p mass balance equation was validated by the experimental data acquired from those operation modes the performance of the p recovery and nutrient removal for each operation mode as well as the microbial community were also investigated the aim of this research is to demonstrate the applicability of the novel aao sbspr process based on the proposed operational strategy at a laboratory scale and to provide a new perspective on the transition of municipal wwtp from traditional biological nutrient removal process into a nutrient recovery process 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater the composition of the synthetic municipal wastewater fed to the aao and aao sbspr processes were as follows 150 mg l sodium acetate 117 mgcod l 50 mg l glucose 53 mgcod l 150 mg l peptone approximately provide 170 mgcod l and 25 mgn l 90 mg l nh4cl 23 mgn l 31 mg l kh2po4 7 mgp l 123 mg l mgso4 7h2o 125 mg l cacl2 and 1 0 ml mineral medium solution the details of the medium can be found in smolders et al 1994 the synthetic wastewater was maintained between ph 7 8 by adding nahco3 influent cod tn tp and nh4 n concentrations are presented in table 1 2 2 operation of the aao and aao sbspr processes fig 1 shows the configuration of the aao sbspr process the process consisted of two parts the mainstream aao reactor for nutrient removal and sidestream sequencing batch reactors sbr for p recovery during the operation of the process part of the sludge in the secondary clarifier was pumped into the sidestream p release reactor prr and in the meantime part of the influent was also diverged into the prr to provide the carbon source for p release under anaerobic conditions after p was released to the liquid phase the sludge was allowed to settle to obtain the p enriched supernatant which was then pumped to the chemical precipitation reactor where p was recovered by adding ca oh 2 the settled sludge was recycled back to the anoxic tank of the aao reactor the supernatant of the chemical precipitation reactor after p recovery was pumped back to the influent of the aao reactor to further remove the residual cod nitrogen n and other contaminants three lab scale parallel aao sbspr systems were set up in this study the working volume of the aao reactor was 10 l the volume ratio of the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks was 1 1 3 the volume of the secondary clarifier was 4 l the total volume of prr was 5 l prr was operated in sequencing batch mode with a 24 h cycle per day sludge filling period 2 5 h wastewater filling period 0 5 h providing cod for p release anaerobic reaction period with stirring 3 h settling period 3 h supernatant decanting period 0 5 h sludge recycling period 2 5 h idle period 12 h the total influent flowrate to either the aao or the aao sbspr process was kept at 20 l d with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h for the aao reactor the internal recycle rate and sludge recycle rate of the aao system were 300 and 80 of the influent flowrate respectively the do concentration in the aerobic tank of the aao reactor ranged from 1 5 to 2 5 mg l the three parallel systems were first operated in conventional aao configuration without sidestream p recovery module the seed activated sludge was obtained from a full scale municipal wwtp in shanghai when the stable performance of n and p removal was achieved the p recovery sidestream module was integrated into the aao mainstream line and the system was operated as the aao sbspr configuration mode the excess sludge was discharged from the systems by discarding a certain amount of mixed liquor from the aerobic tank either in the aao process or in the aao sbspr process for the aao sbspr process the excess sludge was wasted after the sludge in prr was recycled to the aao reactor the influent cod p and n loads of the aao sbspr process remained unchanged compared to the aao process both the aao and aao sbspr processes were operated in a temperature controlled room at 20 c to reduce the negative impact of the sidestream p recovery on the intracellular poly p content of paos the aao sbspr process was operated according to a strategy where the p recovery rate was correlated with srt of the aao sbspr process based on the p mass balance of the process the relationship between p recovery rate and srt as well as the p content in activated sludge of the aao sbspr process can be described by eq 1 the deduction of eq 1 can be found in supplementary data 1 r 100 1 c p eff c p 0 p s y δ s c p 0 1 k d srt where r is p recovery rate cp 0 and cp eff are influent and effluent total p concentration respectively mg l ps is the p content in activated sludge mgp mgvss y is the yield coefficient of activated sludge 1 d s is cod removed by the aao or aao sbspr process mg l kd is endogenous decay coefficient of the activated sludge 1 d it can be seen from eq 1 that the p content in activated sludge will decrease while increasing the p recovery rate r at a certain srt therefore to reduce the amount of the p leaving the system by excess sludge discharge srt was increased with the increase of p recovery rate a target p recovery rate was assigned to the three parallel systems which were 45 50 and 60 and the srt was extended from 15 d of the aao process to 25 d 35 d and 50 d respectively table 1 in addition for the aao sbspr process operated at srt of 35 d the target p recovery rates of 60 and 65 were also carried out table 1 the target p recovery rate in each operation mode was attempted to achieve by taking a certain volume of the p enriched supernatant from the prr to the chemical precipitation reactor for p recovery the volume of the supernatant was calculated based on the influent p load which was kept unchanged during the whole experiments the target p recovery rate and the po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant as the fluctuation of the po4 3 p concentration in the supernatant of prr was inevitable during the operation the volume of the supernatant taken from the prr to the chemical precipitation reactor was not constant and had to be determined in every run of the prr moreover eq 1 was also validated by monitoring the related parameters of the aao and aao sbspr systems after steady state was reached the phosphate in the supernatant was precipitated with ca oh 2 after the ph value was adjusted to 10 the p removal efficiency in the chemical precipitation reactor was above 99 which means almost all the p in the supernatant could be recovered the variation of ph in the anaerobic tank of the aao reactor before and after the p recovery was presented in fig s6 the elevation of ph in the anaerobic tank in the three systems was limited and thus its impact on the operation of the process was negligible 2 3 batch test batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the ebpr activities of the aao process and the aao sbspr process 800 ml mixed liquor samples were taken from the aerobic tank of the aao reactor in the aao process and aao sbspr processes at srt of 35 d and 50 d with target p recovery rate of 60 after the processes reached the steady state then the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded the remaining sludge was washed by the mineral medium described in section 2 1 three times and finally diluted to a volume of 800 ml before the beginning of the anaerobic phase the sludge was sparged with nitrogen for at least 15 min to attain anaerobic conditions sodium acetate was used as carbon source in the anaerobic phase and the initial cod was between 300 and 400 mg l after the anaerobic phase the sludge was divided into two equal parts one was exposed to aerobic condition with oxygen level closed to saturation and the other was exposed to anoxic condition where 25 mgn l kno3 was added and nitrogen was sparged to create the anoxic condition samples were periodically taken for analysis of acetate phosphate and nitrate concentration in the supernatant samples were also taken at the beginning and end of each phase for the determination of the mlss and mlvss the ph value and temperature during the batch experiments were kept at 7 0 0 2 and 20 c respectively 2 4 parameter monitoring and chemical analysis the performance of all the reactors was monitored regularly by measuring cod tn nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations in the influent and effluent as well as mlss and mlvss in the aerobic tank of the aao reactor daily po4 3 p concentration in the anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks of the aao reactor were also measured these parameters combined with the po4 3 p concentration in influent effluent and prr were used for the calculation of po4 3 p mass balance in each tank of the aao reactor to produce anaerobic p release rate anoxic and aerobic p uptake rates of the whole process method of the mass balance calculation for each tank of aao reactor could be found in punrattanasin 1997 in addition total phosphorus in the influent effluent supernatant of prr only for aao sbspr process and excess sludge was measured for the validation of p mass balance of the whole processes cod tn ammonium nitrate phosphate mlss mlvss ph and do were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 hac was measured using a gas chromatography 6890 n agilent usa equipped with a flame ionization detector and a db wax125 column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 mm and the analytical procedure was the same as in our previous study li et al 2015 2 5 microbial community analysis the activated sludge samples were taken from the aao process and aao sbspr processes at srt of 35 d and 50 d with target p recovery rate of 60 after the systems reached the steady state then high throughput illumina miseq

identities using the greengenes 16s rdna gene database 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationships among p recovery rate srt and p content in activated sludge as p recovery rate was targeted under different srts based on p mass balance eq 1 the experimental results show that the target p recovery rate in each operation modes was steadily achieved fig 2 fig 3 presents the profiles of several contaminants in one operation cycle of the sidestream prr srt 35 d target p recovery rate 50 under the anaerobic condition in prr the p in the activated sludge was gradually released into the supernatant and cod was taken up and stored intracellularly the slight decrease of the tn concentration was caused by the denitrification as some of the no3 n was introduced to the prr along with the sludge there was no significant change of nh4 n indicating the sludge cells were not solubilized and the release of p was due to the polyphosphate decomposition in paos based on the p mass balance survey table s1 the mass percentages of p in the effluent excess sludge and recovery of the influent p under the steady state in each operation mode as well as the p content in activated sludge of the aao reactor are shown in fig 4 the p content in activated sludge decreased from the average 0 062 mgp mgvss in the aao process to 0 043 mgp mgvss in the aao sbspr process at the target p recovery rate of 65 which was still much higher than that in the conventional activated sludge processes 0 02 mgp mgvss metcalf and eddy et al 2003 this indicates that the poly p content in the biomass was not depleted although a high p recovery rate was imposed moreover when target p recovery rate increased from 50 to 60 at srt of 35 d p content declined from 0 052 mgp mgvss to 0 048 mgp mgvss fig 4 however only a slight decline of the p content in activated sludge was observed from 0 048 mgp mgvss to 0 047 mgp mgvss when the srt increased from 35 d to 50 d at the target p recovery rate of 60 which suggests that p content in sludge was more easily affected by p recovery rate than by srt according to the study of acevedo et al 2015 at short srt high p recovery rate even could result in the complete depletion of the poly p of the activated sludge moreover xia et al 2014 and lv et al 2014 observed that short srt and high p recovery rate led to the excessive deprivation of poly p content and lost of the characteristics of the ebpr systems after long term operation our present study shows that poly p content in sludge was less affected by the long srt considering that poly p content is very important to the ebpr system it is obvious that increasing srt is more favorable at high p recovery rate to maintain enough poly p content for the stable operation of the p recovery process to further describe the quantitative relationships among p recovery rate srt and p content in activated sludge eq 1 was proposed and tested for validity by using the experimental data acquired in each operation mode under steady state a good fitness of the actual p recovery rates and calculated ones was achieved fig s1a meanwhile fig 5 presents the calculated p recovery rate at different srt and p content in activated sludge based on eq 1 from the perspective of p recovery it can be seen that high p recovery rate is more easily achieved at long srt without undermining the p content in activated sludge for instance at srt of 35 d and calculated p recovery rate of 60 the p content in activated sludge is 0 046 mgp mgvss the solid circle in fig 5 if the srt is kept constant and the calculated p recovery rate further increases to 65 the p content in activated sludge will decrease to 0 039 mgp mgvss solid square in fig 5 however if the srt is increased to 50 d 65 of the calculated p recovery rate can be achieved without p content reduction 0 052 mgp mgvss solid triangle in fig 5 3 2 nutrient removal performance of the aao sbspr process 3 2 1 p removal performance the removal efficiencies of po4 3 p tn nh4 n as well as cod in each operation mode after the long term steady operation are presented in fig 6 both the increase of p recovery rate and srt had little effect on the performance of p removal even though srt was maintained at 50 d the removal efficiency of po4 3 p still reached 98 5 usually for the mainstream ebpr process low srt is favored as the biomass yield of paos is high and more p could be stored as poly p in paos and removed from the system along with the excess sludge the srt of the ebpr process usually varied between 3 and 7 d and could be further extended to 20 25 d if n removal is considered henze et al 2008 increasing srt of the mainstream system means the potential of p removal by sludge wasting is reduced as the biomass production decreases however for the p recovery process proposed in this study the p removal was achieved by both the discharge of surplus biomass and chemical precipitation p was temporarily stored in the biomass as poly p in the mainstream line and then released in prr and removed recovery by chemical precipitation in the sidestream line which resulted in low p load in the mainstream line therefore less paos were required compared with the conventional ebpr process according to smolders et al 1996 the concentration of paos required in the sidestream recovery system was only ten percent of the conventional ebpr system which means that the sidestream p recovery system could be operated under low p content in order to further understand the p removal performance of the aao sbspr processes batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the activity of the paos the stoichiometric parameters acquired by the batch experiments in different operation modes are presented in table 2 evolutions of the hac po4 3 p and no3 n during the batch experiments are shown in fig s2 anaerobic p release rate is an effective indicator of ebpr system according to lv et al 2014 with the increase of p recovery rate anaerobic p release rate along with p content in activated sludge will decrease significantly which deteriorated the p removal in the recovery system however the results of our batch experiments show that the anaerobic p release rates in both the aao and aao sbspr processes were similar to those 20 50 mgp mgvss h observed in conventional ebpr processes kuba et al 1993 only a slight decrease of the anaerobic p release rate was observed from 32 9 mgp gvss h in the aao process to 31 2 mgp gvss h and 29 6 mgp gvss h in the aao sbspr process at srt of 35 d and 50 d respectively this indicates that the activity of paos in the aao sbspr systems was not significantly affected by p recovery in addition gaos could compete with paos for uptake of the carbon source which may lead to the proliferation of the gaos and failure of the ebpr system therefore the ratio of po4 3 p release to vfa uptake p c is used to indicate the activities of paos and gaos in mixed pao gao cultures at a given ph filipe et al 2001 oehmen et al 2006 data in table 2 show that the p c ratio decreased with the increase of the target p recovery rate which is similar to the observations by lv et al 2014 and acevedo et al 2015 this was mainly caused by the decline of p content in activated sludge induced by high p recovery besides the p c ratio still reached 0 35 mmolp mmolc at srt of 50 d with target p recovery rate of 60 which is higher than the gaos oriented system where p c ratio ranged from 0 to 0 02 mmolp mmolc zeng et al 2003 for the conventional ebpr system the p c ratio usually ranges from 0 16 to 0 84 mmolp mmolc and p c ratio below 0 5 mmolp mmolc may indicate a mixed culture of gaos and paos pereira et al 1996 hu et al 2003 however in this study the decrease of the p c ratio may not be caused by the presence of the gaos the following high throughput sequencing analysis indicated that a shift from polyphosphate accumulating metabolism pam to glycogen accumulating metabolism gam occurred this is in accordance with the observations reported by acevedo et al 2012 and welles et al 2015 that paos were able to behave like gaos when poly p depletion occurred or decreased due to p recovery acevedo et al 2015 to further understand the influence of p recovery rate and srt on paos in the aao sbspr process high throughput sequencing analysis of 16s rrna was conducted to investigate the evolution of the microbial community in different operation mode table 3 presents the relative abundance of some important functional microbes at genus level in the aao process and the aao sbspr process distribution of the sequences at phylum and class levels are presented in fig s3 two types of bacteria candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis accumulibacter and acinetobacter which are believed to be paos and prevailed in many full scale ebpr systems were detected the relative abundance of accumulibacter increased even though p recovery was imposed on the systems according to lv et al 2014 high p recovery rate led to depletion of the poly p content in biomass which resulted in suppression of the uptake of the acetate under anaerobic phase thus after long term operation of the p recovery process the fraction of paos decreased significantly and finally was outcompeted by the gaos which caused the failure of the ebpr system however in this study the known members of gaos candidatus competibacter and defluviicoccus were not detected which proved that the decrease of the p c ratio was mainly caused by the shift from pam to gam of paos but not the proliferation of the gaos moreover it seems that the relative abundance of paos was not affected by the increase of srt this result is different from the observation of rodrigo et al 1999 and whang and park 2006 that short srt was beneficial to the growth of the paos while long srt favored the growth of gaos according to the studies of whang and park 2006 and onnis hayden et al 2013 increasing srt will result in the decrease of the anaerobic p release rate of paos which makes it less competitive with gaos in acetate uptake under anaerobic condition and finally leads to the wash out of paos from the system in the present study the anaerobic p release rate acetate uptake rate and p c ratio of paos indeed decreased as p recovery rate and srt increased table 2 however the relative abundance of accumulibacter was not influenced this is probably due to the fact that paos had a relatively low endogenous decay rate and were more predominant at longer srt as suggested by lee et al 2007 it should be pointed out that the adaption of paos to long srt does not necessarily lead to the good performance of the p removal if the p is removed by only discharging the excess sludge like in the conventional ebpr systems as the biomass production is reduced at long srt the p removal performance will definitely become worse even though the abundance of the paos may not be affected the results of the batch experiments and microbial community analysis suggest that p recovery had limited influence on the paos under the operational strategy proposed in this study and stable p removal efficiency under long srt and high p recovery rate was secured 3 2 2 nitrogen removal performance the removal efficiencies of tn were promoted with the increase in p recovery rate and srt fig 6 the average tn removal efficiency was 71 9 in the aao process for aao sbspr process the tn removal efficiency increased from 74 7 to 76 8 while the target p recovery rate increased from 50 to 65 at srt of 35 d when the target p recovery rate was kept at 60 and srt increased from 35 d to 50 d tn removal efficiency notably increased from 75 7 to 80 4 the improvement of the tn removal was probably due to the enhancement of the simultaneous p and n removal accomplished by the denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dnpaos this could be proved by the fact that the ratio of anoxic p uptake to the total p uptake of the whole process increased from 41 7 in the aao process to 77 5 in the aao sbspr process at target p recovery rate of 65 fig 7 despite the decrease of overall p uptake in the whole process caused by the decline of p content in activated sludge hu et al 2001 reported that in ebpr system with n removal the anoxic p uptake was affected by the amount of biomass recycled to the anoxic tank in this study biomass pumped to the prr was raised with the increase of target p recovery rate to make sure that there was enough p released to the supernatant of prr where carbon substrate was taken up and stored in the sludge cell as pha polyhydroxyalkanoates then the pha rich sludge was recycled back to the anoxic tank in the mainstream aao reactor therefore the promotion of anoxic p uptake in the aao sbspr process was probably caused by the increase in biomass returned from prr to the anoxic tank of the aao reactor this is supported by the good correlation between the ratio of anoxic p uptake to the total p uptake of the whole process and the biomass pumped to the prr in the aao sbspr process fig s4 meanwhile long srt also facilitates the anoxic p uptake tsuneda et al 2006 this is because long srt favors the growth of dnpaos owing to its low biomass yield coefficient kuba et al 1996a in addition the results of the batch experiments shown in table 2 indicate that both the anoxic p uptake rate pur and denitrification rate during the anoxic phase were increased in the aao sbspr mode and the values of these kinetic rates are similar with those in other studies where dnpaos were enriched kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 tsuneda et al 2006 the increase of the ratio of anoxic pur to aerobic pur in batch experiments also indicates the increased fraction of dnpaos in total paos table 2 moreover as part of the dnpaos could not directly utilize nitrate as the electron acceptor some nitrate reducing bacteria strains belong to genera dechloromonas were often found in the dnpaos predominant systems to provide nitrite for the dnpaos zeng et al 2003 kim et al 2013 and the relative abundance of dechloromonas increased along with the increase of the dnpaos kim et al 2013 the same phenomenon was also observed in this study as shown in table 3 it should also be noted that the promotion of the anoxic p uptake could reduce the need for a carbon source for denitrification which intrinsically led to the improvement of both p and n removal in this study it is well known that there is a competition for the carbon source between n and p removal in ebpr system and up to 50 reduction of the cod could be achieved by simultaneously n and p removal using dnpaos kuba et al 1996b consequently the carbon source saved by the anoxic p uptake at long srt and high p recovery rate was utilized by the conventional denitrifying bacteria which benefited n removal meanwhile with the increase of p recovery rate more p was removed by the chemical precipitation recovery and less p was involved in the metabolic cycle in paos this could be proved by the fact that both the total amount of p release and p uptake in the aao sbspr process were significantly decreased at higher p recovery rate and longer srt fig 7 thus the total cod involved in the metabolic cycle of paos declined smolders et al 1996 also demonstrated that 2 mghac cod mgp is required theoretically for p removal in a sidestream p recovery system which is much less than 20 mghac cod mgp in conventional ebpr systems in this case more carbon source was saved in the aao sbspr process at high p recovery rate and can be used for denitrification it is well known that ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were involved in the complete nitrification process as both of them have longer doubling times and slower growth rates compared to heterotrophic bacteria long srt is favorable for the nitrification process metcalf and eddy et al 2003 peng and zhu 2006 in this study as srt was extended to coordinate with high p recovery rate the remarkable enhancement of the nitrification process was observed at high p recovery rate both the ammonia oxidation rate aor and nitrite oxidation rate nor in the aao sbspr process were increased compared with the aao process particularly the nor under long srt table s2 which was confirmed by the increase of the relative abundance of nitrospira like nob as shown in table 3 meanwhile the relative abundance of nitrosomonas like aob was quite stable table 3 the nob has smaller endogenous decay coefficient compared with aob which may lead to the increase of nob aob ratio under long srt as suggested by dold et al 2005 and liu and wang 2014 moreover the adverse effect of the p recovery on the nitrification process reported by barat et al 2006 was not observed in this study these results indicate that the operational strategy proposed in this study is also beneficial for the nitrification process 3 3 other benefits of the aao sbspr process and further improvement strategies it is well known that increasing srt or decreasing sludge loading rate can reduce sludge production in wastewater treatment processes wei et al 2003 therefore another benefit of the operational strategy proposed in this study for the p recovery process is the reduction of the waste sludge as a result of long srt the concentration of the mixed liquor increased while the yobs decreased with the increase of srt in the aao sbspr process table 4 the yobs of the aao process was 0 29 kgvss kgcod which is close to the yobs of the conventional activated sludge process ranged from 0 4 to 0 7 kgvss kgcod metcalf and eddy et al 2003 however this parameter decreased to 0 12 kgvss kgcod when srt of the aao sbspr process increased to 50 d which resulted in 58 sludge reduction with respect to yobs under long srt more energy was used for endogenous respiration but not for the growth of the biomass production of excess sludge is one of the most serious challenges in the biological wastewater treatment process and treatment and disposal of sewage sludge could account for even up to 60 of the total cost of a wwtp saby et al 2003 an ideal way to solve this problem is to reduce sludge production during the wastewater treatment rather than the post treatment of the waste sludge the p mass balance equation eq 1 proposed and validated in this study also facilitates the selection of the operational parameters of the p recovery process the p recovery rate could be calculated in advance by specifying the parameters in eq 1 for example according to eq 1 for the operation mode with srt of 50 d if the p content in activated sludge further decreased to 0 035 mgp mgvss still above the 0 02 mgp mgvss the p recovery rate could increase to approximately 70 which is the theoretical maximum p recovery rate of the sidestream p recovery process levlin and hultman 2003 in contrast the potential p recovery rate is quite limited at short srt for aao sbspr process with srt between 10 and 20 d the calculated p recovery rates will fall within 30 55 as shown in fig 5 higher p recovery rates can only be achieved by extending the srt of the process moreover it can be seen from eq 1 that the influent p concentration also has an effect on the p recovery rate higher p recovery rate could be achieved if the influent p concentration is high even at short srt fig s5 however low influent p concentration will reduce p recovery potential understanding the influence of the influent p concentration is crucial to the application of this p recovery process in the full scale municipal wwtp as low influent p concentration as well as large variation of the influent p concentration often occur due to seasonal change of the wastewater and storm weather therefore p recovery rate and srt should be carefully selected based on the actual influent water quality to maintain an appropriate p content level in activated sludge and a stable operation of the process the p content in the precipitates after adding ca oh 2 was measured the phosphorus content of the recovered product was 13 8 0 5 wt or 31 6 1 6 wt as p2o5 table s3 operation mode srt 35 d target p recovery rate 50 which is close to the p content in hydroxyapatite hap 18 9 g p g hap as the phosphate rock is defined as high grade phosphate rock when p2o5 content is higher than 30 abouzeid 2008 the product obtained in this study can be a valuable p product the phosphate concentration in the supernatant of prr is also critical to p recovery as it may affect the quality of the recovered product besides as reported by yuan et al 2012 the techniques of p recovery through chemical precipitation are only economically feasible with p concentration above 50 mg l as shown in fig 7 the amount of p released in the anaerobic tank of the aao reactor decreased as p recovery rate and srt increased which will inevitably lead to the decrease of p content in sludge and further cause a low po4 3 p concentration in sidestream supernatant therefore optimization of the sidestream prr is essential to p recovery as proposed by kodera et al 2013 and wong et al 2013 p concentrated solutions could be achieved by repeatedly using the same organic substrate stream until the p concentration in supernatant reached a plateau meanwhile the high phosphate concentration could also be achieved by increasing the biomass density in the prr and reducing the volume of the organic substrate stream from influent used for anaerobic p release external carbon source such as acetate may be used to enhance p release in prr and reduce the volume of the supernatant and thus result in a high po4 3 p concentration 4 conclusions 1 a novel aao sbspr process was proposed to recover p from municipal wastewater and up to 65 of the influent p can be recovered an operational strategy based on the p mass balance for the process was proposed and validated the strategy linked the p recovery rate with srt which could effectively reduce the impact of p recovery on p content in activated sludge and achieve a stable operation of the process under high p recovery rate 2 high p recovery rate and long srt had limited influence on the kinetic rates and population of paos in the aao sbspr process and good p removal performance was achieved 3 anoxic p uptake was promoted under high p recovery rate and long srt and more carbon substrate was saved in this condition which improved the performance of n removal of the p recovery process meanwhile acceleration of the nitrification process was also observed under long srt and high p recovery rate 4 excess sludge production was minimized under long srt and high p recovery rate the p mass balance equation proposed in this study can facilitate the selection of the operational parameters for the p recovery process 5 further improvement in enhancing p recovery rate of the process is proposed acknowledgments this work was supported by the national hi tech research
