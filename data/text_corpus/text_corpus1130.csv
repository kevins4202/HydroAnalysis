5650,this study derived the flood inducing rainfall fir and flood inducing runoff firo for urban flood warning for this we derived a relationship between the watershed time of concentration and accumulated rainfall depth for 261 flood events at 239 watersheds of seoul with areas between 0 5 and 6 8 km2 during the years 2010 and 2011 based on 10 minute 1β 1 km radar gauge composite rainfall field this relationship was further categorized by discrete ranges of the proportion of the flooded area in the watershed fp and coefficient of variation cv of the rainfall time series then minimum possible rainfall intensity calculated for each of the classified depth duration relationship was determined as fir for the specified range of fp and cv a similar methodology was applied to derive firo which used runoff depths that were estimated using the nrcs curve number method we found that the fir and firo varied between 37 62 and 10 41 mm h respectively fir and firo increase with an increase in fp suggesting that greater rainfall causes larger flooded area as rainfall cv increases fir and firo decrease suggesting that the temporally concentrated rainfall requires less rainfall to cause the flood a flood warning system that checks the accumulated rainfall at each of the 239 seoul watersheds every 10 min was developed to verify the fir and firo against the 21 flood events that occurred between 2012 and 2015 when flooding was tolerated on 5 percent of the watershed area the ratios of hit miss and false alarm of the warning system based on the accumulated rainfall was 44 2 9 5 and 55 8 respectively the ratios of hit miss and false alarm of the warning system based on the runoff was 66 7 4 7 and 33 3 respectively the flood warning system based on gauge only or radar only data gives approximately 3 times as much false warnings compared with the system based on radar gauge composite data also the warning system that does not consider rainfall temporal variability gave approximately twice as much false warnings as the system that considered temporal variability keywords urban flood threshold radar rainfall rainfall temporal variability flood warning 1 introduction damages from floods have been increasing and are expected to significantly increase due to climate change unisdr 2011 visser et al 2014 stocker 2014 and explosive growth of urban areas fernandez et al 2010 chen et al 2015 where population and properties are concentrated coulthard 2007 zhou et al 2013 papagiannaki et al 2013 yoon 2014 therefore various structural and non structural measures have been employed to mitigate possible damages from the floods unep 2002 emphasized the importance of using non structural measures because of their economic and environmental advantages non structural measures are especially effective to be used in highly urbanized areas where land surfaces and undergrounds are occupied chen et al 2015 early flood warning systems have been widely applied as a type of non structural measure day 1985 de roo et al 2003 werner et al 2005 thielen et al 2009 lópez trujillo 2010 priest et al 2011 alfieri 2012 due to the economic advantages estrela et al 2001 teisberg et al 2009 one of the most crucial components of an efficient early flood warning system is an accurate flood inducing rainfall fir hereafter that is used as basis of the flood warning mogil et al 1978 schmidt et al 2007 norbiato et al 2008 gourley et al 2012 fir is typically defined as the depth duration or intensity duration relationship causing flood varying with initial soil moisture condition golian et al 2010 priest et al 2011 jang 2015 determination of the fir can be classified into either simulation based approaches or data driven approaches guzzetti et al 2007 a simulation based approach applies various scenarios of rainfall and antecedent moisture conditions to hydrologic and or hydrodynamic models to identify the threshold of rainfall leading to floods and other secondary disasters such as landslides mogil et al 1978 reed et al 2007 norbiato et al 2008 miao et al 2016 norbiato et al 2009 golian et al 2010 kim et al 2016 zêzere et al 2015 however there is a view that simulation based approaches are susceptible to high degree of error especially at ungauged watersheds because the model parameters cannot be calibrated blöschl 2006 norbiato et al 2008 miao et al 2016 in addition a warning system based on real time operation of the hydrologic and or hydraulic model is vulnerable to the issues associated with the model s initial condition settings and the computational time on the other hand data driven approaches identify fir based on empirical analysis on the in situ data of a flooded area and the corresponding rainfall thus data driven approaches have been widely applied for methodological simplicity glade et al 2000 duncan et al 2011 caine 1980 hong et al 2005 dahal et al 2009 cannon et al 2008 guzzetti et al 2008 saito et al 2010 primary disadvantage of a data driven approach is that it requires a large volume of accurate rainfall flow discharge and or flooded area data in addition applicability of a given data driven approach may be confined by domain of the observed data several studies have addressed the fir corresponding to river floods reed et al 2007 montesarchio et al 2009 golian et al 2010 javelle et al 2010 miao et al 2016 santos 2016 and landslides e g zêzere and rodrigues 2002 kanji et al 2003 guzzetti et al 2007 peruccacci et al 2012 thomas et al 2018 however only few studies diakakis 2012 papagiannaki et al 2015 jang 2015 oh et al 2016 lee et al 2017 have explicitly discussed the fir in urban settings results of these studies are summarized in table 1 investigation of the urban floods has following difficulties as compared to the river floods and landslides 1 urban watersheds quickly respond to rainfall therefore a complete observation of the urban floods requires not only extensive and consistent but also responsive field campaign that often exceeds the capacity of a research team 2 high population density and imperviousness of urban area make even small size watersheds e g less than 1 km2 susceptible to the significant flood damages and accurate observation of rainfall at this small spatial scale can be a daunting task regarding this rafieeinasab et al 2015 argued that an accurate urban flood analysis requires the rainfall data with spatio temporal resolution of 500 m and 15 min which is only possible through the operation of radar rainfall observation system from a practical viewpoint 3 an underground drainage pipe network as well as an artificial alteration of local topography and land cover play an important role in the flooding mechanism in an urban area for this reason simulation based analysis of urban floods not only requires dual drainage models schmitt et al 2004 leandro et al 2009 jahanbazi 2014 chang et al 2015 oh et al 2016 but also geospatial data of the drainage pipe network high resolution topography and land cover which are difficult to obtain in this study we applied a data driven approach to estimate the fir of a highly urbanized area so that it can be applied in the real time flood alert system for the city of seoul first merit of this study comes from the accuracy and precision of the data used to derive the results unlike the existing studies using either ground based rainfall data mogil et al 1978 schmidt et al 2007 norbiato et al 2008 gourley et al 2012 forestieri et al 2016 papagiannaki et al 2015 or radar rainfall data that were adjusted based on gauge data vivoni et al 2006 javelle et al 2010 rozalis et al 2010 fouchier et al 2015 lau et al 2015 we applied an algorithm of merging radar and gauge rainfall data to obtain the radar gauge composite data for flood analysis the composite data has 1 1 km spatial and 10 min temporal resolution analyzed result from the composite data was validated to be more accurate compared to that from the radar only or gauge only rainfall for most of the time steps during the study period we also used the high resolution gis data of the flooded area the data were obtained from an extensive field observation campaign driven by a korean governmental agency that performed the recovery actions so it has a building scale spatial resolution and is very accurate second the quantity of the data adds a unique value to this study the data of rainfall and flooded area were recorded for all 239 watersheds of seoul with various area ranging between 0 5 and 6 8 km2 for 2010 and 2011 meaning a total of 478 239 watersheds 2 years is available for the rainfall flooded area relationships large quantity of the observation data enabled us to perform a thorough analysis on the fir solely based on observation and not depending on numerical simulation which is usually an essential element of the fir estimation to compensate the shortage of the observed data diakakis 2012 santos et al 2016 third in addition to the investigation on the fir we performed an analysis on the flood inducing runoff firo to incorporate the influence of watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture conditions here the runoff was derived from the rainfall data using the nrcs curve number method to ensure its practical applicability our analyses suggest that the relationship between both fir and firo can be expressed using the power law significant uncertainty residing in this relationship could be further explained by examining the proportion of the flooded area in the watershed and the rainfall temporal variability following this discovery we presented the fir and firo as a function of these two variables then the flood warning system using the newly developed fir and firo was validated for 2013 through 2015 the system using the radar gauge composite rainfall data as its input succeeded in giving flood warnings for almost all flooding events while missing only a few in comparison the system based on radar or gauge only data showed poorer performance than the system using the radar gauge composite data 2 methodology 2 1 study area seoul the capital of south korea was chosen as study area representative of typical urban settings seoul has an area of 605 km2 and the population of 10 3 million fig 1 high proportion of impervious surface 49 and steep slopes of mountainous areas average slope of 8 57 make the chosen area highly susceptible to flash floods and subsequent damages at locations where population is concentrated yoon 2014 fig 1 shows the 239 watersheds in seoul and the rain gauge stations in and nearby this city for last fifty years increase in both annual precipitation and frequency of heavy rainfall have been observed in seoul the average annual rainfall increased from 1 498 mm 1962 1971 to 1 614 mm 2001 2011 lee et al 2016 and the frequency of the heavy rainfall increased by 13 9 percent during the same period seoul metropolitan government 2015 during the period from 1980 to 2015 seoul experienced 7 extreme rainfall events among these this study investigated the rainfall events of 2010 and 2011 which caused significant flood damages across vast part of the city the heavy rainfall event of 2010 september 21st was the most intense precipitation 202 mm of average areal rainfall over 5 2 h recorded since 1908 flood from the event caused financial damage of 42 9 million usd and 17 905 flooded buildings the heavy rainfall event of 2011 july 26 28 had rainfall of 500 mm over 30 5 h causing 16 human casualties and financial damage of 30 7 million usd this single event was accounted for approximately half the damages in korea caused by all natural disasters in 2011 2 2 rainfall data this study used 1 minute gauge rainfall records from 31 precipitation stations located in or at nearby seoul star marks in fig 1 and radar precipitation data provided by the korea meteorological administration kma the radar precipitation data has spatial and temporal resolution of 1 1 km and 10 minute interval respectively the radar rainfall measurement system of kma consists of eight s band and three c band radars to construct the composite field of rainfall the radar data is produced through following four processes suk et al 2013 1 quality control of volumetric reflectivity for each radar the terrain blockages and cones of silence are filled using an interpolation technique nimr 1994 wrc 2010 and a fuzzy logic approach cho et al 2006 ye et al 2015 is used to remove the ground echoes and anomalous propagation in radars 2 the computation of the average areal rain rate based on the ground gauges 3 real time updated every 10 min rainfall estimation by z r relationship minimizing the difference between 10 minute radar reflectivity and ground average areal rain rate based on the window probability matching method wpmm 4 composition of estimated rainfall product from 10 radars overlapped coverage is mosaicked using the algorithm of mohr and vaughan 1979 and lee et al 2010 detailed description about the algorithms of the radar data production is provided by suk et al 2013 and kim et al 2019 the rainfall event of 2010 occurred between 2010 09 21 12 30 and 2010 09 21 17 50 and the rainfall event of 2011 occurred between 2011 07 26 16 00 and 2011 07 28 10 30 fig 2 shows the hyetographs and the accumulated rainfall mass curves for areal average rainfall in seoul fig 2a for the 2010 event and fig 2b for the 2011 event it also shows the hyetographs of areal rainfall for the watersheds with maximum accumulated rainfall for the events of 2010 and 2011 i e fig 2c and d for 2010 and 2011 respectively 2 3 gis data of the flood inundation area this study used the flood inundation area from the gis data corresponding to the rainfall events of 2010 and 2011 fig 3 the data was collected by the metropolitan government of seoul following governmental regulation to develop detailed flood footprint maps within 6 months after an occurrence of the flood disaster guidelines regarding disaster mapping standards ministry of the interior and safety of korea 2017 the observation campaign is performed through direct field visits cctv video investigations and civil complaints from the people whose properties were flooded the gis data has a building scale spatial resolution so it contains specific addresses and properties of the flooded buildings as shown in fig 3 2 4 gis data for the drainage pipe network this study used drainage pipe network from the gis data provided by the metropolitan government of seoul data source https opengov seoul go kr sanction 2175286 this data was used to identify the longest flow path and to calculate the watershed time of concentration fig 3c shows the pipe network of the siwol 3 watershed 2 5 radar gauge composite space time rainfall field this study used the radar gauge composite space time rainfall field to identify the reference rainfall threshold causing flood inundation the composite field was produced using the method of conditional merging ehret 2003 sinclair and pegram 2005 pettazzi et al 2012 kim et al 2016 the conditional merging cm method adjusts the gauge based rainfall field using the information on the rainstorm spatial structure obtained from the radar data this technique has been widely used to obtain the accurate space time field of various environmental variables including rainfall and soil moisture sinclair and pegram 2005 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 berndt et al 2014 jongjin et al 2016 kim et al 2016 rainfall is observed at 31 ground gauges for every minute and fig 4 describes the process of the conditional merging technique applied in this study a one minute gauge rainfall data is accumulated over the 10 minute period to be synchronized with measurement interval of the radar data b ordinary kriging technique is applied to obtain the in situ rainfall field c rainfall is observed using the radar d collect the radar rainfall values at the gauge locations and apply ordinary kriging technique to obtain the radar based rainfall field e calculate the correction field by subtracting the radar based rainfall field d from the original radar field c f the correction field e is added to the in situ rain field b to obtain the composite radar ground rainfall data fig 5a compares the observed rainfall x axis with the in situ based rainfall y axis red triangles and the estimated rainfall from the conditional merging method y axis blue circles for the september 21 2010 at 12 50 pm the values for the y axis were obtained using the leave one out cross validation for this specific time the correlation coefficient corresponding to the conditional merging cm was larger than the one corresponding to the in situ observation although this was not always the case correlation coefficients from the cm method was generally higher fig 5b compares the correlation coefficients of the in situ based rainfall and those of the estimates based on the cm method each point on the scatterplot represents a pair of correlation coefficients gauge on the x axis cm on the y axis for a 10 minute snapshot of the rainfall field data points above the 1 1 line represent the snapshots at which the cm method outperformed the gauge kriging estimates among all 289 10 minute radar precipitation fields considered in this study the cm method showed greater correlation coefficients than the gauge kriging at 225 snapshots i e around 78 percent note that there are many data points on the upper left part of the scatterplot where cm method produced rainfall estimates that are dramatically more accurate than those produced by the gauge kriging method 2 6 time of concentration for the watersheds time of concentration toc is defined as a time required for raindrop to reach the watershed outlet from the furthest point of the watershed therefore rainfall excess accumulated at the watershed outlet should be maximized over the time of concentration we assumed that the flooded area of each watershed which can be considered as the footprint of the flood was caused by accumulated water that is maximized over the watershed toc the following equations from the urban storm drainage criteria manual udfcd 2016 were used to calculate the time of concentration t c t i t t 3 t i 0 395 1 1 c l i s 0 0 33 4 t t l t 60 k s 5 where tc ti tt are the time of concentration min time of overland flow min and time of channelized flow min respectively c and k are the runoff coefficient and the conveyance factor tables 6 2 and 6 4 udfcd 2016 s and li are average slope and length ft of the overland flow s0 and lt are average slope and length of the waterway ft the parameters of s li s0 lt were calculated along the longest flow path the toc calculated this way can incorporate various crucial factors of the flood generation mechanism eqs 4 and 5 inherently reflect the size li and lt pipe network geometric characteristics lt surface roughness c pipe network roughness k and slope s of watershed therefore an accurate estimation of the toc is one of the most important steps of our analysis note that the accurate estimation of toc was possible with an aid of extensive pipe network gis database data source https opengov seoul go kr sanction 2175286 of the study area of which an example is shown in fig 3c fig 6 shows the relationship between watershed area and time of concentration developed for all 239 watersheds it can be seen that the relationship roughly follows the power law 2 7 estimation of the flood inducing rainfall we assumed that the flooded area or the flood footprint was caused by the accumulated rainfall that is maximized over the watershed time of concentration toc this maximum rainfall values were calculated for each of the 239 watersheds and for both 2010 and 2011 rainfall events for this we clipped multi temporal radar gauge composite rainfall fields for each of the 239 watershed polygons fig 7 a and calculated the average areal rainfall of each of the clipped rainfall fields to obtain the time series fig 7b here each 1 km 1 km radar rainfall field thick red lines in fig 7a was further subdivided into a 100 m 100 m grid format thin green lines in fig 7a to reduce the error caused by coarse resolution of the radar rainfall data then we moved the time window with the duration of watershed toc over the time series to obtain the maximum accumulated rainfall note that the measurement interval of rainfall data is 10 min while the watershed toc was calculated to have 1 minute precisions e g 36 min to reduce the error caused by this discrepancy we linearly interpolated the accumulated rainfall as an example if a the watershed time of concentration is 35 min and b the accumulated rainfall values over the period of 30 min and 40 min are 50 mm and 100 mm respectively we derived the value of 75 mm linearly interpolated for 35 min as the accumulated rainfall through this process we obtained 478 239 2 pairs of the toc and maximum accumulated rainfall value next out of these 478 sets we excluded 217 sets corresponding to the watersheds with no flooded area then we investigated the relationship between the rainfall depth and the toc of the remaining i e flooded 261 watersheds note that the accumulated rainfall values derived here are of the spatial average so any result based on these values does not account for the influence of rainfall spatial variability olivera et al 2008 kim et al 2019 we performed an analysis to make sure that the influence of rainfall spatial variability is minimal fig 7 c shows coefficient of variation of pixel rainfall values for the 261 flooded cases the coefficient of variation values varied between 0 and 0 35 and 83 percent of the values were less than 0 05 suggesting that the uncertainty induced by rainfall spatial variability in our analysis would be very low 2 8 consideration of the watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition amc play an important role in flooding mechanism we considered the influence of watershed imperviousness by considering the runoff corresponding to the maximum rainfall estimated as explained in the previous section section 2 6 the runoff was estimated using the nrcs curve number method cn method hereafter young et al 1987 we could not calibrate the cn due to lack of the flow discharge data at the watershed outlet therefore we estimated them as area weighted averages of the cn values inferred from the land cover of the watershed fig 8 shows a the map of land use of seoul data source http www neins go kr b the map of the estimated cn values for each of the watersheds denoted as the values in the parenthesis in the legends of fig 8a and c the histogram of the cn values of all 239 watersheds in seoul the amc was considered by adjusting the cn based on the accumulated precipitation for past 5 days prior to the event using the following formula usda 1986 thresholds to adjust the cn values are shown in table 2 we took the values of the growing season 6 cn i 4 2 c n i i 10 0 058 c n i i c n i i i 23 c n i i 10 0 13 c n i i note that the runoff calculated in this manner does not necessarily reflect the runoff in reality this is because flow data was not observed at the watershed outlet during the study period so the cn values could not be calibrated but were inferred from the land cover property fig 8a in addition the approach of this study did not follow the standard procedure of the cn method in which the target rainfall event from time series is separated however analysis based on this calculated runoff value reduced the uncertainty residing in the fir thus significantly improving the performance of the flood warning system therefore the procedure taken by this study to estimate runoff should be understood as a practical choice to improve the accuracy of the warning system 3 results 3 1 duration versus flood inducing rainfall fig 9 a shows the relationship between the accumulated rainfall depth y axis and the time of concentration x axis at each watershed non flooded watersheds were excluded from the plot meaning the relationship was established for the 261 flooded watersheds over the study period of two years for the scatterplot colors represent the proportions of the flooded areas within the watersheds note that both axes of the plots are on logarithmic scales a clear power law relationship exists between the time of concentration and the accumulated rainfall though significant uncertainty resides as suggested by the r2 value of 0 74 we first assumed that this uncertainty can be explained by examining the flooded area proportion since greater rainfall leads to greater flooded area the color distribution of fig 9a supports this assumption as most blue data points corresponding to the low flooded area are at lower part of the scatterplot and most red points corresponding to the high flooded area are at the upper part note there are several watersheds that do not follow this assumption as represented by green and yellow points on the far upper right side of the plot these watersheds have highest amount of the accumulated rainfalls but the proportion of the flooded area is not the highest this is primarily because these two watersheds are located at outskirt of seoul where a significant portion is comprised of a pervious mountain area delineated by thick lines in fig 1 this suggests that a variable that can consider watershed imperviousness will reduce the uncertainty of the relationship as later discussed in section 3 2 we also assumed that the uncertainty is likewise associated with the temporal variability of the spatially averaged rainfall this is because the rainfall with greater intensity is more likely to generate more runoff given same rainfall depth which may subsequently lead to flooding fig 9b supports this assumption fig 9b is identical to fig 9a but the color distribution of the scatterplot now represents the coefficient of variation of rainfall time series red data points corresponding to the greater coefficient of variation or more intense rainfall are located at the lower part of the scatterplot this means that rainfall events with greater temporal variability requires less amount of total rainfall to cause the flood given similar rainfall duration these results suggest that both the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability must be considered to determine the threshold of a flood inducing rainfall event note that the greater coefficient of variation cv does not always imply more intense rainfall especially when the rainfall event has a small mean value which constitutes the denominator term of the cv calculation however this will be a rare case given that most rainfall events considered for a flood warning will have high mean values 3 2 duration versus flood inducing runoff fig 10 a shows the relationship between the accumulated runoff depth y axis and the time of concentration x axis at each watershed the plot is same as fig 9a except that its y axis shows the runoff depths not the rainfall depths a clear power law relationship exists for the fig 10a as well the r2 value 0 81 of the relationship is greater compared to the case of the rainfall 0 74 fig 9a this indicates that the uncertainty residing in the relationship between the duration of flood inducing rainfall and the rainfall depth can be reduced by considering an additional variable accounting for the watershed imperviousness which in our case is the watershed curve number similar trend was observed regarding the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability red data points corresponding to the greater flooded area were in the upper side of the scatterplot in fig 10a and the red points corresponding to the greater rainfall temporal variability were in the lower side of the plot in fig 10b 3 3 threshold of flood inducing rainfall and runoff sections 3 1 and 3 2 suggest that the watershed flooding is highly influenced by 1 the rainfall temporal variability and 2 the watershed imperviousness in addition we found that 3 greater accumulated rainfall depth is associated with greater flooded area proportion here we want to estimate the threshold of flood inducing rainfall and the runoff values considering all three variables for this we classified the flooded area proportion fp into 6 intervals and the coefficient of variation of rainfall cv into 3 intervals to have a total of 18 intervals in the 2 dimensional space then we established a relationship between the accumulated rainfall y axis and the time of concentration x axis of the watersheds belonging to each of the 18 classified intervals blue points in fig 11 we also established a similar relationship for the runoff to account for the watershed imperviousness red points in fig 11 in fig 11 the degree of scatter of the depth duration relationship is significantly less compared to the ones shown in fig 9 and fig 10 this indicates the significant influence of the two classifying variables on the relationship then we assumed that the minimum of the slopes of straight lines that pass through both the origin and any one of the data points is the intensity of the flood inducing rainfall and the runoff corresponding to the classified ranges of the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability here value of such a slope can be mathematically expressed as follows 6 s m i n y i x i where xi and yi represent the time of concentration t and accumulated rainfall or runoff l observed at the ith watershed and min is the minimum value operator these lines are shown as thick dotted lines for each plot in fig 11 then we obtained a contour map of these slope values in the two dimensional space consisting of the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability i e coefficient of variation fig 12 a shows this contour map it clearly shows that the flood inducing rainfall intensity decreases as the rainfall temporal variability increases in other words intense rainfall requires less water to cause flooding in addition threshold value increases as flooded area proportion increases fig 12b shows similar map generated for the flood inducing runoff intensity this map shows that the behavior of the flood inducing runoff is smoother compared to the case of the rainfall this is because the runoff value which accounts for the watershed imperviousness and the amc through the curve number is more directly related to the flooding 3 4 algorithm of the flood warning to validate our results we developed a flood warning algorithm as described in fig 13 this algorithm is to be run separately for each watershed and it can be repeated for different watersheds first the algorithm obtains time series of the rainfall on the watershed corresponding to the duration of the watershed time of concentration toc then the average rainfall intensity pave and the coefficient of variation pcv of the rainfall time series are calculated the calculated pave and pcv are then compared with the threshold values shown in fig 12 see the corresponding explanations on fig 13 to decide whether to initiate the warning an algorithm for the runoff based warning is similar the only difference is that the warning is based on the average runoff rave and the coefficient of variation rcv of the runoff that is estimated based on the cn method 3 5 validation of the fir and firo the algorithm shown in fig 13 was applied to all 239 watersheds in seoul for the validation period between 2012 and 2015 during which 21 flood events were recorded note that no gis data were obtained for the flooded areas during this period because damages by the floods during this period were not as significant as in cases of 2010 and 2011 korean government decided to forgo extensive field observation campaigns instead we extensively investigated the news articles available table 3 summarizes the collected information regarding these flood events of which the location and year of occurrence for each event are shown as circles in fig 3 from section 2 3 furthermore we validated for the no flood no warning cases as well for the events of the floods of 2010 2010 09 21 12 30 to 2010 09 21 17 50 and 2011 2011 07 26 16 00 to 2011 07 28 10 30 among the 478 cases considered in this study 239 watersheds 2 years 261 cases were flooded which subsequently means that the remaining 217 cases were not flooded for a non flooded case flood warning should not be initiated otherwise a false alarm will be initiated fig 14 shows results from the validation blue lines represent the contour values corresponding to the dotted lines in fig 12a and b i e they represent the fir and firo that would flood approximately five percent of the watershed coordinates of the markers in the plot represent the average intensity of the accumulated rainfall over the watershed time of concentration y axis and the coefficient of variation x axis blue lines reveal that 1 the average intensity of the rainfall that flooded approximately five percent of the entire watershed can have depth ranging from 38 mm h to 60 mm h and that 2 firo decreases as the temporal variability of the rainfall increases for these plots any point located at the upper side of the blue line represents a rainfall event for which flood warning is initiated in the validation analysis 43 flood warnings have been initiated among which 19 turned out to be actual floods two gray dots below the blue line represent rainfall events that have resulted in flooding yet were missed by the warning system overall the ratios of hit miss and false alarm were 44 2 percent 19 43 100 9 5 percent 2 21 100 and 55 8 percent 24 43 100 respectively the warning system based on the runoff criteria outperformed the one based on the rainfall with the ratios of hit miss and false alarm being 66 7 percent 20 30 100 4 7 percent 1 21 100 and 33 3 percent 10 30 100 respectively this discrepancy is expected because the analysis based on the runoff considers two extra variables that play important roles in the flood generation mechanism watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition the green squares markers in fig 14a and b show the validation for non flooded watersheds during two flood events of 2010 and 2011 out of 217 non flooded cases 211 97 3 percent and 209 96 3 percent cases did not produce any flood warnings using the criteria based on the rainfall and runoff respectively note that this very low false alarm rate was achieved even during two major storm events that flooded more than half the watersheds in seoul suggesting the importance of determining a proper tolerance level of fp 5 percent of fp was used for the analysis with the results shown in fig 14a and b the 24 rainfall based false alarms occurred in the 22 watersheds and 12 of these 22 watersheds were in the forests see fig 8b in these forest watersheds runoff generation mechanisms are more complex than they are in highly urbanized watersheds where most rainfall turns into runoff the complexity may originate from plant interceptions antecedent moisture condition that is affected by plan evapotranspiration and soil types with varying infiltration characteristics that could not be precisely reflected in this study these conditions collectively could make the watersheds more flood resistant especially for the extreme rainfall with great temporal variability fig 14c and d show performance of the flood warning algorithm varying with degree of allowable flooded area proportions in other words flood warning is not initiated if the flooded area is less than the value of the x axis blue red and yellow lines represent the number of warnings hits and misses respectively the plots reveal that as flooded area proportion increases or as the threshold of flood warning is more relaxed numbers of warnings and hits decrease while the number of misses increases the shaded area on the plot representing the number of false warnings decreases as the threshold of flood warning is more relaxed warnings based on the firo outperformed the ones based on the fir across all degrees of warning threshold or allowable flooded area proportions in terms of the ratio of hits misses and false warnings suggesting the importance of accounting for the watershed imperviousness in flood warning algorithm for an urban area determination of appropriate threshold values to give flood warnings has been a great dilemma for many decision makers selection of a small flooded area proportion or a low threshold would minimize the false alarm at the expense of lower hit ratio the opposite case would increase the number of false alarms but the miss ratio would increase for the decision makers fig 14c and d can be used as a quantitative guideline to decide an optimal threshold of the flood warning system 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of the flood warning algorithm to the rainfall errors the flood warning system fig 13 and the validation results fig 14 are based on the observed rainfall data and not on the predicted one given that it takes time for rain to accumulate in the watershed to cause flood and that the system takes only a few seconds to run the proposed warning system will still have the warning lead time corresponding to the watershed time of concentration however it is always safe to give flood warning as early as possible so long as high accuracy of the warning can be guaranteed here we investigated how the flood warning system would perform if the predicted rainfall values were used instead of the observed ones for this we stochastically perturbed every 10 minute rainfall record observed between 2012 and 2015 then we assumed that the perturbed rainfall data is the predicted rainfall data the following equation was used for stochastic perturbation 7 r 1 κ u 0 1 r where r and r represent the perturbed and observed 10 minute rainfall record κ is the degree of perturbation and u 0 1 represents the random number from a uniform distribution ranging between 0 and 1 the value of κ used for the perturbation was 0 02 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 30 the perturbation ratio of 0 02 and 0 2 roughly correspond to the lead time of 5 min and 1 h respectively akbari asanjan 2018 zahraei 2012 though the relationship may vary significantly with different storm types and storm tracking algorithm for each value of κ 100 ensembles of rainfall time series and the corresponding runoff were produced for each watershed based on which flood warning system was run fig 15 shows performance of the flood warning system varying with different degrees of stochastic perturbation the performance of the warning system decreases with an increase in perturbation ratio the performance significantly decreases around the threshold of 10 15 percent perturbation ratio 0 1 κ 0 15 and the hit ratio of the system converges to a value of 0 and when the rainfall data is perturbed by 30 percent κ 0 3 this result suggests that the warning system is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the rainfall input data so the balance between acquiring lead time and accuracy of the flood warning should be precisely maintained with a sufficient consideration on the accuracy of the radar quantitative forecast and storm tracking algorithm that varies with storm types 4 2 performance of the flood warning algorithm based on ground gauge rainfall input data we further investigated how the alert algorithm would perform if different sets of rainfall data were used as inputs fig 16 a and b show the number of warnings blue hits red and misses yellow varying with warning threshold for the cases when a the radar only and b the gauge only rainfall data were used as an input for the warning system here the gauge only rainfall data was produced using ordinary kriging technique these plots suggest that both systems significantly under perform compared with the system based on radar gauge composite rainfall data fig 14c the warning system based on radar only rainfall data gives significantly more warnings than that based on radar gauge composite data 281 versus 142 and gauge only rainfall data 281 versus 167 the system based on radar only data has greater ratio for both misses and false alarms this suggests that the quantitative precipitation estimation of radar rainfall is not accurate especially for high rainfall rate boodoo et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 note that the results shown here correspond to the situation in which the gauge rainfall is used as input for the flood warning system but the warning criteria fir and firo of the system was derived from the radar ground composite rainfall we did not consider the situation in which flood warning criteria is also derived from the gauge rainfall this is because we already know that the radar ground composite rainfall is more accurate than the ground rainfall and the flood warning system based only on the ground rainfall would be less accurate as well if validation is performed on this circumstance the source of its uncertainty would be difficult to identify 4 3 influence of the rainfall temporal variability more precise fir and firo can be derived by additionally accounting for the rainfall temporal variability as opposed to the approaches based only on the rainfall intensity here we investigated the influence of the rainfall temporal variability on accuracy of the flood warning system for this we developed and tested a separate flood warning algorithm that is based only on the rainfall intensity but not on its temporal variability in this algorithm a flood warning is initiated if accumulated rainfall over the time of concentration or the corresponding runoff is greater than a given threshold value fig 17 a and b show results of this test based on the temporally averaged a rainfall intensity and b runoff respectively in both plots x axis represents the threshold of the rainfall intensity and the runoff of which the flood warning has been initiated and y axis represents the number of initiated flood warnings large shaded area in both plots suggests that significantly more false warnings were initiated compared to the cases in which rainfall temporal variability was additionally considered fig 14c and d in addition low slopes of the red and yellow lines in fig 17a suggest that the actual flood warning is not as sensitive to the temporally averaged rainfall intensity as we commonly expect 4 4 how much rain does cause how much flood primary purpose of this research was to identify the minimum threshold of rainfall and runoff causing flood for this reason we focused on estimating the minimum possible rainfall intensity and runoff fig 12 varying with rainfall temporal variability and flooded area proportion however it may be also interesting to investigate the general relationship between these variables here we tried to provide an answer to the following classical question of urban hydrology how much rainfall cause how much flood in an urban area fig 18 a shows the relationship between the rainfall intensity x axis and the flooded area proportion y axis the color of the scatter points represents the coefficient of variation of the rainfall as previously discussed rainfall here refers to the portion of rainfall time series during which accumulated rainfall is maximized over the watershed toc a weak power law relationship was identified the plot shows that greater rainfall intensity tends to cause greater floods greater rainfall intensity also tends to be associated with lower temporal variability blue scatters are concentrated on the right side of the plot note that both axes of the plot are in logarithmic scale and the flooded area proportion can vary by several orders of magnitude for a given rainfall intensity implying the difficulty of inferring flood magnitude from rainfall intensity alone fig 18b shows similar relationship but this time the color of the scatters is based on the nrcs curve numbers cn compared to fig 18a the influence of third variable cn is more apparent as suggested by the red and blue scatters in upper and lower parts of the plot respectively we performed the regression analysis to predict the flooded area proportion from the cv and cn but we chose not to present the regression equations here due to high uncertainty residing in them instead the general trend revealed by fig 18b may be used as a rough guideline to predict the magnitude of flood given rainfall intensity and watershed imperviousness 5 conclusion we derived flood inducing rainfall fir and flood inducing runoff firo to be used as the basis of the flood warning initiation in highly urbanized areas our framework has following advantages first it can consider the temporal variability of rainfall and runoff unlike many flood warnings based on temporally averaged single rainfall intensity values our approach derived fir as a function of coefficient variation of the rainfall enhancing the accuracy of the flood warning system second our approach enables the decision makers to find the optimal solution to secure both accuracy and reliability of the flood warning system by giving them an option of selecting different degrees of the allowable flooded area proportion third it allows a simple way to incorporate the influence of watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition for flood warning by suggesting the threshold of the runoff leading to flood the warning system based on runoff significantly outperformed the one based on rainfall values most distinctive characteristics of our approach may be the use of high resolution radar gauge composite rainfall data and the flooded area gis data that enabled the threshold values to be calculated without performing numerical simulations which inevitably entail uncertainties derived from the model parameters and the conceptualization of the reality the validation result of this study suggests that accurate threshold of the flood warning can be derived purely based on the information regarding the rainfall and flooded area we also found the importance of utilizing the radar gauge composite rainfall field for flood warning results using the composite data significantly outperformed that of the system based on either gauge only or radar only data credit authorship

5650,this study derived the flood inducing rainfall fir and flood inducing runoff firo for urban flood warning for this we derived a relationship between the watershed time of concentration and accumulated rainfall depth for 261 flood events at 239 watersheds of seoul with areas between 0 5 and 6 8 km2 during the years 2010 and 2011 based on 10 minute 1β 1 km radar gauge composite rainfall field this relationship was further categorized by discrete ranges of the proportion of the flooded area in the watershed fp and coefficient of variation cv of the rainfall time series then minimum possible rainfall intensity calculated for each of the classified depth duration relationship was determined as fir for the specified range of fp and cv a similar methodology was applied to derive firo which used runoff depths that were estimated using the nrcs curve number method we found that the fir and firo varied between 37 62 and 10 41 mm h respectively fir and firo increase with an increase in fp suggesting that greater rainfall causes larger flooded area as rainfall cv increases fir and firo decrease suggesting that the temporally concentrated rainfall requires less rainfall to cause the flood a flood warning system that checks the accumulated rainfall at each of the 239 seoul watersheds every 10 min was developed to verify the fir and firo against the 21 flood events that occurred between 2012 and 2015 when flooding was tolerated on 5 percent of the watershed area the ratios of hit miss and false alarm of the warning system based on the accumulated rainfall was 44 2 9 5 and 55 8 respectively the ratios of hit miss and false alarm of the warning system based on the runoff was 66 7 4 7 and 33 3 respectively the flood warning system based on gauge only or radar only data gives approximately 3 times as much false warnings compared with the system based on radar gauge composite data also the warning system that does not consider rainfall temporal variability gave approximately twice as much false warnings as the system that considered temporal variability keywords urban flood threshold radar rainfall rainfall temporal variability flood warning 1 introduction damages from floods have been increasing and are expected to significantly increase due to climate change unisdr 2011 visser et al 2014 stocker 2014 and explosive growth of urban areas fernandez et al 2010 chen et al 2015 where population and properties are concentrated coulthard 2007 zhou et al 2013 papagiannaki et al 2013 yoon 2014 therefore various structural and non structural measures have been employed to mitigate possible damages from the floods unep 2002 emphasized the importance of using non structural measures because of their economic and environmental advantages non structural measures are especially effective to be used in highly urbanized areas where land surfaces and undergrounds are occupied chen et al 2015 early flood warning systems have been widely applied as a type of non structural measure day 1985 de roo et al 2003 werner et al 2005 thielen et al 2009 lópez trujillo 2010 priest et al 2011 alfieri 2012 due to the economic advantages estrela et al 2001 teisberg et al 2009 one of the most crucial components of an efficient early flood warning system is an accurate flood inducing rainfall fir hereafter that is used as basis of the flood warning mogil et al 1978 schmidt et al 2007 norbiato et al 2008 gourley et al 2012 fir is typically defined as the depth duration or intensity duration relationship causing flood varying with initial soil moisture condition golian et al 2010 priest et al 2011 jang 2015 determination of the fir can be classified into either simulation based approaches or data driven approaches guzzetti et al 2007 a simulation based approach applies various scenarios of rainfall and antecedent moisture conditions to hydrologic and or hydrodynamic models to identify the threshold of rainfall leading to floods and other secondary disasters such as landslides mogil et al 1978 reed et al 2007 norbiato et al 2008 miao et al 2016 norbiato et al 2009 golian et al 2010 kim et al 2016 zêzere et al 2015 however there is a view that simulation based approaches are susceptible to high degree of error especially at ungauged watersheds because the model parameters cannot be calibrated blöschl 2006 norbiato et al 2008 miao et al 2016 in addition a warning system based on real time operation of the hydrologic and or hydraulic model is vulnerable to the issues associated with the model s initial condition settings and the computational time on the other hand data driven approaches identify fir based on empirical analysis on the in situ data of a flooded area and the corresponding rainfall thus data driven approaches have been widely applied for methodological simplicity glade et al 2000 duncan et al 2011 caine 1980 hong et al 2005 dahal et al 2009 cannon et al 2008 guzzetti et al 2008 saito et al 2010 primary disadvantage of a data driven approach is that it requires a large volume of accurate rainfall flow discharge and or flooded area data in addition applicability of a given data driven approach may be confined by domain of the observed data several studies have addressed the fir corresponding to river floods reed et al 2007 montesarchio et al 2009 golian et al 2010 javelle et al 2010 miao et al 2016 santos 2016 and landslides e g zêzere and rodrigues 2002 kanji et al 2003 guzzetti et al 2007 peruccacci et al 2012 thomas et al 2018 however only few studies diakakis 2012 papagiannaki et al 2015 jang 2015 oh et al 2016 lee et al 2017 have explicitly discussed the fir in urban settings results of these studies are summarized in table 1 investigation of the urban floods has following difficulties as compared to the river floods and landslides 1 urban watersheds quickly respond to rainfall therefore a complete observation of the urban floods requires not only extensive and consistent but also responsive field campaign that often exceeds the capacity of a research team 2 high population density and imperviousness of urban area make even small size watersheds e g less than 1 km2 susceptible to the significant flood damages and accurate observation of rainfall at this small spatial scale can be a daunting task regarding this rafieeinasab et al 2015 argued that an accurate urban flood analysis requires the rainfall data with spatio temporal resolution of 500 m and 15 min which is only possible through the operation of radar rainfall observation system from a practical viewpoint 3 an underground drainage pipe network as well as an artificial alteration of local topography and land cover play an important role in the flooding mechanism in an urban area for this reason simulation based analysis of urban floods not only requires dual drainage models schmitt et al 2004 leandro et al 2009 jahanbazi 2014 chang et al 2015 oh et al 2016 but also geospatial data of the drainage pipe network high resolution topography and land cover which are difficult to obtain in this study we applied a data driven approach to estimate the fir of a highly urbanized area so that it can be applied in the real time flood alert system for the city of seoul first merit of this study comes from the accuracy and precision of the data used to derive the results unlike the existing studies using either ground based rainfall data mogil et al 1978 schmidt et al 2007 norbiato et al 2008 gourley et al 2012 forestieri et al 2016 papagiannaki et al 2015 or radar rainfall data that were adjusted based on gauge data vivoni et al 2006 javelle et al 2010 rozalis et al 2010 fouchier et al 2015 lau et al 2015 we applied an algorithm of merging radar and gauge rainfall data to obtain the radar gauge composite data for flood analysis the composite data has 1 1 km spatial and 10 min temporal resolution analyzed result from the composite data was validated to be more accurate compared to that from the radar only or gauge only rainfall for most of the time steps during the study period we also used the high resolution gis data of the flooded area the data were obtained from an extensive field observation campaign driven by a korean governmental agency that performed the recovery actions so it has a building scale spatial resolution and is very accurate second the quantity of the data adds a unique value to this study the data of rainfall and flooded area were recorded for all 239 watersheds of seoul with various area ranging between 0 5 and 6 8 km2 for 2010 and 2011 meaning a total of 478 239 watersheds 2 years is available for the rainfall flooded area relationships large quantity of the observation data enabled us to perform a thorough analysis on the fir solely based on observation and not depending on numerical simulation which is usually an essential element of the fir estimation to compensate the shortage of the observed data diakakis 2012 santos et al 2016 third in addition to the investigation on the fir we performed an analysis on the flood inducing runoff firo to incorporate the influence of watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture conditions here the runoff was derived from the rainfall data using the nrcs curve number method to ensure its practical applicability our analyses suggest that the relationship between both fir and firo can be expressed using the power law significant uncertainty residing in this relationship could be further explained by examining the proportion of the flooded area in the watershed and the rainfall temporal variability following this discovery we presented the fir and firo as a function of these two variables then the flood warning system using the newly developed fir and firo was validated for 2013 through 2015 the system using the radar gauge composite rainfall data as its input succeeded in giving flood warnings for almost all flooding events while missing only a few in comparison the system based on radar or gauge only data showed poorer performance than the system using the radar gauge composite data 2 methodology 2 1 study area seoul the capital of south korea was chosen as study area representative of typical urban settings seoul has an area of 605 km2 and the population of 10 3 million fig 1 high proportion of impervious surface 49 and steep slopes of mountainous areas average slope of 8 57 make the chosen area highly susceptible to flash floods and subsequent damages at locations where population is concentrated yoon 2014 fig 1 shows the 239 watersheds in seoul and the rain gauge stations in and nearby this city for last fifty years increase in both annual precipitation and frequency of heavy rainfall have been observed in seoul the average annual rainfall increased from 1 498 mm 1962 1971 to 1 614 mm 2001 2011 lee et al 2016 and the frequency of the heavy rainfall increased by 13 9 percent during the same period seoul metropolitan government 2015 during the period from 1980 to 2015 seoul experienced 7 extreme rainfall events among these this study investigated the rainfall events of 2010 and 2011 which caused significant flood damages across vast part of the city the heavy rainfall event of 2010 september 21st was the most intense precipitation 202 mm of average areal rainfall over 5 2 h recorded since 1908 flood from the event caused financial damage of 42 9 million usd and 17 905 flooded buildings the heavy rainfall event of 2011 july 26 28 had rainfall of 500 mm over 30 5 h causing 16 human casualties and financial damage of 30 7 million usd this single event was accounted for approximately half the damages in korea caused by all natural disasters in 2011 2 2 rainfall data this study used 1 minute gauge rainfall records from 31 precipitation stations located in or at nearby seoul star marks in fig 1 and radar precipitation data provided by the korea meteorological administration kma the radar precipitation data has spatial and temporal resolution of 1 1 km and 10 minute interval respectively the radar rainfall measurement system of kma consists of eight s band and three c band radars to construct the composite field of rainfall the radar data is produced through following four processes suk et al 2013 1 quality control of volumetric reflectivity for each radar the terrain blockages and cones of silence are filled using an interpolation technique nimr 1994 wrc 2010 and a fuzzy logic approach cho et al 2006 ye et al 2015 is used to remove the ground echoes and anomalous propagation in radars 2 the computation of the average areal rain rate based on the ground gauges 3 real time updated every 10 min rainfall estimation by z r relationship minimizing the difference between 10 minute radar reflectivity and ground average areal rain rate based on the window probability matching method wpmm 4 composition of estimated rainfall product from 10 radars overlapped coverage is mosaicked using the algorithm of mohr and vaughan 1979 and lee et al 2010 detailed description about the algorithms of the radar data production is provided by suk et al 2013 and kim et al 2019 the rainfall event of 2010 occurred between 2010 09 21 12 30 and 2010 09 21 17 50 and the rainfall event of 2011 occurred between 2011 07 26 16 00 and 2011 07 28 10 30 fig 2 shows the hyetographs and the accumulated rainfall mass curves for areal average rainfall in seoul fig 2a for the 2010 event and fig 2b for the 2011 event it also shows the hyetographs of areal rainfall for the watersheds with maximum accumulated rainfall for the events of 2010 and 2011 i e fig 2c and d for 2010 and 2011 respectively 2 3 gis data of the flood inundation area this study used the flood inundation area from the gis data corresponding to the rainfall events of 2010 and 2011 fig 3 the data was collected by the metropolitan government of seoul following governmental regulation to develop detailed flood footprint maps within 6 months after an occurrence of the flood disaster guidelines regarding disaster mapping standards ministry of the interior and safety of korea 2017 the observation campaign is performed through direct field visits cctv video investigations and civil complaints from the people whose properties were flooded the gis data has a building scale spatial resolution so it contains specific addresses and properties of the flooded buildings as shown in fig 3 2 4 gis data for the drainage pipe network this study used drainage pipe network from the gis data provided by the metropolitan government of seoul data source https opengov seoul go kr sanction 2175286 this data was used to identify the longest flow path and to calculate the watershed time of concentration fig 3c shows the pipe network of the siwol 3 watershed 2 5 radar gauge composite space time rainfall field this study used the radar gauge composite space time rainfall field to identify the reference rainfall threshold causing flood inundation the composite field was produced using the method of conditional merging ehret 2003 sinclair and pegram 2005 pettazzi et al 2012 kim et al 2016 the conditional merging cm method adjusts the gauge based rainfall field using the information on the rainstorm spatial structure obtained from the radar data this technique has been widely used to obtain the accurate space time field of various environmental variables including rainfall and soil moisture sinclair and pegram 2005 goudenhoofdt and delobbe 2009 berndt et al 2014 jongjin et al 2016 kim et al 2016 rainfall is observed at 31 ground gauges for every minute and fig 4 describes the process of the conditional merging technique applied in this study a one minute gauge rainfall data is accumulated over the 10 minute period to be synchronized with measurement interval of the radar data b ordinary kriging technique is applied to obtain the in situ rainfall field c rainfall is observed using the radar d collect the radar rainfall values at the gauge locations and apply ordinary kriging technique to obtain the radar based rainfall field e calculate the correction field by subtracting the radar based rainfall field d from the original radar field c f the correction field e is added to the in situ rain field b to obtain the composite radar ground rainfall data fig 5a compares the observed rainfall x axis with the in situ based rainfall y axis red triangles and the estimated rainfall from the conditional merging method y axis blue circles for the september 21 2010 at 12 50 pm the values for the y axis were obtained using the leave one out cross validation for this specific time the correlation coefficient corresponding to the conditional merging cm was larger than the one corresponding to the in situ observation although this was not always the case correlation coefficients from the cm method was generally higher fig 5b compares the correlation coefficients of the in situ based rainfall and those of the estimates based on the cm method each point on the scatterplot represents a pair of correlation coefficients gauge on the x axis cm on the y axis for a 10 minute snapshot of the rainfall field data points above the 1 1 line represent the snapshots at which the cm method outperformed the gauge kriging estimates among all 289 10 minute radar precipitation fields considered in this study the cm method showed greater correlation coefficients than the gauge kriging at 225 snapshots i e around 78 percent note that there are many data points on the upper left part of the scatterplot where cm method produced rainfall estimates that are dramatically more accurate than those produced by the gauge kriging method 2 6 time of concentration for the watersheds time of concentration toc is defined as a time required for raindrop to reach the watershed outlet from the furthest point of the watershed therefore rainfall excess accumulated at the watershed outlet should be maximized over the time of concentration we assumed that the flooded area of each watershed which can be considered as the footprint of the flood was caused by accumulated water that is maximized over the watershed toc the following equations from the urban storm drainage criteria manual udfcd 2016 were used to calculate the time of concentration t c t i t t 3 t i 0 395 1 1 c l i s 0 0 33 4 t t l t 60 k s 5 where tc ti tt are the time of concentration min time of overland flow min and time of channelized flow min respectively c and k are the runoff coefficient and the conveyance factor tables 6 2 and 6 4 udfcd 2016 s and li are average slope and length ft of the overland flow s0 and lt are average slope and length of the waterway ft the parameters of s li s0 lt were calculated along the longest flow path the toc calculated this way can incorporate various crucial factors of the flood generation mechanism eqs 4 and 5 inherently reflect the size li and lt pipe network geometric characteristics lt surface roughness c pipe network roughness k and slope s of watershed therefore an accurate estimation of the toc is one of the most important steps of our analysis note that the accurate estimation of toc was possible with an aid of extensive pipe network gis database data source https opengov seoul go kr sanction 2175286 of the study area of which an example is shown in fig 3c fig 6 shows the relationship between watershed area and time of concentration developed for all 239 watersheds it can be seen that the relationship roughly follows the power law 2 7 estimation of the flood inducing rainfall we assumed that the flooded area or the flood footprint was caused by the accumulated rainfall that is maximized over the watershed time of concentration toc this maximum rainfall values were calculated for each of the 239 watersheds and for both 2010 and 2011 rainfall events for this we clipped multi temporal radar gauge composite rainfall fields for each of the 239 watershed polygons fig 7 a and calculated the average areal rainfall of each of the clipped rainfall fields to obtain the time series fig 7b here each 1 km 1 km radar rainfall field thick red lines in fig 7a was further subdivided into a 100 m 100 m grid format thin green lines in fig 7a to reduce the error caused by coarse resolution of the radar rainfall data then we moved the time window with the duration of watershed toc over the time series to obtain the maximum accumulated rainfall note that the measurement interval of rainfall data is 10 min while the watershed toc was calculated to have 1 minute precisions e g 36 min to reduce the error caused by this discrepancy we linearly interpolated the accumulated rainfall as an example if a the watershed time of concentration is 35 min and b the accumulated rainfall values over the period of 30 min and 40 min are 50 mm and 100 mm respectively we derived the value of 75 mm linearly interpolated for 35 min as the accumulated rainfall through this process we obtained 478 239 2 pairs of the toc and maximum accumulated rainfall value next out of these 478 sets we excluded 217 sets corresponding to the watersheds with no flooded area then we investigated the relationship between the rainfall depth and the toc of the remaining i e flooded 261 watersheds note that the accumulated rainfall values derived here are of the spatial average so any result based on these values does not account for the influence of rainfall spatial variability olivera et al 2008 kim et al 2019 we performed an analysis to make sure that the influence of rainfall spatial variability is minimal fig 7 c shows coefficient of variation of pixel rainfall values for the 261 flooded cases the coefficient of variation values varied between 0 and 0 35 and 83 percent of the values were less than 0 05 suggesting that the uncertainty induced by rainfall spatial variability in our analysis would be very low 2 8 consideration of the watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition amc play an important role in flooding mechanism we considered the influence of watershed imperviousness by considering the runoff corresponding to the maximum rainfall estimated as explained in the previous section section 2 6 the runoff was estimated using the nrcs curve number method cn method hereafter young et al 1987 we could not calibrate the cn due to lack of the flow discharge data at the watershed outlet therefore we estimated them as area weighted averages of the cn values inferred from the land cover of the watershed fig 8 shows a the map of land use of seoul data source http www neins go kr b the map of the estimated cn values for each of the watersheds denoted as the values in the parenthesis in the legends of fig 8a and c the histogram of the cn values of all 239 watersheds in seoul the amc was considered by adjusting the cn based on the accumulated precipitation for past 5 days prior to the event using the following formula usda 1986 thresholds to adjust the cn values are shown in table 2 we took the values of the growing season 6 cn i 4 2 c n i i 10 0 058 c n i i c n i i i 23 c n i i 10 0 13 c n i i note that the runoff calculated in this manner does not necessarily reflect the runoff in reality this is because flow data was not observed at the watershed outlet during the study period so the cn values could not be calibrated but were inferred from the land cover property fig 8a in addition the approach of this study did not follow the standard procedure of the cn method in which the target rainfall event from time series is separated however analysis based on this calculated runoff value reduced the uncertainty residing in the fir thus significantly improving the performance of the flood warning system therefore the procedure taken by this study to estimate runoff should be understood as a practical choice to improve the accuracy of the warning system 3 results 3 1 duration versus flood inducing rainfall fig 9 a shows the relationship between the accumulated rainfall depth y axis and the time of concentration x axis at each watershed non flooded watersheds were excluded from the plot meaning the relationship was established for the 261 flooded watersheds over the study period of two years for the scatterplot colors represent the proportions of the flooded areas within the watersheds note that both axes of the plots are on logarithmic scales a clear power law relationship exists between the time of concentration and the accumulated rainfall though significant uncertainty resides as suggested by the r2 value of 0 74 we first assumed that this uncertainty can be explained by examining the flooded area proportion since greater rainfall leads to greater flooded area the color distribution of fig 9a supports this assumption as most blue data points corresponding to the low flooded area are at lower part of the scatterplot and most red points corresponding to the high flooded area are at the upper part note there are several watersheds that do not follow this assumption as represented by green and yellow points on the far upper right side of the plot these watersheds have highest amount of the accumulated rainfalls but the proportion of the flooded area is not the highest this is primarily because these two watersheds are located at outskirt of seoul where a significant portion is comprised of a pervious mountain area delineated by thick lines in fig 1 this suggests that a variable that can consider watershed imperviousness will reduce the uncertainty of the relationship as later discussed in section 3 2 we also assumed that the uncertainty is likewise associated with the temporal variability of the spatially averaged rainfall this is because the rainfall with greater intensity is more likely to generate more runoff given same rainfall depth which may subsequently lead to flooding fig 9b supports this assumption fig 9b is identical to fig 9a but the color distribution of the scatterplot now represents the coefficient of variation of rainfall time series red data points corresponding to the greater coefficient of variation or more intense rainfall are located at the lower part of the scatterplot this means that rainfall events with greater temporal variability requires less amount of total rainfall to cause the flood given similar rainfall duration these results suggest that both the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability must be considered to determine the threshold of a flood inducing rainfall event note that the greater coefficient of variation cv does not always imply more intense rainfall especially when the rainfall event has a small mean value which constitutes the denominator term of the cv calculation however this will be a rare case given that most rainfall events considered for a flood warning will have high mean values 3 2 duration versus flood inducing runoff fig 10 a shows the relationship between the accumulated runoff depth y axis and the time of concentration x axis at each watershed the plot is same as fig 9a except that its y axis shows the runoff depths not the rainfall depths a clear power law relationship exists for the fig 10a as well the r2 value 0 81 of the relationship is greater compared to the case of the rainfall 0 74 fig 9a this indicates that the uncertainty residing in the relationship between the duration of flood inducing rainfall and the rainfall depth can be reduced by considering an additional variable accounting for the watershed imperviousness which in our case is the watershed curve number similar trend was observed regarding the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability red data points corresponding to the greater flooded area were in the upper side of the scatterplot in fig 10a and the red points corresponding to the greater rainfall temporal variability were in the lower side of the plot in fig 10b 3 3 threshold of flood inducing rainfall and runoff sections 3 1 and 3 2 suggest that the watershed flooding is highly influenced by 1 the rainfall temporal variability and 2 the watershed imperviousness in addition we found that 3 greater accumulated rainfall depth is associated with greater flooded area proportion here we want to estimate the threshold of flood inducing rainfall and the runoff values considering all three variables for this we classified the flooded area proportion fp into 6 intervals and the coefficient of variation of rainfall cv into 3 intervals to have a total of 18 intervals in the 2 dimensional space then we established a relationship between the accumulated rainfall y axis and the time of concentration x axis of the watersheds belonging to each of the 18 classified intervals blue points in fig 11 we also established a similar relationship for the runoff to account for the watershed imperviousness red points in fig 11 in fig 11 the degree of scatter of the depth duration relationship is significantly less compared to the ones shown in fig 9 and fig 10 this indicates the significant influence of the two classifying variables on the relationship then we assumed that the minimum of the slopes of straight lines that pass through both the origin and any one of the data points is the intensity of the flood inducing rainfall and the runoff corresponding to the classified ranges of the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability here value of such a slope can be mathematically expressed as follows 6 s m i n y i x i where xi and yi represent the time of concentration t and accumulated rainfall or runoff l observed at the ith watershed and min is the minimum value operator these lines are shown as thick dotted lines for each plot in fig 11 then we obtained a contour map of these slope values in the two dimensional space consisting of the flooded area proportion and the rainfall temporal variability i e coefficient of variation fig 12 a shows this contour map it clearly shows that the flood inducing rainfall intensity decreases as the rainfall temporal variability increases in other words intense rainfall requires less water to cause flooding in addition threshold value increases as flooded area proportion increases fig 12b shows similar map generated for the flood inducing runoff intensity this map shows that the behavior of the flood inducing runoff is smoother compared to the case of the rainfall this is because the runoff value which accounts for the watershed imperviousness and the amc through the curve number is more directly related to the flooding 3 4 algorithm of the flood warning to validate our results we developed a flood warning algorithm as described in fig 13 this algorithm is to be run separately for each watershed and it can be repeated for different watersheds first the algorithm obtains time series of the rainfall on the watershed corresponding to the duration of the watershed time of concentration toc then the average rainfall intensity pave and the coefficient of variation pcv of the rainfall time series are calculated the calculated pave and pcv are then compared with the threshold values shown in fig 12 see the corresponding explanations on fig 13 to decide whether to initiate the warning an algorithm for the runoff based warning is similar the only difference is that the warning is based on the average runoff rave and the coefficient of variation rcv of the runoff that is estimated based on the cn method 3 5 validation of the fir and firo the algorithm shown in fig 13 was applied to all 239 watersheds in seoul for the validation period between 2012 and 2015 during which 21 flood events were recorded note that no gis data were obtained for the flooded areas during this period because damages by the floods during this period were not as significant as in cases of 2010 and 2011 korean government decided to forgo extensive field observation campaigns instead we extensively investigated the news articles available table 3 summarizes the collected information regarding these flood events of which the location and year of occurrence for each event are shown as circles in fig 3 from section 2 3 furthermore we validated for the no flood no warning cases as well for the events of the floods of 2010 2010 09 21 12 30 to 2010 09 21 17 50 and 2011 2011 07 26 16 00 to 2011 07 28 10 30 among the 478 cases considered in this study 239 watersheds 2 years 261 cases were flooded which subsequently means that the remaining 217 cases were not flooded for a non flooded case flood warning should not be initiated otherwise a false alarm will be initiated fig 14 shows results from the validation blue lines represent the contour values corresponding to the dotted lines in fig 12a and b i e they represent the fir and firo that would flood approximately five percent of the watershed coordinates of the markers in the plot represent the average intensity of the accumulated rainfall over the watershed time of concentration y axis and the coefficient of variation x axis blue lines reveal that 1 the average intensity of the rainfall that flooded approximately five percent of the entire watershed can have depth ranging from 38 mm h to 60 mm h and that 2 firo decreases as the temporal variability of the rainfall increases for these plots any point located at the upper side of the blue line represents a rainfall event for which flood warning is initiated in the validation analysis 43 flood warnings have been initiated among which 19 turned out to be actual floods two gray dots below the blue line represent rainfall events that have resulted in flooding yet were missed by the warning system overall the ratios of hit miss and false alarm were 44 2 percent 19 43 100 9 5 percent 2 21 100 and 55 8 percent 24 43 100 respectively the warning system based on the runoff criteria outperformed the one based on the rainfall with the ratios of hit miss and false alarm being 66 7 percent 20 30 100 4 7 percent 1 21 100 and 33 3 percent 10 30 100 respectively this discrepancy is expected because the analysis based on the runoff considers two extra variables that play important roles in the flood generation mechanism watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition the green squares markers in fig 14a and b show the validation for non flooded watersheds during two flood events of 2010 and 2011 out of 217 non flooded cases 211 97 3 percent and 209 96 3 percent cases did not produce any flood warnings using the criteria based on the rainfall and runoff respectively note that this very low false alarm rate was achieved even during two major storm events that flooded more than half the watersheds in seoul suggesting the importance of determining a proper tolerance level of fp 5 percent of fp was used for the analysis with the results shown in fig 14a and b the 24 rainfall based false alarms occurred in the 22 watersheds and 12 of these 22 watersheds were in the forests see fig 8b in these forest watersheds runoff generation mechanisms are more complex than they are in highly urbanized watersheds where most rainfall turns into runoff the complexity may originate from plant interceptions antecedent moisture condition that is affected by plan evapotranspiration and soil types with varying infiltration characteristics that could not be precisely reflected in this study these conditions collectively could make the watersheds more flood resistant especially for the extreme rainfall with great temporal variability fig 14c and d show performance of the flood warning algorithm varying with degree of allowable flooded area proportions in other words flood warning is not initiated if the flooded area is less than the value of the x axis blue red and yellow lines represent the number of warnings hits and misses respectively the plots reveal that as flooded area proportion increases or as the threshold of flood warning is more relaxed numbers of warnings and hits decrease while the number of misses increases the shaded area on the plot representing the number of false warnings decreases as the threshold of flood warning is more relaxed warnings based on the firo outperformed the ones based on the fir across all degrees of warning threshold or allowable flooded area proportions in terms of the ratio of hits misses and false warnings suggesting the importance of accounting for the watershed imperviousness in flood warning algorithm for an urban area determination of appropriate threshold values to give flood warnings has been a great dilemma for many decision makers selection of a small flooded area proportion or a low threshold would minimize the false alarm at the expense of lower hit ratio the opposite case would increase the number of false alarms but the miss ratio would increase for the decision makers fig 14c and d can be used as a quantitative guideline to decide an optimal threshold of the flood warning system 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of the flood warning algorithm to the rainfall errors the flood warning system fig 13 and the validation results fig 14 are based on the observed rainfall data and not on the predicted one given that it takes time for rain to accumulate in the watershed to cause flood and that the system takes only a few seconds to run the proposed warning system will still have the warning lead time corresponding to the watershed time of concentration however it is always safe to give flood warning as early as possible so long as high accuracy of the warning can be guaranteed here we investigated how the flood warning system would perform if the predicted rainfall values were used instead of the observed ones for this we stochastically perturbed every 10 minute rainfall record observed between 2012 and 2015 then we assumed that the perturbed rainfall data is the predicted rainfall data the following equation was used for stochastic perturbation 7 r 1 κ u 0 1 r where r and r represent the perturbed and observed 10 minute rainfall record κ is the degree of perturbation and u 0 1 represents the random number from a uniform distribution ranging between 0 and 1 the value of κ used for the perturbation was 0 02 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 30 the perturbation ratio of 0 02 and 0 2 roughly correspond to the lead time of 5 min and 1 h respectively akbari asanjan 2018 zahraei 2012 though the relationship may vary significantly with different storm types and storm tracking algorithm for each value of κ 100 ensembles of rainfall time series and the corresponding runoff were produced for each watershed based on which flood warning system was run fig 15 shows performance of the flood warning system varying with different degrees of stochastic perturbation the performance of the warning system decreases with an increase in perturbation ratio the performance significantly decreases around the threshold of 10 15 percent perturbation ratio 0 1 κ 0 15 and the hit ratio of the system converges to a value of 0 and when the rainfall data is perturbed by 30 percent κ 0 3 this result suggests that the warning system is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the rainfall input data so the balance between acquiring lead time and accuracy of the flood warning should be precisely maintained with a sufficient consideration on the accuracy of the radar quantitative forecast and storm tracking algorithm that varies with storm types 4 2 performance of the flood warning algorithm based on ground gauge rainfall input data we further investigated how the alert algorithm would perform if different sets of rainfall data were used as inputs fig 16 a and b show the number of warnings blue hits red and misses yellow varying with warning threshold for the cases when a the radar only and b the gauge only rainfall data were used as an input for the warning system here the gauge only rainfall data was produced using ordinary kriging technique these plots suggest that both systems significantly under perform compared with the system based on radar gauge composite rainfall data fig 14c the warning system based on radar only rainfall data gives significantly more warnings than that based on radar gauge composite data 281 versus 142 and gauge only rainfall data 281 versus 167 the system based on radar only data has greater ratio for both misses and false alarms this suggests that the quantitative precipitation estimation of radar rainfall is not accurate especially for high rainfall rate boodoo et al 2015 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 note that the results shown here correspond to the situation in which the gauge rainfall is used as input for the flood warning system but the warning criteria fir and firo of the system was derived from the radar ground composite rainfall we did not consider the situation in which flood warning criteria is also derived from the gauge rainfall this is because we already know that the radar ground composite rainfall is more accurate than the ground rainfall and the flood warning system based only on the ground rainfall would be less accurate as well if validation is performed on this circumstance the source of its uncertainty would be difficult to identify 4 3 influence of the rainfall temporal variability more precise fir and firo can be derived by additionally accounting for the rainfall temporal variability as opposed to the approaches based only on the rainfall intensity here we investigated the influence of the rainfall temporal variability on accuracy of the flood warning system for this we developed and tested a separate flood warning algorithm that is based only on the rainfall intensity but not on its temporal variability in this algorithm a flood warning is initiated if accumulated rainfall over the time of concentration or the corresponding runoff is greater than a given threshold value fig 17 a and b show results of this test based on the temporally averaged a rainfall intensity and b runoff respectively in both plots x axis represents the threshold of the rainfall intensity and the runoff of which the flood warning has been initiated and y axis represents the number of initiated flood warnings large shaded area in both plots suggests that significantly more false warnings were initiated compared to the cases in which rainfall temporal variability was additionally considered fig 14c and d in addition low slopes of the red and yellow lines in fig 17a suggest that the actual flood warning is not as sensitive to the temporally averaged rainfall intensity as we commonly expect 4 4 how much rain does cause how much flood primary purpose of this research was to identify the minimum threshold of rainfall and runoff causing flood for this reason we focused on estimating the minimum possible rainfall intensity and runoff fig 12 varying with rainfall temporal variability and flooded area proportion however it may be also interesting to investigate the general relationship between these variables here we tried to provide an answer to the following classical question of urban hydrology how much rainfall cause how much flood in an urban area fig 18 a shows the relationship between the rainfall intensity x axis and the flooded area proportion y axis the color of the scatter points represents the coefficient of variation of the rainfall as previously discussed rainfall here refers to the portion of rainfall time series during which accumulated rainfall is maximized over the watershed toc a weak power law relationship was identified the plot shows that greater rainfall intensity tends to cause greater floods greater rainfall intensity also tends to be associated with lower temporal variability blue scatters are concentrated on the right side of the plot note that both axes of the plot are in logarithmic scale and the flooded area proportion can vary by several orders of magnitude for a given rainfall intensity implying the difficulty of inferring flood magnitude from rainfall intensity alone fig 18b shows similar relationship but this time the color of the scatters is based on the nrcs curve numbers cn compared to fig 18a the influence of third variable cn is more apparent as suggested by the red and blue scatters in upper and lower parts of the plot respectively we performed the regression analysis to predict the flooded area proportion from the cv and cn but we chose not to present the regression equations here due to high uncertainty residing in them instead the general trend revealed by fig 18b may be used as a rough guideline to predict the magnitude of flood given rainfall intensity and watershed imperviousness 5 conclusion we derived flood inducing rainfall fir and flood inducing runoff firo to be used as the basis of the flood warning initiation in highly urbanized areas our framework has following advantages first it can consider the temporal variability of rainfall and runoff unlike many flood warnings based on temporally averaged single rainfall intensity values our approach derived fir as a function of coefficient variation of the rainfall enhancing the accuracy of the flood warning system second our approach enables the decision makers to find the optimal solution to secure both accuracy and reliability of the flood warning system by giving them an option of selecting different degrees of the allowable flooded area proportion third it allows a simple way to incorporate the influence of watershed imperviousness and antecedent moisture condition for flood warning by suggesting the threshold of the runoff leading to flood the warning system based on runoff significantly outperformed the one based on rainfall values most distinctive characteristics of our approach may be the use of high resolution radar gauge composite rainfall data and the flooded area gis data that enabled the threshold values to be calculated without performing numerical simulations which inevitably entail uncertainties derived from the model parameters and the conceptualization of the reality the validation result of this study suggests that accurate threshold of the flood warning can be derived purely based on the information regarding the rainfall and flooded area we also found the importance of utilizing the radar gauge composite rainfall field for flood warning results using the composite data significantly outperformed that of the system based on either gauge only or radar only data credit authorship

5651,changes in peak magnitude volume frequency and duration of floods obtained from a peak over threshold sampling in 780 unregulated catchments show significant differences between northern and southern australia over 1975 2012 increases of the flood properties are mainly located in northern australia while decreases are mostly in southern australia these changes could be dominated by inter annual and or decadal variability of floods the multidimensional behaviors of flood change across australia can be described by three distinct groups i e no changes increases and decreases in all flood properties showing strong geographic cohesion the geographical consistency between the changing patterns of flood properties and spatial patterns of vapor transport anomalies during the el niño southern oscillation enso positive phase could partly explain the geographic cohesion of flood changes in a warmer future the observed decreases in floods in southern australia are projected to continue with high model agreement while only magnitude and volume of floods in northern australia are projected to increase but with high uncertainties the diametric changes in flood magnitude between northern and southern australia are projected to be more evident in extreme i e 50 year floods than small i e 5 and 20 year floods keywords flooding behaviors flood magnitude flood volume flood frequency flood prediction 1 introduction in australia floods cause more loss of life than any other disasters fitzgerald et al 2010 the economic damage and loss caused by floods are equivalent to more than 400 million per year bureau of meteorology 2009 recently australia has been plagued by a series of extreme floods such as those occurred in 2011 and 1974 which led to economic losses reaching millions of dollars box et al 2013 however the question remains are the characters of flooding truly changing under climate change climate change considerably affects various aspects of the hydrologic cycle allen and ingram 2002 zhang et al 2017 the amplified hydrologic cycle results in more frequent and extreme floods hirabayashi et al 2013 winsemius et al 2016 numerous recent studies have been carried out to explore impacts of climate change on flooding in many parts of the world based on observations and or model simulations such as china e g zhang et al 2014 li et al 2016 the united states e g mallakpour and villarini 2015 archfield et al 2016 europe e g berghuijs et al 2017 blöschl et al 2017 as well as australia halgamuge and nirmalathas 2017 liu and zhang 2017 however studies may draw different and even contradictory conclusions about changes in flooding in the same region mallakpour and villarini 2015 archfield et al 2016 for example mallakpour and villarini 2015 reported cohesively increasing trends in flood frequency over central united states while the trends in the same region detected in archfield et al 2016 were fragmented the reports of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc indicated that there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and or frequency of floods at a global scale ipcc 2013 low confidence in flood changes under global warming is mainly due to limited observations and the complex surface hydrologic processes in regions the sophisticated interactions between climatic e g tropical cyclones organized thunderstorm systems and extratropical systems and anthropogenic factors e g population land use and infrastructure is a major type of the complexity johnson et al 2016 which makes examination of changes in flooding caused by climate change with reasonable accuracy a huge challenge merz et al 2012 the spatial and temporal aspects of flood variability in australia are also connected to the impacts of large scale climate indices several climate indices such as el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod southern annular mode sam and interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo were recognized to have important impacts on climate variability in australia pui et al 2012 min et al 2013 liu et al 2018a linear trends in precipitation during 1981 2014 were largely attributable to enso and iod across australia forootan et al 2016 summer precipitation extremes in eastern australia are associated with sam and this region tends to be wetter and cooler during the positive phase of sam min et al 2013 on a multidecadal timescale compared with the negative phase of ipo the climate in australia tends to be drier during the positive phase of ipo verdon and wyatt 2004 ipo also tends to modulate the relation between enso and australian climate variability king et al 2013 the impacts of iod sam and ipo on climate variability are recognized across australia however enso is identified as the dominant driving factor behind climate variability over australia pui et al 2012 liu et al 2018a analyzed the relations between flood variability and the four climate indices mentioned above and confirmed that australian flood variability is heavily influenced by enso wasko et al 2015 developed the randomized bartlett lewis model considering the impact of enso in the continuous stochastic precipitation simulation in australia and then replicated observed wet spell statistics and catchment antecedent conditions previous studies investigated australian floods caused by climate change usually using annual maximum series ams and without separating the effects of human activities e g rouillard et al 2015 halgamuge and nirmalathas 2017 the ams defined as the largest streamflow occurring in a year only reflects the changes in magnitude of the annual maximum flood if there are several floods in one year only one flood event is considered in ams however in reality it may happen that the highest flow in a year is not extreme enough to be a flood event but it is still considered in ams there may be more than one flood events in a year but only the largest flood can be included in ams additionally the low confidence that climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods is mainly due to a lack of long term records from unmanaged catchments ipcc 2014 therefore in this study flood records of more than 30 years from 780 unregulated catchments across australia are used to investigate changes in peak magnitude volume frequency and duration of flood events across the various physiographic and climate regions of australia a peak over threshold pot sampling method which can break the limitations of ams is used to obtain the four flood characteristics and then to identify distinct groupings of multidimensional flood behaviors to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have used the pot approach to characterize the flood characteristics and examine multivariate flood properties for the widespread unregulated catchments in australia evaluating the changes in multivariate flood properties is beneficial for us to address questions such as whether floods are becoming more frequent longer or larger in current conditions and warmer future 2 data 2 1 observations from the 780 unregulated catchments australia can be classified into six climatic regions i e equatorial tropical subtropical temperate grassland desert liu et al 2018a fig 1 except for the desert areas daily discharge data unit m3 s from 780 unregulated and unimpaired catchments across australia covering the 1975 2012 period were collected from respective state water agencies zhang et al 2013 these 780 catchments were selected from more than 4 000 catchments across australia using four selection criteria 1 the catchment area is greater than 50 km2 2 the stream is unregulated i e not subject to dam or reservoir regulations 3 the catchment is unimpaired i e not subject to major impacts of irrigation and intensive land use and 4 the observed discharge record contains at least 3 652 daily observations equivalent to ten years during 1975 2012 with acceptable data quality according to a consistent national standard missing values in the discharge dataset were filled by the best simulation obtained from three calibrated hydrological models xinanjiang simhyd and awra models zhang and chiew 2009 zhou et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 for each catchment the best model is identified by the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency nse among the three models we extracted the nse value of the optimal model simulations for each catchment and then obtained a series of 780 nse values the 10th 50th and 90th of the 780 nse values are 0 43 0 67 and 0 81 respectively suggesting an acceptable performance of the optimal model simulations liu and zhang 2017 zhang and post 2019 evaluated the ability of hydrological models for gap filling by taking this discharge dataset for experiments indicating that the gap filling of hydrological models is very reasonable and has little impact on discharge trend more details on this dataset can refer to the report of zhang et al 2013 entitled collation of australian modeller s streamflow dataset for 780 unregulated australian catchments in addition to daily discharge data we also collected the catchment information and catchment attributes of these 780 basins including daily precipitation daily evapotranspiration percentage of irrigation land use and intensive land use fig s1 the daily evapotranspiration at a 5 km spatial resolution was estimated using the priestley taylor equation eichinger et al 1996 with inputs of 5 km gridded climate dataset including daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature daily solar radiation and daily vapor pressure the 5 km gridded meteorological data in australia are sourced from silo http www longpaddock qld gov au silo and awap http www bom gov au climate data it is difficult to adequately characterize the catchment precipitation in catchments smaller than about 50 km2 in drainage area using such coarse gridded data the statistical summary of the catchment attributions in each climatic region is shown in table 1 2 2 modeled discharge data in this study the future

the surface and root zone soil moisture in layer depths of 0 0 1 m and 0 1 m respectively are chosen to analyze changes in basin wetness across australia 3 methods 3 1 pot sampling we use the pot approach to sample flood and heavy precipitation events from water year time series i e july june in the next year the definitions of magnitude volume duration and frequency of floods obtained from pot are shown in fig s3 a threshold in pot is selected so that two events per year on average can be sampled from the daily records the spatial patterns of thresholds in annual flood events are comparable with those of heavy precipitation events fig s4 the independence of flood events is evaluated by lang et al 1999 1 d 5 log a q min 3 4 min q 1 q 2 where d denotes the waiting time between two flood peaks a denotes the drainage area in mile2 and q 1 and q 2 denote the magnitudes of the two flood peaks in m3 s the mann kendall test is used to detect changes of multivariate properties in floods and heavy precipitation mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 2 impacts of enso on floods changes in floods are linked to large scale climate variability mallakpour and villarini 2016 gu et al 2017 the large scale climate variability is often represented by climate indices such as enso iod sam and ipo which have been proven to have noticeable impacts on flood variability across australia e g johnson et al 2016 liu et al 2018a we calculate the correlation between flood events and the climate index such as enso in this study each flood event obtained from pot sampling is described by magnitude duration and volume the month and year of the peak discharge of each flood event were used to match the month and year of monthly enso values resulting in a same length of coincident enso data the spearman method is used to compute the correlations between flood events i e magnitude volume and duration and the coincident enso values among the four climate indices the enso index is significantly correlated with pot flood series at the largest number of the stations fig s5 therefore we investigate the impacts of enso by quantifying the difference in flood magnitude volume frequency and duration between extreme positive and negative enso phases student t test is used to test whether there is a significant difference at the 0 05 significance level we also employ the 850 hpa wind field and compute the integrated vapor transport ivt to explain the relationship between flood events and enso ivt unit kg m s is a quantity that describes the total amount of transported water vapor to a location and is calculated by integrating specific humidity zonal and meridional winds across different atmospheric levels based on ncep ncar reanalysis dataset mallakpour and villarini 2016 nayak et

frequency and duration of floods in each grid are estimated based on pot during 1971 2100 the averages of these values during 1976 2005 and 2070 2099 are defined as q 20c and q 21c respectively the normalized change is calculated as asadieh and krakauer 2017 3 δ q q 21 c q 20 c q 21 c q 20 c where δ q ranges between 1 and 1 δ q values greater smaller than 0 indicate increases decreases in flood properties in warmer future 4 results 4 1 changes in the observed flood properties fig 2 shows the spatial patterns of changes in flood properties across australia most of catchments show no changes in all flood properties except for duration and the percentages of no changes are 82 8 for magnitude 81 9 for volume 79 1 for frequency and 26 8 for duration the catchments with increases in flood properties are mainly in northern australia especially for the duration in the equatorial and tropical areas figs 1 and 2 increases in heavy precipitation properties are also found in this region fig 4 in contrast decreases in flood properties are observed in the catchments mainly located in southern australia especially the temperate areas while we do not observe decreases in any heavy precipitation properties in this region fig 4 the possible reasons behind this inconsistency in changes between floods and heavy precipitation in southern australia are discussed in next paragraphs we further evaluate the temporal variability in regional averages of flood events in the equatorial and tropical areas northern australia and temperate areas southern australia respectively fig 2 the diametric changes i e all flood properties increase in northern australia but decrease in southern australia are more evident a stronger tendency towards increases in the flood volume and duration are apparent 129 m3 year for volume and 0 56 day year for duration both reach the 0 05 significance level in northern australia we also observe the decreases in all flood properties in particular frequency and duration with slopes of 0 02 event year and 0 21 day year respectively both reach the 0 05 significance level in temperate areas significant decreases in flood magnitudes were also found by ishak et al 2013 and ishak and rahman 2015 in this region to explore the potential spatial similarities of the changes in flood properties the patterns of increases or decreases in the magnitude volume frequency and volume of floods can be classified into three distinct groups all flood properties show no nc no change increasing ai all increasing and decreasing ad all decreasing changes fig 3 the three groups are classed using a hierarchal agglomerative clustering approach tan et al 2006 olden et al 2012 based on the four at site kendall tau values helsel and hirsch 2002 which measure changes in the magnitude volume frequency and duration of flood events fig s6 the kendall tau values are calculated by the correlations between time and the flood properties and negative ones indicate decreases in the flood properties and vice versa the agglomerative coefficient which is used to measure the clustering structure is 0 9949 the maximum is 1 in this clustering indicating the grouping is reasonable there is an apparent lack of geographic cohesion within nc group which contains 35 1 of the catchments these catchments in nc group scatter across australia fig 3a the nc group shows a tendency toward decreases in all flood properties as shown by the negative medians of kendall tau values although very few of them are statistically significant 19 7 of the catchments are classed into ai group and most of these catchments are in northern australia except for the frequency of flood events the kendall tau values of the other flood properties of more than 50 of the catchments are greater than 0 15 i e the 0 1 significance level fig 3b the ad group has the largest number of catchments i e 45 1 among the three groups and exhibits the strongest geographic cohesion the ad catchments almost only occur in southern australia fig 3c widespread decreases in magnitude volume frequency and duration of flood events in ad group are observed as more than 50 of the catchments in this group have negative kendall tau values smaller than 0 15 in all flood properties the catchment based and regional changes in each flood property are consistent with the results of cluster analyses based on multidimensional nature of these changes these results affirm the diametric changes in unregulated floods in northern australia and southern australia in northern australia changes between flood properties and heavy precipitation are highly consistent figs 2 and 4 heavy precipitation increases significantly by 0 05 mm year for magnitude 5 19 mm year for volume 0 07 event year for frequency and 0 11 day year for duration fig 4 the climate variations like wet and dry spells characterized as averaged and maximum lengths are stable in time in most of basins in northern australia and this is also the case for their regional averages in this region fig 5 these results imply that heavy precipitation events play a major role in flood generating processes in northern australia increases in heavy precipitation may be not enough to explain the increasing flooding in northern australia because the response of floods to heavy precipitation depends on antecedent hydrologic conditions and wetness state of the catchment sharma et al 2018 90 day and 180 day antecedent water storage defined by the amounts of precipitation minus evapotranspiration prior to the flood event are calculated to analyze changes in antecedent hydrologic conditions fig 6 a and b both the 90 day and 180 day antecedent water storage show increases in the basins in northern australia indicating that a wetness antecedent condition exists ahead the flooding the percentage of heavy precipitation events leading to flooding will be largely amplified if the precipitation is conditioned on the catchment being wet before the start of the flood event ivancic and shaw 2015 changes in soil moisture can reflect the wetness state of the catchment fig 6c and d a tendency towards increases is observed in both surface and root zone soil moisture in northern australia suggesting that basin hydrologic condition is also being wetting in this region clearly wetting soil moisture conditions will promote the translation from heavy precipitation to flooding in northern australia in northern australia an arid region the dominant flood generating mechanism is the infiltration excess johnson et al 2016 in this generating mechanism flooding is likely to occur in the situation where the instantaneous precipitation intensity is remarkably higher than the soil hydraulic conductivity mirus and loague 2013 tropical cyclones villarini and denniston 2016 nott 2018 and australian monsoon callaghan and power 2014 bring abundant water vapor that can produce heavy precipitation in a short period and then trigger flooding in northern australia we can conclude that the increases of flood events in northern australia can be largely attributed to the increasing heavy precipitation conditioned antecedent catchment wetness and wetting soil moisture in southern australia the significant decreases in flood properties cannot be attributed to the slight increases in heavy precipitation figs 2 and 4 for most of catchments in southern australia the dominant flood generating mechanism is the saturation excess where soil moisture dependent precipitation excess plays a more important role in controlling flooding trancoso et al 2016 a significantly decreasing trend is observed in both averaged length and maximum length of wet spell in southern australia fig 5c and d suggesting that the climate becomes drying the drying climate was lengthened and amplified in the hydrological drought during the period of 1997 2009 southeastern australia experienced a record breaking drought known as the millennium drought 1997 2009 yang et al 2017 comparing the period of the millennium drought with pre drought period the average precipitation in southeastern australia decreased by 13 which resulted in about 45 decline in streamflow van dijk et al 2013 the drying climate is also confirmed by the obvious decreases in the 90 day and 180 day antecedent water storage prior to the flood event in southern australia fig 6a and b when the antecedent catchment wetness is declining the percentage of heavy precipitation events leading to flooding will be substantially reduced ivancic and shaw 2015 surface soil moisture drying also exists in southern australia and it is more prominent in root zone soil moisture fig 6c and d the drying soil moisture infiltrates a larger portion of runoff into the soil and then reduces flood magnitude volume and duration in southern australia 4 2 relation of spatial patterns in flood temporal variability to enso although the diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia are detected out these changes may be plausible and not secular due to the relative short record i e only 37 years for example the magnitude of australian floods in tropical areas indicates an obviously declining trend during 1975 to around 1990 while a significantly increasing phase is around 1990 to 1998 fig 2a flood duration shows decrease during 1975 1990 and increase during 1990 2012 in northern australia the change shift in some flood properties may be associated with the large variability of floods it can be seen in fig 2 that the changes in regional averages of floods are dominated by inter annual and or decadal variability here our hypothesis is that the temporal variability in floods is related to the variability in the climate system which can be reflected by the large scale climate index i e enso in this study ward et al 2014 liu et al 2018a the cross correlations between 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 month lags between flood event and the preceding n month enso value where n 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 are conducted how to match of flood event and monthly enso values can refer to section 3 2 the fractions of significant correlations with lag 0 and lag 1 enso are maximum among these lags i e 16 9 and 20 8 for magnitude 19 4 and 22 7 for volume and 23 3 and 22 1 for duration respectively fig 7 when the lag is more than 6 months the fraction of significant correlation is down to a low percentage therefore we show the difference in the four flood properties between extreme positive and negative lag 0 and lag 6 enso phases fig 8 most of significant differences in the four flood properties between extreme positive and negative enso phases are positive and their spatial patterns are almost consistent between lag 0 and lag 6 the catchments with positive differences are mainly in northern australia and east northern australia and this is the case particularly for duration and frequency previous studies have detected tight relations between enso and precipitation extremes in the two areas of northern australia where consistent increases in both floods and heavy precipitation are also observed fig 2 in southern australia especially its southeast part there is little evidence to suggest strong relations between enso values and flood properties in most catchments the inconsistent changes between heavy precipitation and floods in southern australia fig 2 imply a weak correlation between enso and floods in this region the consistent changes of floods in northern australia show geographic cohesion especially for duration figs 2 and 3 which could be partly demonstrated by the consistent positive relations between floods and enso in this region the composite ivt anomaly and wind anomaly during the extreme enso positive phase are used to explain the physical mechanisms responsible for the relationships of flood properties with enso fig 9 during the extreme enso positive phrase the positive vapor transport anomalies over the equatorial and tropical australia are observed suggesting strengthened moisture transport in these regions on the other hand the negative vapor transport anomalies in the temperate areas indicate weakened moisture transport the spatial patterns of vapor transport anomalies composited in enso positive phrase are highly consistent with the geographic cohesion of flood changes i e diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia figs 2 and 3 here we must note that this consensus in spatial patterns can not fully explain the geographic cohesion due to around 80 of catchments show no differences during the extreme positive and negative enso phases fig 8 nevertheless the diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia related to inter annual variability are partly linked to the effects of enso 4 3 projected changes of floods in a multi model framework we detected discrepancies of changes in observed floods between northern and southern australia under climate change the next question to address is then would the diametric changes continue in a warmer future the 40 combinations of hms and gcms are employed to simulate floods over the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 precipitation temperature and other weather variables from gcms under historical and the two rcp scenarios are employed to drive the hms to simulate the impacts of different global warming levels on floods human activities such as population gdp irrigation and land use land cover are not considered in the simulations the quantile quantile plots of simulated and observed flood peaks in the four selected catchments show that the multi model ensemble means of the 40 combinations of hms and gcms performs reasonably to represent flood conditions fig 10 in a warmer climate under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 more than 60 of the 40 models agree the decreases in all flood properties in southern australia figs 11 and 12 where the decreasing flood risk was also projected by previous studies winsemius et al 2016 asadieh and krakauer 2017 the decreases are more intense during 2070 2099 under rcp8 5 representative of a 4 c warmer world compared to the pre industrial era than under rcp2 6 a 2 c warmer world we also observe increases in magnitude and volume of flood events in central northern australia but with high uncertainties the regional averages in flood magnitude and volume anomalies of multimodel ensemble means during 1970 2099 relative to 1976 2005 show increases in northern australia but decreases in southern australia under rcp8 5 fig 12 projected changes in flood magnitudes of the 5 20 30 and 50 year return periods this event on average would occur in n year are also evaluated fig s7 it is more evidence that the flood magnitudes are projected to increase in northern australia more than 60 of models agree the increases more than 50 fig s7 which is in line with that in hirabayashi et al 2013 the areas with increases in flood magnitudes are expected to be larger in floods with higher return levels e g 50 year and warmer climates e g rcp8 5 5 discussion and conclusions we highlight strong differences of changes in unregulated flood properties across australia i e increases in northern australia and decreases in southern australia though the changes during 1975 2012 are not evidently visible in terms of the number of unregulated catchments with 0 05 significance level the changes of regional averages of flood properties are mostly significant and prominent increases of flood events in northern australia are attributable to the increasing heavy precipitation conditioned antecedent catchment wetness and wetting soil moisture while the drying catchment wetness state and climate lead to the decreases of flooding in southern australia it should be noted that these changes in floods may be plausible and not secular due to the relative short record and could be dominated by inter annual and or decadal variability we future analyze the relations between the temporal variability in floods and the variability in the climate system i e enso in this study positive differences in flooding between extreme positive and negative enso phases are mainly in northern australia which shows consistent increases in both floods and heavy precipitation while there is little evidence to suggest strong relations between enso values and flood properties in most catchments of southern australia the geographical consistency between the changing patterns of flood properties and spatial patterns of vapor transport anomalies could partly explain the geographic cohesion of flood changes i e diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia finally we explore whether the diametric changes in floods would be continue in the future the observed decreases in floods in southern australia are projected to continue with high model agreement under a warmer climate while only magnitude and volume of floods in northern australia are projected to increase but with low model agreement compared to rcp2 6 under rcp8 5 representative of a 4 c warmer world compared to the pre industrial era this feature decreases in southern australia and increases in flood magnitude and volume in northern australia would be more pronounced we also noted that the diametric changes of flood magnitude between northern and southern australia are projected to be more evident in extreme i e 50 year floods than small i e 5 and 20 year floods our findings are critical to improve the understanding of the changing nature of flooding across australia and can be assessed and communicated from a practical standpoint in terms of the local threat to people and assets it should be also noted the large uncertainties in simulated flood events in individual models fig 10 hydrologic regimes are usually better monitored in larger rivers in terms of drainage basin area and flood magnitude the flood magnitude in larger rivers is greater enough relative to mitigate the impacts of the systematical biases and errors in hms and gcms li et al 2016 in isi mip hms are large scale land surface models driven by the outputs of gcms with coarse spatial resolution which leads to higher uncertainties in small basins with relatively low river discharge in southern australia fig s1 additionally teng et al 2012 employed five rainfall runoff models and 15 gcms to simulate the runoff in southeast australia and pointed out that the uncertainty sourced from gcms is much larger than the uncertainty in the rainfall runoff models natural variability response uncertainty and scenario uncertainty are the three sources of uncertainty in gcms projecting climate change in the future hawkins and sutton 2009 woldemeskel et al 2016 although the total uncertainty of cmip5 precipitation is visibly reduced due to a number of advances relative to cmip3 the precipitation uncertainty is found to be larger in regions where heavy precipitation exists woldemeskel et al 2016 the cmip5 gcm outputs are bias corrected in isi mip although the bias correction may add extra uncertainty to the projections it can substantially improve the representation of precipitation properties nguyen et al 2017 additionally low frequency variability in gcm simulations is better represented after bias correction rocheta et al 2014 2017 and this improvement in low frequency variability is important for most hydrological studies where the effect of low frequency variability is of considerable importance nguyen et al 2017 another major limitation of this study is that the changes in vegetation due to changing climate and hydrologic conditions are not taken into consideration in the hms variations in vegetation distribution also have consider impacts on streamflow liu et al 2018b 2019 especially for the flood generating processes in australian temperate areas zhang et al 2011 declaration of competing

5651,changes in peak magnitude volume frequency and duration of floods obtained from a peak over threshold sampling in 780 unregulated catchments show significant differences between northern and southern australia over 1975 2012 increases of the flood properties are mainly located in northern australia while decreases are mostly in southern australia these changes could be dominated by inter annual and or decadal variability of floods the multidimensional behaviors of flood change across australia can be described by three distinct groups i e no changes increases and decreases in all flood properties showing strong geographic cohesion the geographical consistency between the changing patterns of flood properties and spatial patterns of vapor transport anomalies during the el niño southern oscillation enso positive phase could partly explain the geographic cohesion of flood changes in a warmer future the observed decreases in floods in southern australia are projected to continue with high model agreement while only magnitude and volume of floods in northern australia are projected to increase but with high uncertainties the diametric changes in flood magnitude between northern and southern australia are projected to be more evident in extreme i e 50 year floods than small i e 5 and 20 year floods keywords flooding behaviors flood magnitude flood volume flood frequency flood prediction 1 introduction in australia floods cause more loss of life than any other disasters fitzgerald et al 2010 the economic damage and loss caused by floods are equivalent to more than 400 million per year bureau of meteorology 2009 recently australia has been plagued by a series of extreme floods such as those occurred in 2011 and 1974 which led to economic losses reaching millions of dollars box et al 2013 however the question remains are the characters of flooding truly changing under climate change climate change considerably affects various aspects of the hydrologic cycle allen and ingram 2002 zhang et al 2017 the amplified hydrologic cycle results in more frequent and extreme floods hirabayashi et al 2013 winsemius et al 2016 numerous recent studies have been carried out to explore impacts of climate change on flooding in many parts of the world based on observations and or model simulations such as china e g zhang et al 2014 li et al 2016 the united states e g mallakpour and villarini 2015 archfield et al 2016 europe e g berghuijs et al 2017 blöschl et al 2017 as well as australia halgamuge and nirmalathas 2017 liu and zhang 2017 however studies may draw different and even contradictory conclusions about changes in flooding in the same region mallakpour and villarini 2015 archfield et al 2016 for example mallakpour and villarini 2015 reported cohesively increasing trends in flood frequency over central united states while the trends in the same region detected in archfield et al 2016 were fragmented the reports of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc indicated that there continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and or frequency of floods at a global scale ipcc 2013 low confidence in flood changes under global warming is mainly due to limited observations and the complex surface hydrologic processes in regions the sophisticated interactions between climatic e g tropical cyclones organized thunderstorm systems and extratropical systems and anthropogenic factors e g population land use and infrastructure is a major type of the complexity johnson et al 2016 which makes examination of changes in flooding caused by climate change with reasonable accuracy a huge challenge merz et al 2012 the spatial and temporal aspects of flood variability in australia are also connected to the impacts of large scale climate indices several climate indices such as el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod southern annular mode sam and interdecadal pacific oscillation ipo were recognized to have important impacts on climate variability in australia pui et al 2012 min et al 2013 liu et al 2018a linear trends in precipitation during 1981 2014 were largely attributable to enso and iod across australia forootan et al 2016 summer precipitation extremes in eastern australia are associated with sam and this region tends to be wetter and cooler during the positive phase of sam min et al 2013 on a multidecadal timescale compared with the negative phase of ipo the climate in australia tends to be drier during the positive phase of ipo verdon and wyatt 2004 ipo also tends to modulate the relation between enso and australian climate variability king et al 2013 the impacts of iod sam and ipo on climate variability are recognized across australia however enso is identified as the dominant driving factor behind climate variability over australia pui et al 2012 liu et al 2018a analyzed the relations between flood variability and the four climate indices mentioned above and confirmed that australian flood variability is heavily influenced by enso wasko et al 2015 developed the randomized bartlett lewis model considering the impact of enso in the continuous stochastic precipitation simulation in australia and then replicated observed wet spell statistics and catchment antecedent conditions previous studies investigated australian floods caused by climate change usually using annual maximum series ams and without separating the effects of human activities e g rouillard et al 2015 halgamuge and nirmalathas 2017 the ams defined as the largest streamflow occurring in a year only reflects the changes in magnitude of the annual maximum flood if there are several floods in one year only one flood event is considered in ams however in reality it may happen that the highest flow in a year is not extreme enough to be a flood event but it is still considered in ams there may be more than one flood events in a year but only the largest flood can be included in ams additionally the low confidence that climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude of fluvial floods is mainly due to a lack of long term records from unmanaged catchments ipcc 2014 therefore in this study flood records of more than 30 years from 780 unregulated catchments across australia are used to investigate changes in peak magnitude volume frequency and duration of flood events across the various physiographic and climate regions of australia a peak over threshold pot sampling method which can break the limitations of ams is used to obtain the four flood characteristics and then to identify distinct groupings of multidimensional flood behaviors to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have used the pot approach to characterize the flood characteristics and examine multivariate flood properties for the widespread unregulated catchments in australia evaluating the changes in multivariate flood properties is beneficial for us to address questions such as whether floods are becoming more frequent longer or larger in current conditions and warmer future 2 data 2 1 observations from the 780 unregulated catchments australia can be classified into six climatic regions i e equatorial tropical subtropical temperate grassland desert liu et al 2018a fig 1 except for the desert areas daily discharge data unit m3 s from 780 unregulated and unimpaired catchments across australia covering the 1975 2012 period were collected from respective state water agencies zhang et al 2013 these 780 catchments were selected from more than 4 000 catchments across australia using four selection criteria 1 the catchment area is greater than 50 km2 2 the stream is unregulated i e not subject to dam or reservoir regulations 3 the catchment is unimpaired i e not subject to major impacts of irrigation and intensive land use and 4 the observed discharge record contains at least 3 652 daily observations equivalent to ten years during 1975 2012 with acceptable data quality according to a consistent national standard missing values in the discharge dataset were filled by the best simulation obtained from three calibrated hydrological models xinanjiang simhyd and awra models zhang and chiew 2009 zhou et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 for each catchment the best model is identified by the highest nash sutcliffe efficiency nse among the three models we extracted the nse value of the optimal model simulations for each catchment and then obtained a series of 780 nse values the 10th 50th and 90th of the 780 nse values are 0 43 0 67 and 0 81 respectively suggesting an acceptable performance of the optimal model simulations liu and zhang 2017 zhang and post 2019 evaluated the ability of hydrological models for gap filling by taking this discharge dataset for experiments indicating that the gap filling of hydrological models is very reasonable and has little impact on discharge trend more details on this dataset can refer to the report of zhang et al 2013 entitled collation of australian modeller s streamflow dataset for 780 unregulated australian catchments in addition to daily discharge data we also collected the catchment information and catchment attributes of these 780 basins including daily precipitation daily evapotranspiration percentage of irrigation land use and intensive land use fig s1 the daily evapotranspiration at a 5 km spatial resolution was estimated using the priestley taylor equation eichinger et al 1996 with inputs of 5 km gridded climate dataset including daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature daily solar radiation and daily vapor pressure the 5 km gridded meteorological data in australia are sourced from silo http www longpaddock qld gov au silo and awap http www bom gov au climate data it is difficult to adequately characterize the catchment precipitation in catchments smaller than about 50 km2 in drainage area using such coarse gridded data the statistical summary of the catchment attributions in each climatic region is shown in table 1 2 2 modeled discharge data in this study the future changes of floods were also evaluated using simulated daily discharges from eight hydrological models hms forced by five coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 global climate models gcms

coarse resolutions of the gcm outputs they are bias corrected into a uniform 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution by a statistical method in isi mip hempel et al 2013 this bias correction ensures the long term

the surface and root zone soil moisture in layer depths of 0 0 1 m and 0 1 m respectively are chosen to analyze changes in basin wetness across australia 3 methods 3 1 pot sampling we use the pot approach to sample flood and heavy precipitation events from water year time series i e july june in the next year the definitions of magnitude volume duration and frequency of floods obtained from pot are shown in fig s3 a threshold in pot is selected so that two events per year on average can be sampled from the daily records the spatial patterns of thresholds in annual flood events are comparable with those of heavy precipitation events fig s4 the independence of flood events is evaluated by lang et al 1999 1 d 5 log a q min 3 4 min q 1 q 2 where d denotes the waiting time between two flood peaks a denotes the drainage area in mile2 and q 1 and q 2 denote the magnitudes of the two flood peaks in m3 s the mann kendall test is used to detect changes of multivariate properties in floods and heavy precipitation mann 1945 kendall 1975 3 2 impacts of enso on floods changes in floods are linked to large scale climate variability mallakpour and villarini 2016 gu et al 2017 the large scale climate variability is often represented by climate indices such as enso iod sam and ipo which have been proven to have noticeable impacts on flood variability across australia e g johnson et al 2016 liu et al 2018a we calculate the correlation between flood events and the climate index such as enso in this study each flood event obtained from pot sampling is described by magnitude duration and volume the month and year of the peak discharge of each flood event were used to match the month and year of monthly enso values resulting in a same length of coincident enso data the spearman method is used to compute the correlations between flood events i e magnitude volume and duration and the coincident enso values among the four climate indices the enso index is significantly correlated with pot flood series at the largest number of the stations fig s5 therefore we investigate the impacts of enso by quantifying the difference in flood magnitude volume frequency and duration between extreme positive and negative enso phases student t test is used to test whether there is a significant difference at the 0 05 significance level we also employ the 850 hpa wind field and compute the integrated vapor transport ivt to explain the relationship between flood events and enso ivt unit kg m s is a quantity that describes the total amount of transported water vapor to a location and is calculated by integrating specific humidity zonal and meridional winds across different atmospheric levels based on ncep ncar reanalysis dataset mallakpour and villarini 2016 nayak et al 2016 2 ivt 1 g surface 300 qudp 2 1 g surface 300 qvdp 2 where q u and v are specific humidity kg kg and zonal and meridional wind components m s respectively g is the acceleration due to gravity m s2 and p is pressure 3 3 normalized changes in projected floods the future changes in floods are evaluated by the normalized changes of isi mip simulations under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the magnitude volume frequency and duration of floods in each grid are estimated based on pot during 1971 2100 the averages of these values during 1976 2005 and 2070 2099 are defined as q 20c and q 21c respectively the normalized change is calculated as asadieh and krakauer 2017 3 δ q q 21 c q 20 c q 21 c q 20 c where δ q ranges between 1 and 1 δ q values greater smaller than 0 indicate increases decreases in flood properties in warmer future 4 results 4 1 changes in the observed flood properties fig 2 shows the spatial patterns of changes in flood properties across australia most of catchments show no changes in all flood properties except for duration and the percentages of no changes are 82 8 for magnitude 81 9 for volume 79 1 for frequency and 26 8 for duration the catchments with increases in flood properties are mainly in northern australia especially for the duration in the equatorial and tropical areas figs 1 and 2 increases in heavy precipitation properties are also found in this region fig 4 in contrast decreases in flood properties are observed in the catchments mainly located in southern australia especially the temperate areas while we do not observe decreases in any heavy precipitation properties in this region fig 4 the possible reasons behind this inconsistency in changes between floods and heavy precipitation in southern australia are discussed in next paragraphs we further evaluate the temporal variability in regional averages of flood events in the equatorial and tropical areas northern australia and temperate areas southern australia respectively fig 2 the diametric changes i e all flood properties increase in northern australia but decrease in southern australia are more evident a stronger tendency towards increases in the flood volume and duration are apparent 129 m3 year for volume and 0 56 day year for duration both reach the 0 05 significance level in northern australia we also observe the decreases in all flood properties in particular frequency and duration with slopes of 0 02 event year and 0 21 day year respectively both reach the 0 05 significance level in temperate areas significant decreases in flood magnitudes were also found by ishak et al 2013 and ishak and rahman 2015 in this region to explore the potential spatial similarities of the changes in flood properties the patterns of increases or decreases in the magnitude volume frequency and volume of floods can be classified into three distinct groups all flood properties show no nc no change increasing ai all increasing and decreasing ad all decreasing changes fig 3 the three groups are classed using a hierarchal agglomerative clustering approach tan et al 2006 olden et al 2012 based on the four at site kendall tau values helsel and hirsch 2002 which measure changes in the magnitude volume frequency and duration of flood events fig s6 the kendall tau values are calculated by the correlations between time and the flood properties and negative ones indicate decreases in the flood properties and vice versa the agglomerative coefficient which is used to measure the clustering structure is 0 9949 the maximum is 1 in this clustering indicating the grouping is reasonable there is an apparent lack of geographic cohesion within nc group which contains 35 1 of the catchments these catchments in nc group scatter across australia fig 3a the nc group shows a tendency toward decreases in all flood properties as shown by the negative medians of kendall tau values although very few of them are statistically significant 19 7 of the catchments are classed into ai group and most of these catchments are in northern australia except for the frequency of flood events the kendall tau values of the other flood properties of more than 50 of the catchments are greater than 0 15 i e the 0 1 significance level fig 3b the ad group has the largest number of catchments i e 45 1 among the three groups and exhibits the strongest geographic cohesion the ad catchments almost only occur in southern australia fig 3c widespread decreases in magnitude volume frequency and duration of flood events in ad group are observed as more than 50 of the catchments in this group have negative kendall tau values smaller than 0 15 in all flood properties the catchment based and regional changes in each flood property are consistent with the results of cluster analyses based on multidimensional nature of these changes these results affirm the diametric changes in unregulated floods in northern australia and southern australia in northern australia changes between flood properties and heavy precipitation are highly consistent figs 2 and 4 heavy precipitation increases significantly by 0 05 mm year for magnitude 5 19 mm year for volume 0 07 event year for frequency and 0 11 day year for duration fig 4 the climate variations like wet and dry spells characterized as averaged and maximum lengths are stable in time in most of basins in northern australia and this is also the case for their regional averages in this region fig 5 these results imply that heavy precipitation events play a major role in flood generating processes in northern australia increases in heavy precipitation may be not enough to explain the increasing flooding in northern australia because the response of floods to heavy precipitation depends on antecedent hydrologic conditions and wetness state of the catchment sharma et al 2018 90 day and 180 day antecedent water storage defined by the amounts of precipitation minus evapotranspiration prior to the flood event are calculated to analyze changes in antecedent hydrologic conditions fig 6 a and b both the 90 day and 180 day antecedent water storage show increases in the basins in northern australia indicating that a wetness antecedent condition exists ahead the flooding the percentage of heavy precipitation events leading to flooding will be largely amplified if the precipitation is conditioned on the catchment being wet before the start of the flood event ivancic and shaw 2015 changes in soil moisture can reflect the wetness state of the catchment fig 6c and d a tendency towards increases is observed in both surface and root zone soil moisture in northern australia suggesting that basin hydrologic condition is also being wetting in this region clearly wetting soil moisture conditions will promote the translation from heavy precipitation to flooding in northern australia in northern australia an arid region the dominant flood generating mechanism is the infiltration excess johnson et al 2016 in this generating mechanism flooding is likely to occur in the situation where the instantaneous precipitation intensity is remarkably higher than the soil hydraulic conductivity mirus and loague 2013 tropical cyclones villarini and denniston 2016 nott 2018 and australian monsoon callaghan and power 2014 bring abundant water vapor that can produce heavy precipitation in a short period and then trigger flooding in northern australia we can conclude that the increases of flood events in northern australia can be largely attributed to the increasing heavy precipitation conditioned antecedent catchment wetness and wetting soil moisture in southern australia the significant decreases in flood properties cannot be attributed to the slight increases in heavy precipitation figs 2 and 4 for most of catchments in southern australia the dominant flood generating mechanism is the saturation excess where soil moisture dependent precipitation excess plays a more important role in controlling flooding trancoso et al 2016 a significantly decreasing trend is observed in both averaged length and maximum length of wet spell in southern australia fig 5c and d suggesting that the climate becomes drying the drying climate was lengthened and amplified in the hydrological drought during the period of 1997 2009 southeastern australia experienced a record breaking drought known as the millennium drought 1997 2009 yang et al 2017 comparing the period of the millennium drought with pre drought period the average precipitation in southeastern australia decreased by 13 which resulted in about 45 decline in streamflow van dijk et al 2013 the drying climate is also confirmed by the obvious decreases in the 90 day and 180 day antecedent water storage prior to the flood event in southern australia fig 6a and b when the antecedent catchment wetness is declining the percentage of heavy precipitation events leading to flooding will be substantially reduced ivancic and shaw 2015 surface soil moisture drying also exists in southern australia and it is more prominent in root zone soil moisture fig 6c and d the drying soil moisture infiltrates a larger portion of runoff into the soil and then reduces flood magnitude volume and duration in southern australia 4 2 relation of spatial patterns in flood temporal variability to enso although the diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia are detected out these changes may be plausible and not secular due to the relative short record i e only 37 years for example the magnitude of australian floods in tropical areas indicates an obviously declining trend during 1975 to around 1990 while a significantly increasing phase is around 1990 to 1998 fig 2a flood duration shows decrease during 1975 1990 and increase during 1990 2012 in northern australia the change shift in some flood properties may be associated with the large variability of floods it can be seen in fig 2 that the changes in regional averages of floods are dominated by inter annual and or decadal variability here our hypothesis is that the temporal variability in floods is related to the variability in the climate system which can be reflected by the large scale climate index i e enso in this study ward et al 2014 liu et al 2018a the cross correlations between 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 month lags between flood event and the preceding n month enso value where n 0 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 are conducted how to match of flood event and monthly enso values can refer to section 3 2 the fractions of significant correlations with lag 0 and lag 1 enso are maximum among these lags i e 16 9 and 20 8 for magnitude 19 4 and 22 7 for volume and 23 3 and 22 1 for duration respectively fig 7 when the lag is more than 6 months the fraction of significant correlation is down to a low percentage therefore we show the difference in the four flood properties between extreme positive and negative lag 0 and lag 6 enso phases fig 8 most of significant differences in the four flood properties between extreme positive and negative enso phases are positive and their spatial patterns are almost consistent between lag 0 and lag 6 the catchments with positive differences are mainly in northern australia and east northern australia and this is the case particularly for duration and frequency previous studies have detected tight relations between enso and precipitation extremes in the two areas of northern australia where consistent increases in both floods and heavy precipitation are also observed fig 2 in southern australia especially its southeast part there is little evidence to suggest strong relations between enso values and flood properties in most catchments the inconsistent changes between heavy precipitation and floods in southern australia fig 2 imply a weak correlation between enso and floods in this region the consistent changes of floods in northern australia show geographic cohesion especially for duration figs 2 and 3 which could be partly demonstrated by the consistent positive relations between floods and enso in this region the composite ivt anomaly and wind anomaly during the extreme enso positive phase are used to explain the physical mechanisms responsible for the relationships of flood properties with enso fig 9 during the extreme enso positive phrase the positive vapor transport anomalies over the equatorial and tropical australia are observed suggesting strengthened moisture transport in these regions on the other hand the negative vapor transport anomalies in the temperate areas indicate weakened moisture transport the spatial patterns of vapor transport anomalies composited in enso positive phrase are highly consistent with the geographic cohesion of flood changes i e diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia figs 2 and 3 here we must note that this consensus in spatial patterns can not fully explain the geographic cohesion due to around 80 of catchments show no differences during the extreme positive and negative enso phases fig 8 nevertheless the diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia related to inter annual variability are partly linked to the effects of enso 4 3 projected changes of floods in a multi model framework we detected discrepancies of changes in observed floods between northern and southern australia under climate change the next question to address is then would the diametric changes continue in a warmer future the 40 combinations of hms and gcms are employed to simulate floods over the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 precipitation temperature and other weather variables from gcms under historical and the two rcp scenarios are employed to drive the hms to simulate the impacts of different global warming levels on floods human activities such as population gdp irrigation and land use land cover are not considered in the simulations the quantile quantile plots of simulated and observed flood peaks in the four selected catchments show that the multi model ensemble means of the 40 combinations of hms and gcms performs reasonably to represent flood conditions fig 10 in a warmer climate under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 more than 60 of the 40 models agree the decreases in all flood properties in southern australia figs 11 and 12 where the decreasing flood risk was also projected by previous studies winsemius et al 2016 asadieh and krakauer 2017 the decreases are more intense during 2070 2099 under rcp8 5 representative of a 4 c warmer world compared to the pre industrial era than under rcp2 6 a 2 c warmer world we also observe increases in magnitude and volume of flood events in central northern australia but with high uncertainties the regional averages in flood magnitude and volume anomalies of multimodel ensemble means during 1970 2099 relative to 1976 2005 show increases in northern australia but decreases in southern australia under rcp8 5 fig 12 projected changes in flood magnitudes of the 5 20 30 and 50 year return periods this event on average would occur in n year are also evaluated fig s7 it is more evidence that the flood magnitudes are projected to increase in northern australia more than 60 of models agree the increases more than 50 fig s7 which is in line with that in hirabayashi et al 2013 the areas with increases in flood magnitudes are expected to be larger in floods with higher return levels e g 50 year and warmer climates e g rcp8 5 5 discussion and conclusions we highlight strong differences of changes in unregulated flood properties across australia i e increases in northern australia and decreases in southern australia though the changes during 1975 2012 are not evidently visible in terms of the number of unregulated catchments with 0 05 significance level the changes of regional averages of flood properties are mostly significant and prominent increases of flood events in northern australia are attributable to the increasing heavy precipitation conditioned antecedent catchment wetness and wetting soil moisture while the drying catchment wetness state and climate lead to the decreases of flooding in southern australia it should be noted that these changes in floods may be plausible and not secular due to the relative short record and could be dominated by inter annual and or decadal variability we future analyze the relations between the temporal variability in floods and the variability in the climate system i e enso in this study positive differences in flooding between extreme positive and negative enso phases are mainly in northern australia which shows consistent increases in both floods and heavy precipitation while there is little evidence to suggest strong relations between enso values and flood properties in most catchments of southern australia the geographical consistency between the changing patterns of flood properties and spatial patterns of vapor transport anomalies could partly explain the geographic cohesion of flood changes i e diametric changes in floods between northern and southern australia finally we explore whether the diametric changes in floods would be continue in the future the observed decreases in floods in southern australia are projected to continue with high model agreement under a warmer climate while only magnitude and volume of floods in northern australia are projected to increase but with low model agreement compared to rcp2 6 under rcp8 5 representative of a 4 c warmer world compared to the pre industrial era this feature decreases in southern australia and increases in flood magnitude and volume in northern australia would be more pronounced we also noted that the diametric changes of flood magnitude between northern and southern australia are projected to be more evident in extreme i e 50 year floods than small i e 5 and 20 year floods our findings are critical to improve the understanding of the changing nature of flooding across australia and can be assessed and communicated from a practical standpoint in terms of the local threat to people and assets it should be also noted the large uncertainties in simulated flood events in individual models fig 10 hydrologic regimes are usually better monitored in larger rivers in terms of drainage basin area and flood magnitude the flood magnitude in larger rivers is greater enough relative to mitigate the impacts of the systematical biases and errors in hms and gcms li et al 2016 in isi mip hms are large scale land surface models driven by the outputs of gcms with coarse spatial resolution which leads to higher uncertainties in small basins with relatively low river discharge in southern australia fig s1 additionally teng et al 2012 employed five rainfall runoff models and 15 gcms to simulate the runoff in southeast australia and pointed out that the uncertainty sourced from gcms is much larger than the uncertainty in the rainfall runoff models natural variability response uncertainty and scenario uncertainty are the three sources of uncertainty in gcms projecting climate change in the future hawkins and sutton 2009 woldemeskel et al 2016 although the total uncertainty of cmip5 precipitation is visibly reduced due to a number of advances relative to cmip3 the precipitation uncertainty is found to be larger in regions where heavy precipitation exists woldemeskel et al 2016 the cmip5 gcm outputs are bias corrected in isi mip although the bias correction may add extra uncertainty to the projections it can substantially improve the representation of precipitation properties nguyen et al 2017 additionally low frequency variability in gcm simulations is better represented after bias correction rocheta et al 2014 2017 and this improvement in low frequency variability is important for most hydrological studies where the effect of low frequency variability is of considerable importance nguyen et al 2017 another major limitation of this study is that the changes in vegetation due to changing climate and hydrologic conditions are not taken into consideration in the hms variations in vegetation distribution also have consider impacts on streamflow liu et al 2018b 2019 especially for the flood generating processes in australian temperate areas zhang et al 2011 declaration of competing

5652,remote rural areas which are generally the source regions for drinking water in small towns in china experience nitrate pollution due to intensive agricultural activities however little is known about the nitrate sources of these waterbodies and how human activities affect the water quality in these rural areas here a pair of rural watersheds on the chinese loess plateau clp were selected for study one of the watersheds which provides drinking water for local villages and a nearby small town has experienced valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation whereas the other one was not affected by human activities water chemistry monitoring and environmental isotope analysis were combined to identify the nitrate sources of the surface and groundwater in the dammed and natural watersheds and to assess the effects of landform transformation and agricultural and living activities on water quality the results demonstrated that nitrate concentrations in both watersheds were lower than 10 mg l 1 however the seasonal nitrate contents in the surface 0 42 0 52 mg l 1 and groundwater 1 86 3 65 mg l 1 of the dammed watershed were significantly lower than those of the natural watershed surface water 0 92 2 07 mg l 1 groundwater 2 73 8 21 mg l 1 isotope analysis demonstrated that nitrate fertilizer soil ammonium and manure and septic waste were the main sources of nitrate in the surface water of the two watersheds while the nitrate in the groundwater mainly originated from the nitrification of soil ammonium and manure and septic waste compared to the natural watershed the dammed watershed had increased inputs of agricultural fertilizers in the surface water however there was no significant difference in the groundwater nitrate sources between the two watersheds the results also demonstrated that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra probably occurred in the groundwater during the wet season while nitrification likely occurred during the dry and snowmelt seasons hierarchical cluster analysis hca showed that there were strong interactions between the surface runoff and the reservoir water in the dammed watershed while in the natural watershed streamflow had a close relationship with the groundwater we concluded that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation increased the nitrate input from mineral fertilizers in the watershed but decreased the nitrate concentrations in the surface water through changing the transformation and transportation processes of nitrate however these activities had little influence on the groundwater while the time lag between land consolidation and the groundwater quality response should be considered in the future this study aids in developing strategies for the comprehensive management of watershed and drinking water sources in rural regions keywords agricultural land consolidation nitrate dual isotopes water chemistry multivariate statistical analysis 1 introduction nitrate no3 contamination in water is a crucial environmental issue worldwide due to continuous and excessive nitrogen n inputs from intensive human activities e g heavy use of mineral fertilizers in agricultural production stark and richards 2008 increased nitrate concentrations retained in watershed does not only lead to ecological threats e g eutrophication and fish death but also pose human health related risks e g methemoglobinemia and stomach cancer fan and steinberg 1996 world health organization 1999 public drinking water supplies are threatened when nitrate concentrations exceed the maximum contaminant limit of 10 mg no3 l 1 set by the us environmental protection agency usepa schoch et al 2009 therefore the investigation and monitoring of nitrate in hydrological systems especially in drinking or biological waters are highly important sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 sepehri et al 2019 due to modern agricultural activities and the utilization of n fertilizers the current input of anthropogenic n into terrestrial ecosystems is estimated to be more than twice the preindustrial level galloway et al 2004 in addition to agricultural n inputs the consumption of fossil fuels by industries and vehicles also plays an important role in the reactive n load of ecosystems galloway et al 2008 therefore many studies on nitrate sources have been conducted near or within areas with intensive agricultural and industrial activities and urban areas because of the high n input and contamination of the surface and groundwater in these areas danielescu and macquarrie 2013 han et al 2018 kojima et al 2011 meghdadi and javar 2018 popescu et al 2015 yang and toor 2016 for example pastén zapata et al 2014 investigated the sources of nitrate in shallow groundwater in an intensive agricultural area and found that the nitrate mainly came from organic waste wastewater and synthetic fertilizers matiatos 2016 reported that septic and industrial wastes were likely the main source of n contamination in the industrial and urban land uses liu et al 2006 investigated the nitrate pollution of groundwater in guiyang city of southwest china and found that chemical fertilizer and organic materials were the dominant sources of nitrate in the suburban groundwater while the nitrate in urban groundwater mainly came from the sewage effluents however few studies have investigated the sources of nitrate in waterbodies that currently have good water quality groundwater is the main resource of drinking water worldwide hulsmann 2011 nonetheless the quality of groundwater is increasingly threatened by widespread contamination gu et al 2013 karen et al 2010 to prevent these valuable water resources from nitrate pollution the quality of groundwater in drinking water areas i e pre alpine and rural agricultural regions should receive increased attention stoewer et al 2015 on the chinese loess plateau clp a remote area in northwest of china a megaproject titled gully land consolidation glc has been implemented in rural watersheds to offset the farmland loss induced by the grain for green program the aim of glc was to create 26 67 104 ha of farmland in creek valleys from 2011 to 2020 jin 2014 the main goals of the glc project includes reshaping creek valleys by incising foot slopes filling stream channels and ditches constructing drainage canals dams and reservoirs and creating flat farmlands jin et al 2019 these newly created farmlands are allocated to local farmers to increase their farmland area and agricultural productivity our previous study found that compared to a natural catchment the soil nitrate increased significantly in the deep profile of the valley flat farmland in a reshaped catchment yu 2019 which indicated that groundwater in the reshaped creek valley could be threatened by soil nitrate leaching however whether such valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation affect the surface and groundwater nitrate and pose a threat to local people remain unclear to protect drinking water and address the effect of valley reshaping and damming on water nitrate levels it is important to first identify the sources of nitrate in waterbodies it has been suggested that the dual isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are a useful tool for characterizing the nitrate sources because the isotope compositions of n and o in nitrate differ significantly among various nitrate sources such as atmospheric deposition inorganic n fertilizer and soil nitrification kendall and aravena 2000 kojima et al 2011 ma et al 2016 xue et al 2009 however the overlap of the dual isotope signatures in different nitrate sources and the complexity of soil n biogeochemical processes e g nitrification denitrification make the precise interpretation of nitrate sources challenging han et al 2018 hence other environmental tracers e g cl δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o and hydrogeochemical information e g anion cation and dissolved oxygen data should be used as an auxiliary approach to identify different sources of nitrate in water bu et al 2017 czekaj et al 2016 kendall et al 2007 moreover the use of multiple statistical analyses can also help interpretations of possible nitrate sources and reduce the uncertainties matiatos 2016 meghdadi and javar 2018 in this study a pair of watersheds were selected on the clp one of the watersheds has experienced valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation and the other is a natural watershed used as the control time series data of inorganic n multiple isotopes of nitrate and water and hydrogeochemical tracers were combined to identify the source differences of nitrate in the reshaped and natural watersheds the aim of this study was to determine whether and how valley reshaping and damming affect surface and groundwater nitrate the resulting information can help policy makers establish more appropriate measures to safeguard drinking water in remote rural areas from potential nitrate pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study was conducted in a pair of watersheds one watershed with valley reshaping and damming and one control watershed located near the town of ganguyi in the yan an city of shaanxi province fig 1 the areas of the reshaped and control watersheds were 24 3 and 16 6 km2 respectively in the treated watershed the glc project was implemented from 2013 to 2014 and an area of 178 ha of flat farmland was created in the valley meanwhile five new dams and reservoirs were built along the stream channel in the reshaped creek valley the land use cover before 2012 and after 2014 glc in the treated watershed showed that the flat valley farmland dramatically expanded in the creek bottom due to valley reshaping and filling fig 2 for example 53 94 of other land use and land cover types other than residential and terrace have been transformed to the valley flat farmlands table s1 in the control watershed the land use and land cover changes were negligible between 2012 and 2014 fig s1 more detailed information about valley reshaping and damming in the treated watershed can be found in the references of jin et al 2019 and yu et al 2017 the study area has a semiarid continental monsoon climate and between 1985 and 2007 the average annual precipitation was 495 mm and the average annual temperature was 10 3 c yu et al 2017 the precipitation from june to september accounted for nearly 70 of the total annual precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration was approximately 1005 mm ning et al 2016 based on the amount of monthly precipitation and the time of snow melting from june 2016 to may 2017 june to october 2016 was defined as the wet season in the study period and accounted for 77 6 of the annual precipitation moreover november 2016 to february 2017 was defined as the dry season in the study period and accounted for 4 6 of the annual precipitation march to may in 2017 was defined as the snowmelt season in the study period and accounted for 17 8 of the annual precipitation fig 3 the dominant soil type in the two watersheds is loessial soil which corresponds to clacaric cambisols in the fao soil taxonomy wrb 2006 the soil profile has a high silt loamy content porosity and permeability china soil database http vdb3 soil csdb cn in the two watersheds the dominant cultivation is corn and the main fertilizers are chemical compound fertilizers i e urea and animal manure in this study the groundwater comprises springs and wells that seep from the interface between the loess and the bedrock in the natural watershed groundwater is the dominant water supply for the local residents in the dammed watershed groundwater is not only for the local settlements but also for the residents in the nearby town 2 2 water sampling and analyses the interval of water sampling was once each month from june 2016 to may 2017 in the dammed watershed there were seven groundwater sampling sites w2 w4 w5 w7 w8 s1 s3 and five reservoir sites re1 re5 while in the natural watershed there were one groundwater sampling site s6 and six surface runoff sampling sites r6 r11 based on the spring exposure and the streamflow distribution fig 1b to decrease the uncertainty resulting from the relatively low spatial distribution of the sampling sites ten additional groundwater sampling sites and five additional surface runoff sampling sites r1 r5 w1 w3 w6 and s2 in the reformed watershed and s4 s7 w9 and w10 in the natural watershed indicated with in fig 1b were added in april 2017 all the water samples were collected in 250 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles stored at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 48 h during each sampling event water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured by a handheld multiparameter probe ysi usa water alkalinity expressed as hco3 was determined by acid based titration on the day of sampling in the laboratory all water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter and then divided into three subsamples the first subsample was used to analyze the nitrate and ammonium nh4 concentrations using a westco smartchem 200 discrete analyzer the second subsample was kept at 4 c until the h and o stable isotope of h2o were analyzed by a picarro l1115 i isotope analyzer the measurement precisions for δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the results of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were reported as δ values with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the third subsample was frozen at 18 c until the stable isotope of no3 was analyzed using a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms the δ15n and δ18o of no3 were determined by the bacterial denitrification method with a measurement precision of 0 5 for both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 analysis results were reported as δ values with respect to the reference air and vsmow respectively in this study all water samples collected were analyzed for the concentrations of no3 and nh4 moreover water samples collected in june july august september and november in 2016 and january march and april in 2017 were used to analyze the stable isotopes of water and nitrate additionally water samples collected in april 2017 were acidified to a ph 2 with 6 m ultrapure hno3 for cation analysis and the unacidified samples were used for anion analysis dionex 600 ion chromatograph to characterize the temporal variations in inorganic n and monitor changes in the quality of drinking water in the dammed watershed a water sampling campaign was conducted weekly at the w2 w4 w5 w7 w8 and s1 groundwater sites to further verify the groundwater nitrate biogeochemical processes a high resolution sampling campaign was conducted at sites w7 s1 and s2 from june to september in 2018 at a daily interval 2 3 statistical analysis the means and standard deviations sds of inorganic n concentrations were calculated in different seasons to evaluate the differences between the dammed and natural watersheds hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied to the samples collected in april 2017 wang et al 2017 the data treatment of hca was divided into three steps first the original data were standardized to eliminate the range effect second the distances were calculated based on euclidean distance and finally the clusters were obtained using the ward d2 algorithm a nonparametric mann whitney m w u test was used to compare the differences in water inorganic n between the dammed and natural watersheds linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationships among the hydrogeochemical variables all statistical analyses were performed using r 3 5 2 software r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics of the surface and groundwater hca analysis of hydrogeochemical and isotope values demonstrated that water samples from the reservoirs and surface runoff in the dammed watershed clustered in the same group group i while water samples from the groundwater in the two watersheds and surface runoff in the natural watershed were clustered into another group group ii fig 4 moreover group ii further divided into two subgroups water samples from the wells except for w10 were in the same subgroup subgroup i and water samples from the spring and surface runoff in the natural watershed were in the same group subgroup ii fig 4 the results indicated that there was a close relationship between the surface runoff and groundwater in the natural watershed while in the dammed watershed surface runoff was closely related to reservoir water moreover there were differences between the groundwater of dammed and natural watersheds w10 grouped alone because it is located in saline farmland and thus had the highest concentrations of ec 2322 μs cm 1 na 813 8 mg l 1 mg2 223 6 mg l 1 so4 2 1677 4 mg l 1 and cl 690 7 mg l 1 according to the hydrogeochemical parameters of the surface and groundwater except w10 in the two watersheds the surface water had higher na mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 hco3 do ph ec and water temperature levels in the natural watershed than in the dammed watershed and there were significant differences occurred in na cl hco3 do ph and ec p 0 05 table s2 however no significant differences were found between the groundwater of the natural and dammed watersheds except for cl and ec in this study strong relationships were found between cl and na and cl and so4 2 in the surface water of the natural and dammed watersheds fig 5 which indicated that the surface water was similar within each watershed but different between the dammed and natural watersheds compared with the natural watershed the surface water of the dammed watershed had lower concentrations of cl and similar ratios of no3 and cl fig 6 a similar result was also found for the groundwater samples but the groundwater had a high ratio of no3 and cl fig 6 which indicated that the natural watershed probably had increased inputs from manure and sewage while the dammed watershed probably had increased inputs of agricultural fertilizers 3 2 seasonal variations in nitrate and ammonium in the surface and groundwater the mean concentrations of nh4 in the surface and groundwater ranged from 0 03 to 0 23 mg l 1 and no significant difference was found between the natural and dammed watersheds in the studied seasons table s3 fig 7 the mean concentrations of no3 0 42 0 52 mg l 1 in the surface water of the dammed watershed were significantly lower than those 0 92 2 07 mg l 1 in the surface water of the natural watershed in all studied seasons p 0 01 table s3 fig 7a the no3 concentrations in the groundwater of the dammed watershed were also significantly lower than those in the groundwater of the natural watershed during the study period except the snowmelt season p 0 05 fig 7b in the two watersheds nitrate was the dominant species of inorganic n in the surface and groundwater accounting for 73 2 98 9 of the total inorganic n contents table s3 there were lower percentages of no3 in the surface and groundwater of the dammed watershed than in those of the natural watershed table s3 weekly sampling results demonstrated that the concentrations of no3 and nh4 showed more significant variations in the wet season than in the dry and snowmelt seasons fig 8 a during the wet season in 2018 the highest values of no3 and the lowest values of nh4 at w7 s1 s2 occurred at the same time in the groundwater of the dammed watershed the periods of i ii and iii in fig 8b which indicated that the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra probably occurred during this season however the no3 concentrations showed a noticeable decreasing trend during the last period of the wet season the period of iv while no clear trend was observed for the nh4 concentrations fig 8b which indicated that the process of denitrification probably occurred during this time 3 3 characteristics of water and nitrate isotopes all the values of the surface and groundwater isotopes δ2h and δ18o in the natural and dammed watersheds were below the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 9 a the stable isotope values in the surface water ranged from 70 7 to 23 4 for δ2h and from 9 8 to 2 9 for δ18o table s4 for the groundwater the stable isotope values of δ2h and δ18o ranged from 75 0 to 52 9 and from 10 3 to 6 3 in the natural and dammed watersheds respectively the surface water showed a seasonal variation in δ2h in the two watersheds while less seasonal variation was found in the groundwater fig 9b in the natural watershed the gaps in δ2h between the surface and groundwater in the months with low precipitation were much smaller than those in other months with high precipitation in the natural watershed the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the surface water ranged from 0 2 to 23 8 mean 6 6 5 8 and from 0 9 to 15 4 mean 9 5 3 2 respectively in the dammed watershed the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the surface water ranged from 1 2 to 27 1 mean 12 4 7 2 and from 2 8 to 12 5 mean 7 1 4 2 respectively table s4 for the groundwater the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the natural watershed ranged from 0 61 to 6 3 mean 1 9 2 12 and from 6 27 to 11 2 mean 7 8 1 7 respectively in the dammed watershed the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 ranged from 4 7 to 7 8 mean 0 7 3 7 and from 0 63 to 17 9 mean 8 0 3 4 respectively tables s4 and s5 seasonal variations in δ18o no3 were found in the surface water of the two watersheds while less seasonal variation was found in the δ18o no3 of the groundwater fig 10 a however both the surface and groundwater showed less seasonal variations in δ15n no3 than in δ18o no3 in the two watersheds fig 10b fig 11 a shows that most of the surface water in the dry and snowmelt seasons clustered with low δ18o no3 values these values fell within the dual isotope signatures of soil nh4 and manure and septic waste which indicated that the majority of the nitrate likely originated from these sources moreover most of the surface water in the wet season fell within the overlapping isotope ranges of the sources of no3 fertilizer the nitrification of soil nh4 and manure and septic waste all groundwater sites except for w4 in the wet season and w10 in the snowmelt season indicated that the possible sources of nitrate were soil nh4 and manure and septic waste fig 11b additionally no negative relationship between δ15n no3 and no3 was found in samples from both the surface and groundwater bodies but a negative relationship was found for some of the surface and groundwater samples in the wet season in the oval shaped areas fig 11 c and d 4 discussion 4 1 effects of valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation on the chemistry of the surface and groundwater 4 1 1 surface water numerous studies have demonstrated that dam and reservoir systems can modify the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of watersheds by slowing down the runoff rate decreasing the flux of the elements and changing the nutrient and thermal balances friedl and wüest 2002 humborg et al 2002 found that weathering fluxes were reduced in a dam river system due to the reduction in soil water contact which induced relatively low ion concentrations in the surface water moreover physical sedimentation and biological absorption processes in the dam reservoir systems can retain large amounts of nutrients and the nutrients are then lost through the physical and chemical processes which would further decrease the concentrations of ions in the water harrison et al 2009 liu et al 2009 many of the hydrogeochemical parameters showed lower values in the dammed watershed than in the natural watershed table s2 and fig 7 and similar results for water nitrate were also found in a dam controlled river in southwest china li et al 2014 in this study the slopes of the local evaporation lines of the surface water in the two watersheds were lower than the slope of the lmwl indicating that precipitation is an important source of surface water however the slope of the surface water in the dammed watershed 5 92 was notably lower than that of the surface water in the natural watershed 7 14 likely due to intense evaporation in the reservoirs fig 9a the results of hca demonstrated that the surface water in the natural and dammed watersheds were notably different in the dammed watershed the elemental and isotope signatures of the surface runoff were similar to those of the reservoirs while in the natural watershed the signatures of the surface runoff were similar to those in the groundwater fig 4 in addition the strong relationships of cl na and so4 2 indicated that the sources of surface water were likely the same within each watershed while these sources were different between the natural and dammed watersheds fig 5 these findings suggest that valley reshaping and damming significantly changed the hydrogeochemical characteristics and biogeochemical processes of the surface water in the dammed watershed 4 1 2 groundwater the results of hca analysis showed that the quality of groundwater in the dammed watershed was similar to that of groundwater in the natural watershed fig 4 based on the observed data the hydrogeochemical parameters of the groundwater showed less significant differences than these of the surface water between the natural and dammed watersheds table s2 moreover the similar slopes of the local evaporation lines and the ranges of δ18o and δ2h of the water suggested that the origin of the groundwater in the two watersheds was probably similar fig 9a table s4 furthermore the weak seasonal variations in δ2h in the groundwater indicated that the surface water did not directly affect the groundwater although the local inputs of anthropogenic fertilizers increased due to increasing agricultural activities after the implementation of the glc project these fertilizers have not yet polluted the groundwater probably due to the buffering capacity of the thick loess vadose zone and the dilution effects of the large volume of groundwater therefore we concluded that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation have not yet significantly affected the groundwater quality although the long term effects should be considered due to the increasing input of pollutants in the future 4 2 effects of valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation on nitrate transformation and transportation 4 2 1 biogeochemical processes of nitrate transformation in our study denitrification in the groundwater is a crucial process of nitrate attenuation during the wet season first many sampling sites showed low do concentrations in the wet season that were below the threshold value of 2 mg l 1 for denitrification suggested by rivett et al 2008 second there was a significant positive linear relationship between δ18o and δ15n in the nitrate slope 0 91 r2 0 69 p 0 0001 fig 11b third some groundwater samples showed that the δ15n no3 decreased as the no3 concentration increased which indicated that denitrification probably changed the isotope values and nitrate content fig 11d minet et al 2017 kendall et al 2007 fourth there was an obvious decreasing trend for nitrate and no clear pattern was found for ammonium during the iv period in the wet season fig 8b which was likely induced by the process of denitrification in the dry and snowmelt seasons significant linear relationships between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the groundwater were also found fig 11b however due to the high do level mean 5 3 mg l 1 and the relative stable water nitrate concentration the isotope signatures of nitrate were likely a remnant of the wet season rather than the result of denitrification additionally the slopes of δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 in the dry 1 05 and snowmelt seasons 1 12 were higher than 1 indicating that other microbial processes i e nitrification with branching fractionation likely occurred in the groundwater during the two seasons archana et al 2018 casciotti 2016 in the surface water the average concentrations of do were 7 2 and 8 6 mg l 1 for the dammed and natural watersheds respectively indicating that no noticeable denitrification process occurred in the surface water we found that some of the surface water samples in the natural watershed showed an enrichment trend for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and a decreasing trend for no3 as δ15n no3 increasing during the wet season fig 11 a and c which was likely caused by the groundwater recharging the surface water dnra is another process of nitrate attenuation that occurs under similar environmental conditions as denitrification rivett et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that a limited nitrate supply in the environment is beneficial to dnra tiedje 1988 currently there is no recognized nitrate concentration threshold to determine whether the process of nitrate attenuation is dnra or denitrification palacin lizarbe et al 2019 and van den berg et al 2017 suggested that the magnitude of nitrate concentrations could range from 10 1 to 102 mg l 1 in this study although the annual average concentrations of nitrate 5 0 and 2 8 mg l 1 for the natural and dammed watersheds respectively in the groundwater were not relatively low the lowest values in the wet season were less than the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 in addition the concentrations of nitrate would decrease during the process of denitrification which could trigger the process of dnra our results showed that the peak concentrations of ammonium and the minimum concentrations of nitrate in the groundwater occurred simultaneously during the wet season the periods of i ii and iii fig 8b which likely induced from the dnra process therefore we infer that the dnra process probably occurred in the groundwater nitrification should also be considered in the two watersheds because of the application of urea and animal manure and the high ammonia concentration in precipitation yu et al 2017 the oxygen isotope values of the generated no3 should theoretically have a wide rage i e 5 to 15 according to the oxygen sources in the process of nitrification kendall et al 2007 li et al 2014 our results showed that the values of δ18o no3 in most of the groundwater samples and many surface water samples fell in the range of δ18o no3 resulting from microbial nitrification fig 10 a and b indicating that nitrification was an important source of nitrate in the waters of the two watersheds the theoretically incorporated δ18o values of the water were further calculated using the measured δ18o values in the nitrate via the formula δ18o h2o 3 2 δ18o no3 1 3 δ18o o2 to identify the locations of the nitrification process stoewer et al 2015 the most calculated δ18o values in the surface and groundwater fell within the δ18o ranges of precipitation 44 2 81 3 and soil water 22 3 44 table s6 therefore we concluded that nitrification of the upper soil horizons was an important source of nitrate in the surface and groundwater however 25 and 8 of the calculated δ18o values in the dry and snowmelt seasons respectively matched the measured isotope range of groundwater indicating that nitrification likely occurred in the groundwater the findings further verified the slopes of δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 were greater than 1 during the dry and snowmelt seasons 4 2 2 nitrate sources of the surface and groundwater the surface water showed a wide range of nitrate isotope values which indicated that the surface water nitrate originated from varied and mixed sources e g nitrate fertilizers soil ammonium and manure and septic waste fig 11a meghdadi and javar 2018 groundwater is the main source of base flow during the dry period and thus many of the nitrate isotopes in the surface water samples were similar to those in the groundwater in addition compared with the natural watershed the dammed watershed showed high values of δ18o no3 and lower values of δ15n no3 in the surface water which indicated that atmospheric n deposition and nitrate fertilizers might be the crucial sources of nitrate in the surface water especially during the wet and snowmelt seasons fig 11a table s5 wang et al 2016 there may be two reasons for this phenomenon the effects of the new flat farmland and the dams and reservoirs in the treated watershed regarding the first reason the newly created farmland separated the drainage channels and the local settlements in the dammed watershed fig 2b and fig 12 a thus organic pollutants from human and domestic animals were not directly transported to the surface water however the drainage channels in the original landform before the glc project and in the natural watershed were near the local settlements fig 2 and fig 12 and manure and septic waste could be easily transported to the streams regarding the second reason reservoirs are the well known nonpoint pollution sinks yu et al 2017 previous studies have demonstrated that valley reshaping and agricultural land consolidation increase the precipitation infiltration which consequently increases the nitrate leaching from agricultural inputs jin et al 2019 yu 2019 nitrate would leach down to the reservoir through subsurface flow overall the surface water in the dammed watershed could be more influenced by agricultural practices compared to the surface water in the natural watershed the results of this study showed that most of the nitrate in the groundwater originated from the topsoil nitrification and nitrate leaching in the two watersheds and that there was relatively little variation among the different seasons fig 10 fig 11b moreover denitrification and dnra processes in the wet season could affect the nitrate concentrations and isotope signatures the similar isotope characteristics and biogeochemical processes of the two watersheds showed that there was likely no difference in the sources of groundwater nitrate another important factor was the area ratio between the glc created valley farmland and the total area of the watershed the area ratio was 0 09 in the dammed watershed thus we assumed that the contribution of nitrate from the farmland to the groundwater was limited however there may be a time lag between the leaching of the anthropogenic nitrate and the groundwater response in places where the unsaturated vadose zone is thick wei et al 2017 huang et al 2013 reported that the time lag between land use change and the groundwater quality response could be as long as a hundred years due to the considerable buffering capacity of the thick unsaturated zone therefore we concluded that the glc project currently has little influence on the groundwater nitrate however the time lag should be considered in the future 4 3 the implications of valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation on nitrate pollution agricultural land consolidation has been implemented in many countries worldwide jiang et al 2015 pašakarnis et al 2013 liu and li 2017 however whether valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation projects induce nitrate pollution has not been well addressed especially in remote rural areas to fully understand how these projects alter nitrate contamination in waters the characteristics of nitrate including its content biogeochemical processes and sources should be considered this study is a pioneering attempt to quantify the impacts of agricultural land consolidation on nitrate levels addressing the knowledge gap our study showed that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation can alleviate nitrate pollution and that dams and reservoirs would play a key role in controlling the concentrations of water nitrate many studies have demonstrated that n is removed in large reservoirs in the river systems because large reservoirs offer ideal conditions for n burial in sediments or loss via the n cycle harrison et al 2009 liu et al 2009 li et al 2014 investigated the spatiotemporal variations and stable isotope signatures of nitrate in a dammed river and found that water nitrate can be consumed by the processes of assimilation and or denitrification in reservoirs therefore the dam reservoir system in small watersheds has the potential to mitigate the risk of nitrate pollution which has significant implications for agricultural watershed management and nitrate regulation in rural areas although the quality of the groundwater was not noticeably affected by the anthropogenic nitrate our results demonstrated that nitrate in the groundwater e g the wells in the newly created farmlands trended to receive more inputs of agricultural pollution in the dammed watershed than the natural watershed fig 6a moreover the annual rate of n fertilizer application is 234 kg n ha 1 which is much higher than the recommended annual application rate of 66 92 kg n ha 1on the clp dai et al 2015 our results also showed that there were a few nitrification processes in the groundwater indicating that a part of the n fertilizers is first leached into the groundwater and then nitrified to nitrate the reservoir is a net sink of n organic matter and sediments however this sink could change into a net source of n if the environmental conditions changed kraus et al 2011 therefore the risk of groundwater pollution in the dammed watershed will increase in the future due to the continuous input of agricultural fertilizers in the valley to safeguard the quality of drinking water fertilizer application should be shorten to a reasonable level in the dammed watershed meanwhile the long term monitoring of the water quality in the valley should be strengthened 5 conclusion the results of this study demonstrated that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation increased the agricultural nitrate input in the watershed but decreased the nitrate concentrations in the surface water through changing the transformation and transportation processes of nitrate newly created farmlands and reservoirs had critical effects on the surface water nitrate levels in the dammed watershed mineral fertilizers were important sources of surface water nitrate in the intensely managed watershed and the reservoirs built along the reshaped valley reduced element concentrations and consumed nitrate from different sources although the current groundwater had not been influenced noticeably by glc projects in the dammed watershed the time lag between agricultural land consolidation and groundwater quality response should be considered in the future we suggest that a reasonable level of n application should be implemented in the dammed watershed to maintain the high quality of the surface and groundwater credit

5652,remote rural areas which are generally the source regions for drinking water in small towns in china experience nitrate pollution due to intensive agricultural activities however little is known about the nitrate sources of these waterbodies and how human activities affect the water quality in these rural areas here a pair of rural watersheds on the chinese loess plateau clp were selected for study one of the watersheds which provides drinking water for local villages and a nearby small town has experienced valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation whereas the other one was not affected by human activities water chemistry monitoring and environmental isotope analysis were combined to identify the nitrate sources of the surface and groundwater in the dammed and natural watersheds and to assess the effects of landform transformation and agricultural and living activities on water quality the results demonstrated that nitrate concentrations in both watersheds were lower than 10 mg l 1 however the seasonal nitrate contents in the surface 0 42 0 52 mg l 1 and groundwater 1 86 3 65 mg l 1 of the dammed watershed were significantly lower than those of the natural watershed surface water 0 92 2 07 mg l 1 groundwater 2 73 8 21 mg l 1 isotope analysis demonstrated that nitrate fertilizer soil ammonium and manure and septic waste were the main sources of nitrate in the surface water of the two watersheds while the nitrate in the groundwater mainly originated from the nitrification of soil ammonium and manure and septic waste compared to the natural watershed the dammed watershed had increased inputs of agricultural fertilizers in the surface water however there was no significant difference in the groundwater nitrate sources between the two watersheds the results also demonstrated that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra probably occurred in the groundwater during the wet season while nitrification likely occurred during the dry and snowmelt seasons hierarchical cluster analysis hca showed that there were strong interactions between the surface runoff and the reservoir water in the dammed watershed while in the natural watershed streamflow had a close relationship with the groundwater we concluded that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation increased the nitrate input from mineral fertilizers in the watershed but decreased the nitrate concentrations in the surface water through changing the transformation and transportation processes of nitrate however these activities had little influence on the groundwater while the time lag between land consolidation and the groundwater quality response should be considered in the future this study aids in developing strategies

hydrological systems especially in drinking or biological waters are highly important sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 sepehri et al 2019 due to modern agricultural activities and the utilization of n fertilizers the current input of anthropogenic n into terrestrial ecosystems is estimated to be more than twice the preindustrial level galloway et al 2004 in addition to agricultural n inputs the consumption of fossil fuels by industries and vehicles also plays an important role in the reactive n load of ecosystems galloway et al 2008 therefore many studies on nitrate sources have been conducted near or within areas with intensive agricultural and industrial activities and urban areas because of the high n input and contamination of the surface and groundwater in these areas danielescu and macquarrie 2013 han et al 2018 kojima et al 2011 meghdadi and javar 2018 popescu et al 2015 yang and toor 2016 for example pastén zapata et al 2014 investigated the sources of nitrate in shallow groundwater in an intensive agricultural area and found that the nitrate mainly came from organic waste wastewater and synthetic fertilizers matiatos 2016 reported that septic and industrial wastes were likely the main source of n contamination in the industrial and urban land uses liu et al 2006 investigated the nitrate pollution of groundwater in guiyang city of southwest china and found that chemical fertilizer and organic materials were the dominant sources of nitrate in the suburban groundwater while the nitrate in urban groundwater mainly came from the sewage effluents however few studies have investigated the sources of nitrate in waterbodies that currently have good water quality groundwater is the main resource of drinking water worldwide hulsmann 2011 nonetheless the quality of groundwater is increasingly threatened by widespread contamination gu et al 2013 karen et al 2010 to prevent these valuable water resources from nitrate pollution the quality of groundwater in drinking water areas i e pre alpine and rural agricultural regions should receive increased attention stoewer et al 2015 on the chinese loess plateau clp a remote area in northwest of china a megaproject titled gully land consolidation glc has been implemented in rural watersheds to offset the farmland loss induced by the grain for green program the aim of glc was to create 26 67 104 ha of farmland in creek valleys from 2011 to 2020 jin 2014 the main goals of the glc project includes reshaping creek valleys by incising foot slopes filling stream channels and ditches constructing drainage canals dams and reservoirs and creating flat farmlands jin et al 2019 these newly created farmlands are allocated to local farmers to increase their farmland area and agricultural productivity our previous study found that compared to a natural catchment the soil nitrate increased significantly in the deep profile of the valley flat farmland in a reshaped catchment yu 2019 which indicated that groundwater in the reshaped creek valley could be threatened by soil nitrate leaching however whether such valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation affect the surface and groundwater nitrate and pose a threat to local people remain unclear to protect drinking water and address the effect of valley reshaping and damming on water nitrate levels it is important to first identify the sources of nitrate in waterbodies it has been suggested that the dual isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are a useful tool for characterizing the nitrate sources because the isotope compositions of n and o in nitrate differ significantly among various nitrate sources such as atmospheric deposition inorganic n fertilizer and soil nitrification kendall and aravena 2000 kojima et al 2011 ma et al 2016 xue et al 2009 however the overlap of the dual isotope signatures in different nitrate sources and the complexity of soil n biogeochemical processes e g nitrification denitrification make the precise interpretation of nitrate sources challenging han et al 2018 hence other environmental tracers e g cl δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o and hydrogeochemical information e g anion cation and dissolved oxygen data should be used as an auxiliary approach to identify different sources of nitrate in water bu et al 2017 czekaj et al 2016 kendall et al 2007 moreover the use of multiple statistical analyses can also help interpretations of possible nitrate sources and reduce the uncertainties matiatos 2016 meghdadi and javar 2018 in this study a pair of watersheds were selected on the clp one of the watersheds has experienced valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation and the other is a natural watershed used as the control time series data of inorganic n multiple isotopes of nitrate and water and hydrogeochemical tracers were combined to identify the source differences of nitrate in the reshaped and natural watersheds the aim of this study was to determine whether and how valley reshaping and damming affect surface and groundwater nitrate the resulting information can help policy makers establish more appropriate measures to safeguard drinking water in remote rural areas from potential nitrate pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study was conducted in a pair of watersheds one watershed with valley reshaping and damming and one control watershed located near the town of ganguyi in the yan an city of shaanxi province fig 1 the areas of the reshaped and control watersheds were 24 3 and 16 6 km2 respectively in the treated watershed the glc project was implemented from 2013 to 2014 and an area of 178 ha of flat farmland was created in the valley meanwhile five new dams and reservoirs were built along the stream channel in the reshaped creek valley the land use cover before 2012 and after 2014 glc in the treated watershed showed that the flat valley farmland dramatically expanded in the creek bottom due to valley reshaping and filling fig 2 for example 53 94 of other land use and land cover types other than residential and terrace have been transformed to the valley flat farmlands table s1 in the control watershed the land use and land cover changes were negligible between 2012 and 2014 fig s1 more detailed information about valley reshaping and damming in the treated watershed can be found in the references of jin et al 2019 and yu et al 2017 the study area has a semiarid continental monsoon climate and between 1985 and 2007 the average annual precipitation was 495 mm and the average annual temperature was 10 3 c yu et al 2017 the precipitation from june to september accounted for nearly 70 of the total annual precipitation and the potential evapotranspiration was approximately 1005 mm ning et al 2016 based on the amount of monthly precipitation and the time of snow melting from june 2016 to may 2017 june to october 2016 was defined as the wet season in the study period and accounted for 77 6 of the annual precipitation moreover november 2016 to february 2017 was defined as the dry season in the study period and accounted for 4 6 of the annual precipitation march to may in 2017 was defined as the snowmelt season in the study period and accounted for 17 8 of the annual precipitation fig 3 the dominant soil type in the two watersheds is loessial soil which corresponds to clacaric cambisols in the fao soil taxonomy wrb 2006 the soil profile has a high silt loamy content porosity and permeability china soil database http vdb3 soil csdb cn in the two watersheds the dominant cultivation is corn and the main fertilizers are chemical compound fertilizers i e urea and animal manure in this study the groundwater comprises springs and wells that seep from the interface between the loess and the bedrock in the natural watershed groundwater is the dominant water supply for the local residents in the dammed watershed groundwater is not only for the local settlements but also for the residents in the nearby town 2 2 water sampling and analyses the interval of water sampling was once each month from june 2016 to may 2017 in the dammed watershed there were seven groundwater sampling sites w2 w4 w5 w7 w8 s1 s3 and five reservoir sites re1 re5 while in the natural watershed there were one groundwater sampling site s6 and six surface runoff sampling sites r6 r11 based on the spring exposure and the streamflow distribution fig 1b to decrease the uncertainty resulting from the relatively low spatial distribution of the sampling sites ten additional groundwater sampling sites and five additional surface runoff sampling sites r1 r5 w1 w3 w6 and s2 in the reformed watershed and s4 s7 w9 and w10 in the natural watershed indicated with in fig 1b were added in april 2017 all the water samples were collected in 250 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles stored at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 48 h during each sampling event water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured by a handheld multiparameter probe ysi usa water alkalinity expressed as hco3 was determined by acid based titration on the day of sampling in the laboratory all water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter and then divided into three subsamples the first subsample was used to analyze the nitrate and ammonium nh4 concentrations using a westco smartchem 200 discrete analyzer the second subsample was kept at 4 c until the h and o stable isotope of h2o were analyzed by a picarro l1115 i isotope analyzer the measurement precisions for δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the results of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o were reported as δ values with respect to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the third subsample was frozen at 18 c until the stable isotope of no3 was analyzed using a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms the δ15n and δ18o of no3 were determined by the bacterial denitrification method with a measurement precision of 0 5 for both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 analysis results were reported as δ values with respect to the reference air and vsmow respectively in this study all water samples collected were analyzed for the concentrations of no3 and nh4 moreover water samples collected in june july august september and november in 2016 and january march and april in 2017 were used to analyze the stable isotopes of water and nitrate additionally water samples collected in april 2017 were acidified to a ph 2 with 6 m ultrapure hno3 for cation analysis and the unacidified samples were used for anion analysis dionex 600 ion chromatograph to characterize the temporal variations in inorganic n and monitor changes in the quality of drinking water in the dammed watershed a water sampling campaign was conducted weekly at the w2 w4 w5 w7 w8 and s1 groundwater sites to further verify the groundwater nitrate biogeochemical processes a high resolution sampling campaign was conducted at sites w7 s1 and s2 from june to september in 2018 at a daily interval 2 3 statistical analysis the means and standard deviations sds of inorganic n concentrations were calculated in different seasons to evaluate the differences between the dammed and natural watersheds hierarchical cluster analysis hca was applied to the samples collected in april 2017 wang et al 2017 the data treatment of hca was divided into three steps first the original data were standardized to eliminate the range effect second the distances were calculated based on euclidean distance and finally the clusters were obtained using the ward d2 algorithm a nonparametric mann whitney m w u test was used to compare the differences in water inorganic n between the dammed and natural watersheds linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the relationships among the hydrogeochemical variables all statistical analyses were performed using r 3 5 2 software r core team 2018 3 results 3 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics of the surface and groundwater hca analysis of hydrogeochemical and isotope values demonstrated that water samples from the reservoirs and surface runoff in the dammed watershed clustered in the same group group i while water samples from the groundwater in the two watersheds and surface runoff in the natural watershed were clustered into another group group ii fig 4 moreover group ii further divided into two subgroups water samples from the wells except for w10 were in the same subgroup subgroup i and water samples from the spring and surface runoff in the natural watershed were in the same group subgroup ii fig 4 the results indicated that there was a close relationship between the surface runoff and groundwater in the natural watershed while in the dammed watershed surface runoff was closely related to reservoir water moreover there were differences between the groundwater of dammed and natural watersheds w10 grouped alone because it is located in saline farmland and thus had the highest concentrations of ec 2322 μs cm 1 na 813 8 mg l 1 mg2 223 6 mg l 1 so4 2 1677 4 mg l 1 and cl 690 7 mg l 1 according to the hydrogeochemical parameters of the surface and groundwater except w10 in the two watersheds the surface water had higher na mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 hco3 do ph ec and water temperature levels in the natural watershed than in the dammed watershed and there were significant differences occurred in na cl hco3 do ph and ec p 0 05 table s2 however no significant differences were found between the groundwater of the natural and dammed watersheds except for cl and ec in this study strong relationships were found between cl and na and cl and so4 2 in the surface water of the natural and dammed watersheds fig 5 which indicated that the surface water was similar within each watershed but different between the dammed and natural watersheds compared with the natural watershed the surface water of the dammed watershed had lower concentrations of cl and similar ratios of no3 and cl fig 6 a similar result was also found for the groundwater samples but the groundwater had a high ratio of no3 and cl fig 6 which indicated that the natural watershed probably had increased inputs from manure and sewage while the dammed watershed probably had increased inputs of agricultural fertilizers 3 2 seasonal variations in nitrate and ammonium in the surface and groundwater the mean concentrations of nh4 in the surface and groundwater ranged from 0 03 to 0 23 mg l 1 and no significant difference was found between the natural and dammed watersheds in the studied seasons table s3 fig 7 the mean concentrations of no3 0 42 0 52 mg l 1 in the surface water of the dammed watershed were significantly lower than those 0 92 2 07 mg l 1 in the surface water of the natural watershed in all studied seasons p 0 01 table s3 fig 7a the no3 concentrations in the groundwater of the dammed watershed were also significantly lower than those in the groundwater of the natural watershed during the study period except the snowmelt season p 0 05 fig 7b in the two watersheds nitrate was the dominant species of inorganic n in the surface and groundwater accounting for 73 2 98 9 of the total inorganic n contents table s3 there were lower percentages of no3 in the surface and groundwater of the dammed watershed than in those of the natural watershed table s3 weekly sampling results demonstrated that the concentrations of no3 and nh4 showed more significant variations in the wet season than in the dry and snowmelt seasons fig 8 a during the wet season in 2018 the highest values of no3 and the lowest values of nh4 at w7 s1 s2 occurred at the same time in the groundwater of the dammed watershed the periods of i ii and iii in fig 8b which indicated that the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra probably occurred during this season however the no3 concentrations showed a noticeable decreasing trend during the last period of the wet season the period of iv while no clear trend was observed for the nh4 concentrations fig 8b which indicated that the process of denitrification probably occurred during this time 3 3 characteristics of water and nitrate isotopes all the values of the surface and groundwater isotopes δ2h and δ18o in the natural and dammed watersheds were below the local meteoric water line lmwl fig 9 a the stable isotope values in the surface water ranged from 70 7 to 23 4 for δ2h and from 9 8 to 2 9 for δ18o table s4 for the groundwater the stable isotope values of δ2h and δ18o ranged from 75 0 to 52 9 and from 10 3 to 6 3 in the natural and dammed watersheds respectively the surface water showed a seasonal variation in δ2h in the two watersheds while less seasonal variation was found in the groundwater fig 9b in the natural watershed the gaps in δ2h between the surface and groundwater in the months with low precipitation were much smaller than those in other months with high precipitation in the natural watershed the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the surface water ranged from 0 2 to 23 8 mean 6 6 5 8 and from 0 9 to 15 4 mean 9 5 3 2 respectively in the dammed watershed the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the surface water ranged from 1 2 to 27 1 mean 12 4 7 2 and from 2 8 to 12 5 mean 7 1 4 2 respectively table s4 for the groundwater the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the natural watershed ranged from 0 61 to 6 3 mean 1 9 2 12 and from 6 27 to 11 2 mean 7 8 1 7 respectively in the dammed watershed the δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 ranged from 4 7 to 7 8 mean 0 7 3 7 and from 0 63 to 17 9 mean 8 0 3 4 respectively tables s4 and s5 seasonal variations in δ18o no3 were found in the surface water of the two watersheds while less seasonal variation was found in the δ18o no3 of the groundwater fig 10 a however both the surface and groundwater showed less seasonal variations in δ15n no3 than in δ18o no3 in the two watersheds fig 10b fig 11 a shows that most of the surface water in the dry and snowmelt seasons clustered with low δ18o no3 values these values fell within the dual isotope signatures of soil nh4 and manure and septic waste which indicated that the majority of the nitrate likely originated from these sources moreover most of the surface water in the wet season fell within the overlapping isotope ranges of the sources of no3 fertilizer the nitrification of soil nh4 and manure and septic waste all groundwater sites except for w4 in the wet season and w10 in the snowmelt season indicated that the possible sources of nitrate were soil nh4 and manure and septic waste fig 11b additionally no negative relationship between δ15n no3 and no3 was found in samples from both the surface and groundwater bodies but a negative relationship was found for some of the surface and groundwater samples in the wet season in the oval shaped areas fig 11 c and d 4 discussion 4 1 effects of valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation on the chemistry of the surface and groundwater 4 1 1 surface water numerous studies have demonstrated that dam and reservoir systems can modify the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of watersheds by slowing down the runoff rate decreasing the flux of the elements and changing the nutrient and thermal balances friedl and wüest 2002 humborg et al 2002 found that weathering fluxes were reduced in a dam river system due to the reduction in soil water contact which induced relatively low ion concentrations in the surface water moreover physical sedimentation and biological absorption processes in the dam reservoir systems can retain large amounts of nutrients and the nutrients are then lost through the physical and chemical processes which would further decrease the concentrations of ions in the water harrison et al 2009 liu et al 2009 many of the hydrogeochemical parameters showed lower values in the dammed watershed than in the natural watershed table s2 and fig 7 and similar results for water nitrate were also found in a dam controlled river in southwest china li et al 2014 in this study the slopes of the local evaporation lines of the surface water in the two watersheds were lower than the slope of the lmwl indicating that precipitation is an important source of surface water however the slope of the surface water in the dammed watershed 5 92 was notably lower than that of the surface water in the natural watershed 7 14 likely due to intense evaporation in the reservoirs fig 9a the results of hca demonstrated that the surface water in the natural and dammed watersheds were notably different in the dammed watershed the elemental and isotope signatures of the surface runoff were similar to those of the reservoirs while in the natural watershed the signatures of the surface runoff were similar to those in the groundwater fig 4 in addition the strong relationships of cl na and so4 2 indicated that the sources of surface water were likely the same within each watershed while these sources were different between the natural and dammed watersheds fig 5 these findings suggest that valley reshaping and damming significantly changed the hydrogeochemical characteristics and biogeochemical processes of the surface water in the dammed watershed 4 1 2 groundwater the results of hca analysis showed that the quality of groundwater in the dammed watershed was similar to that of groundwater in the natural watershed fig 4 based on the observed data the hydrogeochemical parameters of the groundwater showed less significant differences than these of the surface water between the natural and dammed watersheds table s2 moreover the similar slopes of the local evaporation lines and the ranges of δ18o and δ2h of the water suggested that the origin of the groundwater in the two watersheds was probably similar fig 9a table s4 furthermore the weak seasonal variations in δ2h in the groundwater indicated that the surface water did not directly affect the groundwater although the local inputs of anthropogenic fertilizers increased due to increasing agricultural activities after the implementation of the glc project these fertilizers have not yet polluted the groundwater probably due to the buffering capacity of the thick loess vadose zone and the dilution effects of the large volume of groundwater therefore we concluded that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation have not yet significantly affected the groundwater quality although the long term effects should be considered due to the increasing input of pollutants in the future 4 2 effects of valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation on nitrate transformation and transportation 4 2 1 biogeochemical processes of nitrate transformation in our study denitrification in the groundwater is a crucial process of nitrate attenuation during the wet season first many sampling sites showed low do concentrations in the wet season that were below the threshold value of 2 mg l 1 for denitrification suggested by rivett et al 2008 second there was a significant positive linear relationship between δ18o and δ15n in the nitrate slope 0 91 r2 0 69 p 0 0001 fig 11b third some groundwater samples showed that the δ15n no3 decreased as the no3 concentration increased which indicated that denitrification probably changed the isotope values and nitrate content fig 11d minet et al 2017 kendall et al 2007 fourth there was an obvious decreasing trend for nitrate and no clear pattern was found for ammonium during the iv period in the wet season fig 8b which was likely induced by the process of denitrification in the dry and snowmelt seasons significant linear relationships between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the groundwater were also found fig 11b however due to the high do level mean 5 3 mg l 1 and the relative stable water nitrate concentration the isotope signatures of nitrate were likely a remnant of the wet season rather than the result of denitrification additionally the slopes of δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 in the dry 1 05 and snowmelt seasons 1 12 were higher than 1 indicating that other microbial processes i e nitrification with branching fractionation likely occurred in the groundwater during the two seasons archana et al 2018 casciotti 2016 in the surface water the average concentrations of do were 7 2 and 8 6 mg l 1 for the dammed and natural watersheds respectively indicating that no noticeable denitrification process occurred in the surface water we found that some of the surface water samples in the natural watershed showed an enrichment trend for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and a decreasing trend for no3 as δ15n no3 increasing during the wet season fig 11 a and c which was likely caused by the groundwater recharging the surface water dnra is another process of nitrate attenuation that occurs under similar environmental conditions as denitrification rivett et al 2008 previous studies have suggested that a limited nitrate supply in the environment is beneficial to dnra tiedje 1988 currently there is no recognized nitrate concentration threshold to determine whether the process of nitrate attenuation is dnra or denitrification palacin lizarbe et al 2019 and van den berg et al 2017 suggested that the magnitude of nitrate concentrations could range from 10 1 to 102 mg l 1 in this study although the annual average concentrations of nitrate 5 0 and 2 8 mg l 1 for the natural and dammed watersheds respectively in the groundwater were not relatively low the lowest values in the wet season were less than the detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 in addition the concentrations of nitrate would decrease during the process of denitrification which could trigger the process of dnra our results showed that the peak concentrations of ammonium and the minimum concentrations of nitrate in the groundwater occurred simultaneously during the wet season the periods of i ii and iii fig 8b which likely induced from the dnra process therefore we infer that the dnra process probably occurred in the groundwater nitrification should also be considered in the two watersheds because of the application of urea and animal manure and the high ammonia concentration in precipitation yu et al 2017 the oxygen isotope values of the generated no3 should theoretically have a wide rage i e 5 to 15 according to the oxygen sources in the process of nitrification kendall et al 2007 li et al 2014 our results showed that the values of δ18o no3 in most of the groundwater samples and many surface water samples fell in the range of δ18o no3 resulting from microbial nitrification fig 10 a and b indicating that nitrification was an important source of nitrate in the waters of the two watersheds the theoretically incorporated δ18o values of the water were further calculated using the measured δ18o values in the nitrate via the formula δ18o h2o 3 2 δ18o no3 1 3 δ18o o2 to identify the locations of the nitrification process stoewer et al 2015 the most calculated δ18o values in the surface and groundwater fell within the δ18o ranges of precipitation 44 2 81 3 and soil water 22 3 44 table s6 therefore we concluded that nitrification of the upper soil horizons was an important source of nitrate in the surface and groundwater however 25 and 8 of the calculated δ18o values in the dry and snowmelt seasons respectively matched the measured isotope range of groundwater indicating that nitrification likely occurred in the groundwater the findings further verified the slopes of δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 were greater than 1 during the dry and snowmelt seasons 4 2 2 nitrate sources of the surface and groundwater the surface water showed a wide range of nitrate isotope values which indicated that the surface water nitrate originated from varied and mixed sources e g nitrate fertilizers soil ammonium and manure and septic waste fig 11a meghdadi and javar 2018 groundwater is the main source of base flow during the dry period and thus many of the nitrate isotopes in the surface water samples were similar to those in the groundwater in addition compared with the natural watershed the dammed watershed showed high values of δ18o no3 and lower values of δ15n no3 in the surface water which indicated that atmospheric n deposition and nitrate fertilizers might be the crucial sources of nitrate in the surface water especially during the wet and snowmelt seasons fig 11a table s5 wang et al 2016 there may be two reasons for this phenomenon the effects of the new flat farmland and the dams and reservoirs in the treated watershed regarding the first reason the newly created farmland separated the drainage channels and the local settlements in the dammed watershed fig 2b and fig 12 a thus organic pollutants from human and domestic animals were not directly transported to the surface water however the drainage channels in the original landform before the glc project and in the natural watershed were near the local settlements fig 2 and fig 12 and manure and septic waste could be easily transported to the streams regarding the second reason reservoirs are the well known nonpoint pollution sinks yu et al 2017 previous studies have demonstrated that valley reshaping and agricultural land consolidation increase the precipitation infiltration which consequently increases the nitrate leaching from agricultural inputs jin et al 2019 yu 2019 nitrate would leach down to the reservoir through subsurface flow overall the surface water in the dammed watershed could be more influenced by agricultural practices compared to the surface water in the natural watershed the results of this study showed that most of the nitrate in the groundwater originated from the topsoil nitrification and nitrate leaching in the two watersheds and that there was relatively little variation among the different seasons fig 10 fig 11b moreover denitrification and dnra processes in the wet season could affect the nitrate concentrations and isotope signatures the similar isotope characteristics and biogeochemical processes of the two watersheds showed that there was likely no difference in the sources of groundwater nitrate another important factor was the area ratio between the glc created valley farmland and the total area of the watershed the area ratio was 0 09 in the dammed watershed thus we assumed that the contribution of nitrate from the farmland to the groundwater was limited however there may be a time lag between the leaching of the anthropogenic nitrate and the groundwater response in places where the unsaturated vadose zone is thick wei et al 2017 huang et al 2013 reported that the time lag between land use change and the groundwater quality response could be as long as a hundred years due to the considerable buffering capacity of the thick unsaturated zone therefore we concluded that the glc project currently has little influence on the groundwater nitrate however the time lag should be considered in the future 4 3 the implications of valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation on nitrate pollution agricultural land consolidation has been implemented in many countries worldwide jiang et al 2015 pašakarnis et al 2013 liu and li 2017 however whether valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation projects induce nitrate pollution has not been well addressed especially in remote rural areas to fully understand how these projects alter nitrate contamination in waters the characteristics of nitrate including its content biogeochemical processes and sources should be considered this study is a pioneering attempt to quantify the impacts of agricultural land consolidation on nitrate levels addressing the knowledge gap our study showed that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation can alleviate nitrate pollution and that dams and reservoirs would play a key role in controlling the concentrations of water nitrate many studies have demonstrated that n is removed in large reservoirs in the river systems because large reservoirs offer ideal conditions for n burial in sediments or loss via the n cycle harrison et al 2009 liu et al 2009 li et al 2014 investigated the spatiotemporal variations and stable isotope signatures of nitrate in a dammed river and found that water nitrate can be consumed by the processes of assimilation and or denitrification in reservoirs therefore the dam reservoir system in small watersheds has the potential to mitigate the risk of nitrate pollution which has significant implications for agricultural watershed management and nitrate regulation in rural areas although the quality of the groundwater was not noticeably affected by the anthropogenic nitrate our results demonstrated that nitrate in the groundwater e g the wells in the newly created farmlands trended to receive more inputs of agricultural pollution in the dammed watershed than the natural watershed fig 6a moreover the annual rate of n fertilizer application is 234 kg n ha 1 which is much higher than the recommended annual application rate of 66 92 kg n ha 1on the clp dai et al 2015 our results also showed that there were a few nitrification processes in the groundwater indicating that a part of the n fertilizers is first leached into the groundwater and then nitrified to nitrate the reservoir is a net sink of n organic matter and sediments however this sink could change into a net source of n if the environmental conditions changed kraus et al 2011 therefore the risk of groundwater pollution in the dammed watershed will increase in the future due to the continuous input of agricultural fertilizers in the valley to safeguard the quality of drinking water fertilizer application should be shorten to a reasonable level in the dammed watershed meanwhile the long term monitoring of the water quality in the valley should be strengthened 5 conclusion the results of this study demonstrated that valley reshaping damming and agricultural land consolidation increased the agricultural nitrate input in the watershed but decreased the nitrate concentrations in the surface water through changing the transformation and transportation processes of nitrate newly created farmlands and reservoirs had critical effects on the surface water nitrate levels in the dammed watershed mineral fertilizers were important sources of surface water nitrate in the intensely managed watershed and the reservoirs built along the reshaped valley reduced element concentrations and consumed nitrate from different sources although the current groundwater had not been influenced noticeably by glc projects in the dammed watershed the time lag between agricultural land consolidation and groundwater quality response should be considered in the future we suggest that a reasonable level of n application should be implemented in the dammed watershed to maintain the high quality of the surface and groundwater credit

5653,heavy metal hm pollution is a serious and urgent issue in integrated watershed management in china and worldwide determining effective management strategies for pollution control requires quantification of input and output metal fluxes and the inherent uncertainties process based metal models can simulate the metal movement on a watershed scale providing essential information for metal budget however there has been little effort to quantify the uncertainties in metal flux simulations in this work we modified the previously developed swat hm soil and water assessment tool heavy metal model by adding two external model inputs atmospheric deposition and agricultural source input and one process based module plant uptake we then linked the modified model with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup for stochastic calibration and uncertainty analysis the modified swat hm was used to model the fluxes of primary inputs and outputs of zinc zn in both uplands soil and channel bed sediment in the upper liuyang river watershed in south central china to calibrate the model with uncertainty analysis we used six years of daily streamflow daily sediment load and daily zn load at monthly frequency at the watershed outlet in the upland phase we identified zn input from atmospheric deposition and zn output through soil erosion as the most significant fluxes in the channel phase bed sediment was the critical zn sink receiving 5 100 to 42 000 kg yr 1 zn the method used in swat hm calibration and uncertainty analysis is general with potential application to similar settings in the world keywords heavy metal flux mass balance watershed system sensitivity analysis 1 introduction heavy metal hm pollution in soil and water from both natural and anthropogenic sources presents a significant threat to ecosystem services and human health across the world a metal budget assessment can provide critical information to policymakers regarding pollution prevention and remediation strategies metal budgets summarize inputs and outputs of metals from a defined environmental system over a specific period in this paper we focus on metal budgets of watershed systems inputs of metals to a watershed system may occur naturally from weathering of parent rocks or anthropogenic activities such as mining industry and agriculture meanwhile the output pathways of metals include surface runoff subsurface leaching lateral flow soil erosion and plant uptake in contrast to the numerous field monitoring studies conducted all over the world bengtsson et al 2006 six and smolders 2014 very few modeling efforts are performed to assess hm balance monitoring data is the basis for most assessments of hm budget which often does not adequately address all the primary input and output pathways and their uncertainties for example input processes not considered are the influence of livestock manure jiang et al 2014 xia et al 2014 and soil erosion shi et al 2019 while often only drainage water is taken into consideration as the primary output flux salman et al 2017 in modeling studies correct neglect abbaspour et al 2018 is allowed however neglect of influential processes could lead to significant bias in delineating hm mass flows and consequently mislead the decision making published data on the measured hm in the environment e g metal fluxes in surface runoff the metal content of eroded soil and the concentration of metals in leached flow is often somewhat scarce or inaccurate this partially reflects the difficulties in field sampling and the variability of hm output fluxes both in space and time bengtsson 2006 gray 2017 peraza castro et al 2016 quinton and catt 2007 tao 2003 therefore it is imperative to develop new methods to model the environmental behavior of metals at the watershed scale and to support soil and water quality management thereupon fu et al 2019 to better understand the environmental behavior of heavy metals and the associated risks process based metal models are increasingly used at the watershed scale du 2019 meng 2018 velleux et al 2006 vink and peters 2003 these models can simulate long term mass balances of different metal species in the environmental system and offer an alternative to the monitoring of metal budgets with an in stream component these models also address the transport and transformation and hence the budget analysis of metals in river channels however the watershed water quality models for metals like all other models have an inherent inability to represent precisely how nature works and hence are associated with uncertainties originating from process simplifications inaccurately measured input data and un measurable parameters therefore uncertainty becomes an essential issue in modeling in general and hm accounting in particular many existing hm models do not consider uncertainty in their prediction du 2019 jiao 2014 qiao 2019 shrestha et al 2018 meng et al 2018 developed a heavy metal model coupled to the soil and water assessment tool swat heavy metal or swat hm to simulate the fate and transport of metals at the watershed scale to better simulate the metal budget analysis in this study we modified the previously demonstrated swat hm model by allowing for the external model inputs of heavy metals such as atmospheric deposition fertilizer and livestock manure application and their plant uptake from the soil to account for the uncertainty of model prediction we coupled the modified swat hm model with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2013 we then applied the model to the upper liuyang river watershed in china to quantify the zn fluxes and their input and output uncertainties so the final metal budget together with its uncertainty can provide better information to the environmental managers to make a more informed decision the application of watershed scale hydrology and water quality models such as swat hm profoundly depends on the proper calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2013 beven and binley 1992 traditional methods of calibration aim at finding an optimal set of parameter values that represent the watershed processes duan et al 1992 however when dealing with complex models with limited data calibration approaches lead to several significantly different parameter sets with similar calibration results known as equifinality traditionally the best parameter set was selected and reported ignoring model uncertainty and misleading the decision making these considerations prompted the development of uncertainty analysis techniques and methods of decision making under uncertainty during the past decades various uncertainty analysis techniques have been developed to account for the uncertainties yang et al 2008 compared five typical uncertainty analysis techniques used in hydrological researches namely generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue parameter solution parasol sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 and a bayesian framework implemented using markov chain monte carlo mcmc and importance sampling is techniques they concluded that the canonical approach of bayesian inference is computationally expensive whereas sufi 2 needs the smallest number of model runs to achieve a similarly good calibration and prediction uncertainty results to take the advantage of sufi 2 in computation efficiency which is critical for complex hydrological and water quality models we chose sufi 2 to couple with the swat hm model abbaspour 2007 abbaspour et al 2004 whereby the simulated metal budgets brought about by behavioral parameter sets beven and binley 1992 are used to represent the metal budget uncertainty the aims of this study were to 1 develop a model based approach amenable to the evaluation of uncertainties in the metal budget assessment and 2 compile a detailed inventory of the inputs and outputs of zn for the study watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and metal pollution xiang river runs northward through the hunan province and makes its basin one of the major rice growing regions in china meanwhile the basin has abundant nonferrous metal and nonmetallic mineral ores and has become the most distinguishable heavy metal contaminated area in china du 2013 liu 2012 liu et al 2005 zhao 2015 lei et al 2008 in 2011 the state council of china invested 9 8 billion us dollars in the xiang river basin control plan for heavy metal pollution thus it is crucial to investigate the balance of input and output fluxes of heavy metals for sustainable soil and water quality management in this region in this study we selected the upper liuyang river ulr watershed located in the northeastern of the xiang river basin as a case study area fig 1 one of the major tributaries in ulr watershed is the baoshan river which runs through the qibaoshan mine the historical and current mining activities in the qibaoshan mining area have generated substantial amounts of mine wastes which are widely distributed across the qibaoshan area weathering and erosion of the abandoned mine wastes are intense due to the humid subtropical climate with an annual precipitation of 1 550 mm and an annual mean temperature of 17 5 c there are 9 soil types in the study area and the dominant soil type is red loam with occasional scattered yellow loam these loam soils have weak acidity and low organic content which enhances the solubility and mobility of metals hence the sediments in the baoshan river and the nearby soils are severely polluted dai et al 2005 moreover this watershed has an approximately 10 paddy field the fertilizers and livestock manures contribute considerable amounts of metals to the local environment for example several heavy metals especially cd were found to accumulate in rice and ramie around the mining sites wei et al 2011 dai et al 2005 2 2 model description 2 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is a process based continuous simulation watershed model which has been widely used around the world to evaluate the effects of alternative management decisions on water resources and point and non point source pollutions arnold et al 2012 in swat a watershed is divided into multiple subbasins which are then further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that consist of unique land cover soil type and slope class swat simulates the land phase of the hydrologic cycle plant growth and sediment movement for each hru which controls the amount of water sediment delivered to the main channel in each sub basin the resulting flow and load are then routed through the channel network of the watershed to the basin outlet 2 2 2 swat hm model meng et al 2018 coupled swat with a heavy metal model to simulate the fate and transport of hm at the watershed scale swat hm provides a process based representation of the metal behavior from uplands to streams and down to the watershed outlet the supplementary information fig s1 illustrates a schematic diagram of the main processes upland and channel processes of the swat hm swat hm operates at a daily time step tracking the stores and fluxes of dissolved and particulate metals in both the land and in stream phases of a catchment the sub models are briefly described below while in section 1 of the supplementary information we present more specific processes and equations of the upland and channel metal module 2 2 2 1 the upland phase of metal processes in the upland phase swat hm divides metals into 3 pools dissolved metal in soil aqueous phase labile metal in soil solid phase and non labile metal in soil solid phase we consider in swat hm an equilibrium based sorption reaction between the dissolved metal and labile metal and a rate determined slow aging reaction between labile and non labile metals in the model metal is allowed to move vertically between soil layers through leaching and evaporation induced capillary flow and to move horizontally from the upland to the stream via surface runoff lateral flow and eroded soil plant uptake of metals is modeled using a plant uptake factor puf method swartjes 2011 as mentioned above the inputs outputs and storage of metals are calculated at the hru level metal outputs from all the hrus within a subbasin are summed to provide total metal load from that subbasin to the corresponding river channel in addition the weathering of waste rocks atmospheric deposition fertilizers and livestock manures are added as external model inputs 2 2 2 2 the channel phase of metal processes the aquatic hm routine simulates the fate and transport of hm in the stream and other water bodies in the channel swat hm assumes a well mixed layer of water column overlying a bed of sediment layer and simulates the water column and streambed processes separately in the water column the metal is present as dissolved metal in the aqueous phase and particulate metal labile and non labile in suspended sediments in the stream bed the metal is present as dissolved metal in the pore water of bed sediment labile metal in bed sediment and non labile metal in bed sediment mass balance equations are calculated for each reach segment each river reach receives all the point and non point source loads from the corresponding subbasin the hm from inflow to outflow could undergo various conversions such as diffusion burial settling and re suspension the concentration gradient drives the diffusion of dissolved metal from the water column to the riverbed pore water lick 2008 burial is the process by which particulate metal moves from the active sediment layer to the deeper sediment the settling and re suspension of heavy metal in the suspended sediment and bed sediment phase depend on the sediment dynamics 2 3 model setup and parameterization using a threshold drainage area of 15 km2 we divided the ulr watershed into 79 subbasins based on the 8 landuse 9 soil type and 2 slope classes the 79 subbasins provided 1 354 hrus table 1 all metal inputs came from point sources and non point sources point sources are the inputs coming directly from the discharge of industrial wastewater non point sources are inputs from atmospheric deposition inputs from weathering of waste rocks and inputs from fertilizers and livestock manures swat hm adds the point source loads to the inlets of reaches receiving the discharge and apportions the nonpoint source loads to the soil of each hru in the study area a total of three factories provide point source loads we averaged their loads based on the quarterly sampling during 2014 2016 and assumed to be the same during 2008 2013 to calculate atmospheric deposition we used the annual rate of total atmospheric deposition 760 5 g ha 1 yr 1 reported by ke 2015 the total atmospheric deposition was monitored from november 2011 to october 2012 in the liuyang monitoring site located in the southwest corner of the ulr watershed and far from industrial emission sources we applied a constant deposition rate during the study years 2008 2016 using the reported number as a surrogate no information about the metal content of fertilizers and livestock manures in the study area was available so the agricultural source annual inputs 796 4 g ha 1 y 1 for the yangtze river delta reported by hou 2014 luo et al 2009 were used as a surrogate for ulr because the yangtze river delta shares similar climate and agricultural practices with ulr it should be noted that both the atmospheric deposition and agricultural sources are treated as uncertain external inputs and the literature reported numbers are used as prior information and the final values are obtained through model calibration conditioned on the local observations as elaborated in subsection 2 4 to calculate waste rocks weathering we regarded the spatially scattered abandoned waste rock dumps as nonpoint sources these sites were first identified through visual interpretation of remote sensing rs images worldview 2 and further validated through field investigation the fraction of waste rock source areas in an hru was derived by overlying the rs images and the hru raster and calculating the intercepted areas for the metal content of the waste rocks we used the data from dai et al 2005 the metal released from weathering of waste rocks were added to the metal pool of the first soil layer in the hrus having waste rock sources to estimate the initial soil metal concentration we used the information from soil samples taken in different landuses mining area forest and paddy field by meng et al 2018 yu and wang 2014 to calibrate and validate the hydrological and water quality models we used six year consecutive daily streamflow consecutive daily sediment load and regularly sampled once a month total zn load data at the watershed outlet the southwest corner in fig 1 from 2011 to 2016 to quantify the zn fluxes in different pathways we used zn load not zn concertation to calibrate the model the zn load was calculated by multiplying the observed zn concentration and the streamflow on the sampling day we took the needed data from the reports of the hydrology bureau of hunan province full details of sampling protocol and analytical methods are given in china standards gb 50179 93 gb 50159 92 gb 7475 87 the swat hm model ran on a daily time step for 9 years we used the period of 2008 2010 for warm up 2011 2013 for calibration and 2014 2016 for validation 2 4 model calibration and uncertainty analysis we chose the widely used sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour 2007 abbaspour et al 2004 algorithm for calibration and uncertainty analysis this algorithm maps all sources of uncertainties e g parameter conceptual model input into parameter uncertainty which are delineated as parameter ranges in sufi 2 the prior information or knowledge are harnessed to prepare a suite of initial parameter ranges which are then iteratively narrowed down to the final refined parameter ranges in each iteration the parameter ranges get smaller zooming on a region of the parameter space which produced better results than the previous iteration then each parameter set of the final iteration is assessed as either behavioral or non behavioral through a comparison of the likelihood measure with a selected threshold value beven and binley 1992 finally prediction uncertainty is described by quantiles of the cumulative distribution realized from the behavioral parameter sets details of the sufi 2 algorithm can be found in section 2 of the supplementary information and the swat cup program suitable for the swat hm model is available upon request 2 4 1 characterizing different sources of uncertainty assessing the prediction uncertainty of watershed water quality models is very important for using these numerical models to support management decision making specifically prediction uncertainty arises due to process simplification in the model structure unknown parameters representing site characteristics input data driving the model and the observations used for calibration abbaspour 2013 below we discuss the strategies that we applied to deal with these multiple sources of uncertainties first parameter uncertainty is treated explicitly by assigning the initial parameter ranges prior distributions swat and swat hm are semi distributed watershed models where many parameters are distributed parameters that have different values in spatial units e g hru wide solid solution partition coefficient in soil k d1 to limit the number of model parameters we use aggregate parameters to modify distributed parameters yang et al 2007 with this concept distributed parameters are changed by additively or multiplicatively modifying their initial spatially varying values these ranges are either absolute parameter values or relative changes to the actual parameter values for example the solid solution partition coefficient in soil k d1 in different hrus were first initialized with the established formula logk d1 2 48 0 69ph 0 67log soc which represents the spatial characteristics of k d1 through spatially varying ph and soc soil organic carbon this parameter was adjusted by a corresponding multiplicative factor to reflect the intrinsic spatial variability for the watershed water quality models the primary inputs are pollutant loads from various sources e g wastewater treatment plant fertilizer use atmospheric deposition data resolution of these pollutant loads both temporal and spatial is a crucial source of uncertainty in this study a load adjustment coefficient is assigned to each pollutant input to represent the input data uncertainty zheng and keller 2007 these load adjustment coefficients are specific model parameters that quantify the uncertainty in pollutant inputs for example we assigned an adjustment range to the reference zn input rate 760 5 g ha 1 yr 1 for total atmospheric deposition however it should be noted that load adjustment coefficients can only explain a specific portion of input uncertainty in the watershed water quality modeling there always exist practical issues about what is modeled and what is measured for example most watershed scale models including swat hm run on a daily time step and generate daily mean values however most water quality measurements are grab samples which only represent the values at the time and location of sampling these instantaneous data are often assumed to represent the daily mean values although many studies have shown that metal concentrations can vary notably within a day aubert et al 2014 kirchner and neal 2013 in this study we assume that the once a month sampled zn concentration data represents the average value for that sampling day to account for the corresponding measurement errors we assumed 10 20 and 30 error in streamflow sediment load and measured metal load respectively harmel et al 2006 to the authors knowledge although not accurate the assumed measurement errors are still reasonable and safe model structural uncertainty is implicitly considered in this study as sufi 2 maps all sources of uncertainties parameter model structure input etc onto the parameters and aims to capture most of the measured data within the prediction uncertainty bound if prediction bounds include most of the observed data it means that parameter ranges can account for all sources of error and thus account for the total output uncertainty 2 4 2 the procedure of the sufi 2 approach step 1 a total of 32 parameters were used in the uncertainty analysis the adjustment method the initial and final ranges of these parameters are listed in table 2 the form of the objective function may affect the final results kouchi et al 2017 king gupta efficiency kge was introduced by gupta et al 2009 as an improvement of the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency brighenti et al 2019 also suggests using kge as the objective function in the simultaneous multi variable calibration when sediment is included in this study we used kge in eq 1 for the tri variate simultaneous calibration namely streamflow suspended sediment load and metal load the final objective function in eq 2 was formulated as the sum of kges of each variable i e streamflow sediment load and metal load kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient between observed and simulated values α is the measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β is the bias normalized by the standard deviation in the observed values kge ranges from to 1 and the ideal value is 1 g j 1 3 w j k g e j where w js are weights of the three variables here we set all w js to 1 step 2 the initial parameter ranges are updated iteratively the details of the sufi 2 algorithm can be found in abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 seeks to bracket most of the measured data with the smallest possible uncertainty band the p factor and r factor are the two uncertainty measures offered by sufi 2 to judge the reliability and precision of the model prediction the p factor is the fraction of measured data plus its measurement error bracketed by the 95ppu band and varies from 0 to 1 the r factor on the other hand is the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured variable representing model uncertainty step 3 in the final iteration each iteration has 2000 model runs where acceptable values of r factor and p factor are reached different performance measures and behavioral criteria were used to investigate their influence on the outcome of the uncertainty analysis as moriasi et al 2015 recommended swat model performance for nutrients simulations can be judged as good if the monthly coefficient of determination r 2 0 30 nash sutcliff efficiency ns 0 35 and percent bias pbias 30 these performance evaluation criteria were used for zn simulations to retain the behavioral simulations 2 5 uncertainty based heavy metal balance calculation using all the behavioral simulations derived from section 2 4 the primary input and output zn fluxes both in the upland soil and channel bed sediment and their uncertainty 95 confidence interval were quantified the heavy metal balances of soil and bed sediment are then calculated using eq 3 δ m m input m output 2 6 sensitivity analysis for the swat hm parameters for the purpose of understanding the dominant processes for metal loads we made a sensitivity analysis separately after the stochastic calibration with the sufi 2 algorithm we only adjusted the totally 13 hm parameters and kept the swat parameters at their best values as calibrated in subsection 2 4 in this sensitivity analysis the objective function was defined as the pbias between the observed and the simulated total zn load at the watershed outlet a multiple linear regression method was used which regresses the latin hypercube generated parameters against the values of the objective function a t test is then used to identify the relative significance of each parameter the larger in absolute value of the t stat and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter is details of the sensitivity analysis method can be found in section 2 of the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of model performance the model was run 2000 times in the final sufi 2 iteration creating 2000 latin hypercube sampled parameter sets 2000 simulations we used multiple statistical indices r 2 ns pbias p factor r factor in table 3 as well as graphical analyses time series plots and scatter plots to evaluate the model performance both the best simulation and all the 2000 simulations were examined regarding the best simulation visual inspection fig 2 and fig 3 shows a good match of the observed in red and the best simulated in blue streamflow sediment load and total metal load time series with respect to all the 2000 simulations the p factor of daily streamflow was 71 while the r factor had a value of 0 55 in the simulation period for daily sediment load only 31 of the monitored data was bracketed by the 95ppu r factor was 0 26 however on the monthly scale fig 4 the p factors for sediment was 0 68 a closer examination identified the reason for small p factor to be the quick runoff concentration of ulr watershed i e concentration ends within less than 24 h therefore a precipitation event occurring late in a day is actually assigned by the model to that day whereas the observed hydrographic and water quality response frequently occur one day after the precipitation peak the calibrated model gave acceptable results for total zn load with 53 of the monitored data bracketed by the relatively narrow 95ppu r factor was to 0 41 the values of ns pbias and r 2 of zn load manifested by the 2000 simulations were further investigated ns ranged from 0 15 to 0 88 pbias extended from 0 51 to 0 73 covering both the negative and the positive ranges substantially r 2 stayed relative narrower from 0 56 to 0 89 for each of the 3 performance measures the majority of the values stand coherently to make a high density region with a small proportion trailing off on both sides fig 5 according to the behavioral criteria of moriasi et al 2015 four different groups of behavioral simulations were defined 1 group 1 2000 behavioral simulations with r 2 0 3 2 group 2 1937 behavioral simulations with ns 0 35 3 group 3 1320 behavioral simulations with pbias 30 and 4 group 4 1292 behavioral simulations with r 2 0 3 ns 0 35 and pbias 30 3 2 uncertainty based metal budget assessment 3 2 1 upland metal balance we compared the net zn balance in the upland soils of ulr watershed using the four groups of behavioral simulations fig 6 a in group 1 the simulated net zn fluxes of soil were found to range from 1 014 g ha 1 yr 1 to 648 g ha 1 yr 1 with a 63 probability to be positive the more likely enrichment of zn in the soil 63 65 50 and 51 for group 1 group 2 group 3 and group 4 respectively whichever is greater than 50 implies an increased risk of metal pollution in the ulr watershed the behavioral criteria should be carefully determined because they could affect the results of uncertainty estimation therefore we select group 4 as being more reliable because every behavior simulation in this group meets all the performance criteria mentioned in moriasi et al 2015 based on the behavioral simulations of group 4 we calculated the ranges 95 confidence interval of inputs and outputs fluxes of zn in the upland of ulr watershed fig 6b the zn fluxes from the three input pathways were 803 905 g ha 1 yr 1 from atmospheric deposition 94 123 g ha 1 yr 1 from fertilizers and livestock manures application and 20 39 g ha 1 yr 1 from waste rocks weathering fig 6 at the entire basin level atmospheric deposition accounted for most of input fluxes 83 3 88 9 which agrees with the finding of yi et al 2018 in hunan province of china xia et al 2014 in heilongjiang northeastern china and reimann et al 2000 in the kola peninsula although the mining area 63 ha is much smaller compared to the agricultural area 2 657 ha the contribution of zn inputs from agriculture 9 1 13 0 was on the average 3 8 times larger than that of rock weathering 1 9 4 1 the output fluxes of zn from the upland entering the stream were estimated to be 94 288 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn in surface runoff 88 368 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn in lateral flow and 233 786 g ha 1 yr 1 of particulate zn through eroded soil there were also 60 519 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn leached out of soil profile and 13 20 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn has been taken up by plants the small fraction of plant uptake is corroborated by gandois et al 2010 who found a plant uptake share of less than 5 in north eastern france relatively high model uncertainty was associated with particulate zn flux through soil erosion resulting from the uncertainty in the sediment load analysis of the simulated output fluxes revealed a considerable monthly variation in total zn output fig 7 with the maximum occurring in july and the minimum in january such between month variation is predominantly a reflection of the precipitation amount fluctuation since the monthly zn output fluxes as the total or pertaining to each pathway except plant uptake are found to have high correlations with the monthly precipitation fig s2 zinc output from soil erosion varied considerably over time and dominated the zn output during the rainy seasons in july for instance soil erosion accounted for 66 of the total output so soil erosion control could be an effective remediation measure especially in rainy seasons although the majority of zn loads from upland to river are of the particulate form they will partly transform into dissolved species bioavailable species after re equilibration in the river reaches in contrast metal output with lateral flow became the main pathway during the dry period percolation leaching is the only pathway that transported the metal from soil profile into groundwater and accounted for 19 of the total zn output 3 2 2 metal balance in channel the reduction of pollutant loads in rivers requires a good understanding of the contribution of all point and non point sources as shown in the baoshan river basin mining area baoshan river received 11 500 kg yr 1 21 and 44 000 kg yr 1 79 of dissolved zn from the point and non point sources respectively indicating the predominance of diffuse metal inputs 79 from the upland to the stream china has seen marked decreases from point sources with the improved installation and performance of wastewater treatment facilities for example in the xiang river basin control plan for heavy metal pollution the number of enterprises involved in heavy metal pollution was reduced by 50 from 2008 to 2015 however many surface waters especially in the mining impacted watersheds still suffer from severe heavy metal pollution mainly due to the complicated non point source inputs to achieve further reductions in river water metal concentrations both point and diffuse source metal inputs to the water bodies should be reduced examination of the zn dynamics in the interface of the water column and bed sediment in the simulation period from 2011 to 2016 indicated 16 40 000 kg yr 1 zn had settled onto the bed sediment and 49 6 500 kg yr 1 zn had resuspended into the water column fig 8 b net flux of 4 100 11 000 kg yr 1 dissolved zn was transported from the water column to the pore water of bed sediment at the same time 36 000 55 000 kg yr 1 zn was transported from the active sediment layer to the deeper layer based on the balance calculation using group 4 fig 8a the net zn balance of bed sediment ranged from 5 100 to 42 000 kg yr 1 the unanimously considerable positive fluxes of the behavioral simulations of the four groups identified the bed sediment as a critical zn sink in the aquatic environment of the ulr basin 3 3 the sensitivity of the swat hm parameters seven out of a total of 13 hm parameters table 4 were found to be sensitive p 0 05 these 13 metal parameters can be grouped into three categories related to input processes i a i f i p and rw upland processes k d1 puf k 1 k 1 and ε and channel processes k d2 k d3 v d and v b among the input fluxes metal input flux by atmospheric deposition ia was found to be the most influential factor this indicates that the deposition of zn onto the soil surface is critical to the total metal load of the watershed outlet as a comparison the weathering rate r w was not sensitive one possible explanation is that here we chose daily zn load at the watershed outlet to make the objective function so the weathering of waste rocks in the mining area was rendered insignificant which plays a long term role to provide a critical input to the specific mining area the high sensitivity to atmospheric deposition input also implies the needs for a denser monitoring network for the mining area and improved estimation of the atmospheric deposition reflecting integratively the effects of land surface and meteorological characteristics in the upland processes enrichment ratio ε was the most sensitive parameter which highlights the contribution of soil erosion to the total zn load the slow reaction rate k 1 and k 1 and solid solution partition coefficient in soil k d1 were also crucial parameters indicating the chemical reactions in the upland play an essential role in the zn transport for the channel processes the transport parameters v d and v b were more sensitive than the transformation parameters k d2 and k d3 this selection indicated that in the channel phase physical transport has more impact on the total zn load than chemical transformation 3 4 implications for environmental management practices a comprehensive watershed modeling of the physical chemical and biological watershed processes can support the implementation of environmental management practices to reduce excessive pollutant loads in this study we used the swat hm model to identify critical watershed processes by conducting sensitivity analysis and uncertainty based metal budget assessment in order to subsequently providing a preliminary selection of potentially effective management practices the sensitivity analysis of the metal parameters identified transport of zn with eroded sediments to streams as the predominant process in the ulr watershed a similar result was observed in the metal budget assessment as zn output through soil erosion was identified as the most significant flux also the annual sediment and particulate zn loads in the streams are often the results of only a few major storm events during the year therefore storm based soil erosion control could be an effective prevention measure in practice the conservation operations implemented on the upland especially mining waste sites such as revegetation and erosion control will be useful to mitigate erosion loads from storm events on the other hand the bed sediment was identified to be a vital zn sink so the long term accumulation of zn in stream sediment bed may continue to affect the river ecosystem long after upland remediation measures have been implemented restoration of the metal polluted bed sediment especially those of the highly polluted river channels should be simultaneously implemented with other mitigation measures 4 conclusion and perspective a better understanding of the metal budget in a watershed system is critical to evaluate the current pollution status and develop effective management strategies in this study we modified and applied the watershed scale heavy metal model swat hm to the upper liuyang river basin in china and assessed the zn balances both in the upland soil and channel bed sediment the estimation of the predictive uncertainty to grasp the uncertainties both inherent in the model and in the external inputs gains more importance as the model predictions are increasingly being used as a scientific basis for supporting decisions in the context of environmental management the computationally efficient sufi 2 approach was used in this study to estimate the predictive uncertainties of metal fluxes based on multiple behavioral simulations the major input and output zn fluxes and their uncertainties in the study watershed were quantified in the upland phase zn input from atmospheric deposition and zn output through soil erosion were identified as the largest fluxes in the channel phase the bed sediment was identified as the most important zn sink these results suggest two environmental management strategies first soil erosion control could be an imperative and effective remediation measure second restoration of the metal polluted bed sediment especially those of the highly polluted river channels should be simultaneously implemented with other mitigation measures nonetheless the effort to identify environmental management strategies under uncertainty should not be replace other efforts to reduce uncertainties increasing the frequency of monitoring data extending the use of remote sensing data and collecting more management related information such as site specific agricultural applicate rate will improve the calibration by narrowing down the model parameters ranges and consequently refine the metal budget estimation in addition the swat hm model needs to be upgraded to reflect recent advantages and to include more processes to support a more robust environmental management for example extending the swat hm model to include a groundwater metal module or alternatively connecting it to an established groundwater metal model and refining the metal behavior modeling in paddy land will be important for better budgeting metals in a watershed credit authorship contribution statement lingfeng zhou conceptualization methodology writing original draft yaobin

5653,heavy metal hm pollution is a serious and urgent issue in integrated watershed management in china and worldwide determining effective management strategies for pollution control requires quantification of input and output metal fluxes and the inherent uncertainties process based metal models can simulate the metal movement on a watershed scale providing essential information for metal budget however there has been little effort to quantify the uncertainties in metal flux simulations in this work we modified the previously developed swat hm soil and water assessment tool heavy metal model by adding two external model inputs atmospheric deposition and agricultural source input and one process based module plant uptake we then linked the modified model with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup for stochastic calibration and uncertainty analysis the modified swat hm was used to model the fluxes of primary inputs and outputs of zinc zn in both uplands soil and channel bed sediment in the upper liuyang river watershed in south central china to calibrate the model with uncertainty analysis we used six years of daily streamflow daily sediment load and daily zn load at monthly frequency at the watershed outlet in the upland phase we identified zn input from atmospheric deposition and zn output through soil erosion as the most significant fluxes in the channel phase bed sediment was the critical zn sink receiving 5 100 to 42 000 kg yr 1 zn the method used in swat hm calibration and uncertainty analysis is general with potential application to similar settings in the world keywords heavy metal flux mass balance watershed system sensitivity analysis 1 introduction heavy metal hm pollution in soil and water from both natural and anthropogenic sources presents a significant threat to ecosystem services and human health across the world a metal budget assessment can provide critical information to policymakers regarding pollution prevention and remediation strategies metal budgets summarize inputs and outputs of metals from a defined environmental system over a specific period in this paper we focus on metal budgets of watershed systems inputs of metals to a watershed system may occur naturally from weathering of parent rocks or anthropogenic activities such as mining industry and agriculture meanwhile the output pathways of metals include surface runoff subsurface leaching lateral flow soil erosion and plant uptake in contrast to the numerous field monitoring studies conducted all over the world bengtsson et al 2006 six and smolders 2014 very few modeling efforts are performed to assess hm balance monitoring data is the basis for most assessments of hm budget which often does not adequately address all the primary input and output pathways and their uncertainties for example input processes not considered are the influence of livestock manure jiang et al 2014 xia et al 2014 and soil erosion shi et al 2019 while often only drainage water is taken into consideration as the primary output flux salman et al 2017 in modeling studies correct neglect abbaspour et al 2018 is allowed however neglect of influential processes could lead to significant bias in delineating hm mass flows and consequently mislead the decision making published data on the measured hm in the environment e g metal fluxes in surface runoff the metal content of eroded soil and the concentration of metals in leached flow is often somewhat scarce or inaccurate this partially reflects the difficulties in field sampling and the variability of hm output fluxes both in space and time bengtsson 2006 gray 2017 peraza castro et al 2016 quinton and catt 2007 tao 2003 therefore it is imperative to develop new methods to model the environmental behavior of metals at the watershed scale and to support soil and water quality management thereupon fu et al 2019 to better understand the environmental behavior of heavy metals and the associated risks process based metal models are increasingly used at the watershed scale du 2019 meng 2018 velleux et al 2006 vink and peters 2003 these models can simulate long term mass balances of different metal species in the environmental system and offer an alternative to the monitoring of metal budgets with an in stream component these models also address the transport and transformation and hence the budget analysis of metals in river channels however the watershed water quality models for metals like all other models have an inherent inability to represent precisely how nature works and hence are associated with uncertainties originating from process simplifications inaccurately measured input data and un measurable parameters therefore uncertainty becomes an essential issue in modeling in general and hm accounting in particular many existing hm models do not consider uncertainty in their prediction du 2019 jiao 2014 qiao 2019 shrestha et al 2018 meng et al 2018 developed a heavy metal model coupled to the soil and water assessment tool swat heavy metal or swat hm to simulate the fate and transport of metals at the watershed scale to better simulate the metal budget analysis in this study we modified the previously demonstrated swat hm model by allowing for the external model inputs of heavy metals such as atmospheric deposition fertilizer and livestock manure application and their plant uptake from the soil to account for the uncertainty of model prediction we coupled the modified swat hm model with the swat calibration and uncertainty programs swat cup abbaspour 2013 we then applied the model to the upper liuyang river watershed in china to quantify the zn fluxes and their input and output uncertainties so the final metal budget together with its uncertainty can provide better information to the environmental managers to make a more informed decision the application of watershed scale hydrology and water quality models such as swat hm profoundly depends on the proper calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2013 beven and binley 1992 traditional methods of calibration aim at finding an optimal set of parameter values that represent the watershed processes duan et al 1992 however when dealing with complex models with limited data calibration approaches lead to several significantly different parameter sets with similar calibration results known as equifinality traditionally the best parameter set was selected and reported ignoring model uncertainty and misleading the decision making these considerations prompted the development of uncertainty analysis techniques and methods of decision making under uncertainty during the past decades various uncertainty analysis techniques have been developed to account for the uncertainties yang et al 2008 compared five typical uncertainty analysis techniques used in hydrological researches namely generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue parameter solution parasol sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 and a bayesian framework implemented using markov chain monte carlo mcmc and importance sampling is techniques they concluded that the canonical approach of bayesian inference is computationally expensive whereas sufi 2 needs the smallest number of model runs to achieve a similarly good calibration and prediction uncertainty results to take the advantage of sufi 2 in computation efficiency which is critical for complex hydrological and water quality models we chose sufi 2 to couple with the swat hm model abbaspour 2007 abbaspour et al 2004 whereby the simulated metal budgets brought about by behavioral parameter sets beven and binley 1992 are used to represent the metal budget uncertainty the aims of this study were to 1 develop a model based approach amenable to the evaluation of uncertainties in the metal budget assessment and 2 compile a detailed inventory of the inputs and outputs of zn for the study watershed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and metal pollution xiang river runs northward through the hunan province and makes its basin one of the major rice growing regions in china meanwhile the basin has abundant nonferrous metal and nonmetallic mineral ores and has become the most distinguishable heavy metal contaminated area in china du 2013 liu 2012 liu et al 2005 zhao 2015 lei et al 2008 in 2011 the state council of china invested 9 8 billion us dollars in the xiang river basin control plan for heavy metal pollution thus it is crucial to investigate the balance of input and output fluxes of heavy metals for sustainable soil and water quality management in this region in this study we selected the upper liuyang river ulr watershed located in the northeastern of the xiang river basin as a case study area fig 1 one of the major tributaries in ulr watershed is the baoshan river which runs through the qibaoshan mine the historical and current mining activities in the qibaoshan mining area have generated substantial amounts of mine wastes which are widely distributed across the qibaoshan area weathering and erosion of the abandoned mine wastes are intense due to the humid subtropical climate with an annual precipitation of 1 550 mm and an annual mean temperature of 17 5 c there are 9 soil types in the study area and the dominant soil type is red loam with occasional scattered yellow loam these loam soils have weak acidity and low organic content which enhances the solubility and mobility of metals hence the sediments in the baoshan river and the nearby soils are severely polluted dai et al 2005 moreover this watershed has an approximately 10 paddy field the fertilizers and livestock manures contribute considerable amounts of metals to the local environment for example several heavy metals especially cd were found to accumulate in rice and ramie around the mining sites wei et al 2011 dai et al 2005 2 2 model description 2 2 1 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is a process based continuous simulation watershed model which has been widely used around the world to evaluate the effects of alternative management decisions on water resources and point and non point source pollutions arnold et al 2012 in swat a watershed is divided into multiple subbasins which are then further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that consist of unique land cover soil type and slope class swat simulates the land phase of the hydrologic cycle plant growth and sediment movement for each hru which controls the amount of water sediment delivered to the main channel in each sub basin the resulting flow and load are then routed through the channel network of the watershed to the basin outlet 2 2 2 swat hm model meng et al 2018 coupled swat with a heavy metal model to simulate the fate and transport of hm at the watershed scale swat hm provides a process based representation of the metal behavior from uplands to streams and down to the watershed outlet the supplementary information fig s1 illustrates a schematic diagram of the main processes upland and channel processes of the swat hm swat hm operates at a daily time step tracking the stores and fluxes of dissolved and particulate metals in both the land and in stream phases of a catchment the sub models are briefly described below while in section 1 of the supplementary information we present more specific processes and equations of the upland and channel metal module 2 2 2 1 the upland phase of metal processes in the upland phase swat hm divides metals into 3 pools dissolved metal in soil aqueous phase labile metal in soil solid phase and non labile metal in soil solid phase we consider in swat hm an equilibrium based sorption reaction between the dissolved metal and labile metal and a rate determined slow aging reaction between labile and non labile metals in the model metal is allowed to move vertically between soil layers through leaching and evaporation induced capillary flow and to move horizontally from the upland to the stream via surface runoff lateral flow and eroded soil plant uptake of metals is modeled using a plant uptake factor puf method swartjes 2011 as mentioned above the inputs outputs and storage of metals are calculated at the hru level metal outputs from all the hrus within a subbasin are summed to provide total metal load from that subbasin to the corresponding river channel in addition the weathering of waste rocks atmospheric deposition fertilizers and livestock manures are added as external model inputs 2 2 2 2 the channel phase of metal processes the aquatic hm routine simulates the fate and transport of hm in the stream and other water bodies in the channel swat hm assumes a well mixed layer of water column overlying a bed of sediment layer and simulates the water column and streambed processes separately in the water column the metal is present as dissolved metal in the aqueous phase and particulate metal labile and non labile in suspended sediments in the stream bed the metal is present as dissolved metal in the pore water of bed sediment labile metal in bed sediment and non labile metal in bed sediment mass balance equations are calculated for each reach segment each river reach receives all the point and non point source loads from the corresponding subbasin the hm from inflow to outflow could undergo various conversions such as diffusion burial settling and re suspension the concentration gradient drives the diffusion of dissolved metal from the water column to the riverbed pore water lick 2008 burial is the process by which particulate metal moves from the active sediment layer to the deeper sediment the settling and re suspension of heavy metal in the suspended sediment and bed sediment phase depend on the sediment dynamics 2 3 model setup and parameterization using a threshold drainage area of 15 km2 we divided the ulr watershed into 79 subbasins based on the 8 landuse 9 soil type and 2 slope classes the 79 subbasins provided 1 354 hrus table 1 all metal inputs came from point sources and non point sources point sources are the inputs coming directly from the discharge of industrial wastewater non point sources are inputs from atmospheric deposition inputs from weathering of waste rocks and inputs from fertilizers and livestock manures swat hm adds the point source loads to the inlets of reaches receiving the discharge and apportions the nonpoint source loads to the soil of each hru in the study area a total of three factories provide point source loads we averaged their loads based on the quarterly sampling during 2014 2016 and assumed to be the same during 2008 2013 to calculate atmospheric deposition we used the annual rate of total atmospheric deposition 760 5 g ha 1 yr 1 reported by ke 2015 the total atmospheric deposition was monitored from november 2011 to october 2012 in the liuyang monitoring site located in the southwest corner of the ulr watershed and far from industrial emission sources we applied a constant deposition rate during the study years 2008 2016 using the reported number as a surrogate no information about the metal content of fertilizers and livestock manures in the study area was available so the agricultural source annual inputs 796 4 g ha 1 y 1 for the yangtze river delta reported by hou 2014 luo et al 2009 were used as a surrogate for ulr because the yangtze river delta shares similar climate and agricultural practices with ulr it should be noted that both the atmospheric deposition and agricultural sources are treated as uncertain external inputs and the literature reported numbers are used as prior information and the final values are obtained through model calibration conditioned on the local observations as elaborated in subsection 2 4 to calculate waste rocks weathering we regarded the spatially scattered abandoned waste rock dumps as nonpoint sources these sites were first identified through visual interpretation of remote sensing rs images worldview 2 and further validated through field investigation the fraction of waste rock source areas in an hru was derived by overlying the rs images and the hru raster and calculating the intercepted areas for the metal content of the waste rocks we used the data from dai et al 2005 the metal released from weathering of waste rocks were added to the metal pool of the first soil layer in the hrus having waste rock sources to estimate the initial soil metal concentration we used the information from soil samples taken in different landuses mining area forest and paddy field by meng et al 2018 yu and wang 2014 to calibrate and validate the hydrological and water quality models we used six year consecutive daily streamflow consecutive daily sediment load and regularly sampled once a month total zn load data at the watershed outlet the southwest corner in fig 1 from 2011 to 2016 to quantify the zn fluxes in different pathways we used zn load not zn concertation to calibrate the model the zn load was calculated by multiplying the observed zn concentration and the streamflow on the sampling day we took the needed data from the reports of the hydrology bureau of hunan province full details of sampling protocol and analytical methods are given in china standards gb 50179 93 gb 50159 92 gb 7475 87 the swat hm model ran on a daily time step for 9 years we used the period of 2008 2010 for warm up 2011 2013 for calibration and 2014 2016 for validation 2 4 model calibration and uncertainty analysis we chose the widely used sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 abbaspour 2007 abbaspour et al 2004 algorithm for calibration and uncertainty analysis this algorithm maps all sources of uncertainties e g parameter conceptual model input into parameter uncertainty which are delineated as parameter ranges in sufi 2 the prior information or knowledge are harnessed to prepare a suite of initial parameter ranges which are then iteratively narrowed down to the final refined parameter ranges in each iteration the parameter ranges get smaller zooming on a region of the parameter space which produced better results than the previous iteration then each parameter set of the final iteration is assessed as either behavioral or non behavioral through a comparison of the likelihood measure with a selected threshold value beven and binley 1992 finally prediction uncertainty is described by quantiles of the cumulative distribution realized from the behavioral parameter sets details of the sufi 2 algorithm can be found in section 2 of the supplementary information and the swat cup program suitable for the swat hm model is available upon request 2 4 1 characterizing different sources of uncertainty assessing the prediction uncertainty of watershed water quality models is very important for using these numerical models to support management decision making specifically prediction uncertainty arises due to process simplification in the model structure unknown parameters representing site characteristics input data driving the model and the observations used for calibration abbaspour 2013 below we discuss the strategies that we applied to deal with these multiple sources of uncertainties first parameter uncertainty is treated explicitly by assigning the initial parameter ranges prior distributions swat and swat hm are semi distributed watershed models where many parameters are distributed parameters that have different values in spatial units e g hru wide solid solution partition coefficient in soil k d1 to limit the number of model parameters we use aggregate parameters to modify distributed parameters yang et al 2007 with this concept distributed parameters are changed by additively or multiplicatively modifying their initial spatially varying values these ranges are either absolute parameter values or relative changes to the actual parameter values for example the solid solution partition coefficient in soil k d1 in different hrus were first initialized with the established formula logk d1 2 48 0 69ph 0 67log soc which represents the spatial characteristics of k d1 through spatially varying ph and soc soil organic carbon this parameter was adjusted by a corresponding multiplicative factor to reflect the intrinsic spatial variability for the watershed water quality models the primary inputs are pollutant loads from various sources e g wastewater treatment plant fertilizer use atmospheric deposition data resolution of these pollutant loads both temporal and spatial is a crucial source of uncertainty in this study a load adjustment coefficient is assigned to each pollutant input to represent the input data uncertainty zheng and keller 2007 these load adjustment coefficients are specific model parameters that quantify the uncertainty in pollutant inputs for example we assigned an adjustment range to the reference zn input rate 760 5 g ha 1 yr 1 for total atmospheric deposition however it should be noted that load adjustment coefficients can only explain a specific portion of input uncertainty in the watershed water quality modeling there always exist practical issues about what is modeled and what is measured for example most watershed scale models including swat hm run on a daily time step and generate daily mean values however most water quality measurements are grab samples which only represent the values at the time and location of sampling these instantaneous data are often assumed to represent the daily mean values although many studies have shown that metal concentrations can vary notably within a day aubert et al 2014 kirchner and neal 2013 in this study we assume that the once a month sampled zn concentration data represents the average value for that sampling day to account for the corresponding measurement errors we assumed 10 20 and 30 error in streamflow sediment load and measured metal load respectively harmel et al 2006 to the authors knowledge although not accurate the assumed measurement errors are still reasonable and safe model structural uncertainty is implicitly considered in this study as sufi 2 maps all sources of uncertainties parameter model structure input etc onto the parameters and aims to capture most of the measured data within the prediction uncertainty bound if prediction bounds include most of the observed data it means that parameter ranges can account for all sources of error and thus account for the total output uncertainty 2 4 2 the procedure of the sufi 2 approach step 1 a total of 32 parameters were used in the uncertainty analysis the adjustment method the initial and final ranges of these parameters are listed in table 2 the form of the objective function may affect the final results kouchi et al 2017 king gupta efficiency kge was introduced by gupta et al 2009 as an improvement of the widely used nash sutcliffe efficiency brighenti et al 2019 also suggests using kge as the objective function in the simultaneous multi variable calibration when sediment is included in this study we used kge in eq 1 for the tri variate simultaneous calibration namely streamflow suspended sediment load and metal load the final objective function in eq 2 was formulated as the sum of kges of each variable i e streamflow sediment load and metal load kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient between observed and simulated values α is the measure of relative variability in the simulated and observed values and β is the bias normalized by the standard deviation in the observed values kge ranges from to 1 and the ideal value is 1 g j 1 3 w j k g e j where w js are weights of the three variables here we set all w js to 1 step 2 the initial parameter ranges are updated iteratively the details of the sufi 2 algorithm can be found in abbaspour et al 2007 sufi 2 seeks to bracket most of the measured data with the smallest possible uncertainty band the p factor and r factor are the two uncertainty measures offered by sufi 2 to judge the reliability and precision of the model prediction the p factor is the fraction of measured data plus its measurement error bracketed by the 95ppu band and varies from 0 to 1 the r factor on the other hand is the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu band and the standard deviation of the measured variable representing model uncertainty step 3 in the final iteration each iteration has 2000 model runs where acceptable values of r factor and p factor are reached different performance measures and behavioral criteria were used to investigate their influence on the outcome of the uncertainty analysis as moriasi et al 2015 recommended swat model performance for nutrients simulations can be judged as good if the monthly coefficient of determination r 2 0 30 nash sutcliff efficiency ns 0 35 and percent bias pbias 30 these performance evaluation criteria were used for zn simulations to retain the behavioral simulations 2 5 uncertainty based heavy metal balance calculation using all the behavioral simulations derived from section 2 4 the primary input and output zn fluxes both in the upland soil and channel bed sediment and their uncertainty 95 confidence interval were quantified the heavy metal balances of soil and bed sediment are then calculated using eq 3 δ m m input m output 2 6 sensitivity analysis for the swat hm parameters for the purpose of understanding the dominant processes for metal loads we made a sensitivity analysis separately after the stochastic calibration with the sufi 2 algorithm we only adjusted the totally 13 hm parameters and kept the swat parameters at their best values as calibrated in subsection 2 4 in this sensitivity analysis the objective function was defined as the pbias between the observed and the simulated total zn load at the watershed outlet a multiple linear regression method was used which regresses the latin hypercube generated parameters against the values of the objective function a t test is then used to identify the relative significance of each parameter the larger in absolute value of the t stat and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter is details of the sensitivity analysis method can be found in section 2 of the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of model performance the model was run 2000 times in the final sufi 2 iteration creating 2000 latin hypercube sampled parameter sets 2000 simulations we used multiple statistical indices r 2 ns pbias p factor r factor in table 3 as well as graphical analyses time series plots and scatter plots to evaluate the model performance both the best simulation and all the 2000 simulations were examined regarding the best simulation visual inspection fig 2 and fig 3 shows a good match of the observed in red and the best simulated in blue streamflow sediment load and total metal load time series with respect to all the 2000 simulations the p factor of daily streamflow was 71 while the r factor had a value of 0 55 in the simulation period for daily sediment load only 31 of the monitored data was bracketed by the 95ppu r factor was 0 26 however on the monthly scale fig 4 the p factors for sediment was 0 68 a closer examination identified the reason for small p factor to be the quick runoff concentration of ulr watershed i e concentration ends within less than 24 h therefore a precipitation event occurring late in a day is actually assigned by the model to that day whereas the observed hydrographic and water quality response frequently occur one day after the precipitation peak the calibrated model gave acceptable results for total zn load with 53 of the monitored data bracketed by the relatively narrow 95ppu r factor was to 0 41 the values of ns pbias and r 2 of zn load manifested by the 2000 simulations were further investigated ns ranged from 0 15 to 0 88 pbias extended from 0 51 to 0 73 covering both the negative and the positive ranges substantially r 2 stayed relative narrower from 0 56 to 0 89 for each of the 3 performance measures the majority of the values stand coherently to make a high density region with a small proportion trailing off on both sides fig 5 according to the behavioral criteria of moriasi et al 2015 four different groups of behavioral simulations were defined 1 group 1 2000 behavioral simulations with r 2 0 3 2 group 2 1937 behavioral simulations with ns 0 35 3 group 3 1320 behavioral simulations with pbias 30 and 4 group 4 1292 behavioral simulations with r 2 0 3 ns 0 35 and pbias 30 3 2 uncertainty based metal budget assessment 3 2 1 upland metal balance we compared the net zn balance in the upland soils of ulr watershed using the four groups of behavioral simulations fig 6 a in group 1 the simulated net zn fluxes of soil were found to range from 1 014 g ha 1 yr 1 to 648 g ha 1 yr 1 with a 63 probability to be positive the more likely enrichment of zn in the soil 63 65 50 and 51 for group 1 group 2 group 3 and group 4 respectively whichever is greater than 50 implies an increased risk of metal pollution in the ulr watershed the behavioral criteria should be carefully determined because they could affect the results of uncertainty estimation therefore we select group 4 as being more reliable because every behavior simulation in this group meets all the performance criteria mentioned in moriasi et al 2015 based on the behavioral simulations of group 4 we calculated the ranges 95 confidence interval of inputs and outputs fluxes of zn in the upland of ulr watershed fig 6b the zn fluxes from the three input pathways were 803 905 g ha 1 yr 1 from atmospheric deposition 94 123 g ha 1 yr 1 from fertilizers and livestock manures application and 20 39 g ha 1 yr 1 from waste rocks weathering fig 6 at the entire basin level atmospheric deposition accounted for most of input fluxes 83 3 88 9 which agrees with the finding of yi et al 2018 in hunan province of china xia et al 2014 in heilongjiang northeastern china and reimann et al 2000 in the kola peninsula although the mining area 63 ha is much smaller compared to the agricultural area 2 657 ha the contribution of zn inputs from agriculture 9 1 13 0 was on the average 3 8 times larger than that of rock weathering 1 9 4 1 the output fluxes of zn from the upland entering the stream were estimated to be 94 288 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn in surface runoff 88 368 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn in lateral flow and 233 786 g ha 1 yr 1 of particulate zn through eroded soil there were also 60 519 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn leached out of soil profile and 13 20 g ha 1 yr 1 of dissolved zn has been taken up by plants the small fraction of plant uptake is corroborated by gandois et al 2010 who found a plant uptake share of less than 5 in north eastern france relatively high model uncertainty was associated with particulate zn flux through soil erosion resulting from the uncertainty in the sediment load analysis of the simulated output fluxes revealed a considerable monthly variation in total zn output fig 7 with the maximum occurring in july and the minimum in january such between month variation is predominantly a reflection of the precipitation amount fluctuation since the monthly zn output fluxes as the total or pertaining to each pathway except plant uptake are found to have high correlations with the monthly precipitation fig s2 zinc output from soil erosion varied considerably over time and dominated the zn output during the rainy seasons in july for instance soil erosion accounted for 66 of the total output so soil erosion control could be an effective remediation measure especially in rainy seasons although the majority of zn loads from upland to river are of the particulate form they will partly transform into dissolved species bioavailable species after re equilibration in the river reaches in contrast metal output with lateral flow became the main pathway during the dry period percolation leaching is the only pathway that transported the metal from soil profile into groundwater and accounted for 19 of the total zn output 3 2 2 metal balance in channel the reduction of pollutant loads in rivers requires a good understanding of the contribution of all point and non point sources as shown in the baoshan river basin mining area baoshan river received 11 500 kg yr 1 21 and 44 000 kg yr 1 79 of dissolved zn from the point and non point sources respectively indicating the predominance of diffuse metal inputs 79 from the upland to the stream china has seen marked decreases from point sources with the improved installation and performance of wastewater treatment facilities for example in the xiang river basin control plan for heavy metal pollution the number of enterprises involved in heavy metal pollution was reduced by 50 from 2008 to 2015 however many surface waters especially in the mining impacted watersheds still suffer from severe heavy metal pollution mainly due to the complicated non point source inputs to achieve further reductions in river water metal concentrations both point and diffuse source metal inputs to the water bodies should be reduced examination of the zn dynamics in the interface of the water column and bed sediment in the simulation period from 2011 to 2016 indicated 16 40 000 kg yr 1 zn had settled onto the bed sediment and 49 6 500 kg yr 1 zn had resuspended into the water column fig 8 b net flux of 4 100 11 000 kg yr 1 dissolved zn was transported from the water column to the pore water of bed sediment at the same time 36 000 55 000 kg yr 1 zn was transported from the active sediment layer to the deeper layer based on the balance calculation using group 4 fig 8a the net zn balance of bed sediment ranged from 5 100 to 42 000 kg yr 1 the unanimously considerable positive fluxes of the behavioral simulations of the four groups identified the bed sediment as a critical zn sink in the aquatic environment of the ulr basin 3 3 the sensitivity of the swat hm parameters seven out of a total of 13 hm parameters table 4 were found to be sensitive p 0 05 these 13 metal parameters can be grouped into three categories related to input processes i a i f i p and rw upland processes k d1 puf k 1 k 1 and ε and channel processes k d2 k d3 v d and v b among the input fluxes metal input flux by atmospheric deposition ia was found to be the most influential factor this indicates that the deposition of zn onto the soil surface is critical to the total metal load of the watershed outlet as a comparison the weathering rate r w was not sensitive one possible explanation is that here we chose daily zn load at the watershed outlet to make the objective function so the weathering of waste rocks in the mining area was rendered insignificant which plays a long term role to provide a critical input to the specific mining area the high sensitivity to atmospheric deposition input also implies the needs for a denser monitoring network for the mining area and improved estimation of the atmospheric deposition reflecting integratively the effects of land surface and meteorological characteristics in the upland processes enrichment ratio ε was the most sensitive parameter which highlights the contribution of soil erosion to the total zn load the slow reaction rate k 1 and k 1 and solid solution partition coefficient in soil k d1 were also crucial parameters indicating the chemical reactions in the upland play an essential role in the zn transport for the channel processes the transport parameters v d and v b were more sensitive than the transformation parameters k d2 and k d3 this selection indicated that in the channel phase physical transport has more impact on the total zn load than chemical transformation 3 4 implications for environmental management practices a comprehensive watershed modeling of the physical chemical and biological watershed processes can support the implementation of environmental management practices to reduce excessive pollutant loads in this study we used the swat hm model to identify critical watershed processes by conducting sensitivity analysis and uncertainty based metal budget assessment in order to subsequently providing a preliminary selection of potentially effective management practices the sensitivity analysis of the metal parameters identified transport of zn with eroded sediments to streams as the predominant process in the ulr watershed a similar result was observed in the metal budget assessment as zn output through soil erosion was identified as the most significant flux also the annual sediment and particulate zn loads in the streams are often the results of only a few major storm events during the year therefore storm based soil erosion control could be an effective prevention measure in practice the conservation operations implemented on the upland especially mining waste sites such as revegetation and erosion control will be useful to mitigate erosion loads from storm events on the other hand the bed sediment was identified to be a vital zn sink so the long term accumulation of zn in stream sediment bed may continue to affect the river ecosystem long after upland remediation measures have been implemented restoration of the metal polluted bed sediment especially those of the highly polluted river channels should be simultaneously implemented with other mitigation measures 4 conclusion and perspective a better understanding of the metal budget in a watershed system is critical to evaluate the current pollution status and develop effective management strategies in this study we modified and applied the watershed scale heavy metal model swat hm to the upper liuyang river basin in china and assessed the zn balances both in the upland soil and channel bed sediment the estimation of the predictive uncertainty to grasp the uncertainties both inherent in the model and in the external inputs gains more importance as the model predictions are increasingly being used as a scientific basis for supporting decisions in the context of environmental management the computationally efficient sufi 2 approach was used in this study to estimate the predictive uncertainties of metal fluxes based on multiple behavioral simulations the major input and output zn fluxes and their uncertainties in the study watershed were quantified in the upland phase zn input from atmospheric deposition and zn output through soil erosion were identified as the largest fluxes in the channel phase the bed sediment was identified as the most important zn sink these results suggest two environmental management strategies first soil erosion control could be an imperative and effective remediation measure second restoration of the metal polluted bed sediment especially those of the highly polluted river channels should be simultaneously implemented with other mitigation measures nonetheless the effort to identify environmental management strategies under uncertainty should not be replace other efforts to reduce uncertainties increasing the frequency of monitoring data extending the use of remote sensing data and collecting more management related information such as site specific agricultural applicate rate will improve the calibration by narrowing down the model parameters ranges and consequently refine the metal budget estimation in addition the swat hm model needs to be upgraded to reflect recent advantages and to include more processes to support a more robust environmental management for example extending the swat hm model to include a groundwater metal module or alternatively connecting it to an established groundwater metal model and refining the metal behavior modeling in paddy land will be important for better budgeting metals in a watershed credit authorship contribution statement lingfeng zhou conceptualization methodology writing original draft yaobin

5654,literature raises doubts about the usability of infiltrometer methods to characterize soils in a hydrological perspective since these methods often yield excessively high infiltration rates or saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks values for a loam ar and a silty clay ro soil beerkan infiltration runs were adapted in the perspective to obtain usable soil data to predict rainfall partition into infiltration and rainfall excess in particular the initially nearly dry soil was sampled with different water volumes 15 or 30 and heights of water application low l 0 03 m and high h 1 5 m and the best steady algorithm was applied to determine sorptivity s and ks the h runs altered the surface soil layer more than the l runs but the response of the two soils to disturbance was different for the ar soil deterioration of the surface layer was almost complete close to the end of the run while for the ro soil it was concluded after applying one third of the overall used water volume the least soil perturbing experiment 15l that was carried out with the commonly recommended experimental protocol yielded high s 91 118 mm h0 5 and ks 88 294 mm h values at the two sites likely incompatible with formation of any rainfall excess a soil perturbing experiment 30h yielded significantly and substantially smaller s 26 40 mm h0 5 and ks 4 6 mm h values that appeared potentially compatible with formation of rainfall excess the gravitational potential energy ep of the water used for the infiltration run explained most of the variance of both ks and s in conclusion the infiltration run can be adapted in an attempt to induce a soil disturbance likely similar to that expected for a rainfall producing runoff in a relatively dry initial status complete deterioration can require less water for a silty clay soil than a loam soil the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity is more sensitive than soil sorptivity to the applied experimental methodology finally the gravitational potential energy of the applied water could be used to establish a link between the hydrological process that has to be explained and a soil hydraulic characterization appropriate to reach the desired objective keywords soil hydraulic properties surface hydrological processes best procedure experimental methods 1 introduction explaining and simulating rainfall partition into infiltration and surface runoff which is a central topic in hydrology of arid and semi arid areas assouline and mualem 2002 2006 chen et al 2013 wu et al 2019 requires determining sorptivity s and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the surface soil layer touma et al 2007 due to their dependence on soil structure these properties frequently show a noticeable spatial and temporal variability prieksat et al 1994 logsdon and jaynes 1996 therefore soil should be sampled intensively to characterize an area of interest bagarello et al 2013 working directly in the field is preferred to obtain reliable data since the functional connection of the sampled soil volume with the surrounding porous medium is maintained in this case bouma 1982 experimental methods to determine the soil hydraulic properties in the field should be cheap simple parsimonious and rapid ponding single ring infiltration methods generally have these requirements reynolds 2008 moreover they are based on robust theories have been extensively tested and can also yield a complete soil hydraulic characterization this is the case of the so called best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters method lassabatere et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2010 bagarello et al 2014a angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 which estimates water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves by a three dimensional field infiltration experiment at theoretically zero pressure head and the infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 however the literature raises doubts about the usability of infiltrometer methods to explain surface hydrological processes since a tendency of these methods to yield excessively high infiltration rates or ks values has been reported by many authors for example ben hur et al 1987 suggested that predicting rainfall infiltration from double ring infiltrometer data was not possible the reason was that the structure of the bulk soil is the main factor controlling infiltration under water ponding conditions while the surface seal controls rainfall infiltration the infiltration rates measured by cerdà 1996 1999 in some spanish sites by ring infiltrometers were 3 8 times greater than those obtained by rainfall simulation due to water depth pressure established in the rings and crust development under simulated rainfall working in côte d ivoire van de giesen et al 2000 obtained a too high ks value actually precluding runoff occurrence although runoff was measured these authors explained this inconsistency by noting that during tropical storms massive air inclusion may block some larger pores and more importantly crust formation and associated particle sorting decreases overall permeability a similar result was obtained in sicily by bagarello et al 2013 on runoff plots established on a clay soil the median ks values obtained by intensively sampling the soil were not lower than 600 mm h but runoff at the base of the plot was measured even with rainfall intensities of no more than 100 mm h these authors suggested that surface ks decreased during the event due to soil compaction induced by rainfall impact and wetting induced soil swelling recently morbidelli et al 2017 showed that the double ring infiltrometer overestimated the areal value of ks as compared with controlled rainfall runoff experiments picciafuoco et al 2019 concluded that the magnitude of the bias is still an open issue for any available device because of the difficulties related to the identification of a reference value of ks therefore the inability of ponded infiltrometer methods to yield data usable to model rainfall runoff processes seems a more experimental than theoretical problem generally single ring infiltration runs make use of rather small water volumes this circumstance has several advantages such as i transporting small water volumes in remote areas is easy bagarello et al 2011 ii many locations can be sampled with a limited water amount which is important to improve confidence in the estimated mean value of a soil property kanso et al 2018 picciafuoco et al 2019 and iii the assumption of homogeneous soil and uniform initial water content that is commonly made by infiltration models is more realistic vandervaere et al 2000 moreover using small amounts of water and hence performing relatively short duration runs is supported by the existing literature since attainment of quasi steady state infiltration rates should be quite rapid in many circumstances bagarello et al 1999 reynolds et al 2000 lassabatere et al 2006 2019 stewart and abou najm 2018 xiao et al 2019 in many instances emphasis is also put on the fact that obtaining reliable soil data by an infiltration method requires avoiding or at least reducing as much as possible any soil alteration due to the run consequently small insertion depths of the ring are preferred great care in ring insertion into the soil is recommended compaction and shattering prone situations are suggested to impede or compromise ring insertion into the soil and the need to prevent or minimize disturbance of the infiltration surface when water is applied is emphasized reynolds 2008 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 khodaverdiloo et al 2017 lassabatere et al 2019 however two factors have to be considered in the perspective to characterize the soil for simulating surface hydrological processes i structure dependent soil properties have a dynamic nature and they can vary appreciably upon wetting due to for example aggregate breakdown by raindrop impact or weakening of interparticle bonds assouline 2004 dikinya et al 2008 king and bjorneberg 2012 chen et al 2013 and ii hortonian surface runoff occurs as a consequence of prolonged and intense rainfall events assouline and mualem 2002 2006 wu et al 2019 therefore in reality a short and non perturbing infiltration run could not represent the best choice to describe the hydrodynamic behavior of a soil when surface runoff occurs instead long runs and water applications that induce some surface soil alteration could yield more appropriate estimates of soil hydrodynamic properties to explain and simulate surface hydrological processes starting from this premise bagarello et al 2014b and alagna et al 2016 2018 tested the effect of the height of water pouring for a single ring infiltration experiment on the detectable soil response in an attempt to distinguish between the theoretically expected decrease of infiltration rates during the run elrick and reynolds 1992 and that specifically due to mechanical disturbance of the infiltration surface with the beerkan infiltration experiment and best methodologies of data analysis low runs l height of water pouring hw 0 03 m yielded higher mean values of ks than high h hw 1 5 m runs by a factor of 11 35 depending on the sampled site whereas height effects were less appreciable for sorptivity in agreement with a similar finding by somaratne and smettem 1993 a relatively coarse textured soil was more sensitive to mechanical disturbance in initially drier conditions in agreement with other investigations suggesting a greater rainfall induced soil disturbance in these conditions truman et al 1990 fohrer et al 1999 deterioration of the soil surface due to the higher height of water pouring was practically completed by the end of the run for the fine textured soils but not for the relatively coarse textured ones and it is still unclear if this result was fortuitous the usability of the beerkan run methodology and the best procedure to obtain soil data specifically representative of the altered soil surface layer was later demonstrated by di prima et al 2017 2018 and alagna et al 2019 all the available information on the l and h infiltration runs methodology was collected by a standard protocol that yields an experimental cumulative infiltration curve by pouring a sequence of 15 water volumes each establishing an initial water depth of nearly 1 cm on the infiltration surface this protocol that is largely applied angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 lassabatere et al 2019 was introduced in the first best paper lassabatere et al 2006 probably because it was considered a reasonable compromise between the need to reach a near steady state infiltration rate at the end of the run and that to use as small water volumes as possible for field campaigns however a longer infiltration process could promote a weakening of inter particle bonds affecting the comparison between the l and h runs to an unpredictable extent indeed either more similar or dissimilar results between the two types of runs can be expected in comparison with the standard i e 15 water volumes infiltration test the former result could be the consequence of a progressive soil structure deterioration also occurring with the least soil perturbing runs the latter result could occur since structure deterioration is easier and more complete with the perturbing runs due to the greater propensity of soil particles to be displaced therefore the effect of the applied water volume should be established experimentally given that it was never tested before the objective of this investigation was to verify if performing a beerkan infiltration run with more water than that corresponding to the standard experimental protocol could make sense in the perspective to obtain realistic soil data for simulation of hydrological processes in particular a loam and a silty clay soil were sampled by l and h runs using for the first time a relatively large number of water volumes to i verify water volume and pouring height effects on the established infiltration process ii establish if deterioration requires less water for the finer soil than the coarser one and iii compare soil hydrodynamic properties estimated with infiltration runs differing by both the number of poured water volumes and the height of water application 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sites two sicilian soils with different physical properties were chosen for this investigation table 1 disturbed soil samples were collected from the upper 0 10 m of the profile to determine the soil particle size distribution psd the psd was determined using conventional methods following h2o2 pre treatment to eliminate organic matter and clay deflocculation using sodium hexametaphosphate and mechanical agitation gee and bauder 1986 soil organic carbon content oc was also determined by the walkley black method the risk of structural degradation of the sampled soils was then estimated by the structural stability index si pieri 1992 si 1 724 o c silt c l a y 100 with oc silt and clay contents expressed in percentage according to the usda classification a loam soil ar site was located at the department of agricultural food and forest sciences of the palermo italy university at a few tens of meters from the sandy loam soil sampled by bagarello et al 2014b a silty clay soil ro site was located near roccamena approximately 70 km south of palermo these two soils had a similar silt percentage 36 41 but the ar soil had a 3 9 times higher sand content and a 3 0 times lower clay content than the ro soil therefore the former soil was appreciably coarser than the latter one which represented a favorable condition to verify a possible soil texture effect on the response to the infiltration run bagarello et al 2014b the two soils also differed in terms of structural stability since si was equal to 10 5 for the ar soil which denotes a stable structure pieri 1992 reynolds et al 2009 and 3 2 for the ro soil that indicates a structurally degraded soil land use and management practices at each site were summarized in table 1 an area of approximately 150 m2 was selected at each site and the sampled soil surface was gently levelled and smoothed by manual implements bare areas were sampled at both sites 2 2 experimental field methods small diameter d 0 08 m rings were inserted on the soil surface to a depth of 0 01 m for the beerkan infiltration runs lassabatere et al 2006 ring insertion was conducted manually or by gently using a rubber hammer and ensuring that the upper rim of the ring remained horizontal during insertion the rings were particularly small to more clearly detect possible effects of soil disturbance due to water application a total of 20 infiltration runs were carried out at randomly selected locations at a site for each run 30 water volumes each of 57 ml were successively poured in approximately 3 s on the confined infiltration surface for each water volume 1st 2nd 30th the infiltration time was measured from water application to disappearance of all water when the subsequent water volume was poured on the infiltration surface despite other choices could have been made to establish when adding a new volume of water smith 1999 waiting for complete disappearance of water from the infiltration surface was preferred to reduce operator s subjectivity when the infiltration surface was disturbed as a consequence of repeated soil perturbing water pours ten runs were carried out by applying water at a small distance from the infiltration surface i e approximately at a height hw of 0 03 m water energy was dissipated on the fingers of the hand in an attempt to minimize soil disturbance due to water application low l runs water was applied from hw 1 5 m at the other 10 sampling points high h runs the soil surface was not shielded in this case to maximize possible disruptive effects of water impact to ensure flow verticality and prevent wind effects the device developed by bagarello et al 2014b and alagna et al 2016 was used at least one l and one h run were carried out on a given day at a distance of no more than 1 5 2 0 m from each other in an intermediate position between the two sampling points for infiltration two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height by 0 05 m in diameter were collected at the 0 to 0 05 m and 0 05 to 0 10 m depths in accordance with other investigations e g lassabatere et al 2019 these cores were used to determine the dry soil bulk density ρ b and the antecedent volumetric soil water content θ i the soil porosity f was calculated from ρ b assuming a soil particle density of 2650 kg m3 according to other investigations the field saturated soil water content θ s was assumed to coincide with f mubarak et al 2009 bagarello et al 2011 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 the data were averaged over the two depths and they were associated with the couple of l and h runs performed in the vicinity of the soil sampling location a nearly uniform vertical profile of θ i was assumed because the two soils were not irrigated and no rainfall occurred for several weeks before sampling a summary of both ρ b and θ i for the two sampling sites was reported in table 1 this field experiment was carried out in the spring months of 2019 that is in a similar period of the year to that of the experiment by bagarello et al 2014b the antecedent soil water conditions did not differ much between this investigation θ i 0 16 and 0 18 m3 m3 for the coarser and the finer soil respectively table 1 and the previous one θ i 0 12 0 14 and 0 19 0 25 m3 m3 for the coarser and the finer soils respectively therefore this new experiment appeared usable to test the suggestion by bagarello et al 2014b that in initially dry or relatively dry conditions complete soil disturbance due to height effects requires less water for fine than relatively coarse textured soils 2 3 calculations and data analysis infiltration data were plotted on cumulative infiltration i l vs time t t and infiltration rate ir l t vs i plots to take an initial look at the general response of the two types of experiments l and h for the two sites the ir vs i plot was used since durations changed from run to run making presentation of all data on a single ir vs t plot confuse the mean infiltration time of each applied water volume 1st 2nd 30th was also calculated for both the low δt l t and the high δt h t runs the δt h δt l ratio was then plotted against the number of the applied water volumes to detect the effect of the height of water pouring on infiltration for each run the best steady algorithm bagarello et al 2014a was applied to calculate soil sorptivity s l t0 5 and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks l t from the experimentally determined intercept bs l and slope is l t of the straight line fitted to the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot calculation of s and ks was described in detail elsewhere bagarello et al 2014a angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 and it was not repeated here for brevity reasons best steady was preferred to best slope lassabatere et al 2006 and best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 because it was the only algorithm that in another investigation allowed a successful treatment of runs involving soil alteration and led to ks values close to those obtained by rainfall simulation di prima et al 2018 in particular these last authors suggested that if any seal forms at the soil surface during a perturbing infiltration test the best steady estimates should properly characterize the hydraulic properties of the seal the ability of the best methodology of soil hydraulic characterization to yield reliable estimates of the hydrodynamic parameters of the altered surface soil layer was also demonstrated by alagna et al 2019 with a field experiment and numerical simulation for a loam soil two s and ks values were determined for each infiltration run in particular an estimate of these parameters was obtained by considering a run with 15 water volumes that represents the standard number of water volumes for a beerkan experiment and was used in previous investigations on height effects lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2014b alagna et al 2016 another estimate of s and ks was obtained for a run with 30 water volumes that is using the complete experimental information this procedure was applied for both the l and h runs consequently four different experimental methodologies were considered to calculate s and ks 15l 15 water volumes and low height of water pouring 30l 30 water volumes l runs 15h 15 water volumes and high height of water pouring and 30h 30 water volumes h runs for each experimental methodology the gravitational potential energy ep j m2 of the water used for the infiltration run was calculated taking into account that both the mass of water and the height of fall were known for example 15 water volumes each of 57 ml correspond to a mass of water m 0 855 kg assuming a water density of 1000 kg m3 if the height of water pouring is h 1 5 m and the infiltration surface is a πd 2 4 0 00503 m2 ep mgh a 2502 1 j m2 is obtained g m s2 being the acceleration due to gravity each dataset was summarized by calculating the mean m and the associated coefficient of variation cv the arithmetic mean and the associated cv were calculated for cl si sa oc ρ b and θ i for s and ks the statistical frequency distribution of the data was assumed to be ln normal and geometric means and associated cvs were calculated using the appropriate ln normal equations lee et al 1985 for each soil comparisons were established between the hydrodynamic parameters estimated by different experimental methodologies in particular differences in ks and s between the least 15l and the most 30h soil altering experiments were checked the dependence of these differences on the two experimental factors that were allowed to vary was then determined by comparing the 15 l and 30 l water volume and the 30 l and 30 h height of pouring methodologies subsequently a comparison between the two soils was carried out with reference to the four experimental methodologies the 15 l methodology was considered because it represents the standard beerkan infiltration experiment the 30l methodology was perhaps more reliable with respect to attainment of steady state infiltration rates the 15h methodology was the most soil perturbing methodology in previous investigations on height effects the 30h methodology had the most perturbing character in this investigation the relationship between the mean values of both ks and s obtained with the four experimental methodologies and ep was then tested to verify if the energy of the water used for the infiltration experiment explained changes in the two hydrodynamic parameters exponential linear logarithmic and power relationships were considered and the relationship having the highest coefficient of determination r 2 was retained for further analysis two tailed t tests p 0 05 were carried out on ln transformed s and ks values to compare two datasets a two tailed t test was also used to establish the statistical significance of the fitted regression line to the data glantz 2012 3 results 3 1 infiltration process both the cumulative infiltration i vs t and the infiltration rate ir vs i curves signaled that at both sites the infiltration processes was generally consistent with theory fig 1 in particular the concavity of the i vs t curves was generally facing downwards and the infiltration rates decreased during the run in some cases the i vs t relationship was nearly linear indicating a practically steady state infiltration process from the beginning of the run in a single case ar site l10 run ir increased during part of the run and therefore the concavity of the cumulative infiltration curve was faced upwards infiltration rates were greater for the l runs than the h ones at both sites and consequently the former runs mean infiltration time 0 57 h cv 59 9 at the ar site and 1 00 h cv 55 3 at the ro site were shorter than the latter ones mean infiltration time 2 34 h cv 41 7 at the ar site and 6 44 h cv 21 5 at the ro site both types of runs were more rapid at the ar than the ro site relative variability of total run duration was smaller for the h runs than the l runs at both sites suggesting a more homogeneous response of the sampled sites with the most perturbing runs at both sites and for both types of run the mean infiltration time of a given water volume increased during the run fig 2 however δt h was greater than δt l from the beginning of the process suggesting that soil perturbation had an immediate influence on infiltration the graphs of fig 2 also suggested that δt became nearly constant for the last 3 5 water volumes depending on the site and the height of water pouring denoting a near stabilization of infiltration rates close to the end of the experiment the δt h δt l ratio was always greater than one and it increased for at least a part of the run with the number of applied water volumes fig 3 in particular at the ar site the relationship between δt h δt l and the number of applied water volumes showed an increasing trend for almost the whole duration of the run although the results for the last four water volumes could also be viewed as suggesting a final stabilization of δt h δt l three particularities were detectable at the ro site i the first water volume determined an appreciably slower infiltration process when it was applied with the h procedure as compared with the l one δt h δt l 3 8 ii δt h δt l was appreciably smaller 1 4 with the second water application but it then increased with the number of the applied water volumes and iii δt h δt l stabilized after applying ten volumes of water the highest values of δt h δt l were detected on the coarser soil δt h δt l 9 6 and 7 3 at the ar and ro sites respectively at the ar site δt h δt l increased for almost all the run suggesting a progressive deterioration of the surface soil layer that however seemed almost complete close to the end of the run since δt h δt l did not change much in this last phase soil deterioration was concluded by the end of the run at the ro site since δt h δt l stabilized early that is after pouring one third of the overall used water volume in general a higher δt h δt l value indicates a greater difference between infiltration with low and high runs the number of the applied water volumes influenced the comparison between the two soils with respect to the relevance of height of pouring on infiltration in particular this effect was greater at the ro site than the ar site for 17 volumes the opposite was true for 20 or more water volumes and the two soils yielded a similar response with 18 19 water volumes therefore the information collected with a small number of water volumes was not representative for the late phase of the run 3 2 soil hydrodynamic parameters valid calculations of ks and s were obtained for seven l runs and nine h runs at the ar site and for nine l runs and 10 h runs at the ro site invalid calculations occurred as a consequence of a negative estimate of bs for the nearly linear or concave upwards cumulative infiltration curves at both sites the highest and the lowest ks and s values were obtained with the experiments that induced the lowest 15 l and the highest 30 h soil disturbance respectively and all differences between two extreme mean values were statistically significant table 2 therefore the applied experimental methodology had a statistically detectable impact on determination of both soil hydrodynamic parameters the changes of ks were more noticeable at the ar site decrease by 46 6 times from the 15 l to the 30 h experiment than the ro site 22 1 times the opposite result was obtained for s but in this case the two soils yielded a similar response decrease by 2 9 and 3 4 times at the ar and ro sites respectively therefore ks was more affected than s by the applied experimental methodology in agreement with previous findings somaratne and smettem 1993 bagarello et al 2014b this result confirmed that ks is a sentinel property since it is highly sensitive to the applied experimental methodology reynolds et al 2000 the saturated conductivity decreased by 3 5 times at both sites for increasing water volumes comparison between 15 l and 30 l methodologies and by 13 3 ar site and 6 3 ro site times for increasing height of water pouring 30 l vs 30 h methodologies table 2 more water determined a decrease of s by 1 1 and 1 3 times at the ar and ro sites respectively whereas s decreased by 2 8 times at the ar site and 2 7 times at the ro site with a higher height of water pouring with the standard beerkan infiltration run 15 l the ar soil had a 3 3 times greater ks value and a similar s value as compared with the ro soil table 2 using more water for the run 30l or increasing its perturbing character 15h did not modify the ks results soil differences by 3 2 3 3 times but it induced a difference for s that was 1 6 1 8 times higher at the former site than the latter one using more water for the run and increasing its perturbing character 30h made the two soils statistically similar with reference to ks but the ar soil was 1 5 times more sorptive than the ro soil at both sites the gravitational potential energy ep of the water used for the infiltration run explained much of the variance in both ks and s fig 4 the effect of ep was stronger for s than ks and for the latter soil parameter the fitted relationship for the ro site was significant at p 0 10 instead of p 0 05 as in all the other cases however the r 2 differences between the two soils were minimal with reference to the mean ks values for the ar site fig 5 shows the fitted relationship obtained by considering simultaneously the data collected in this investigation and those obtained by bagarello et al 2014b even in this case the r 2 value was significant and also rather high 0 86 notwithstanding the differences in the applied experimental methods given that bagarello et al 2014b used best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 and the one dimensional simplified falling head technique bagarello et al 2004 the fact that even in this case it was possible to fit a unique relationship to the data suggested that the energy of the applied water for the experiment had a major impact on the results of the field campaign according to the relationship of fig 5 the soil maintains its permeability characteristics for an ep value that does not exceed approximately 1000 j m2 but it decreases even appreciably for higher ep values 4 discussion the environmental conditions of this investigation were similar to those reported by bagarello et al 2014b in particular they were typical of the spring period in the mediterranean area that is persistently dry and occasionally hot before sampling the soil had time enough to dry out after the winter period but not to become extremely dry as could occur in summer months according to this investigation a soil structure explanation pieri 1992 reynolds et al 2009 could be invoked to explain the detected soil effect on the dynamics of the alteration process bagarello et al 2014b in particular degradation is more impulsive fast occurrence and rapid stabilization in a structurally less resilient soil than in a more resilient medium development of a structural seal layer at the soil surface is a dynamic process which depends on many factors and has a very large impact on infiltration fohrer et al 1999 assouline and mualem 2002 assouline 2004 according to this investigation a simple methodology that makes use of two different heights of water pouring 1 5 m and less than 2 l of water can be applied in the field to check changes in the infiltration process under development of an altered layer at the soil surface a greater ks stability was detected for the silty clay soil than the loam soil table 2 in agreement with other investigations for example assouline and mualem 2002 reported a saturated conductivity of the seal layer lower than that of the underlying undisturbed soil by 17 times for a relatively fine textured silty clay loam soil and by 79 115 times for two coarser loam and sandy loam soils this similarity supports the usability of an adapted infiltration run for a hydrologically relevant soil hydraulic characterization in particular a soil can be characterized under different conditions ranging from a nearly undisturbed situation relatively short and non perturbing run to heavily disturbed long and perturbing run a run making use of more water 30 l instead of 15 l can be expected to yield smaller infiltration rates at the end of the process for different reasons the most obvious is a closer attainment of nearly steady state conditions with the longer run reynolds and elrick 2002 fig 2 gave some weak support to this interpretation but the estimated is values were characterized by r 2 values of the near steady state phase of the process varying between 0 997 and 1 0 for the 15l runs denoting a stabilization of the infiltration process with the shorter run therefore attainment of steady state was probably a minor factor influencing the established comparison more water implies larger sampled volumes elrick and reynolds 1992 which could suggest that the different response of the two types of run was a consequence of small scale spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties price and bauer 1984 mallants et al 1996 however each individual 30l run yielded a smaller ks value than the corresponding 15l run and it was unlikely that each smaller soil bulb was systematically embedded in a less permeable bulb a more plausible explanation was that more water promoted soil structural changes or 1996 bagarello and sgroi 2004 lado et al 2004 dikinya et al 2008 the infiltration run was longer and therefore there was more time for a weakening of the bonds between soil particles and more chances that detached soil particles were transported with a subsequent modification of the soil pore system applying water from a higher height 30 h instead of 30 l can be expected to yield smaller infiltration rates as a consequence of mechanical effects on the soil surface such as compaction and vertical displacement of detached soil particles and small aggregates vertical heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties was not considered to explain the detected differences between the 30l and 30h runs since the same water volume was used for these runs areal heterogeneity was also viewed as an unlikely explanation because the sampled area was rather small and the number of replications was relatively large therefore most of the decrease in the soil hydrodynamic parameters detected in the passage from the 15 l to 30 h runs occurred because water was poured from a high height structural changes due to prolonged wetting contributed to make the decrease of s and ks more noticeable likely changing the experimental method implied passing from a process mainly governed by an unstable structural macroporosity watson and luxmoore 1986 jarvis and messing 1995 jarvis et al 2013 to a process that was more controlled by the soil matrix in such a situation a greater s value for the ar soil than the ro one was consistent with less dissipation for the coarsest soil stewart et al 2013 a decline of the soil hydrodynamic properties can occur at the seasonal temporal scale hu et al 2009 and according to this investigation it can also have a nearly abrupt character the decrease of s and ks induced by the perturbing run in a situation of no tillage management practice table 1 could also be viewed as a suggestion that soil recovery processes occurred after previous damaging hu et al 2012 2018 bagarello et al 2020 rainfall energy is known to influence infiltration since it controls development of a structural seal layer at the soil surface thompson and james 1985 smith et al 1990 schiettecatte et al 2005 king and bjorneberg 2012 according to investigation the energy of the applied water by a beerkan infiltration run could be used to establish a link between the hydrological process that has to be simulated and a soil hydraulic characterization appropriate to reach the desired objective however it will be necessary to take into account that the same total energy can be obtained with different intensities and durations rainfall and with different water volumes and heights of pouring infiltration run moreover it should also be considered that in natural conditions part of the energy could be dissipated by the vegetation covering the soil whereas according to the experimental protocol for a beerkan infiltration run lassabatere et al 2006 the surface vegetation has to be removed from the area to be sampled even in this case an effect of the vegetation on the response of the l and h runs cannot be excluded because the roots remain in situ and they could reinforce the soil cislaghi et al 2017 predicting areal infiltration and runoff from small bare catchments in arid and semiarid areas needs considering areal heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties and particularly of ks as well as the presence of a sealed layer at the soil surface assouline and mualem 2002 2006 obtaining in the field the effective soil hydraulic properties by considering that soil structure deteriorates as a consequence of raindrop impact is still a challenge this investigation could open some new perspective to approach this objective by adapting common single ring infiltration methods a non perturbing infiltration experiment provides the necessary information to characterize the nearly undisturbed soil whereas the perturbing infiltration experiment characterizes the upper altered soil layer di prima et al 2018 the experiments are simple and rather parsimonious in terms of both equipment and required water amounts which means that many replicated infiltration runs can be carried out to characterize areal variability of soil hydraulic properties in the future the actual potential of this methodological suggestion could perhaps be checked by establishing a link between hydrological data and alternative soil hydraulic characterizations as an example for the ro soil fig 6 shows the relationship between the time to ponding tp and the rainfall intensity irain developed according to white et al 1989 for each of the four experimental scenarios of this investigation if at least a few tp values can experimentally be determined the closeness of the tp data to the predicted tp irain relationships could represent a criterion to establish what is the most appropriate soil sampling methodology this kind of check could yield a more robust information as compared with that obtained by comparing different methods to measure soil hydraulic properties the reason is that especially with reference to ks different methods can be expected to yield dissimilar results and there is no independent ks datum or benchmark upon which evaluations and judgments can be made reynolds et al 2000 picciafuoco et al 2019 5 conclusions this investigation showed that the single ring beerkan infiltration run can be adapted in an attempt to induce a soil disturbance that is likely similar to the one expected when a rainfall event produces runoff in particular using much water for the experiment and applying water from a relatively high height on the infiltration surface determined an appreciable decrease of sorptivity s and particularly of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks as compared with the standard beerkan run these data seem more hydrologically relevant than those obtained with standard experimental methodologies since they were obtained in a soil condition that is closer to that expected when runoff is formed the investigation also showed that in an initially relatively dry soil deterioration effects attributable to the mechanical impact of the water required less water for a silty clay soil than a loam soil the gravitational potential energy ep of the water used for the infiltrometer experiment explained much of the variance of the ks and s values obtained by different experimental methodologies in conclusion an infiltrometer experiment can be carried out in such a way to mimic what happens in real situations when rainfall produces hortonian runoff soil disturbance can be controlled by changing the water volume used for the run and the height of water pouring the field experiment remains rather simple and consequently the attractiveness of infiltrometer methods is not reduced by adapting the run to a hydrologically representative situation the few encouraging signs about the reliability of the proposed method to estimate soil hydraulic properties relevant for simulating runoff deserve stronger confirmation in a hydrological perspective it also seems advisable to improve our knowledge on the short term modifications of ks and s in an attempt to verify if under what experimental conditions and to what level they stabilize when a disturbing run is carried out the lowest possible s and ks values could be viewed as a sort of hydrologically relevant index since they describe the most favorable condition to runoff occurrence according to this investigation these developments should not be excessively demanding from an experimental point of view an alternative method to characterize a soil in a runoff prone situation is to make the field campaign with common experimental protocols after a sealed layer has fully developed establishing a comparison between the two options inducing disturbance working on naturally altered soil is obviously advisable although the latter option places constraints on the time when the experiment can be performed funding this research did not receive any specific grant

5654,literature raises doubts about the usability of infiltrometer methods to characterize soils in a hydrological perspective since these methods often yield excessively high infiltration rates or saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks values for a loam ar and a silty clay ro soil beerkan infiltration runs were adapted in the perspective to obtain usable soil data to predict rainfall partition into infiltration and rainfall excess in particular the initially nearly dry soil was sampled with different water volumes 15 or 30 and heights of water application low l 0 03 m and high h 1 5 m and the best steady algorithm was applied to determine sorptivity s and ks the h runs altered the surface soil layer more than the l runs but the response of the two soils to disturbance was different for the ar soil deterioration of the surface layer was almost complete close to the end of the run while for the ro soil it was concluded after applying one third of the overall used water volume the least soil perturbing experiment 15l that was carried out with the commonly recommended experimental protocol yielded high s 91 118 mm h0 5 and ks 88 294 mm h values at the two sites likely incompatible with formation of any rainfall excess a soil perturbing experiment 30h yielded significantly and substantially smaller s 26 40 mm h0 5 and ks 4 6 mm h values that appeared potentially compatible with formation of rainfall excess the gravitational potential energy ep of the water used for the infiltration run explained most of the variance of both ks and s in conclusion the infiltration run can be adapted in an attempt to induce a soil disturbance likely similar to that expected for a rainfall producing runoff in a relatively dry initial status complete deterioration can require less water for a silty clay soil than a loam soil the saturated soil hydraulic conductivity is more sensitive than soil sorptivity to the applied experimental methodology finally the gravitational potential energy of the applied water could be used to establish a link between the hydrological process that has to be explained and a soil hydraulic characterization appropriate to reach the desired objective keywords soil hydraulic properties surface hydrological processes best procedure experimental methods 1 introduction explaining and simulating rainfall partition into infiltration and surface runoff which is a central topic in hydrology of arid and semi arid areas assouline and mualem 2002 2006 chen et al 2013 wu et al 2019 requires determining sorptivity s and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the surface soil layer touma et al 2007 due to their dependence on soil structure these properties frequently show a noticeable spatial and temporal variability prieksat et al 1994 logsdon and jaynes 1996 therefore soil should be sampled intensively to characterize an area of interest bagarello et al 2013 working directly in the field is preferred to obtain reliable data since the functional connection of the sampled soil volume with the surrounding porous medium is maintained in this case bouma 1982 experimental methods to determine the soil hydraulic properties in the field should be cheap simple parsimonious and rapid ponding single ring infiltration methods generally have these requirements reynolds 2008 moreover they are based on robust theories have been extensively tested and can also yield a complete soil hydraulic characterization this is the case of the so called best beerkan estimation of soil transfer parameters method lassabatere et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2010 bagarello et al 2014a angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 which estimates water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves by a three dimensional field infiltration experiment at theoretically zero pressure head and the infiltration model by haverkamp et al 1994 however the literature raises doubts about the usability of infiltrometer methods to explain surface hydrological processes since a tendency of these methods to yield excessively high infiltration rates or ks values has been reported by many authors for example ben hur et al 1987 suggested that predicting rainfall infiltration from double ring infiltrometer data was not possible the reason was that the structure of the bulk soil is the main factor controlling infiltration under water ponding conditions while the surface seal controls rainfall infiltration the infiltration rates measured by cerdà 1996 1999 in some spanish sites by ring infiltrometers were 3 8 times greater than those obtained by rainfall simulation due to water depth pressure established in the rings and crust development under simulated rainfall working in côte d ivoire van de giesen et al 2000 obtained a too high ks value actually precluding runoff occurrence although runoff was measured these authors explained this inconsistency by noting that during tropical storms massive air inclusion may block some larger pores and more importantly crust formation and associated particle sorting decreases overall permeability a similar result was obtained in sicily by bagarello et al 2013 on runoff plots established on a clay soil the median ks values obtained by intensively sampling the soil were not lower than 600 mm h but runoff at the base of the plot was measured even with rainfall intensities of no more than 100 mm h these authors suggested that surface ks decreased during the event due to soil compaction induced by rainfall impact and wetting induced soil swelling recently morbidelli et al 2017 showed that the double ring infiltrometer overestimated the areal value of ks as compared with controlled rainfall runoff experiments picciafuoco et al 2019 concluded that the magnitude of the bias is still an open issue for any available device because of the difficulties related to the identification of a reference value of ks therefore the inability of ponded infiltrometer methods to yield data usable to model rainfall runoff processes seems a more experimental than theoretical problem generally single ring infiltration runs make use of rather small water volumes this circumstance has several advantages such as i transporting small water volumes in remote areas is easy bagarello et al 2011 ii many locations can be sampled with a limited water amount which is important to improve confidence in the estimated mean value of a soil property kanso et al 2018 picciafuoco et al 2019 and iii the assumption of homogeneous soil and uniform initial water content that is commonly made by infiltration models is more realistic vandervaere et al 2000 moreover using small amounts of water and hence performing relatively short duration runs is supported by the existing literature since attainment of quasi steady state infiltration rates should be quite rapid in many circumstances bagarello et al 1999 reynolds et al 2000 lassabatere et al 2006 2019 stewart and abou najm 2018 xiao et al 2019 in many instances emphasis is also put on the fact that obtaining reliable soil data by an infiltration method requires avoiding or at least reducing as much as possible any soil alteration due to the run consequently small insertion depths of the ring are preferred great care in ring insertion into the soil is recommended compaction and shattering prone situations are suggested to impede or compromise ring insertion into the soil and the need to prevent or minimize disturbance of the infiltration surface when water is applied is emphasized reynolds 2008 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 khodaverdiloo et al 2017 lassabatere et al 2019 however two factors have to be considered in the perspective to characterize the soil for simulating surface hydrological processes i structure dependent soil properties have a dynamic nature and they can vary appreciably upon wetting due to for example aggregate breakdown by raindrop impact or weakening of interparticle bonds assouline 2004 dikinya et al 2008 king and bjorneberg 2012 chen et al 2013 and ii hortonian surface runoff occurs as a consequence of prolonged and intense rainfall events assouline and mualem 2002 2006 wu et al 2019 therefore in reality a short and non perturbing infiltration run could not represent the best choice to describe the hydrodynamic behavior of a soil when surface runoff occurs instead long runs and water applications that induce some surface soil alteration could yield more appropriate estimates of soil hydrodynamic properties to explain and simulate surface hydrological processes starting from this premise bagarello et al 2014b and alagna et al 2016 2018 tested the effect of the height of water pouring for a single ring infiltration experiment on the detectable soil response in an attempt to distinguish between the theoretically expected decrease of infiltration rates during the run elrick and reynolds 1992 and that specifically due to mechanical disturbance of the infiltration surface with the beerkan infiltration experiment and best methodologies of data analysis low runs l height of water pouring hw 0 03 m yielded higher mean values of ks than high h hw 1 5 m runs by a factor of 11 35 depending on the sampled site whereas height effects were less appreciable for sorptivity in agreement with a similar finding by somaratne and smettem 1993 a relatively coarse textured soil was more sensitive to mechanical disturbance in initially drier conditions in agreement with other investigations suggesting a greater rainfall induced soil disturbance in these conditions truman et al 1990 fohrer et al 1999 deterioration of the soil surface due to the higher height of water pouring was practically completed by the end of the run for the fine textured soils but not for the relatively coarse textured ones and it is still unclear if this result was fortuitous the usability of the beerkan run methodology and the best procedure to obtain soil data specifically representative of the altered soil surface layer was later demonstrated by di prima et al 2017 2018 and alagna et al 2019 all the available information on the l and h infiltration runs methodology was collected by a standard protocol that yields an experimental cumulative infiltration curve by pouring a sequence of 15 water volumes each establishing an initial water depth of nearly 1 cm on the infiltration surface this protocol that is largely applied angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 lassabatere et al 2019 was introduced in the first best paper lassabatere et al 2006 probably because it was considered a reasonable compromise between the need to reach a near steady state infiltration rate at the end of the run and that to use as small water volumes as possible for field campaigns however a longer infiltration process could promote a weakening of inter particle bonds affecting the comparison between the l and h runs to an unpredictable extent indeed either more similar or dissimilar results between the two types of runs can be expected in comparison with the standard i e 15 water volumes infiltration test the former result could be the consequence of a progressive soil structure deterioration also occurring with the least soil perturbing runs the latter result could occur since structure deterioration is easier and more complete with the perturbing runs due to the greater propensity of soil particles to be displaced therefore the effect of the applied water volume should be established experimentally given that it was never tested before the objective of this investigation was to verify if performing a beerkan infiltration run with more water than that corresponding to the standard experimental protocol could make sense in the perspective to obtain realistic soil data for simulation of hydrological processes in particular a loam and a silty clay soil were sampled by l and h runs using for the first time a relatively large number of water volumes to i verify water volume and pouring height effects on the established infiltration process ii establish if deterioration requires less water for the finer soil than the coarser one and iii compare soil hydrodynamic properties estimated with infiltration runs differing by both the number of poured water volumes and the height of water application 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sites two sicilian soils with different physical properties were chosen for this investigation table 1 disturbed soil samples were collected from the upper 0 10 m of the profile to determine the soil particle size distribution psd the psd was determined using conventional methods following h2o2 pre treatment to eliminate organic matter and clay deflocculation using sodium hexametaphosphate and mechanical agitation gee and bauder 1986 soil organic carbon content oc was also determined by the walkley black method the risk of structural degradation of the sampled soils was then estimated by the structural stability index si pieri 1992 si 1 724 o c silt c l a y 100 with oc silt and clay contents expressed in percentage according to the usda classification a loam soil ar site was located at the department of agricultural food and forest sciences of the palermo italy university at a few tens of meters from the sandy loam soil sampled by bagarello et al 2014b a silty clay soil ro site was located near roccamena approximately 70 km south of palermo these two soils had a similar silt percentage 36 41 but the ar soil had a 3 9 times higher sand content and a 3 0 times lower clay content than the ro soil therefore the former soil was appreciably coarser than the latter one which represented a favorable condition to verify a possible soil texture effect on the response to the infiltration run bagarello et al 2014b the two soils also differed in terms of structural stability since si was equal to 10 5 for the ar soil which denotes a stable structure pieri 1992 reynolds et al 2009 and 3 2 for the ro soil that indicates a structurally degraded soil land use and management practices at each site were summarized in table 1 an area of approximately 150 m2 was selected at each site and the sampled soil surface was gently levelled and smoothed by manual implements bare areas were sampled at both sites 2 2 experimental field methods small diameter d 0 08 m rings were inserted on the soil surface to a depth of 0 01 m for the beerkan infiltration runs lassabatere et al 2006 ring insertion was conducted manually or by gently using a rubber hammer and ensuring that the upper rim of the ring remained horizontal during insertion the rings were particularly small to more clearly detect possible effects of soil disturbance due to water application a total of 20 infiltration runs were carried out at randomly selected locations at a site for each run 30 water volumes each of 57 ml were successively poured in approximately 3 s on the confined infiltration surface for each water volume 1st 2nd 30th the infiltration time was measured from water application to disappearance of all water when the subsequent water volume was poured on the infiltration surface despite other choices could have been made to establish when adding a new volume of water smith 1999 waiting for complete disappearance of water from the infiltration surface was preferred to reduce operator s subjectivity when the infiltration surface was disturbed as a consequence of repeated soil perturbing water pours ten runs were carried out by applying water at a small distance from the infiltration surface i e approximately at a height hw of 0 03 m water energy was dissipated on the fingers of the hand in an attempt to minimize soil disturbance due to water application low l runs water was applied from hw 1 5 m at the other 10 sampling points high h runs the soil surface was not shielded in this case to maximize possible disruptive effects of water impact to ensure flow verticality and prevent wind effects the device developed by bagarello et al 2014b and alagna et al 2016 was used at least one l and one h run were carried out on a given day at a distance of no more than 1 5 2 0 m from each other in an intermediate position between the two sampling points for infiltration two undisturbed soil cores 0 05 m in height by 0 05 m in diameter were collected at the 0 to 0 05 m and 0 05 to 0 10 m depths in accordance with other investigations e g lassabatere et al 2019 these cores were used to determine the dry soil bulk density ρ b and the antecedent volumetric soil water content θ i the soil porosity f was calculated from ρ b assuming a soil particle density of 2650 kg m3 according to other investigations the field saturated soil water content θ s was assumed to coincide with f mubarak et al 2009 bagarello et al 2011 angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 the data were averaged over the two depths and they were associated with the couple of l and h runs performed in the vicinity of the soil sampling location a nearly uniform vertical profile of θ i was assumed because the two soils were not irrigated and no rainfall occurred for several weeks before sampling a summary of both ρ b and θ i for the two sampling sites was reported in table 1 this field experiment was carried out in the spring months of 2019 that is in a similar period of the year to that of the experiment by bagarello et al 2014b the antecedent soil water conditions did not differ much between this investigation θ i 0 16 and 0 18 m3 m3 for the coarser and the finer soil respectively table 1 and the previous one θ i 0 12 0 14 and 0 19 0 25 m3 m3 for the coarser and the finer soils respectively therefore this new experiment appeared usable to test the suggestion by bagarello et al 2014b that in initially dry or relatively dry conditions complete soil disturbance due to height effects requires less water for fine than relatively coarse textured soils 2 3 calculations and data analysis infiltration data were plotted on cumulative infiltration i l vs time t t and infiltration rate ir l t vs i plots to take an initial look at the general response of the two types of experiments l and h for the two sites the ir vs i plot was used since durations changed from run to run making presentation of all data on a single ir vs t plot confuse the mean infiltration time of each applied water volume 1st 2nd 30th was also calculated for both the low δt l t and the high δt h t runs the δt h δt l ratio was then plotted against the number of the applied water volumes to detect the effect of the height of water pouring on infiltration for each run the best steady algorithm bagarello et al 2014a was applied to calculate soil sorptivity s l t0 5 and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks l t from the experimentally determined intercept bs l and slope is l t of the straight line fitted to the data describing steady state conditions on the i vs t plot calculation of s and ks was described in detail elsewhere bagarello et al 2014a angulo jaramillo et al 2016 2019 and it was not repeated here for brevity reasons best steady was preferred to best slope lassabatere et al 2006 and best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 because it was the only algorithm that in another investigation allowed a successful treatment of runs involving soil alteration and led to ks values close to those obtained by rainfall simulation di prima et al 2018 in particular these last authors suggested that if any seal forms at the soil surface during a perturbing infiltration test the best steady estimates should properly characterize the hydraulic properties of the seal the ability of the best methodology of soil hydraulic characterization to yield reliable estimates of the hydrodynamic parameters of the altered surface soil layer was also demonstrated by alagna et al 2019 with a field experiment and numerical simulation for a loam soil two s and ks values were determined for each infiltration run in particular an estimate of these parameters was obtained by considering a run with 15 water volumes that represents the standard number of water volumes for a beerkan experiment and was used in previous investigations on height effects lassabatere et al 2006 bagarello et al 2014b alagna et al 2016 another estimate of s and ks was obtained for a run with 30 water volumes that is using the complete experimental information this procedure was applied for both the l and h runs consequently four different experimental methodologies were considered to calculate s and ks 15l 15 water volumes and low height of water pouring 30l 30 water volumes l runs 15h 15 water volumes and high height of water pouring and 30h 30 water volumes h runs for each experimental methodology the gravitational potential energy ep j m2 of the water used for the infiltration run was calculated taking into account that both the mass of water and the height of fall were known for example 15 water volumes each of 57 ml correspond to a mass of water m 0 855 kg assuming a water density of 1000 kg m3 if the height of water pouring is h 1 5 m and the infiltration surface is a πd 2 4 0 00503 m2 ep mgh a 2502 1 j m2 is obtained g m s2 being the acceleration due to gravity each dataset was summarized by calculating the mean m and the associated coefficient of variation cv the arithmetic mean and the associated cv were calculated for cl si sa oc ρ b and θ i for s and ks the statistical frequency distribution of the data was assumed to be ln normal and geometric means and associated cvs were calculated using the appropriate ln normal equations lee et al 1985 for each soil comparisons were established between the hydrodynamic parameters estimated by different experimental methodologies in particular differences in ks and s between the least 15l and the most 30h soil altering experiments were checked the dependence of these differences on the two experimental factors that were allowed to vary was then determined by comparing the 15 l and 30 l water volume and the 30 l and 30 h height of pouring methodologies subsequently a comparison between the two soils was carried out with reference to the four experimental methodologies the 15 l methodology was considered because it represents the standard beerkan infiltration experiment the 30l methodology was perhaps more reliable with respect to attainment of steady state infiltration rates the 15h methodology was the most soil perturbing methodology in previous investigations on height effects the 30h methodology had the most perturbing character in this investigation the relationship between the mean values of both ks and s obtained with the four experimental methodologies and ep was then tested to verify if the energy of the water used for the infiltration experiment explained changes in the two hydrodynamic parameters exponential linear logarithmic and power relationships were considered and the relationship having the highest coefficient of determination r 2 was retained for further analysis two tailed t tests p 0 05 were carried out on ln transformed s and ks values to compare two datasets a two tailed t test was also used to establish the statistical significance of the fitted regression line to the data glantz 2012 3 results 3 1 infiltration process both the cumulative infiltration i vs t and the infiltration rate ir vs i curves signaled that at both sites the infiltration processes was generally consistent with theory fig 1 in particular the concavity of the i vs t curves was generally facing downwards and the infiltration rates decreased during the run in some cases the i vs t relationship was nearly linear indicating a practically steady state infiltration process from the beginning of the run in a single case ar site l10 run ir increased during part of the run and therefore the concavity of the cumulative infiltration curve was faced upwards infiltration rates were greater for the l runs than the h ones at both sites and consequently the former runs mean infiltration time 0 57 h cv 59 9 at the ar site and 1 00 h cv 55 3 at the ro site were shorter than the latter ones mean infiltration time 2 34 h cv 41 7 at the ar site and 6 44 h cv 21 5 at the ro site both types of runs were more rapid at the ar than the ro site relative variability of total run duration was smaller for the h runs than the l runs at both sites suggesting a more homogeneous response of the sampled sites with the most perturbing runs at both sites and for both types of run the mean infiltration time of a given water volume increased during the run fig 2 however δt h was greater than δt l from the beginning of the process suggesting that soil perturbation had an immediate influence on infiltration the graphs of fig 2 also suggested that δt became nearly constant for the last 3 5 water volumes depending on the site and the height of water pouring denoting a near stabilization of infiltration rates close to the end of the experiment the δt h δt l ratio was always greater than one and it increased for at least a part of the run with the number of applied water volumes fig 3 in particular at the ar site the relationship between δt h δt l and the number of applied water volumes showed an increasing trend for almost the whole duration of the run although the results for the last four water volumes could also be viewed as suggesting a final stabilization of δt h δt l three particularities were detectable at the ro site i the first water volume determined an appreciably slower infiltration process when it was applied with the h procedure as compared with the l one δt h δt l 3 8 ii δt h δt l was appreciably smaller 1 4 with the second water application but it then increased with the number of the applied water volumes and iii δt h δt l stabilized after applying ten volumes of water the highest values of δt h δt l were detected on the coarser soil δt h δt l 9 6 and 7 3 at the ar and ro sites respectively at the ar site δt h δt l increased for almost all the run suggesting a progressive deterioration of the surface soil layer that however seemed almost complete close to the end of the run since δt h δt l did not change much in this last phase soil deterioration was concluded by the end of the run at the ro site since δt h δt l stabilized early that is after pouring one third of the overall used water volume in general a higher δt h δt l value indicates a greater difference between infiltration with low and high runs the number of the applied water volumes influenced the comparison between the two soils with respect to the relevance of height of pouring on infiltration in particular this effect was greater at the ro site than the ar site for 17 volumes the opposite was true for 20 or more water volumes and the two soils yielded a similar response with 18 19 water volumes therefore the information collected with a small number of water volumes was not representative for the late phase of the run 3 2 soil hydrodynamic parameters valid calculations of ks and s were obtained for seven l runs and nine h runs at the ar site and for nine l runs and 10 h runs at the ro site invalid calculations occurred as a consequence of a negative estimate of bs for the nearly linear or concave upwards cumulative infiltration curves at both sites the highest and the lowest ks and s values were obtained with the experiments that induced the lowest 15 l and the highest 30 h soil disturbance respectively and all differences between two extreme mean values were statistically significant table 2 therefore the applied experimental methodology had a statistically detectable impact on determination of both soil hydrodynamic parameters the changes of ks were more noticeable at the ar site decrease by 46 6 times from the 15 l to the 30 h experiment than the ro site 22 1 times the opposite result was obtained for s but in this case the two soils yielded a similar response decrease by 2 9 and 3 4 times at the ar and ro sites respectively therefore ks was more affected than s by the applied experimental methodology in agreement with previous findings somaratne and smettem 1993 bagarello et al 2014b this result confirmed that ks is a sentinel property since it is highly sensitive to the applied experimental methodology reynolds et al 2000 the saturated conductivity decreased by 3 5 times at both sites for increasing water volumes comparison between 15 l and 30 l methodologies and by 13 3 ar site and 6 3 ro site times for increasing height of water pouring 30 l vs 30 h methodologies table 2 more water determined a decrease of s by 1 1 and 1 3 times at the ar and ro sites respectively whereas s decreased by 2 8 times at the ar site and 2 7 times at the ro site with a higher height of water pouring with the standard beerkan infiltration run 15 l the ar soil had a 3 3 times greater ks value and a similar s value as compared with the ro soil table 2 using more water for the run 30l or increasing its perturbing character 15h did not modify the ks results soil differences by 3 2 3 3 times but it induced a difference for s that was 1 6 1 8 times higher at the former site than the latter one using more water for the run and increasing its perturbing character 30h made the two soils statistically similar with reference to ks but the ar soil was 1 5 times more sorptive than the ro soil at both sites the gravitational potential energy ep of the water used for the infiltration run explained much of the variance in both ks and s fig 4 the effect of ep was stronger for s than ks and for the latter soil parameter the fitted relationship for the ro site was significant at p 0 10 instead of p 0 05 as in all the other cases however the r 2 differences between the two soils were minimal with reference to the mean ks values for the ar site fig 5 shows the fitted relationship obtained by considering simultaneously the data collected in this investigation and those obtained by bagarello et al 2014b even in this case the r 2 value was significant and also rather high 0 86 notwithstanding the differences in the applied experimental methods given that bagarello et al 2014b used best intercept yilmaz et al 2010 and the one dimensional simplified falling head technique bagarello et al 2004 the fact that even in this case it was possible to fit a unique relationship to the data suggested that the energy of the applied water for the experiment had a major impact on the results of the field campaign according to the relationship of fig 5 the soil maintains its permeability characteristics for an ep value that does not exceed approximately 1000 j m2 but it decreases even appreciably for higher ep values 4 discussion the environmental conditions of this investigation were similar to those reported by bagarello et al 2014b in particular they were typical of the spring period in the mediterranean area that is persistently dry and occasionally hot before sampling the soil had time enough to dry out after the winter period but not to become extremely dry as could occur in summer months according to this investigation a soil structure explanation pieri 1992 reynolds et al 2009 could be invoked to explain the detected soil effect on the dynamics of the alteration process bagarello et al 2014b in particular degradation is more impulsive fast occurrence and rapid stabilization in a structurally less resilient soil than in a more resilient medium development of a structural seal layer at the soil surface is a dynamic process which depends on many factors and has a very large impact on infiltration fohrer et al 1999 assouline and mualem 2002 assouline 2004 according to this investigation a simple methodology that makes use of two different heights of water pouring 1 5 m and less than 2 l of water can be applied in the field to check changes in the infiltration process under development of an altered layer at the soil surface a greater ks stability was detected for the silty clay soil than the loam soil table 2 in agreement with other investigations for example assouline and mualem 2002 reported a saturated conductivity of the seal layer lower than that of the underlying undisturbed soil by 17 times for a relatively fine textured silty clay loam soil and by 79 115 times for two coarser loam and sandy loam soils this similarity supports the usability of an adapted infiltration run for a hydrologically relevant soil hydraulic characterization in particular a soil can be characterized under different conditions ranging from a nearly undisturbed situation relatively short and non perturbing run to heavily disturbed long and perturbing run a run making use of more water 30 l instead of 15 l can be expected to yield smaller infiltration rates at the end of the process for different reasons the most obvious is a closer attainment of nearly steady state conditions with the longer run reynolds and elrick 2002 fig 2 gave some weak support to this interpretation but the estimated is values were characterized by r 2 values of the near steady state phase of the process varying between 0 997 and 1 0 for the 15l runs denoting a stabilization of the infiltration process with the shorter run therefore attainment of steady state was probably a minor factor influencing the established comparison more water implies larger sampled volumes elrick and reynolds 1992 which could suggest that the different response of the two types of run was a consequence of small scale spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties price and bauer 1984 mallants et al 1996 however each individual 30l run yielded a smaller ks value than the corresponding 15l run and it was unlikely that each smaller soil bulb was systematically embedded in a less permeable bulb a more plausible explanation was that more water promoted soil structural changes or 1996 bagarello and sgroi 2004 lado et al 2004 dikinya et al 2008 the infiltration run was longer and therefore there was more time for a weakening of the bonds between soil particles and more chances that detached soil particles were transported with a subsequent modification of the soil pore system applying water from a higher height 30 h instead of 30 l can be expected to yield smaller infiltration rates as a consequence of mechanical effects on the soil surface such as compaction and vertical displacement of detached soil particles and small aggregates vertical heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties was not considered to explain the detected differences between the 30l and 30h runs since the same water volume was used for these runs areal heterogeneity was also viewed as an unlikely explanation because the sampled area was rather small and the number of replications was relatively large therefore most of the decrease in the soil hydrodynamic parameters detected in the passage from the 15 l to 30 h runs occurred because water was poured from a high height structural changes due to prolonged wetting contributed to make the decrease of s and ks more noticeable likely changing the experimental method implied passing from a process mainly governed by an unstable structural macroporosity watson and luxmoore 1986 jarvis and messing 1995 jarvis et al 2013 to a process that was more controlled by the soil matrix in such a situation a greater s value for the ar soil than the ro one was consistent with less dissipation for the coarsest soil stewart et al 2013 a decline of the soil hydrodynamic properties can occur at the seasonal temporal scale hu et al 2009 and according to this investigation it can also have a nearly abrupt character the decrease of s and ks induced by the perturbing run in a situation of no tillage management practice table 1 could also be viewed as a suggestion that soil recovery processes occurred after previous damaging hu et al 2012 2018 bagarello et al 2020 rainfall energy is known to influence infiltration since it controls development of a structural seal layer at the soil surface thompson and james 1985 smith et al 1990 schiettecatte et al 2005 king and bjorneberg 2012 according to investigation the energy of the applied water by a beerkan infiltration run could be used to establish a link between the hydrological process that has to be simulated and a soil hydraulic characterization appropriate to reach the desired objective however it will be necessary to take into account that the same total energy can be obtained with different intensities and durations rainfall and with different water volumes and heights of pouring infiltration run moreover it should also be considered that in natural conditions part of the energy could be dissipated by the vegetation covering the soil whereas according to the experimental protocol for a beerkan infiltration run lassabatere et al 2006 the surface vegetation has to be removed from the area to be sampled even in this case an effect of the vegetation on the response of the l and h runs cannot be excluded because the roots remain in situ and they could reinforce the soil cislaghi et al 2017 predicting areal infiltration and runoff from small bare catchments in arid and semiarid areas needs considering areal heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties and particularly of ks as well as the presence of a sealed layer at the soil surface assouline and mualem 2002 2006 obtaining in the field the effective soil hydraulic properties by considering that soil structure deteriorates as a consequence of raindrop impact is still a challenge this investigation could open some new perspective to approach this objective by adapting common single ring infiltration methods a non perturbing infiltration experiment provides the necessary information to characterize the nearly undisturbed soil whereas the perturbing infiltration experiment characterizes the upper altered soil layer di prima et al 2018 the experiments are simple and rather parsimonious in terms of both equipment and required water amounts which means that many replicated infiltration runs can be carried out to characterize areal variability of soil hydraulic properties in the future the actual potential of this methodological suggestion could perhaps be checked by establishing a link between hydrological data and alternative soil hydraulic characterizations as an example for the ro soil fig 6 shows the relationship between the time to ponding tp and the rainfall intensity irain developed according to white et al 1989 for each of the four experimental scenarios of this investigation if at least a few tp values can experimentally be determined the closeness of the tp data to the predicted tp irain relationships could represent a criterion to establish what is the most appropriate soil sampling methodology this kind of check could yield a more robust information as compared with that obtained by comparing different methods to measure soil hydraulic properties the reason is that especially with reference to ks different methods can be expected to yield dissimilar results and there is no independent ks datum or benchmark upon which evaluations and judgments can be made reynolds et al 2000 picciafuoco et al 2019 5 conclusions this investigation showed that the single ring beerkan infiltration run can be adapted in an attempt to induce a soil disturbance that is likely similar to the one expected when a rainfall event produces runoff in particular using much water for the experiment and applying water from a relatively high height on the infiltration surface determined an appreciable decrease of sorptivity s and particularly of saturated soil hydraulic conductivity ks as compared with the standard beerkan run these data seem more hydrologically relevant than those obtained with standard experimental methodologies since they were obtained in a soil condition that is closer to that expected when runoff is formed the investigation also showed that in an initially relatively dry soil deterioration effects attributable to the mechanical impact of the water required less water for a silty clay soil than a loam soil the gravitational potential energy ep of the water used for the infiltrometer experiment explained much of the variance of the ks and s values obtained by different experimental methodologies in conclusion an infiltrometer experiment can be carried out in such a way to mimic what happens in real situations when rainfall produces hortonian runoff soil disturbance can be controlled by changing the water volume used for the run and the height of water pouring the field experiment remains rather simple and consequently the attractiveness of infiltrometer methods is not reduced by adapting the run to a hydrologically representative situation the few encouraging signs about the reliability of the proposed method to estimate soil hydraulic properties relevant for simulating runoff deserve stronger confirmation in a hydrological perspective it also seems advisable to improve our knowledge on the short term modifications of ks and s in an attempt to verify if under what experimental conditions and to what level they stabilize when a disturbing run is carried out the lowest possible s and ks values could be viewed as a sort of hydrologically relevant index since they describe the most favorable condition to runoff occurrence according to this investigation these developments should not be excessively demanding from an experimental point of view an alternative method to characterize a soil in a runoff prone situation is to make the field campaign with common experimental protocols after a sealed layer has fully developed establishing a comparison between the two options inducing disturbance working on naturally altered soil is obviously advisable although the latter option places constraints on the time when the experiment can be performed funding this research did not receive any specific grant
