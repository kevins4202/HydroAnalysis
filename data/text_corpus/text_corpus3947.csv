in ph or dose indicating similar difficulties in a coagulation process the difference in components c1 and c2 may partly explain the difference in efficiencies of removal of bp in water from different

conditions in coagulation membrane filtration processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water samples three types of surface river water in japan were used as raw water samples fig 1 water from kikuchi river k rw was taken upstream of several large cities in the vicinity and very clean as drinking water source water form edo river e rw a river flowing past tokyo contained many more impurities yodo river water y rw was highly contaminated and had the worst quality among the three samples as the river traverses several metropolitan areas and for approximately the river water is contaminated by wastewater yamamura et al 2014 before analysis particles larger than 10 μm were removed using a 10 μm stainless steel cartridge filter the characteristics of the three types of water are listed in table 1 the total organic carbon toc in k rw was approximately half that in y rw table 1 indicating less organic matter k rw also had the lowest specific ultraviolet absorbance suva an indicator of hydrophobicity of organic matter table 1 suggesting that k rw was rich in hydrophilic organic matter the bp concentration for each water sample filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters was determined by the method described in section 2 3 analytical methods k rw had the lowest bp concentration and y rw the highest implying high and low water quality respectively table 1 fig 2 this is consistent with the finding that water contaminated by wastewater always contains large amounts of bps tian et al 2013 however the difference in bp concentration between k rw and e rw was insubstantial the eem contours of each raw water sample filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters normalised against their toc data are shown in fig 3 and the original eem contours of each water sample can be found in fig s1 2 2 jar tests jar tests were performed at room temperature 23 3 c using six replicates of standard 1 l beakers and a six paddle jar test apparatus commercial pac 10 as al2o3 basicity 50 55 taiki chemical japan was used as the coagulant for all samples the ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 n sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid solution prior to the addition of pac the same amount of pac as in the six tubes of the jar test apparatus was at the same time added to the six beakers the ph levels after pac addition were 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 7 5 and 8 0 for k rw and 5 0 5 5 6 0 6 5 7 0 and 8 0 for e rw and y rw samples were mixed for 3 min at 160 rpm g value 207 s 1 after which the coagulated water was allowed to settle for 3 min taking into account the in line coagulation membrane filtration and our aim of exploring the behaviour of bp during coagulation we used fast mixing only slow mixing flocculation and sedimentation were excluded from our investigation after settling the supernatant from 2 cm below the water surface was collected centrifuged 3000 rpm for 10 min and finally passed through 1 0 and 0 5 μm membrane filters to obtain samples for subsequent analysis these separation steps were performed to avoid cake formation caused by large particles which might affect the small particles in the filtrate the same jar test and subsequent separation steps and analyses were also conducted using ph adjusted raw water without added coagulant in order to compare the effects of coagulation and its absence 2 3 analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a toc analyser toc l shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured with a uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu in a natural river the quantity of bp is generally so low that characterisation is difficult the zeta potential zp of bp is especially difficult to quantify because of the high dilution rate around 105 particles ml and tiny particle size below 0 1 μm the reported lower concentration limits for common zp analysers such as zetasizer nano and nanosight ns500 malvern instruments uk are 0 1 mg l and 106 particles ml respectively ding et al 2016 to improve the sensitivity of particle tracking analysis we developed a novel analyser that combines a high power violet laser and a high magnification microscope this equipment allows the determination of the zp of colloidal particles with sizes above 20 nm based on the observation of their mobility details of the equipment are provided elsewhere ding et al 2016 as the sample was passed through a 0 5 μm membrane filter the characterised particles ranged between 0 5 μm and 20 nm and were thus considered meso particles the mw distribution of doc was determined by hplc sec using an organic carbon detector ocd her et al 2002 2003 yamamura et al 2007 two columns tskgel g4000pw φ 7 5 mm 30 cm tosoh japan and toyopearl hw 65s φ 7 5 mm 30 cm tosoh were connected in series to obtain a wide range of mws the mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer ph 6 8 adjusted with sodium sulphate to an ionic strength of 0 1 m the hplc system was operated at a flow rate of 1 15 ml min and the injection volume of the sample was set at 2 ml the calibration line between the mw and retention time of the sec columns was tested using standard solutions of polyethylene glycol and dextran the concentrations of bp and humic substance ha were thus obtained by integrating the peak area from 11 to 17 min for bp and from 17 to 22 min for ha fig s2 the eem was analysed in a 1 cm cuvette using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 2700 hitachi japan a filter with a cut off wavelength of 295 nm was used to remove second order rayleigh scattering both emission and excitation wavelengths were varied from 220 nm to 550 nm in increments of 5 nm slit widths were set to 10 nm and the scan speed was set to 60 000 nm min sanchez et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 an eem spectrum of milli q water was subtracted from each eem spectrum to remove the raman scattering effect the eems of both bp and ha fractions separated by hplc sec were analysed and then subjected to parafac analyses the parafac modelling of eems was run in matlab 2016a mathworks usa with domfluor toolbox ver 1 7 following stedmon and bro 2008 a series of parafac models consisting of two to ten components were generated residual analyses spectral property examinations and split half analyses were used in model validation to determine the final valid model and components stedmon and bro 2008 because components extracted using parafac may represent groups of dom with similar fluorescent properties we could not convert each component s fluorescence into concentration by comparison with fluorescent standards stedmon and bro 2008 hence the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax score of each parafac component was used to illustrate the quantitative and qualitative differences between samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of coagulation conditions on hplc sec fractions the changes in bp and ha fractions of the three different samples to which coagulation was applied at different ph and pac dosages are illustrated in fig 4 the potential contaminants in each sample are native organic matter which are from original bps or has in raw water or non native organic matter which transforms from a small to a large size fraction through aggregation fig 4 shows a decrease in concentration for every sample when the coagulation was applied from this we conclude that the removal of native organic matter proceeded at a faster rate than the formation of non native aggregate comparison of the levels of decrease in bp and ha fractions clarified that bps were more easily reduced by coagulation than were has regardless of the coagulation condition and that the impact of the changes in ph or pac dose was more significant for bp than it was for ha the removal of bp or ha per pac dose also showed an apparent influence of coagulation conditions on the preference of pac for removing bp fig s3 this trend is consistent with a previous study by haberkamp et al 2011 reporting that macromolecular substances such as bps were easy to remove by coagulation while smaller compact molecules such as has were difficult to remove comparison showed similarity among the three source waters in terms of the degree of reduction of ha under every coagulation condition contours tended to be lateral at low dose ie 1 0 mg al l but perpendicular at high dose ie 1 0 mg al l in other words has could be removed more efficiently at higher coagulant dosage and at lower ph as is described in textbooks for conventional coagulation process tambo 1980 on the other hand the removal of bp strongly depended on the type of source water and the dosage of pac for example at low pac dose 1 0 mg al l bps in k rw and e rw were equally influenced by both ph and dose while bps in y rw were far more influenced by dose than by ph when the pac dosage exceeded 1 0 mg al l bps in k rw and e rw were influenced more by ph than by pac dose and there was a significant relationship for k rw despite the fact that bps were completely removed in y rw this result clearly demonstrates that the nature of bp depends on the type of source water and that the apparent difference in bp removal trends between y rw and k rw e rw may be due to the much higher content of non charged bps in y rw zheng et al 2017 showed changes in bp content in terms of n c ratio by monitoring river water with lc ocd over the course of a year the difference in molecular properties may result in differences in the decrease in bp concentration details of the difference in bp characteristics such as zp or organic composition are discussed in later sections 3 2 estimation of bp charge property by comparing meso particle zps because of the linear correlation between the bp concentration and the number of meso particles fig s4 in the present study we posited that bps consisted of macromolecular particles with sizes between 20 nm and 0 5 μm we determined their zp after a series of coagulation processes to identify the effect of coagulation conditions on the charge neutralisation of the bp fraction distributions of zp determined for bps when the coagulation was applied at different ph and pac dosage are illustrated in fig 5 the zp of bps changed substantially with the coagulation conditions when the pac dose was lower than 1 0 mg al l both ph and pac dose had a large impact on the zp as shown by the oblique contour lines however when the pac dose exceeded 1 0 mg al l zp changed only when the ph was shifted pac dose had little impact on zp even when the pac dose exceeded 3 0 mg al l this indicates that the neutralisation of bp can only be achieved by lowering the ph and not by elevation of pac dosage comparison of the trends of bp removal fig 4 and zp fig 5 suggests that conditions in which zp is neutralised are most effective for bp removal that is low ph and high pac dose are appropriate for the elimination of bp this finding indicates that the coagulation process effectively reduces bps by charge neutralisation in contrast hydrophilic organic matter such as carbohydrates and proteins has been reported to be difficult to eliminate through coagulation interestingly the ph values at which bp was neutralised varied with the type of source water at 1 0 mg al l dosage bps in k rw e rw and y rw were neutralised at ph 5 6 5 3 and 5 8 respectively bps partly consist of proteinaceous organic matter and the difference in isoelectric points of proteins may contribute to the difference in ph for neutralisation the bp content was further investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy as follows 3 3 fluorescence features of bp as observed by lc eem after separation by hplc sec eem fluorescence spectroscopy of bp fractions in the source water samples and coagulated water was performed the typical eem contours of the bp fraction in the samples are illustrated in fig 6 a c comparison of fig 6 a b and c shows that the bp fraction for all types of source water produced two peaks at excitation emission wavelengths ex em 275 330 and ex em 225 325 these peaks have different intensities indicating different bp concentrations they are proteinaceous peaks which is consistent with other reports of the peaks of the bp fraction of surface water after lc eem her et al 2003 the typical eem contours of the bp fraction after coagulation of each type of water are shown in fig 6 d f comparing the eem contours of bp fractions before and after coagulation a vs d b vs e and c vs f in fig 6 we can easily discern two peaks for the coagulated water peak 1 ex 275 280 nm em 325 335 nm peak 2 ex 220 225 nm em 325 335 nm these are at locations similar to those for the source water implying that there was no chemical change during coagulation moreover there was no peak indicating humic like substances for any bp fraction of coagulated water fig 6 d f this implies that has of small mw could not increase to the size of the bp fraction during the coagulation process in contrast all of the ha fractions for each type of water and coagulated water produced separate peaks indicating humic like and protein like substances fig s5 comparison of fig 6 with fig s5 confirmed that has tend to aggregate into particles larger than bps which can then be removed by settling in addition to the examples in fig 6 all eem contours of the bp fraction before and after coagulation are summarised in table s1 peak intensity ratios of the bp fraction for coagulated water were calculated on the basis of the source water for the three samples table s1 these are summarised in fig 7 a ratio larger than 1 0 means that the peak intensity increased after coagulation for possible reasons discussed in the following although it is observed that the intensity of specific fluorophores is linearly correlated with doc removal gone et al 2009 the wavelength and intensity of the fluorophores do not just depend on the properties of dom but they can also undergo quenching or enhancement by factors such as temperature and ph as well as dom complexation with metal ions such as iron and aluminium hudson et al 2007 vera et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 in this study temperature was held constant during fluorescence analysis to avoid thermal quenching the ph range 5 8 used in this study is unlikely to affect fluorescence analysis and is lower than the variability caused by changes in dom hudson et al 2007 gone et al 2009 also reported that the effect of ph 4 5 7 5 on fluorescence is negligible during the coagulation flocculation process the iron concentration was below 0 01 mg fe l for all water samples in this study which suggests that the quenching effect of iron is negligible ohno et al 2008 hence the increase in intensity of protein like peaks after coagulation may be estimated from the quenching effect of humic like components on protein like components carstea et al 2016 wang et al 2015 or from the quenching enhancement effect of aluminium wang et al 2015 reported a significant quenching effect of humic like components from suwannee river and nordic reservoir on tyrosine 52 and 46 respectively and tryptophan 35 and 36 respectively on the basis of the overlap between their fluorescence peaks related to inter component interactions the possible quenching effect of organic matter increases the difficulty of quantifying the change in bp fractions during coagulation in addition to the difficulty of quantifying the difference in bp fraction behaviours in different water samples therefore parafac analyses were performed 3 4 parafac analyses of bp fractions parafac analyses of two to ten components were performed using eem data for all bp fraction samples split half validation resulted in a model containing three components c1 c3 fig 8 table 2 shows the main peaks of extracted components and their probable origins c3 appeared as an individual component which indicates the presence of humic like substances in the bp fractions fig 8 this implies a low amount of humic like substances trapped in or aggregated with bp fractions the peak of which could not be detected when the eem of the bp fraction was directly measured in contrast a component indicating protein like substances was also separated after parafac analyses of all eem data for the ha fraction samples c1 in fig s6 the eem parafac analysis showed that the bp fraction in natural water is not a unitary constituent and that it consists of at least three components the behaviours of the components under application of coagulation are illustrated as topographical maps in fig 9 crittenden et al 2012 from the decomposition of bp fractions we concluded that the quenching enhancement effect of one fraction of organic matter on another were negligible thus the changes in fmax score for each component might be due to the coagulation effect or residual aluminium quenching enhancement effect comparison of the maps of the different water types reveals that trends of the fmax score vary with the coagulation conditions depending on the source water even for the same component this is probably due to the diversity of the organic content of each component we suggest that the parafac components could be further fractured into multiple organic components if more data were collected however even at the present resolution several similarities in the behaviour of fmax score for the same component can be observed c1 varied a lot after coagulation of k rw and y rw the fmax score of c1 of k rw and y rw decreased markedly with decreasing ph at the same dose because ph levels of 5 8 did not have a quenching effect the decrease in c1 is probably due to its proteinaceous components which would be easy to remove at a ph near their isoelectric point around ph 5 for tryptophan however fmax score of c1 increased more than that of raw water when we increased the dose at the same ph ie ph 7 this indicates the enhancement effect of residual aluminium in the bp fraction it is thus not possible to discuss the influence of dose on c1 on the other hand e rw originally contained only trace amounts of c1 and thus the changes after coagulation were difficult to detect c2 was less dynamic than c1 as indicated by its wider contour in the topographical map this implies that the elimination of c2 by coagulation is difficult even when the coagulation condition is shifted and other unit processes for the elimination of c2 are required c3 was not detected clearly except in k rw probably because of the low suva value of k rw which implies a high percentage of hydrophilic dom the behaviours of c1 and c2 in the coagulation process were completely different c1 was strongly affected by the coagulation conditions whereas c2 was not this finding can partially explain the difference in efficiencies of bp coagulation observed in a number of previous studies kimura and oki 2017 showed large difference in the efficiencies of bp removal under the same coagulation conditions for four types of surface water chitose river yodo river toyohira river and yoichi river in japan the bp removal efficiency was highest in the case of toyohira river and lowest in the case of yodo river probably because toyohira river was rich in c1 while yodo river was rich in c2 on the basis of the results obtained in the present study we can conclude that the composition of bps especially c1 and c2 components requires much attention in the selection of appropriate processes of treating surface water with bps the reason for the differences in coagulation behaviour is likely to be the higher isoelectric point of c1 as compared with that of c2 which leads to a preference for charge neutralisation of c1 during coagulation further investigation of the mechanism of c1 and c2 coagulation is needed we did not determine the characteristics of bps such as n c ratio which could be determined by lc ocd combined with organic nitrogen detector and molecular structure which could be analysed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy qualitatively from the three water sources as our focus was on determining the different coagulation characteristics of bps in different source waters and their causes as expressed as differences in composition of the bp fractions our next step will be the investigation of the coagulation characteristics of bps with a specific n c ratio 4 conclusions bps have been reported as the main organic foulants in coagulation membrane filtration processes we here propose optimal coagulation conditions for maximum bp removal many previous studies have treated bps as a single uniform organic component when in fact they usually consist of multiple components that have complex and heterogeneous properties the lack of studies on bp composition and coagulation characteristics has led to difficulties in selecting optimal conditions for bp elimination in coagulation processes in this study we first investigated the coagulation characteristics of concentration and charge properties of the bp fractions in three types of surface water by performing jar tests under various coagulation conditions the bp fractions were then decomposed into several components by fractionating and characterising the bp samples by combined hplc sec and eem parafac analyses finally the behaviour of each fluorescent organic component in the bp fractions was investigated in detail the main results obtained are as follows 1 the trends of bp removal efficiency during coagulation differed between the three types of surface water while that of ha did not this difference may be due to the different dom characteristics of the source water 2 the conditions under which zp was neutral low ph and high pac dosage were best suited for bp removal the difference in neutralisation ph for bps at the same pac dosage might be due to the proteinaceous organic matter in the bp fractions and its effect on the isoelectric point 3 bps in natural water were categorised into three parafac components c1 and c2 protein like substances and c3 humic like substances 4 c1 c2 and c3 showed different behaviours under various coagulation conditions in the different water samples removal of c1 was strongly affected by ph but that of c2 was influenced little by coagulation this difference may partly explain the different efficiencies of bp coagulation in various raw water samples 5 results suggest that differences in the composition of bps especially c1 and c2 components necessitate increased attention to the selection of appropriate treatment processes for treating surface water with bps if c1 dominates the bp fraction then coagulation at acidic condition is recommended in contrast if c2 dominates the bp fraction then coagulation is not an appropriate treatment process for removing bps

steps and analyses were also conducted using ph adjusted raw water without added coagulant in order to compare the effects of coagulation and its absence 2 3 analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a toc analyser toc l shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured with a uv spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu in a natural river the quantity of bp is generally so low that characterisation is difficult the zeta potential zp of bp is especially difficult to quantify because of the high dilution rate around 105 particles ml and tiny particle size below 0 1 μm the reported lower concentration limits for common zp analysers such as zetasizer nano and nanosight ns500 malvern instruments uk are 0 1 mg l and 106 particles ml respectively ding et al 2016 to improve the sensitivity of particle tracking analysis we developed a novel analyser that combines a high power violet laser and a high magnification microscope this equipment allows the determination of the zp of colloidal particles with sizes above 20 nm based on the observation of their mobility details of the equipment are provided elsewhere ding et al 2016 as the sample was passed through a 0 5 μm membrane filter the characterised particles ranged between 0 5 μm and 20 nm and were thus considered meso particles the mw distribution of doc was determined by hplc sec using an organic carbon detector ocd her et al 2002 2003 yamamura et al 2007 two columns tskgel g4000pw φ 7 5 mm 30 cm tosoh japan and toyopearl hw 65s φ 7 5 mm 30 cm tosoh were connected in series to obtain a wide range of mws the mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer ph 6 8 adjusted with sodium sulphate to an ionic strength of 0 1 m the hplc system was operated at a flow rate of 1 15 ml min and the injection volume of the sample was set at 2 ml the calibration line between the mw and retention time of the sec columns was tested using standard solutions of polyethylene glycol and dextran the concentrations of bp and humic substance ha were thus obtained by integrating the peak area from 11 to 17 min for bp and from 17 to 22 min for ha fig s2 the eem was analysed in a 1 cm cuvette using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 2700 hitachi japan a filter with a cut off wavelength of 295 nm was used to remove second order rayleigh scattering both emission and excitation wavelengths were varied from 220 nm to 550 nm in increments of 5 nm slit widths were set to 10 nm and the scan speed was set to 60 000 nm min sanchez et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 an eem spectrum of milli q water was subtracted from each eem spectrum to remove the raman scattering effect the eems of both bp and ha fractions separated by hplc sec were analysed and then subjected to parafac analyses the parafac modelling of eems was run in matlab 2016a mathworks usa with domfluor toolbox ver 1 7 following stedmon and bro 2008 a series of parafac models consisting of two to ten components were generated residual analyses spectral property examinations and split half analyses were used in model validation to determine the final valid model and components stedmon and bro 2008 because components extracted using parafac may represent groups of dom with similar fluorescent properties we could not convert each component s fluorescence into concentration by comparison with fluorescent standards stedmon and bro 2008 hence the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax score of each parafac component was used to illustrate the quantitative and qualitative differences between samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of coagulation conditions on hplc sec fractions the changes in bp and ha fractions of the three different samples to which coagulation was applied at different ph and pac dosages are illustrated in fig 4 the potential contaminants in each sample are native organic matter which are from original bps or has in raw water or non native organic matter which transforms from a small to a large size fraction through aggregation fig 4 shows a decrease in concentration for every sample when the coagulation was applied from this we conclude that the removal of native organic matter proceeded at a faster rate than the formation of non native aggregate comparison of the levels of decrease in bp and ha fractions clarified that bps were more easily reduced by coagulation than were has regardless of the coagulation condition and that the impact of the changes in ph or pac dose was more significant for bp than it was for ha the removal of bp or ha per pac dose also showed an apparent influence of coagulation conditions on the preference of pac for removing bp fig s3 this trend is consistent with a previous study by haberkamp et al 2011 reporting that macromolecular substances such as bps were easy to remove by coagulation while smaller compact molecules such as has were difficult to remove comparison showed similarity among the three source waters in terms of the degree of reduction of ha under every coagulation condition contours tended to be lateral at low dose ie 1 0 mg al l but perpendicular at high dose ie 1 0 mg al l in other words has could be removed more efficiently at higher coagulant dosage and at lower ph as is described in textbooks for conventional coagulation process tambo 1980 on the other hand the removal of bp strongly depended on the type of source water and the dosage of pac for example at low pac dose 1 0 mg al l bps in k rw and e rw were equally influenced by both ph and dose while bps in y rw were far more influenced by dose than by ph when the pac dosage exceeded 1 0 mg al l bps in k rw and e rw were influenced more by ph than by pac dose and there was a significant relationship for k rw despite the fact that bps were completely removed in y rw this result clearly demonstrates that the nature of bp depends on the type of source water and that the apparent difference in bp removal trends between y rw and k rw e rw may be due to the much higher content of non charged bps in y rw zheng et al 2017 showed changes in bp content in terms of n c ratio by monitoring river water with lc ocd over the course of a year the difference in molecular properties may result in differences in the decrease in bp concentration details of the difference in bp characteristics such as zp or organic composition are discussed in later sections 3 2 estimation of bp charge property by comparing meso particle zps because of the linear correlation between the bp concentration and the number of meso particles fig s4 in the present study we posited that bps consisted of macromolecular particles with sizes between 20 nm and 0 5 μm we determined their zp after a series of coagulation processes to identify the effect of coagulation conditions on the charge neutralisation of the bp fraction distributions of zp determined for bps when the coagulation was applied at different ph and pac dosage are illustrated in fig 5 the zp of bps changed substantially with the coagulation conditions when the pac dose was lower than 1 0 mg al l both ph and pac dose had a large impact on the zp as shown by the oblique contour lines however when the pac dose exceeded 1 0 mg al l zp changed only when the ph was shifted pac dose had little impact on zp even when the pac dose exceeded 3 0 mg al l this indicates that the neutralisation of bp can only be achieved by lowering the ph and not by elevation of pac dosage comparison of the trends of bp removal fig 4 and zp fig 5 suggests that conditions in which zp is neutralised are most effective for bp removal that is low ph and high pac dose are appropriate for the elimination of bp this finding indicates that the coagulation process effectively reduces bps by charge neutralisation in contrast hydrophilic organic matter such as carbohydrates and proteins has been reported to be difficult to eliminate through coagulation interestingly the ph values at which bp was neutralised varied with the type of source water at 1 0 mg al l dosage bps in k rw e rw and y rw were neutralised at ph 5 6 5 3 and 5 8 respectively bps partly consist of proteinaceous organic matter and the difference in isoelectric points of proteins may contribute to the difference in ph for neutralisation the bp content was further investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy as follows 3 3 fluorescence features of bp as observed by lc eem after separation by hplc sec eem fluorescence spectroscopy of bp fractions in the source water samples and coagulated water was performed the typical eem contours of the bp fraction in the samples are illustrated in fig 6 a c comparison of fig 6 a b and c shows that the bp fraction for all types of source water produced two peaks at excitation emission wavelengths ex em 275 330 and ex em 225 325 these peaks have different intensities indicating different bp concentrations they are proteinaceous peaks which is consistent with other reports of the peaks of the bp fraction of surface water after lc eem her et al 2003 the typical eem contours of the bp fraction after coagulation of each type of water are shown in fig 6 d f comparing the eem contours of bp fractions before and after coagulation a vs d b vs e and c vs f in fig 6 we can easily discern two peaks for the coagulated water peak 1 ex 275 280 nm em 325 335 nm peak 2 ex 220 225 nm em 325 335 nm these are at locations similar to those for the source water implying that there was no chemical change during coagulation moreover there was no peak indicating humic like substances for any bp fraction of coagulated water fig 6 d f this implies that has of small mw could not increase to the size of the bp fraction during the coagulation process in contrast all of the ha fractions for each type of water and coagulated water produced separate peaks indicating humic like and protein like substances fig s5 comparison of fig 6 with fig s5 confirmed that has tend to aggregate into particles larger than bps which can then be removed by settling in addition to the examples in fig 6 all eem contours of the bp fraction before and after coagulation are summarised in table s1 peak intensity ratios of the bp fraction for coagulated water were calculated on the basis of the source water for the three samples table s1 these are summarised in fig 7 a ratio larger than 1 0 means that the peak intensity increased after coagulation for possible reasons discussed in the following although it is observed that the intensity of specific fluorophores is linearly correlated with doc removal gone et al 2009 the wavelength and intensity of the fluorophores do not just depend on the properties of dom but they can also undergo quenching or enhancement by factors such as temperature and ph as well as dom complexation with metal ions such as iron and aluminium hudson et al 2007 vera et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 in this study temperature was held constant during fluorescence analysis to avoid thermal quenching the ph range 5 8 used in this study is unlikely to affect fluorescence analysis and is lower than the variability caused by changes in dom hudson et al 2007 gone et al 2009 also reported that the effect of ph 4 5 7 5 on fluorescence is negligible during the coagulation flocculation process the iron concentration was below 0 01 mg fe l for all water samples in this study which suggests that the quenching effect of iron is negligible ohno et al 2008 hence the increase in intensity of protein like peaks after coagulation may be estimated from the quenching effect of humic like components on protein like components carstea et al 2016 wang et al 2015 or from the quenching enhancement effect of aluminium wang et al 2015 reported a significant quenching effect of humic like components from suwannee river and nordic reservoir on tyrosine 52 and 46 respectively and tryptophan 35 and 36 respectively on the basis of the overlap between their fluorescence peaks related to inter component interactions the possible quenching effect of organic matter increases the difficulty of quantifying the change in bp fractions during coagulation in addition to the difficulty of quantifying the difference in bp fraction behaviours in different water samples therefore parafac analyses were performed 3 4 parafac analyses of bp fractions parafac analyses of two to ten components were performed using eem data for all bp fraction samples split half validation resulted in a model containing three components c1 c3 fig 8 table 2 shows the main peaks of extracted components and their probable origins c3 appeared as an individual component which indicates the presence of humic like substances in the bp fractions fig 8 this implies a low amount of humic like substances trapped in or aggregated with bp fractions the peak of which could not be detected when the eem of the bp fraction was directly measured in contrast a component indicating protein like substances was also separated after parafac analyses of all eem data for the ha fraction samples c1 in fig s6 the eem parafac analysis showed that the bp fraction in natural water is not a unitary constituent and that it consists of at least three components the behaviours of the components under application of coagulation are illustrated as topographical maps in fig 9 crittenden et al 2012 from the decomposition of bp fractions we concluded that the quenching enhancement effect of one fraction of organic matter on another were negligible thus the changes in fmax score for each component might be due to the coagulation effect or residual aluminium quenching enhancement effect comparison of the maps of the different water types reveals that trends of the fmax score vary with the coagulation conditions depending on the source water even for the same component this is probably due to the diversity of the organic content of each component we suggest that the parafac components could be further fractured into multiple organic components if more data were collected however even at the present resolution several similarities in the behaviour of fmax score for the same component can be observed c1 varied a lot after coagulation of k rw and y rw the fmax score of c1 of k rw and y rw decreased markedly with decreasing ph at the same dose because ph levels of 5 8 did not have a quenching effect the decrease in c1 is probably due to its proteinaceous components which would be easy to remove at a ph near their isoelectric point around ph 5 for tryptophan however fmax score of c1 increased more than that of raw water when we increased the dose at the same ph ie ph 7 this indicates the enhancement effect of residual aluminium in the bp fraction it is thus not possible to discuss the influence of dose on c1 on the other hand e rw originally contained only trace amounts of c1 and thus the changes after coagulation were difficult to detect c2 was less dynamic than c1 as indicated by its wider contour in the topographical map this implies that the elimination of c2 by coagulation is difficult even when the coagulation condition is shifted and other unit processes for the elimination of c2 are required c3 was not detected clearly except in k rw probably because of the low suva value of k rw which implies a high percentage of hydrophilic dom the behaviours of c1 and c2 in the coagulation process were completely different c1 was strongly affected by the coagulation conditions whereas c2 was not this finding can partially explain the difference in efficiencies of bp coagulation observed in a number of previous studies kimura and oki 2017 showed large difference in the efficiencies of bp removal under the same coagulation conditions for four types of surface water chitose river yodo river toyohira river and yoichi river in japan the bp removal efficiency was highest in the case of toyohira river and lowest in the case of yodo river probably because toyohira river was rich in c1 while yodo river was rich in c2 on the basis of the results obtained in the present study we can conclude that the composition of bps especially c1 and c2 components requires much attention in the selection of appropriate processes of treating surface water with bps the reason for the differences in coagulation behaviour is likely to be the higher isoelectric point of c1 as compared with that of c2 which leads to a preference for charge neutralisation of c1 during coagulation further investigation of the mechanism of c1 and c2 coagulation is needed we did not determine the characteristics of bps such as n c ratio which could be determined by lc ocd combined with organic nitrogen detector and molecular structure which could be analysed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy qualitatively from the three water sources as our focus was on determining the different coagulation characteristics of bps in different source waters and their causes as expressed as differences in composition of the bp fractions our next step will be the investigation of the coagulation characteristics of bps with a specific n c ratio 4 conclusions bps have been reported as the main organic foulants in coagulation membrane filtration processes we here propose optimal coagulation conditions for maximum bp removal many previous studies have treated bps as a single uniform organic component when in fact they usually consist of multiple components that have complex and heterogeneous properties the lack of studies on bp composition and coagulation characteristics has led to difficulties in selecting optimal conditions for bp elimination in coagulation processes in this study we first investigated the coagulation characteristics of concentration and charge properties of the bp fractions in three types of surface water by performing jar tests under various coagulation conditions the bp fractions were then decomposed into several components by fractionating and characterising the bp samples by combined hplc sec and eem parafac analyses finally the behaviour of each fluorescent organic component in the bp fractions was investigated in detail the main results obtained are as follows 1 the trends of bp removal efficiency during coagulation differed between the three types of surface water while that of ha did not this difference may be due to the different dom characteristics of the source water 2 the conditions under which zp was neutral low ph and high pac dosage were best suited for bp removal the difference in neutralisation ph for bps at the same pac dosage might be due to the proteinaceous organic matter in the bp fractions and its effect on the isoelectric point 3 bps in natural water were categorised into three parafac components c1 and c2 protein like substances and c3 humic like substances 4 c1 c2 and c3 showed different behaviours under various coagulation conditions in the different water samples removal of c1 was strongly affected by ph but that of c2 was influenced little by coagulation this difference may partly explain the different efficiencies of bp coagulation in various raw water samples 5 results suggest that differences in the composition of bps especially c1 and c2 components necessitate increased attention to the selection of appropriate treatment processes for treating surface water with bps if c1 dominates the bp fraction then coagulation at acidic condition is recommended in contrast if c2 dominates the bp fraction then coagulation is not an appropriate treatment process for removing bps

19736,phosphorus p is an important and often limiting element in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem a lack of understanding of its distribution and structures in the environment limits the design of effective p mitigation and recovery approaches here we developed a robust method employing size exclusion chromatography sec coupled to an icp ms to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of p in environmental samples the most abundant fraction of p varied widely in different environmental samples i orthophosphate was the dominant fraction 93 100 in one lake two aerosols and doc isolate samples ii species of 400 600 da range were abundant 74 100 in two surface waters and iii species of 150 350 da range were abundant in wastewater effluents sec doc of the aqueous samples using a similar sec column showed overlapping peaks for the 400 600 da species in two surface waters and for 20 kda species in the effluents suggesting that these fractions are likely associated with organic matter the mw resolution and performance of sec icp ms agreed well with the time integrated results obtained using conventional ultrafiltration method results show that sec in combination with icp ms and doc has the potential to be a powerful and easy to use method in identifying unknown fractions of p in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus molecular weight distribution size exclusion chromatography dissolved organic carbon icp ms 1 introduction phosphorus p is an important and often limiting element in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem and is at the center of important environmental challenges from a perspective of excess and scarcity phosphorus is essential because of its biochemical role in rna dna and cellular processes gifford et al 2015 modern agriculture heavily relies on mineral phosphate fertilizers to achieve high yields and feed an ever growing population rittmann et al 2011 venkatesan et al 2016 excess organic and inorganic phosphate mainly from plant and animal agricultural waste streams enters waterways and leads to algae blooms in fresh and seawater that threaten ecosystems while the most advanced wastewater treatment systems remove and in some cases attempt to capture and reuse inorganic p reasonably well they still discharge organic p op into waterways mayer et al 2016 research has been performed on eutrophication and p cycling in estuaries wetlands lakes etc over the last decade and identified the bioavailability of op as a major and underestimated issue björkman and karl 2003 ni et al 2016 pant et al 2002 op is known to be a complex mixture of many different species including dna and rna fragments phospholipids phosphoproteins and phosphate esters baldwin 2013 worsfold et al 2008 in addition to the unknown fractions of op total p tp in environmental systems is also comprised of condensed inorganic phosphates polyphosphates and colloidal p moorleghem et al 2011 studies have addressed the mineralization of these unknown forms but all from a rather coarse perspective as chemically the op and colloidal p remains poorly characterized the complexity and lack of chemical information on tp organic and some inorganic in the environment hampers our understanding of the mineralization of the material its dynamic partitioning in water sediment particle systems and eventually its lifetime the lack of understanding of the p structures molecular weight distribution functional group composition also limits the design of p mitigation and recovery approaches the various fractions of p in the environment are often determined via indirect methods for example dissolved organic phosphorus dop measurement in the environment is calculated either as the difference between total dissolved p tdp and dissolved reactive p drp or measured in terms of drp after pretreatment or digestion of samples worsfold et al 2008 such measurements however fail to provide fundamental chemical data on the diverse nature of tp e g size distributions functional groups etc the most common tool used in the study of the speciation of p in terrestrial systems is 31p nmr spectroscopy the method is well established and showed that typically a large part of p is under the form of orthophosphate and polyphosphate cade menun 2005 nmr also allowed demonstrating the presence of phosphate esters dna rna phospholipids and glycophosphates all derived from biological processes bell et al 2017 advanced high resolution mass spectrometry was only attempted in a few studies but allowed for the discovery of select biomarker species most of the characterization work focused on soils and sediments and less research is available for 31p nmr and ms on organic matter extracted from water in part because isolation and concentration techniques have not been developed to target p like they have been for bulk carbon or nitrogen aiken et al 1992 chin et al 1994 herckes et al 2007 leenheer et al 2007 ion liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms have been successfully applied to determine the speciation of p in soils and foodstuffs koplík et al 2002 persson et al 2009 shah and caruso 2005 the advantage of using icp ms is that it detects tdp both organic and inorganic in samples unlike commonly used spectrophotometric and colorimetric p methods that detect only orthophosphates chromatographic separation prior to tdp analysis by icp ms could serve as a powerful and robust tool to conveniently analyze various fractions of p in the environment two studies have successfully applied size exclusion chromatography sec icp ms technique to investigate the soluble p species and other elements in soybean flour white bean seeds and barley grain tissues koplík et al 2002 persson et al 2009 by using sec icp ms the authors were able to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of p in food samples in a single run without the need for complex and successive ultrafiltration techniques though sec coupled to an organic carbon detector sec doc is a commonly used technique in determining the mw distribution of doc in waters her et al 2003 nam et al 2008 wang et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge a similar approach has not been applied for the determination of size distribution of p in environmental waters the goal of this study was to develop a robust sec icp ms method to conveniently determine the mw distribution of p in environmental matrices specifically in waters the developed method was tested on surface waters primary and secondary wastewater effluents aerosols and wetland samples to identify the abundant mw fraction of p in these environmental matrices the performance of the sec icp ms method was compared against a typically used ultrafiltration technique for mw fractionation sec doc was additionally applied to aqueous samples in order to qualitatively determine the fraction of p associated with organic matter though this method does not directly identify op in samples it provides critical molecular information and improved understanding of the dynamic nature of p in the environment 2 material and methods 2 1 chemical

peak shape of p supplemental fig s1 shows the peak shapes and retention time of orthophosphate injected into the sec icp ms system similar to the observation made for the sec doc system her et al 2003 increasing the ionic strength of the mobile phase increased the retention of p orthophosphate in the column and also improved the peak shape di water vs 20 mm nacl conductivity of 2 2 ms cm tris hcl buffer at ph 7 5 has been successfully used in the past for p separation in sec systems for speciation analyses in foodstuffs koplík et al 2002 persson et al 2009 when using the tris hcl buffer in our system we observed an improved retention time of 64 min but the chromatogram showed higher background noise increased baseline interferences and also tailing of peaks especially for op other buffers tested acetate ph 4 bicarbonate ph 8 6 showed either poor retention and or increased background interferences 50 mm hcl at a ph of 1 3 provided the best retention time 72 min and peak shape for orthophosphate compared to other buffers hydrochloric acid mobile phase has been used in the past for separation of inositol phosphates an abundant op form in plant materials using ion chromatography ic chen and li 2003 skoglund et al 1998 inositol phosphates are highly acidic compounds and the use of acidic mobile phase has shown to improve retention and separation on ic columns chen and li 2003 though sec separations are dependent on size of the molecules electrostatic interactions also play a role in the retention of certain charged molecules hong et al 2012 pujar and zydney 1998 injection of inositol phosphate standard in the sec icp ms system confirmed this observation by showing improved retention on to the column with 50 mm hcl mobile phase compared to other buffers also it is conventional to acidify samples 2 hno3 or 2 hcl in icp ms systems to avoid loss of analytes due to sorption in the sample introduction system which may serve as an added benefit for using acidic mobile phase though acid hydrolysis could potentially convert some op to inorganic orthophosphates this is likely to happen only at strong acidic conditions 12 m hcl 4 m h2so4 bowman 1989 turner et al 2005 to confirm this we acidified p standards phytic acid phosphate glass and l α phosphatidylcholine for 5 h using 50 mm hcl and analyzed for orthophosphate using ic no phosphate peak was detected before and after acidification of the standards confirming that there was no concern for hydrolysis of op during analysis however in order to prevent any potential acid hydrolysis of labile op the samples were acidified only prior to injection into the sec icp ms system thus minimizing the contact time with the acid to 100 min the column was calibrated using a suite of peg and p markers of known mw fig 1 the calibration curve was similar and comparable between both suites of markers the calibration curve from the p markers were used for determining the mw distribution of p in environmental samples but this experiment confirmed that it is feasible to use non p markers for calibration purposes when ideal standards are not available for speciation analysis l α phosphatidylcholine was not included in the calibration curve as they form micelles at the concentration injected into the sec icp ms system and exceeded the separation range of the column 20 000 g mol this can be seen in fig 1b where the retention time of the phospholipid matches with the injection peak or the void volume of the column 32 min or 32 ml since 1 ml min was used as the flowrate in the system retention time of the various compounds can be interchangeably interpreted as elution volume in ml the peak areas of high mw p markers phytic acid phosphate glass and l α phosphatidylcholine were 13 16 relative to the peak area of kh2po4 of the same concentration through controlled experiments we found out that this difference in peak height area and sensitivity between different markers was due to two reasons i adsorption on to sec column and ii difference in icp ms sensitivity to different p molecules after several months of running p samples and standards we flushed the sec column using 0 1 m naoh solution and collected the eluate to check for p adsorption in column a large amount of total p sub ppm levels was detected in the eluate first 150 ml fraction when analyzed using icp ms in normal mode this confirmed that a fraction of high mw p compounds was lost due to adsorption to the sec column similar observations were made in the past when analyzing for aggregates of protein molecules high mw using sec hong et al 2012 we additionally analyzed organic p markers phytic acid and l α phosphatidylcholine directly by icp ms in normal mode and the results revealed concentration dependent recoveries of 43 114 relative to orthophosphate response suggesting that the difference in peak areas can additionally result from icp ms sensitivity to different molecules organics vs inorganics we compared sec icp ms performance with ultrafiltration method see supplemental sections s2 s3 and the results agreed well both with size resolution and concentration supplemental fig s3 3 2 mw distribution of p in environmental samples the chromatograms of four surface water samples are shown in fig 2 the figures revealed that the dominant mw fraction of p in most samples was at a retention time of 73 min this matched the retention time of kh2po4 standard fig 1 indicating the presence of orthophosphate in the samples tempe town lake was the only sample in the present study that did not contain any orthophosphate and the dominant p fraction was detected at a retention time of 62 min fig 2a corresponding to a mw range of 400 600 g mol tempe canal that conveys salt river water to potable water treatment plants showed two peaks at retention times 62 min and 71 min corresponding to mw range of 400 600 g mol and 100 g mol orthophosphate respectively both surface waters are present in the dry region of the salt river with minimum input from agricultural areas hence the tdp in these samples were low 14 ppb with the abundant form of the p 74 100 within the mw range of 400 600 g mol these can likely be attributed to anthropogenic sources during recreational use of the lake and or deposits from plant materials e g inositol phosphates poly meta phosphates etc inositol phosphates are produced by plants and are released to the aquatic environments upon plant degradation baldwin 2013 they can also be produced in situ by certain species including spirodela sp brearley and hanke 1996 and azolla sp benaroya et al 2004 similarly it is known that inorganic poly and meta phosphates are produced by biological activity and also introduced from human activities persson and jansson 2012 the retention time of 62 min observed in these two surface water samples was similar to the inositol phosphate standard phytic acid 62 min used in the study and thus indicating its presence in these samples everglades is a p sensitive environment where dissolved organic phosphorus dop has been shown to represent up to 56 of tdp and 40 of dop was high mw aromatic rich compounds ged and boyer 2013 sample from lake alice from the everglades analyzed in this study showed a large tailing peak at a rt of 73 min though the peak retention time matches with that of the k2hpo4 standard the tailing peak suggests compound interaction with the column it is known that certain compounds can interact with sec and gel columns that can result in high retention time and elution volumes persson and jansson 2012 comparison of tdp from icp ms and orthophosphate from ic showed 61 difference in concentration 102 ppb suggesting that there were likely species of p that interacted with the sec column and co eluted with orthophosphate resulting in peak tailing further research is needed to investigate and identify such interacting species primary and secondary wastewater effluents collected from a wwtp located in mesa az were filtered and injected into the sec icp ms system fig 3 three peaks were initially identified for both primary and secondary effluents at a rt of 32 63 and 73 min the peak at 32 min represents the void volume of the column and hence this fraction of p is associated with high mw 20 kda compounds primary and secondary effluents are abundant with microorganisms and hence it is reasonable to assume that this fraction of p is composed of dna rna phospholipids and other microbial products containing p since the p concentration was high in the effluent samples we observed overlapping peaks between 60 and 75 min the peak de convolution software output suggested that a 3 peak model was the best fit for the observed chromatogram with rt of the peaks at 64 69 5 and 73 5 min fig 3c and f the peak at 64 min and 69 70 min suggest the presence of p fractions in the 400 450 g mol and 135 155 g mol range respectively phosphonates are a group of compounds that have direct c p bonds that can occur from natural sources phosphonolipids clark et al 1999 and or from synthetic products e g glyphosate mw 159 g mol an active ingredient used in commercial herbicides nowack 2003 these are abundantly present in aquatic environment and make up a significant fraction of the dissolved op villarreal chiu et al 2012 suggesting that they likely represent the fraction observed in this study other condensed inorganic phosphates polyphosphate and pyrophosphate of low mw range can also contribute to these observed peaks as they are known forms to exist in wastewaters we also analyzed an archived doc isolate obtained from a wetland in arizona as seen in fig 2d the majority of the p was detected at the rt of 72 min indicating high levels of orthophosphate in the sample a peak was also detected at 62 min corresponding to the mw range of 400 600 g mol as observed for the tempe surface water samples a study conducted by shaw et al investigated the influence of humic substances on the mw distribution of inorganic phosphate by adding radioisotope 32po4 3 to isolated high mw humic substances 10 kda to 50 kda in lake waters shaw et al 2000 they observed complexation of added 32po4 3 to high mw humic substances but only at specific ph ph 4 for 50 kda ph 5 5 and 7 for 10 kda 50 kda and ionic strength of the lake water samples hence the large orthophosphate peak observed for the doc isolate in our method was likely due to the dissociation of inorganic phosphates from high mw colloidal materials when the isolate was re suspended in a di water matrix we confirmed that po4 3 did not form from acid hydrolysis from acidic mobile phase 50 mm hcl used for chromatography by measuring for po4 3 using ic in non acidified water samples table 1 the orthophosphate concentration detected in ic was comparable relative percentage difference rpd 33 to the concentration determined from integration of the peak this suggests that the inorganic phosphate more likely resulted due to dissociation from colloidal doc isolates during sonication while atmospheric p has been found to be a very small reservoir compared to water or sediments it might still be important in terms of transport the chromatograms from the two aerosol samples show a large over lapping peak between 62 and 75 min supplemental fig s4 peak deconvolution suggested three peaks at a rt of 65 70 and 73 min as observed for the wastewater effluents phosphate associated with mineral dust and fuel emissions are abundant in aerosols anderson et al 2010 and may have caused the large peak at the rt of 71 73 min suggesting a significant fraction of inorganic phosphates in the samples very little is known about atmospheric op despite recent studies showing the ubiquity of biological material in aerosols and clouds and significant contributions to atmospheric organic matter herckes et al 2013 one study showed that the occurrence of op in aerosols was seasonal and increases during warm periods when biological activity increase chen et al 2006 3 3 fraction of orthophosphate in environmental samples table 1 summarizes the estimated concentration of p fractions with different mw ranges in the tested samples tdp as measured by icp ms in normal mode was higher than the concentration of po4 3 measured by ic in all aqueous samples surface waters and wastewater effluents the integrated peak area for po4 3 at rt 73 min was comparable to ic measurements for all aqueous samples except for lake alice results showed that the percentage of p as orthophosphate varied highly with an average of 55 49 n 3 of tdp in surface water samples in wastewater effluents the fraction of orthophosphate was lower and represented only 20 1 2 n 2 of tdp though the recovery of orthophosphate peaks in the sec column was satisfactory varying recovery of higher mw compounds through the column made it difficult for accurate quantification of various fractions of p in the samples as described in the methods section the high mw p markers used for calibration purpose showed a recovery of 13 16 relative to k2hpo4 standard assuming a 15 recovery of the different mw fraction of p the fraction of orthophosphate in surface waters was estimated at 42 48 which was similar to the uncorrected value estimated above 55 49 of tdp similar results were observed in a study conducted by ged and boyer where the percentage of orthophosphate varied seasonally in the everglades between 44 and 87 of tdp ged and boyer 2013 for wastewater effluent samples assuming a 15 recovery of various mw fractions of p suggests that orthophosphate can be as low as 3 2 0 2 of tp in the samples though this is an extreme case estimate of orthophosphate fraction dissolved op in wastewater effluents can be as high as 81 of the tp gu et al 2011 since the majority of the p is stored within microbial cells after secondary biological treatment qin et al 2015 of these fractions qin et al determined that 61 4 80 7 are hydrophobic in nature and exist predominantly in the forms of phosphate monoesters and phosphate diesters for aerosol samples the concentration determined by icp ms and ic was comparable indicating 90 of tdp is in the form of orthophosphate we observed multiple peaks between 62 and 75 min in aerosol samples this could be due to the presence of labile forms of low mw condensed phosphates and or particle adsorbed phosphate forms that could have released orthophosphate in the alkaline mobile phase of the ic system 3 4 qualitative determination of organic fraction of p using sec doc the mw distribution of dissolved organic matter dom in surface water and wastewater effluent samples was determined by using an sec doc system equipped with the same sec media hydroxylated methacrylate and column dimension as the sec icp ms system an overlay of both sec icp ms and sec doc chromatograms of the samples is shown in fig 4 a large peak is observed for both chromatograms at 100 g mol mw range this peak represents small mw compounds that feature an elution volume greater than the total volume of the packed bed i e outside the separation range of the column inorganic orthophosphate falls in this region of the sec icp ms chromatogram and hence the peak overlap observed with the sec doc chromatogram does not imply organic fraction of p however for higher mw compounds overlapping peaks between the chromatograms can be interpreted as the fraction of p associated with organic matter this can be observed for the primary effluent fig 4b secondary effluent fig 4e tempe town lake fig 4g and tempe canal fig 4h showing peaks at same mw fraction in both chromatograms highlighted by the arrow mark the primary and secondary effluent peaks overlap at a mw of 30 kda and is likely comprised of large biopolymers and protein like molecules e g phospholipids and nucleotides the peak at 470 g mol rt of 63 65 min determined by the deconvolution of peak do not coincide with any doc peaks highlighted by the circle fig 4c and f suggesting that these are likely to be inorganic p e g polyphosphates the tempe town lake and tempe canal samples show overlapping peaks with sec doc chromatograms at 500 g mol indicating the presence of op fraction in the samples the rt of these peaks is very close to the rt of phytic acid standard used in the calibration phytic acids or inositol phosphates are present in large quantities in aquatic environment where they may contribute to eutrophication turner et al 2005 though this is not an ideal method to quantify the op fraction of samples the qualitative results provided here is critical in understanding the distribution of various species of p in the environment that cannot be obtained by other traditional methods such as ultrafiltration and chemical extractions 3 5 advantages and limitations of sec icp ms method like sec doc the developed sec icp ms method has its advantages and limitations in its applications the most important advantage of sec icp ms over other mw characterization techniques is the ability to obtain information of various p species as a function of mw in a single 100 min run after the initial set up of the instrument minimal sample preparation was required prior to obtaining the chromatograms in ultrafiltration a series of membranes with different mw cut off a time consuming experimental set up and extended experimental runtime 5 h is required in order to obtain similar mw distribution results also the sec icp ms required much less volume 1 ml to characterize samples whereas in membrane techniques 100 ml of samples is needed using icp ms as the detector provides the opportunity to detect for multiple elements simultaneously this way various metal complexes of p species in the environment can additionally be determined in a single run this technique was successfully employed by persson et al to determine the association of phytic acid with fe in barley grain tissue persson et al 2009 sec methods are dependent on the use of ideal mobile phase matrix to minimize the interaction of compounds with the media though the mobile phase was optimized using various buffers at different ph and ionic strength in the present study the possibility of compound interactions with the column cannot be completely ignored this was observed for the lake alice sample that showed tailing peak and significant difference in the orthophosphate concentration between ic and icp ms data the present method successfully provided qualitative information of various p forms in the environment but accurate quantification relies on using the right markers during calibration in this study a suite of inorganic and organic p markers in addition to non p peg markers of known mws was used to calibrate the column this enabled in determination of the recovery of different p markers relative to orthophosphate the current method featured lower recovery 13 16 of intermediate and high mw p compounds relative to orthophosphate but knowledge of analyte losses by using known p standards enabled us to perform a mass balance and successfully compare with ultrafiltration method see supplemental information however recovery of unknown p species can be difficult to estimate without knowing the molecular structure an important challenge in using this method is that the concentration of intermediate and high mw p species especially the organic forms are very low in the environment for successful detection and quantification using sec icp ms this can be noticed by the absence of peaks in the 1000 20 000 g mol range hence pre concentration of samples prior to injection is required in future for successful characterization of trace levels of environmental p though with such optimizations the sec icp ms can serve to characterize tdp mw fractions the method does not detect particulate p fractions the samples were filtered in the present study using 0 2 μm filters to prevent clogging and deterioration of sec column over time by filtering the samples the particulate and colloidal forms of p are removed particulate forms of p may constitute a significant fraction of tp in aquatic environment especially with agricultural and surface runoffs 30 to the environment grant et al 1996 hart et al 2004 kronvang 1992 uusitalo et al 2001 over time these forms can become bioavailable through degradation and hence it is important in understanding their dynamic nature in addition to tdp ellison and brett 2006 uusitalo et al 2003 4 conclusions the present study shows that a combination of sec and icp ms can serve as a powerful and robust tool to characterize unknown fractions of p in the environment to further our understanding of the occurrence and cycling of p in natural and built systems the study results point out that the abundant fraction of p in the environment is 600 g mol in most cases the average fraction of orthophosphate in various environmental matrices ranged from 21 to 98 of tdp with the lowest value observed for the secondary effluent from a wwtp the sec icp ms method performance was shown to be comparable to conventional ultrafiltration method for determination of mw distribution additionally sec doc measurements of aqueous samples in the present study helped with qualitative determination of op fractions in the samples in the future a combination of detectors in addition to doc and icp ms uv fluorescence etc can be used in series to better understand the composition of the various organic and inorganic p species fraction collectors may be used to obtain specific mw fractions from the column that can then be used for structural characterization and identification of individual species using nmr and high resolution mass spectrometry acknowledgment this material is based upon work

19736,phosphorus p is an important and often limiting element in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem a lack of understanding of its distribution and structures in the environment limits the design of effective p mitigation and recovery approaches here we developed a robust method employing size exclusion chromatography sec coupled to an icp ms to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of p in environmental samples the most abundant fraction of p varied widely in different environmental samples i orthophosphate was the dominant fraction 93 100 in one lake two aerosols and doc isolate samples ii species of 400 600 da range were abundant 74 100 in two surface waters and iii species of 150 350 da range were abundant in wastewater effluents sec doc of the aqueous samples using a similar sec column showed overlapping peaks for the 400 600 da species in two surface waters and for 20 kda species in the effluents suggesting that these fractions are likely associated with organic matter the mw resolution and performance of sec icp ms agreed well with the time integrated results obtained using conventional ultrafiltration method results show that sec in combination with icp ms and doc has the potential to be a powerful and easy to use method in identifying unknown fractions of p in the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus molecular weight distribution size exclusion chromatography dissolved organic carbon icp ms 1 introduction phosphorus p is an important and often limiting element in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem and is at the center of important environmental challenges from a perspective of excess and scarcity phosphorus is essential because of its biochemical role in rna dna and cellular processes gifford et al 2015 modern agriculture heavily relies on mineral phosphate fertilizers to achieve high yields and feed an ever growing population rittmann et al 2011 venkatesan et al 2016 excess organic and inorganic phosphate mainly from plant and animal agricultural waste streams enters waterways and leads to algae blooms in fresh and seawater that threaten ecosystems while the most advanced wastewater treatment systems remove and in some cases attempt to capture and reuse inorganic p reasonably well they still discharge organic p op into waterways mayer et al 2016 research has been performed on eutrophication and p cycling in estuaries wetlands lakes etc over the last decade and identified the bioavailability of op as a major and underestimated issue björkman and karl 2003 ni et al 2016 pant et al 2002 op is known to be a complex mixture of many different species including dna and rna fragments phospholipids phosphoproteins and phosphate esters baldwin 2013 worsfold et al 2008 in addition to the unknown fractions of op total p tp in environmental systems is also comprised of condensed inorganic phosphates polyphosphates and colloidal p moorleghem et al 2011 studies have addressed the mineralization of these unknown forms but all from a rather coarse perspective as chemically the op and colloidal p remains poorly characterized the complexity and lack of chemical information on tp organic and some inorganic in the environment hampers our understanding of the mineralization of the material its dynamic partitioning in water sediment particle systems and eventually its lifetime the lack of understanding of the p structures molecular weight distribution functional group composition also limits the design of p mitigation and recovery approaches the various fractions of p in the environment are often determined via indirect methods for example dissolved organic phosphorus dop measurement in the environment is calculated either as the difference between total dissolved p tdp and dissolved reactive p drp or measured in terms of drp after pretreatment or digestion of samples worsfold et al 2008 such measurements however fail to provide fundamental chemical data on the diverse nature of tp e g size distributions functional groups etc the most common tool used in the study of the speciation of p in terrestrial systems is 31p nmr spectroscopy the method is well established and showed that typically a large part of p is under the form of orthophosphate and polyphosphate cade menun 2005 nmr also allowed demonstrating the presence of phosphate esters dna rna phospholipids and glycophosphates all derived from biological processes bell et al 2017 advanced high resolution mass spectrometry was only attempted in a few studies but allowed for the discovery of select biomarker species most of the characterization work focused on soils and sediments and less research is available for 31p nmr and ms on organic matter extracted from water in part because isolation and concentration techniques have not been developed to target p like they have been for bulk carbon or nitrogen aiken et al 1992 chin et al 1994 herckes et al 2007 leenheer et al 2007 ion liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms have been successfully applied to determine the speciation of p in soils and foodstuffs koplík et al 2002 persson et al 2009 shah and caruso 2005 the advantage of using icp ms is that it detects tdp both organic and inorganic in samples unlike commonly used spectrophotometric and colorimetric p methods that detect only orthophosphates chromatographic separation prior to tdp analysis by icp ms could serve as a powerful and robust tool to conveniently analyze various fractions of p in the environment two studies have successfully applied size exclusion chromatography sec icp ms technique to investigate the soluble p species and other elements in soybean flour white bean seeds and barley grain tissues koplík et al 2002 persson et al 2009 by using sec icp ms the authors were able to determine the molecular weight mw distribution of p in food samples in a single run without the need for complex and successive ultrafiltration techniques though sec coupled to an organic carbon detector sec doc is a commonly used technique in determining the mw distribution of doc in waters her et al 2003 nam et al 2008 wang et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge a similar approach has not been applied for the determination of size distribution of p in environmental waters the goal of this study was to develop a robust sec icp ms method to conveniently determine the mw distribution of p in environmental matrices specifically in waters the developed method was tested on surface waters primary and secondary wastewater effluents aerosols and wetland samples to identify the abundant mw fraction of p in these environmental matrices the performance of the sec icp ms method was compared against a typically used ultrafiltration technique for mw fractionation sec doc was additionally applied to aqueous samples in order to qualitatively determine the fraction of p associated with organic matter though this method does not directly identify op in samples it provides critical molecular information and improved understanding of the dynamic nature of p in the environment 2 material and methods 2 1 chemical

discussion 3 1 mobile phase calibration and method optimization of p detection in sec icp ms various mobile phase buffers and eluent ph were tested on the column to optimize for retention time and peak shape of p supplemental fig s1 shows the peak shapes and retention time of orthophosphate injected into the sec icp ms system similar to the observation made for the sec doc system her et al 2003 increasing the ionic strength of the mobile phase increased the retention of p orthophosphate in the column and also improved the peak shape di water vs 20 mm nacl conductivity of 2 2 ms cm tris hcl buffer at ph 7 5 has been successfully used in the past for p separation in sec systems for speciation analyses in foodstuffs koplík et al 2002 persson et al 2009 when using the tris hcl buffer in our system we observed an improved retention time of 64 min but the chromatogram showed higher background noise increased baseline interferences and also tailing of peaks especially for op other buffers tested acetate ph 4 bicarbonate ph 8 6 showed either poor retention and or increased background interferences 50 mm hcl at a ph of 1 3 provided the best retention time 72 min and peak shape for orthophosphate compared to other buffers hydrochloric acid mobile phase has been used in the past for separation of inositol phosphates an abundant op form in plant materials using ion chromatography ic chen and li 2003 skoglund et al 1998 inositol phosphates are highly acidic compounds and the use of acidic mobile phase has shown to improve retention and separation on ic columns chen and li 2003 though sec separations are dependent on size of the molecules electrostatic interactions also play a role in the retention of certain charged molecules hong et al 2012 pujar and zydney 1998 injection of inositol phosphate standard in the sec icp ms system confirmed this observation by showing improved retention on to the column with 50 mm hcl mobile phase compared to other buffers also it is conventional to acidify samples 2 hno3 or 2 hcl in icp ms systems to avoid loss of analytes due to sorption in the sample introduction system which may serve as an added benefit for using acidic mobile phase though acid hydrolysis could potentially convert some op to inorganic orthophosphates this is likely to happen only at strong acidic conditions 12 m hcl 4 m h2so4 bowman 1989 turner et al 2005 to confirm this we acidified p standards phytic acid phosphate glass and l α phosphatidylcholine for 5 h using 50 mm hcl and analyzed for orthophosphate using ic no phosphate peak was detected before and after acidification of the standards confirming that there was no concern for hydrolysis of op during analysis however in order to prevent any potential acid hydrolysis of labile op the samples were acidified only prior to injection into the sec icp ms system thus minimizing the contact time with the acid to 100 min the column was calibrated using a suite of peg and p markers of known mw fig 1 the calibration curve was similar and comparable between both suites of markers the calibration curve from the p markers were used for determining the mw distribution of p in environmental samples but this experiment confirmed that it is feasible to use non p markers for calibration purposes when ideal standards are not available for speciation analysis l α phosphatidylcholine was not included in the calibration curve as they form micelles at the concentration injected into the sec icp ms system and exceeded the separation range of the column 20 000 g mol this can be seen in fig 1b where the retention time of the phospholipid matches with the injection peak or the void volume of the column 32 min or 32 ml since 1 ml min was used as the flowrate in the system retention time of the various compounds can be interchangeably interpreted as elution volume in ml the peak areas of high mw p markers phytic acid phosphate glass and l α phosphatidylcholine were 13 16 relative to the peak area of kh2po4 of the same concentration through controlled experiments we found out that this difference in peak height area and sensitivity between different markers was due to two reasons i adsorption on to sec column and ii difference in icp ms sensitivity to different p molecules after several months of running p samples and standards we flushed the sec column using 0 1 m naoh solution and collected the eluate to check for p adsorption in column a large amount of total p sub ppm levels was detected in the eluate first 150 ml fraction when analyzed using icp ms in normal mode this confirmed that a fraction of high mw p compounds was lost due to adsorption to the sec column similar observations were made in the past when analyzing for aggregates of protein molecules high mw using sec hong et al 2012 we additionally analyzed organic p markers phytic acid and l α phosphatidylcholine directly by icp ms in normal mode and the results revealed concentration dependent recoveries of 43 114 relative to orthophosphate response suggesting that the difference in peak areas can additionally result from icp ms sensitivity to different molecules organics vs inorganics we compared sec icp ms performance with ultrafiltration method see supplemental sections s2 s3 and the results agreed well both with size resolution and concentration supplemental fig s3 3 2 mw distribution of p in environmental samples the chromatograms of four surface water samples are shown in fig 2 the figures revealed that the dominant mw fraction of p in most samples was at a retention time of 73 min this matched the retention time of kh2po4 standard fig 1 indicating the presence of orthophosphate in the samples tempe town lake was the only sample in the present study that did not contain any orthophosphate and the dominant p fraction was detected at a retention time of 62 min fig 2a corresponding to a mw range of 400 600 g mol tempe canal that conveys salt river water to potable water treatment plants showed two peaks at retention times 62 min and 71 min corresponding to mw range of 400 600 g mol and 100 g mol orthophosphate respectively both surface waters are present in the dry region of the salt river with minimum input from agricultural areas hence the tdp in these samples were low 14 ppb with the abundant form of the p 74 100 within the mw range of 400 600 g mol these can likely be attributed to anthropogenic sources during recreational use of the lake and or deposits from plant materials e g inositol phosphates poly meta phosphates etc inositol phosphates are produced by plants and are released to the aquatic environments upon plant degradation baldwin 2013 they can also be produced in situ by certain species including spirodela sp brearley and hanke 1996 and azolla sp benaroya et al 2004 similarly it is known that inorganic poly and meta phosphates are produced by biological activity and also introduced from human activities persson and jansson 2012 the retention time of 62 min observed in these two surface water samples was similar to the inositol phosphate standard phytic acid 62 min used in the study and thus indicating its presence in these samples everglades is a p sensitive environment where dissolved organic phosphorus dop has been shown to represent up to 56 of tdp and 40 of dop was high mw aromatic rich compounds ged and boyer 2013 sample from lake alice from the everglades analyzed in this study showed a large tailing peak at a rt of 73 min though the peak retention time matches with that of the k2hpo4 standard the tailing peak suggests compound interaction with the column it is known that certain compounds can interact with sec and gel columns that can result in high retention time and elution volumes persson and jansson 2012 comparison of tdp from icp ms and orthophosphate from ic showed 61 difference in concentration 102 ppb suggesting that there were likely species of p that interacted with the sec column and co eluted with orthophosphate resulting in peak tailing further research is needed to investigate and identify such interacting species primary and secondary wastewater effluents collected from a wwtp located in mesa az were filtered and injected into the sec icp ms system fig 3 three peaks were initially identified for both primary and secondary effluents at a rt of 32 63 and 73 min the peak at 32 min represents the void volume of the column and hence this fraction of p is associated with high mw 20 kda compounds primary and secondary effluents are abundant with microorganisms and hence it is reasonable to assume that this fraction of p is composed of dna rna phospholipids and other microbial products containing p since the p concentration was high in the effluent samples we observed overlapping peaks between 60 and 75 min the peak de convolution software output suggested that a 3 peak model was the best fit for the observed chromatogram with rt of the peaks at 64 69 5 and 73 5 min fig 3c and f the peak at 64 min and 69 70 min suggest the presence of p fractions in the 400 450 g mol and 135 155 g mol range respectively phosphonates are a group of compounds that have direct c p bonds that can occur from natural sources phosphonolipids clark et al 1999 and or from synthetic products e g glyphosate mw 159 g mol an active ingredient used in commercial herbicides nowack 2003 these are abundantly present in aquatic environment and make up a significant fraction of the dissolved op villarreal chiu et al 2012 suggesting that they likely represent the fraction observed in this study other condensed inorganic phosphates polyphosphate and pyrophosphate of low mw range can also contribute to these observed peaks as they are known forms to exist in wastewaters we also analyzed an archived doc isolate obtained from a wetland in arizona as seen in fig 2d the majority of the p was detected at the rt of 72 min indicating high levels of orthophosphate in the sample a peak was also detected at 62 min corresponding to the mw range of 400 600 g mol as observed for the tempe surface water samples a study conducted by shaw et al investigated the influence of humic substances on the mw distribution of inorganic phosphate by adding radioisotope 32po4 3 to isolated high mw humic substances 10 kda to 50 kda in lake waters shaw et al 2000 they observed complexation of added 32po4 3 to high mw humic substances but only at specific ph ph 4 for 50 kda ph 5 5 and 7 for 10 kda 50 kda and ionic strength of the lake water samples hence the large orthophosphate peak observed for the doc isolate in our method was likely due to the dissociation of inorganic phosphates from high mw colloidal materials when the isolate was re suspended in a di water matrix we confirmed that po4 3 did not form from acid hydrolysis from acidic mobile phase 50 mm hcl used for chromatography by measuring for po4 3 using ic in non acidified water samples table 1 the orthophosphate concentration detected in ic was comparable relative percentage difference rpd 33 to the concentration determined from integration of the peak this suggests that the inorganic phosphate more likely resulted due to dissociation from colloidal doc isolates during sonication while atmospheric p has been found to be a very small reservoir compared to water or sediments it might still be important in terms of transport the chromatograms from the two aerosol samples show a large over lapping peak between 62 and 75 min supplemental fig s4 peak deconvolution suggested three peaks at a rt of 65 70 and 73 min as observed for the wastewater effluents phosphate associated with mineral dust and fuel emissions are abundant in aerosols anderson et al 2010 and may have caused the large peak at the rt of 71 73 min suggesting a significant fraction of inorganic phosphates in the samples very little is known about atmospheric op despite recent studies showing the ubiquity of biological material in aerosols and clouds and significant contributions to atmospheric organic matter herckes et al 2013 one study showed that the occurrence of op in aerosols was seasonal and increases during warm periods when biological activity increase chen et al 2006 3 3 fraction of orthophosphate in environmental samples table 1 summarizes the estimated concentration of p fractions with different mw ranges in the tested samples tdp as measured by icp ms in normal mode was higher than the concentration of po4 3 measured by ic in all aqueous samples surface waters and wastewater effluents the integrated peak area for po4 3 at rt 73 min was comparable to ic measurements for all aqueous samples except for lake alice results showed that the percentage of p as orthophosphate varied highly with an average of 55 49 n 3 of tdp in surface water samples in wastewater effluents the fraction of orthophosphate was lower and represented only 20 1 2 n 2 of tdp though the recovery of orthophosphate peaks in the sec column was satisfactory varying recovery of higher mw compounds through the column made it difficult for accurate quantification of various fractions of p in the samples as described in the methods section the high mw p markers used for calibration purpose showed a recovery of 13 16 relative to k2hpo4 standard assuming a 15 recovery of the different mw fraction of p the fraction of orthophosphate in surface waters was estimated at 42 48 which was similar to the uncorrected value estimated above 55 49 of tdp similar results were observed in a study conducted by ged and boyer where the percentage of orthophosphate varied seasonally in the everglades between 44 and 87 of tdp ged and boyer 2013 for wastewater effluent samples assuming a 15 recovery of various mw fractions of p suggests that orthophosphate can be as low as 3 2 0 2 of tp in the samples though this is an extreme case estimate of orthophosphate fraction dissolved op in wastewater effluents can be as high as 81 of the tp gu et al 2011 since the majority of the p is stored within microbial cells after secondary biological treatment qin et al 2015 of these fractions qin et al determined that 61 4 80 7 are hydrophobic in nature and exist predominantly in the forms of phosphate monoesters and phosphate diesters for aerosol samples the concentration determined by icp ms and ic was comparable indicating 90 of tdp is in the form of orthophosphate we observed multiple peaks between 62 and 75 min in aerosol samples this could be due to the presence of labile forms of low mw condensed phosphates and or particle adsorbed phosphate forms that could have released orthophosphate in the alkaline mobile phase of the ic system 3 4 qualitative determination of organic fraction of p using sec doc the mw distribution of dissolved organic matter dom in surface water and wastewater effluent samples was determined by using an sec doc system equipped with the same sec media hydroxylated methacrylate and column dimension as the sec icp ms system an overlay of both sec icp ms and sec doc chromatograms of the samples is shown in fig 4 a large peak is observed for both chromatograms at 100 g mol mw range this peak represents small mw compounds that feature an elution volume greater than the total volume of the packed bed i e outside the separation range of the column inorganic orthophosphate falls in this region of the sec icp ms chromatogram and hence the peak overlap observed with the sec doc chromatogram does not imply organic fraction of p however for higher mw compounds overlapping peaks between the chromatograms can be interpreted as the fraction of p associated with organic matter this can be observed for the primary effluent fig 4b secondary effluent fig 4e tempe town lake fig 4g and tempe canal fig 4h showing peaks at same mw fraction in both chromatograms highlighted by the arrow mark the primary and secondary effluent peaks overlap at a mw of 30 kda and is likely comprised of large biopolymers and protein like molecules e g phospholipids and nucleotides the peak at 470 g mol rt of 63 65 min determined by the deconvolution of peak do not coincide with any doc peaks highlighted by the circle fig 4c and f suggesting that these are likely to be inorganic p e g polyphosphates the tempe town lake and tempe canal samples show overlapping peaks with sec doc chromatograms at 500 g mol indicating the presence of op fraction in the samples the rt of these peaks is very close to the rt of phytic acid standard used in the calibration phytic acids or inositol phosphates are present in large quantities in aquatic environment where they may contribute to eutrophication turner et al 2005 though this is not an ideal method to quantify the op fraction of samples the qualitative results provided here is critical in understanding the distribution of various species of p in the environment that cannot be obtained by other traditional methods such as ultrafiltration and chemical extractions 3 5 advantages and limitations of sec icp ms method like sec doc the developed sec icp ms method has its advantages and limitations in its applications the most important advantage of sec icp ms over other mw characterization techniques is the ability to obtain information of various p species as a function of mw in a single 100 min run after the initial set up of the instrument minimal sample preparation was required prior to obtaining the chromatograms in ultrafiltration a series of membranes with different mw cut off a time consuming experimental set up and extended experimental runtime 5 h is required in order to obtain similar mw distribution results also the sec icp ms required much less volume 1 ml to characterize samples whereas in membrane techniques 100 ml of samples is needed using icp ms as the detector provides the opportunity to detect for multiple elements simultaneously this way various metal complexes of p species in the environment can additionally be determined in a single run this technique was successfully employed by persson et al to determine the association of phytic acid with fe in barley grain tissue persson et al 2009 sec methods are dependent on the use of ideal mobile phase matrix to minimize the interaction of compounds with the media though the mobile phase was optimized using various buffers at different ph and ionic strength in the present study the possibility of compound interactions with the column cannot be completely ignored this was observed for the lake alice sample that showed tailing peak and significant difference in the orthophosphate concentration between ic and icp ms data the present method successfully provided qualitative information of various p forms in the environment but accurate quantification relies on using the right markers during calibration in this study a suite of inorganic and organic p markers in addition to non p peg markers of known mws was used to calibrate the column this enabled in determination of the recovery of different p markers relative to orthophosphate the current method featured lower recovery 13 16 of intermediate and high mw p compounds relative to orthophosphate but knowledge of analyte losses by using known p standards enabled us to perform a mass balance and successfully compare with ultrafiltration method see supplemental information however recovery of unknown p species can be difficult to estimate without knowing the molecular structure an important challenge in using this method is that the concentration of intermediate and high mw p species especially the organic forms are very low in the environment for successful detection and quantification using sec icp ms this can be noticed by the absence of peaks in the 1000 20 000 g mol range hence pre concentration of samples prior to injection is required in future for successful characterization of trace levels of environmental p though with such optimizations the sec icp ms can serve to characterize tdp mw fractions the method does not detect particulate p fractions the samples were filtered in the present study using 0 2 μm filters to prevent clogging and deterioration of sec column over time by filtering the samples the particulate and colloidal forms of p are removed particulate forms of p may constitute a significant fraction of tp in aquatic environment especially with agricultural and surface runoffs 30 to the environment grant et al 1996 hart et al 2004 kronvang 1992 uusitalo et al 2001 over time these forms can become bioavailable through degradation and hence it is important in understanding their dynamic nature in addition to tdp ellison and brett 2006 uusitalo et al 2003 4 conclusions the present study shows that a combination of sec and icp ms can serve as a powerful and robust tool to characterize unknown fractions of p in the environment to further our understanding of the occurrence and cycling of p in natural and built systems the study results point out that the abundant fraction of p in the environment is 600 g mol in most cases the average fraction of orthophosphate in various environmental matrices ranged from 21 to 98 of tdp with the lowest value observed for the secondary effluent from a wwtp the sec icp ms method performance was shown to be comparable to conventional ultrafiltration method for determination of mw distribution additionally sec doc measurements of aqueous samples in the present study helped with qualitative determination of op fractions in the samples in the future a combination of detectors in addition to doc and icp ms uv fluorescence etc can be used in series to better understand the composition of the various organic and inorganic p species fraction collectors may be used to obtain specific mw fractions from the column that can then be used for structural characterization and identification of individual species using nmr and high resolution mass spectrometry acknowledgment this material is based upon work

19737,ammonium and or free ammonia the unionized form of ammonium are generally thought to inhibit the activities of microbes involved in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge it was found in this work however that the presence of ammonium nh4 n largely enhanced dark fermentative hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge with the increase of initial nh4 n level from 36 to 266 mg l the maximal hydrogen production from alkaline ph 9 5 pretreated sludge increased from 7 3 to 15 6 ml per gram volatile suspended solids vss under the standard condition further increase of nh4 n to 308 mg l caused a slight decrease of hydrogen yield 15 0 ml g vss experimental results demonstrated that free ammonia instead of nh4 n was the true contributor to the enhancement of hydrogen production it was found that the presence of free ammonia facilitated the releases of both extracellular and intracellular constituents which thereby provided more substrates for subsequent hydrogen production the free ammonia at the tested levels i e 0 444 mg l did not affect acetogenesis significantly although free ammonia inhibited all other bio processes its inhibition to the hydrogen consumption processes i e homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing process was much severer than that to the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes further investigations with enzyme analyses showed that free ammonia posed slight impacts on protease butyrate kinase acetate kinase coa transferase and fefe hydrogenase activities but largely suppressed the activities of coenzyme f420 carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and adenylyl sulfate reductase which were consistent with the chemical analyses performed above graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation hydrogen free ammonia 1 introduction hydrogen is widely considered the most promising alternative to fossil fuels as it has a high energy yield 142 35 kj g with at least 2 75 times that of any hydrocarbons and produces water instead of greenhouse gases when it is combusted cai et al 2004 as the major byproduct of biological wastewater treatment waste activated sludge is produced in huge quantities feng et al 2015 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017a 2017b treatment and disposal of the sludge are costly accounting for up to 60 of the total operation costs of wastewater treatment plants wwtps zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2017c on the other hand sludge contains high levels of organic constituents such as protein and carbohydrate zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 xie et al 2016 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 which can be used as substrates for hydrogen production therefore biological production of hydrogen from waste activated sludge has recently attracted much attention zhao et al 2010 gioannis et al 2013 li et al 2009 by which sludge is reduced and reused fossil fuels are saved and greenhouse gas productions are reduced the hydrogen yield of dark fermentation of waste activated sludge is usually low due to rapid hydrogen consumption in comparison to sludge disintegration most previous investigations to enhance hydrogen production therefore focused on optimizing sludge pretreatment methods yang et al 2012 assawamongkholsiri et al 2013 kim et al 2013 operational conditions zhao et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 jung et al 2011 or sludge composition kim et al 2012 chen et al 2012a wang et al 2015 for instance cai et al 2004 found that sludge pretreated by alkaline ph 11 for 24 h could increase hydrogen yield from 9 1 to 16 6 ml of h2 g of dry solids the bioconversion of sludge proteins and hydrogen production were found to be largely enhanced by co fermentation of sewage sludge and carbohydrate rich substrates such as food wastes and agricultural wastes kim et al 2012 chen et al 2012b liu et al 2013 by elevating the content of sludge polyhydroxyalkanoates from 25 to 178 mg g volatile suspended solids vss hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of sludge increased from 26 5 to 58 7 ml g vss wang et al 2015 apart from these parameters byproducts that are in situ generated in the anaerobic fermentation process may also affect hydrogen yield to date however little information is available to this field nh4 n which is produced from the disintegration of nitrogen rich compounds such as proteins urea and nucleic acids could be accumulated at high concentrations in the sludge digestion or fermentation process yan et al 2010 gonzález fernández et al 2009 the nh4 n concentration in the sludge fermentation liquid is usually at 300 mg l chen et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 and this value could be up to 1500 mg l in the sludge digestion liquid wang et al 2014 almost all previous studies demonstrated that the presence of nh4 n especially at high levels showed inhibitory effects on bio gas production from anaerobic digestion for example sung and liu 2003 found that compared with the control 0 4 g l 5 0 and 5 8 g l of nh4 n resulted in 39 and 64 decreases in methane production respectively nakakubo et al 2008 reported that a 50 reduction in methane yield under thermophilic anaerobic digestion was observed at nh4 n concentration of 11 0 g l as compared with 4 6 g l nh4 n these findings suggested that it was essential to remove or reduce nh4 n levels in the anaerobic digestion process to ensure bio gas production nevertheless it was found in the current work that when 63 272 mg l nh4 n was added into the sludge mixture hydrogen yield from alkaline pretreated sludge was enhanced rather than reduced as compared to the case without nh4 n addition there were two varying parameters in these fermentation systems one is the nh4 n added as ph variation is similar among these fermentation systems thus the other varying parameter is free ammonia fa the unionized form of ammonium due to the high concentrations of ammonium added and alkaline condition maintained fa can diffuse through cell membrane shuttle protons between the two sides and result in cell inactivation kayhanian 1999 this could cause variations in the activities of function microbes involved in sludge anaerobic fermentation which thereby may affect hydrogen production however the role of fa on hydrogen production from dark fermentation of sludge has not been clarified so far it is unknown which one nh4 n or fa is the main contributor to the enhanced hydrogen production the aim of this study was to identify whether and how fa enhances dark fermentative hydrogen production first hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment ph 9 5 in the presence of nh4 n at different levels 36 308 mg l was compared to identify the potential contribution of nh4 n to hydrogen production hydrogen yield from acidic fermentation of sludge ph 5 5 was also compared at the same nh4 n levels it should be emphasized that the variations of fa level among these acidic fermenters were negligible thus the results obtained could be used to indicate the impact of nh4 n on hydrogen production finally the mechanisms for fa enhancing hydrogen production were explored the findings reported in this work reveal the details of how fa enhances hydrogen production for the first time erase the concern regarding the inhibitory effect of nh4 n or fa produced in the fermentation process on dark fermentation and may guide engineers to develop more economic strategies for hydrogen production from sludge fermentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sources and characteristics of waste activated sludge the sludge employed in this work was withdrawn from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the raw sludge was filtrated by a stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and concentrated by setting at 4 c for 24 h before use the major characteristics of the concentrated sludge are as follows ph 6 8 0 1 total suspended soils tss 14920 260 mg l vss 12140 170 mg l total chemical oxygen demand cod 14780 290 mg l total carbohydrate 1650 230 mg cod l total protein 7780 310 mg cod l lipid and oil 170 20 mg cod l and nh4 n 36 4 mg l it can be seen that protein and carbohydrate are the top two organics in the sludge accounting for about 64 of total sludge cod 2 2 hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment in the presence of nh4 n at different levels this batch test was conducted in eight serum bottles with a working volume of 1 l each each serum bottle was first fed with 500 ml concentrated sludge as mentioned above then different volumes of nh4cl stock solution 4 0 m were added at the beginning of the test which resulted in the initial nh4 n concentration of 36 36 99 141 182 224 266 or 308 mg l it should be noted that nh4 n was not added to the first two bottles and 36 mg l nh4 n was the background ammonium concentration except one serum bottle with nh4 n concentration at 36 mg l set as the blank the tested sludge in all other serum bottles was pretreated under alkaline condition ph 9 5 at 35 c for 24 h before fermentation as alkaline pretreatment was demonstrated to be an effective method for enhancing biohydrogen production from waste activated sludge cai et al 2004 the nh4 n concentration temperature and ph applied gave rise to initial fa concentrations of 0 3 the blank 34 95 135 174 214 254 or 294 mg l fa concentration was determined by the formula s nh3 n nh4 n 10ph kb kw 10ph where s nh3 n nh4 n represents the concentration of nh3 n nh4 n kb represents the ionization constant of the ammonia equilibrium equation and kw represents the ionization constant of water anthonisen et al 1976 the value of kb kw was calculated via the formula of kb kw e6 344 273 t anthonisen et al 1976 after pretreatment the serum bottles were sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition finally all serum bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 150 rpm no extra inoculum was added into these reactors and hence the sludge was used as both fermentation substrate and inoculum in the fermentation process the ph value in all bottles was not controlled but was recorded periodically the total gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottle using a glass syringe 300 ml to equilibrate with the atmospheric pressure oh et al 2003 the cumulative volume of hydrogen gas was calculated as 1 vh i vh i 1 ch i vg i ch i 1 vg i 1 where vh i and vh i 1 are respectively the cumulative volumes of hydrogen gas in the current i and previous i 1 time intervals vg i and vg i 1 are respectively the total gas volumes in the current and previous time intervals and ch i and ch i 1 are the fractions of hydrogen gas measured by gas chromatography in the current and previous time intervals respectively 2 3 hydrogen production from acidic fermentation of sludge in the presence of nh4 n at different levels this set of batch experiments was utilized to assess the impact of nh4 n on hydrogen production to minimize the impact of fa acidic fermentation was employed eight serum bottles with a working volume of 1 l each were operated in this experiment the experimental procedure was identical to that described above except that acidic condition ph 5 5 was employed to both sludge pretreatment and dark fermentation fa concentration in these reactors varied only between 0 02 and 0 36 mg l thus the impact of fa on hydrogen yield in this set of experiments is expected to be negligible 2 4 assessing the impacts of fa on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis methonogenesis and sulfate reducing processes sludge dark fermentation generally contains several processes the rate of sludge disintegration the major rate limiting process in sludge dark fermentation is often assessed by measuring the concentrations of soluble cod and soluble proteins released in fermentation liquor zhao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 li et al 2009 besides several other bio reactions such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis methonogenesis and sulfate reducing processes are also involved in sludge dark fermentation which affect hydrogen production significantly the rates of these processes are generally evaluated by batch tests using model substrates in the literature zhao et al 2010 2016 li et al 2009 in this set of tests 20 replicate serum bottles with a working volume of 1 0 l each were performed these bottles were divided into five groups namely dextran test glucose test butyrate test h2 co2 test and h2 so4 2 test with four in each group dextran test all bottles received 450 ml of synthetic wastewater and 50 ml of same inoculum inoculum used in this test was withdrawn from an anaerobic sludge fermenter in our laboratory the synthetic wastewater contains 0 5 g dextran average molecular weight 23800 a model polysaccharide compound l ph in all the bottles was controlled at 9 0 0 1 which was close to the average ph value in the fermenters operated in the hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment in the presence of nh4 n at different levels section different volumes of nh4cl stock solution 4 0 m were added into the four serum bottles resulting in an initial concentration of nh4 n at 0 540 648 or 678 mg l all other fermentation conditions were the same as those described above the nh4 n temperature and ph applied gave rise to fa concentrations at 0 354 424 or 444 mg l the fa concentrations used in this test were respectively equal to the average fa concentrations measured from the fermenters fed with 141 266 and 308 mg l of initial nh4 n treated sludges by analyzing the degradation efficiency of dextran the effect of fa on hydrolysis process could be evaluated glucose test the operation of this test was operated with the same approach described in dextran test except that the fermentation substrate i e dextran was replaced with glucose by determining the glucose degradation the effect of fa on acidogenesis could be assessed butyrate test the operation of this experiment was carried out the same as that depicted in dextran test except that the fermentation substrate was replaced with 10 g l sodium butyrate the effect of fa on acetogenesis could be indicated by analyzing the degradation efficiency of sodium butyrate h2 co2 test each serum bottle first received 50 ml of fermented sludge mixture as inoculums and 450 ml tap water the ph and nh4 n levels in the four serum bottles were the same as those operated in dextran test all these bottles were then flushed with a combined gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to guarantee that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas finally all bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at stirring speed of 150 rpm the effect of fa on homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis could be assessed by comparing the consumption of hydrogen and the productions of acetic acid and methane among these fermenters h2 so4 2 test each bottle received 450 ml of synthetic wastewater and 50 ml of fermented sludge mixture the synthetic wastewater contains 1 18 g potassium sulfate l each bottle was flushed with a combined gas 45 hydrogen and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to ensure that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas all other operations were the same as those depicted in h2 co2 test the effect of fa on sulfate reducing process could be indicated by comparing the hydrogen consumption and sulfate degradation among these fermenters 2 5 long term semi continuous reactor operation for the analysis of key enzymes two long term semi continuous reactors were operated to further explore the impact of different fa levels on sludge anaerobic fermentation from the aspect of microbial analyses the two reactors were replicate with a working volume of 1 l each and fed with alkaline ph 9 5 pretreated sludge with either 36 or 266 mg l initial nh4 n concentration in this experiment two typical sludge with either 36 or 266 mg l initial nh4 n concentration was tested as 36 mg l nh4 n was the background ammonium concentration and maximum hydrogen was achieved at 266 mg l nh4 n according to the batch test above the fermentation conditions were the same as described in section 2 2 according to the results obtained from the batch tests the sludge retention time in the reactors was maintained at 7 d thus 70 ml of fermentation mixture was withdrawn daily from each reactor and replaced with the same amount of new alkaline pretreated sludge afterwards both the reactors were sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen before they were re capped and re sealed hydrogen yield reached a stable level after approximately 50 d operation and then the assay of key enzyme activities was performed 2 6 analytical methods hydrogen and methane fractions in the generated gas were determined at normal pressure via a gas chromatograph gc112a china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector a 2 m stainless column activated carbon 60 80 mesh and with nitrogen as the carrier gas the temperatures of the injection column and detector were set at 70 140 and 140 c respectively the measurements of cod nh4 n vss and tss were performed in accordance with standard methods apha 1998 proteins carbohydrates lipids and short chain fatty acids were measured as previously described wang et al 2015 a heat extraction method was used to extract different fractions of extracellular polymeric substances eps from sludge xu et al 2017 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific france with a 450 w xe arc lamp was applied to characterize the changes of fermentation liquid luo et al 2013 sulfide concentration was determined according to the method depicted in the literature aiking et al 1982 cell membrane integrity was indicated by the lactate dehydrogenase ldh release assay using a ldh cytotoxicity assay kit biovision usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and the procedure documented in our previous study chen et al 2012b the measurement of dna released from sludge cells was conducted according to a previously established protocol liang et al 2015 for measuring the activities of key enzymes 25 ml the fermentation mixture was collected form the long term reactors cleaned using 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 sonicated at 20kha at 4 c for 10 min and finally centrifuged at 12000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min to remove the waste debris the extracts were kept on ice before analyzing the activities of the following eight key enzymes i e protease acetate kinase butyrate kinase coa transferase carbon monoxide dehydrogenase adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase coenzyme f420 and fefe hydrogenase were measured in this study with the procedures detailed in supporting information 2 7 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment in the presence of nh4 n at different levels fig 1 shows the cumulative hydrogen production from dark fermentation of sludge with alkaline pretreatment ph 9 5 at different nh4 n levels hydrogen yield from the blank without ph and nh4 n adjustments was low 2 ml g vss alkaline pretreatment of sludge effectively enhanced hydrogen production consistent with previous results cai et al 2004 in the initial 168 h hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge without addition of nh4 n i e 36 mg l nh4 n sludge increased gradually and no further significant increase was found after that time p 0 05 see table s1 for statistical analysis the maximal hydrogen production and optimal fermentation time were 7 3 0 3 ml g vss and 168 h for alkaline pretreated sludge without nh4 addition similar trend of hydrogen production was also observed for other alkaline pretreated sludge several previous publications reported that nh4 n had inhibitory effects on biogas production from anaerobic digestion of sludge however fig 1 shows that hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge was not inhibited but promoted by the increase of nh4 n with the increase of initial nh4 n content from 36 to 266 mg l the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 7 3 0 3 to 15 6 0 4 ml g vss although further increase of initial nh4 n to 308 mg l caused a slight decrease of hydrogen yield to 15 0 0 3 ml g vss this value was still 2 folds of that from 36 mg l nh4 n sludge it should be noted that this decrease was considered to be statistically insignificant p 0 05 the presence of nh4 n at pertinent levels clearly enhanced dark fermentative hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge 3 2 identification of the true contributor to the increased hydrogen production two major differences among the above fermenters fed with alkaline pretreated sludge are 1 the nh4 n level and 2 the unionized form of ammonium fa level due to the alkaline pretreatment applied the initial nh4 n level varied from 36 to 308 mg l among the fermenters while the initial fa level varied from 34 to 294 mg l according to the calculation both the two parameters correlated well with the hydrogen production from dark fermentation of alkaline pretreated sludge fig s1 using food waste as the fermentation substrate pan et al 2013 also reported that the suitable addition of nh4 n e g 1 5 2 5 g l could enhance biohydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation to date however the potential impact of fa on hydrogen production has not yet been documented thus the roles of these two potential contributors require further clarification to assess the contribution of nh4 n the variation of fa should be controlled in a negligible range an acidic fermentation test ph 5 5 was employed to provide such support in this situation fa concentration in the acidic fermentation reactors varied only between 0 02 and 0 36 mg l therefore the impact of fa on hydrogen yield in this test could be neglected although nh4 n concentration in these acidic fermentation reactors still varied from 36 to 308 mg l as in the previous set of tests hydrogen yield in these reactors was almost the same table s2 suggesting that fa rather than nh4 n was the true contributor to the enhancement of hydrogen production 3 3 how does fa enhance hydrogen production sludge disintegration is generally considered the major rate limiting process in anaerobic fermentation or digestion of sludge thus the potential impact of fa on sludge disintegration was first assessed the rate of sludge disintegration is generally indicated by vss reduction and soluble cod release in fermentation liquor zhao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 wang et al 2013 2015 vss reduction after 1 d alkaline pretreatment increased from 20 3 0 5 to 25 9 1 7 when the initial fa concentration increased from 34 to 254 mg l fig 2 a no significant increase in vss reduction was observed when initial fa concentration further increased to 294 mg l 25 9 1 7 vs 26 3 1 9 p 0 05 with the increase of initial fa from 34 to 254 mg l soluble cod after 24 h pretreatment increased from 4560 140 to 5220 110 mg l which further slightly increased to 5290 120 mg l fig 2b when the initial fa was 294 mg l similar observations were also made for other pretreatment times these data were further supported by eem profiles of fermentation liquid fig 2c the eem fluorescence spectroscopy is widely employed to characterize the structure changes in either eps or fermentation liquid zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 sheng and yu 2006 a red shift blue shift of emission wavelength is usually relevant to an increase decrease of particular functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl alkoxyl amino and carboxyl groups while an increase decrease of fluorescence intensity of characteristic peaks is often related to an increase decrease of fluorophores concentration zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 sheng and yu 2006 as shown in fig 2c two major peaks signed as peak a and peak b in this work were identified from fluorescence spectra peak a and peak b located at the ex em of 220 340 350 and 270 280 340 350 nm in the spectra respectively which was reported to belong to aromatic proteins and tryptophan protein like substances respectively luo et al 2013 sheng and yu 2006 compared with 34 mg l fa 254 mg l fa caused not only red shifts of emission wavelength from 340 to 350 nm but also increases of fluorescence intensity from 499 to 571 in peak a and from 1308 to 1460 in peak b suggesting that 254 mg l fa led to more substrates released in the fermentation liquid than 34 mg l fa all the results revealed that the increase of fa improved sludge disintegration resulting in more soluble substrates for subsequent hydrogen production fig 3 presents the protein and carbohydrate contents extracted from loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps of sludge cells at 2 h pretreatment under different fa levels the measurements of ldh cell membrane integrity marker and dna releases suggested that the increase of fa did not cause extra leakage of intracellular substrates at 2 h pretreatment time fig s2 thus the data shown in fig 3 could be utilized to indicate the impact of fa on disruption of loosely bound eps or tightly bound eps it can be seen that the increase of fa resulted in less substrates remained in both loosely and tightly bound eps for example 49 2 and 46 1 mg g vss proteins were respectively measured in loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps from the sludge cells exposed to 34 mg l fa whereas the corresponding values were 42 5 and 37 0 mg g vss in loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps from the sludge cells exposed to 254 mg l fa respectively fig 4 shows the variations in ldh and dna releases after 24 h pretreatment under different fa levels it is known that ldh is a cell membrane integrity marker while dna is only located in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes i e bacteria and archaea their releases can therefore indicate the degree of the leakage of intracellular substrates in fig 4 the releases of both ldh and dna increased with the increase of fa level compared with 34 mg l fa 254 mg l fa enhanced ldh release by 13 5 3 6 and dna release by 10 3 3 6 the above results suggested that the increase of fa accelerated the disruption of eps and the leakage of intracellular substrates thereby benefiting sludge disintegration in the literature wei et al 2017 also demonstrated that the sludge biodegradability was enhanced after fa treatment after sludge disintegration several biological processes involved in the anaerobic fermentation are relevant to the accumulation of hydrogen fig 5 a the solubilized substrates with large molecule weight need to be hydrolyzed in the hydrolysis process before their use for hydrogen production hydrogen is directly produced in the acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes however hydrogen can serve as substrate for the production of acetate methane and hydrogen sulfide in the homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing process respectively all these processes are highly relevant to the yield of hydrogen production after alkaline pretreatment ph in the fermenters was not controlled but recorded periodically although ph in these fermenters decreased during fermentation it remained alkaline 8 4 in addition substantial amounts of nh4 n were released due to decomposition of nitrogen rich substrates such as proteins urea and nucleic acids see fig s3 for cyclic variations of ph nh4 n and fa the average fa levels in the fermenters varied from 234 to 496 mg l thus the effect of fa in this range on these processes was also evaluated table 1 summarizes the effect of fa on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing processes via a series of batch tests i e dextran test glucose test butyrate test h2 co2 test and h2 so4 2 test it was observed that the presence of fa decreased the degradation ratios of dextran and glucose the higher the fa level the lower the degradations of dextran and glucose for example when fa level increased from 0 to 424 mg l the degradation ratios of dextran glucose at 1 d fermentation decreased from 74 1 4 1 90 2 5 5 to 45 8 2 8 86 4 5 2 similar results were also made at 2 d fermentation time it should be emphasized that at 2 d fermentation 83 of dextran and glucose were degraded even at the highest fa level suggesting that although fa could inhibit the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes this inhibition did not affect the degradation of substrates substantially apart from acidogenesis acetogenesis can also produce hydrogen in this work the degradation of sodium butyrate was employed to indicate the effect of fa on this process it was found from table 1 that with the fa level increasing from 0 to 444 mg l the degradation of butyrate varied from 20 9 1 9 and 23 6 1 2 at 1 d fermentation and from 25 3 1 7 and 28 7 1 5 at 2 d fermentation table 1 statistical analysis showed that compared with the control i e fa 0 mg l all the variations caused by fa at any level investigated were insignificant p 0 05 indicating that the presence of fa did not affect the acetogenesis process as metabolic intermediates hydrogen produced can be further consumed by several anaerobes including methanogens acetogens and sulfate reducers to produce methane acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide via methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes fig 5a hydrogen and carbon dioxide could be bio converted into methane and acetate through methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis respectively while hydrogen and sulfate could be consumed through sulfate reducing process to generate hydrogen sulfide thus two hydrogen consumption tests i e h2 co2 test and h2 so4 2 test were performed to assess the impact of fa on these three processes the presence of fa largely reduced the consumption of hydrogen in the h2 co2 test table 1 for instance when fa concentration increased from 0 to 354 mg l hydrogen consumption at 2 d fermentation decreased from 68 5 3 1 to 9 5 1 0 further increase of fa concentration to 444 mg l led to a further slight decrease of hydrogen consumption 4 5 0 5 at 2 d fermentation furthermore methane was at a non detectable level in all the fa present fermenters suggesting that methanogenesis was completely inhibited by fa although acetic acid was detected in all the fermenters the amount of acetic acid produced in the fa present fermenters was much less than that in the control at 2 d fermentation 92 7 3 3 mg l acetic acid was produced in the control whereas the corresponding data were 34 3 1 2 mg l in the 354 mg l fa fermenter 18 4 1 1 mg l in the 424 mg l fa fermenter and 15 4 1 2 mg l in the 444 mg l fa fermenter the results indicated that fa severely inhibited homoacetogenesis table 1 table 1 also shows that the addition of fa significantly inhibited the sulfate reducing process as well since fa decreased both the hydrogen consumption and sulfate degradation h2 so4 2 test with the increase of fa level from 0 to 444 mg l hydrogen and sulfate consumption rates at 1 d fermentation decreased from 14 9 1 3 to 4 9 0 4 and from 4 5 0 3 to 1 5 0 2 respectively similar observations were also made at 2 d fermentation the analysis above clarified the role of fa in the anaerobic fermentation of sludge all processes relevant to the accumulation of hydrogen with the exception of acetogenesis were affected by fa fa promoted sludge disintegration process which provided more soluble substrates for the subsequent hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes although fa inhibited the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes the inhibitions did not affect the degradation of substrates such as dextran and glucose to a great extent compared with the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes the inhibition of fa to the three hydrogen consumption processes i e methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes however were much severer these explain why fa promoted hydrogen accumulation additionally as soluble cod measured at 294 mg l of fa pretreatment i e the initial nh4 n concentration of 308 mg l was not significantly higher than that measured at 254 mg l of fa pretreatment i e the initial nh4 n concentration of 266 mg l while the former level of fa caused severer inhibitions to hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes than the latter level of fa it can be understood why increasing the initial nh4 n concentration from 266 to 308 mg l did not enhance hydrogen production fig 1 no significant increase in vss reduction was observed when initial fa concentration further increased to 294 mg l 25 9 1 7 vs 26 3 1 9 p 0 05 with the increase of initial fa from 34 to 254 mg l soluble cod after 24 h pretreatment increased from 4560 140 to 5220 110 mg l which further slightly increased to 5290 120 mg l fig 2b when the initial fa was 3 4 comparison of key enzyme activities in the two long term semi continuous reactors the generation of hydrogen in sludge anaerobic fermentation is directly related to the activities of some key enzymes fig 5a thus we finally compared them in the two long term reactors fed with alkaline ph 9 5 pretreated sludge with 0 or 266 mg l nh4 n addition protease butyrate kinase acetate kinase coa transferase carbon monoxide dehydrogenase coenzyme f420 adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase and fefe hydrogenase which are key enzymes for hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis methanogenesis homoacetogenesis sulfate reducing and hydrogen production respectively were selected to be measured in this work fig 5b shows that fa inhibited the activities of all the enzymes measured to some extent it was reported that fa could diffuse through cell membrane shuttle protons between the two sides and therefore lead to cell inactivation kayhanian 1999 wang et al 2017d also found that fa treatment at 210 mg l for 24 h decreased the activities of both ammonium oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria which was in accord with our results however the inhibition of fa to the enzymes relevant to hydrogen production was much lighter than that to the enzymes relevant to hydrogen consumption for example fa caused only 7 of inhibition to fefe hydrogenase but 97 of inhibition to coenzyme f420 the observations were consistent with the chemical analyses results 3 5 implication to sludge anaerobic treatment to date almost all previous studies reported that nh4 n would inhibit bio gas methane production from anaerobic digestion of sludge pan et al 2013 showed that the addition of nh4 n e g 1 5 2 5 g l enhanced biohydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of food waste the findings obtained in this work significantly advanced the understanding of the impact nh4 n on fermentation because they did not identify the impact of fa on each step of anaerobic fermentation of sludge in this work we found that fa promoted sludge disintegration and caused severe inhibitions to the three hydrogen consumption processes i e methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes thus this work revealed for the first time that the presence of fa in a suitable range could enhance hydrogen accumulation from sludge anaerobic fermentation which was previously existed in sludge fermentation systems but unrecognized before this was experimentally demonstrated through the use of chemical analysis on a series of batch tests using either real sludge or model substrates and microbial analysis on the long term semi continuous experiment with the increasing demand for energy worldwide energy recovery from wwtps attracts growing attention wang et al 2017e li et al 2014 li et al 2015 compared with methane hydrogen is a more valuable product due to its higher energy yield and lower carbon footprint the findings achieved here may enlighten engineers to develop more economic strategies for hydrogen production from sludge fermentation in the past extensive efforts such as acid alkaline heat and ozone ultrasound pretreatment were dedicated to enhancing hydrogen yield these strategies require high input of either chemicals or energy in comparison fa is a waste generated renewable chemical that can be generated in situ in wwtps as a byproduct of sludge treatment i e fa can be attained directly from anaerobic digester fermenter effluent thus the fa based strategy does not have these limitations fig 6 presents an enhanced hydrogen production concept of a sludge fermentation system with the economical fa based pretreatment method applied the essential chemical for this method i e fa can be directly obtained from the anaerobic fermenter effluent the sludge fermentation liquid which is required to be returned to the head of wwtps for treatment usually contains 300 mg l nh4 n chen et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 by recycling a part of fermentation liquid into the pretreatment unit and controlling ph and temperature at suitable levels the desirable fa concentration can be readily achieved in such a sludge fermentation concept with fa supported sludge pretreatment both sludge reduction and hydrogen yield are achieved in an economic way based on the results obtained in this work it is calculated that this fa supported strategy can cause 0 8 103 t more in sludge reduction and 7 6 104 m3 more in hydrogen production annually in a wwtp q 105 m3 day as compared with the alkaline ph 9 5 pretreatment method only table s3 considering the large number of wwtps worldwide this fa based pretreatment method could have significant benefits it should be emphasized that this work mainly aimed to identify the contribution of fa to the enhanced hydrogen production and to reveal details of how fa enhances hydrogen production thus technical optimization was not carried out for example only seven nh4 n concentrations i e 36 99 141 182 224 266 and 308 mg l one pretreatment time i e 24 h and one ph value i e 9 5 were tested in this work although one hydrogen consumption process i e methanogenesis was completely inhibited hydrogen was still consumed by two other hydrogen consumption processes i e homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes table 1 the hydrogen yield would be further enhanced if these two processes can be further inhibited via optimizing both the fa concentration and pretreatment time a comprehensive optimization study e g a mathematical model study or a response surface study is therefore required in the future based on the optimization study scaling up this fa supported hydrogen production method to pilot scale or full scale levels is also required in the future to further evaluate its technical and economic feasibilities under real world situations 4 conclusion in this study the contribution of fa to the increased hydrogen production from anaerobic sludge fermentation was identified and the underlying mechanism of how fa enhanced hydrogen production was investigated for the first time the results showed that with the increase of initial nh4 n level from 36 to 266 mg l the maximal hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge increased from 7 3 to 15 6 ml vss further increase of nh4 n to 308 mg l caused a slight decrease of hydrogen yield 15 0 ml g vss fa instead of nh4 n was demonstrated to be the true contributor it was found that the presence of free ammonia facilitated the releases of both extracellular and intracellular constituents except for acetogenesis fa inhibited all other bio processes but its inhibition to the hydrogen consumption processes i e homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing process was much severer than that to the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the project of national natural science foundation of china nsfc

19737,ammonium and or free ammonia the unionized form of ammonium are generally thought to inhibit the activities of microbes involved in anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge it was found in this work however that the presence of ammonium nh4 n largely enhanced dark fermentative hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge with the increase of initial nh4 n level from 36 to 266 mg l the maximal hydrogen production from alkaline ph 9 5 pretreated sludge increased from 7 3 to 15 6 ml per gram volatile suspended solids vss under the standard condition further increase of nh4 n to 308 mg l caused a slight decrease of hydrogen yield 15 0 ml g vss experimental results demonstrated that free ammonia instead of nh4 n was the true contributor to the enhancement of hydrogen production it was found that the presence of free ammonia facilitated the releases of both extracellular and intracellular constituents which thereby provided more substrates for subsequent hydrogen production the free ammonia at the tested levels i e 0 444 mg l did not affect acetogenesis significantly although free ammonia inhibited all other bio processes its inhibition to the hydrogen consumption processes i e homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing process was much severer than that to the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes further investigations with enzyme analyses showed that free ammonia posed slight impacts on protease butyrate kinase acetate kinase coa transferase and fefe hydrogenase activities but largely suppressed the activities of coenzyme f420 carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and adenylyl sulfate reductase which were consistent with the chemical analyses performed above graphical abstract image 1 keywords waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation hydrogen free ammonia 1 introduction hydrogen is widely considered the most promising alternative to fossil fuels as it has a high energy yield 142 35 kj g with at least 2 75 times that of any hydrocarbons and produces water instead of greenhouse gases when it is combusted cai et al 2004 as the major byproduct of biological wastewater treatment waste activated sludge is produced in huge quantities feng et al 2015 li et al 2016 wang et al 2017a 2017b treatment and disposal of the sludge are costly accounting for up to 60 of the total operation costs of wastewater treatment plants wwtps zhao et al 2017 wang et al 2017c on the other hand sludge contains high levels of organic constituents such as protein and carbohydrate zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 xie et al 2016 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2018 which can be used as substrates for hydrogen production therefore biological production of hydrogen from waste activated sludge has recently attracted much attention zhao et al 2010 gioannis et al 2013 li et al 2009 by which sludge is reduced and reused fossil fuels are saved and greenhouse gas productions are reduced the hydrogen yield of dark fermentation of waste activated sludge is usually low due to rapid hydrogen consumption in comparison to sludge disintegration most previous investigations to enhance hydrogen production therefore focused on optimizing sludge pretreatment methods yang et al 2012 assawamongkholsiri et al 2013 kim et al 2013 operational conditions zhao et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 jung et al 2011 or sludge composition kim et al 2012 chen et al 2012a wang et al 2015 for instance cai et al 2004 found that sludge pretreated by alkaline ph 11 for 24 h could increase hydrogen yield from 9 1 to 16 6 ml of h2 g of dry solids the bioconversion of sludge proteins and hydrogen production were found to be largely enhanced by co fermentation of sewage sludge and carbohydrate rich substrates such as food wastes and agricultural wastes kim et al 2012 chen et al 2012b liu et al 2013 by elevating the content of sludge polyhydroxyalkanoates from 25 to 178 mg g volatile suspended solids vss hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of sludge increased from 26 5 to 58 7 ml g vss wang et al 2015 apart from these parameters byproducts that are in situ generated in the anaerobic fermentation process may also affect hydrogen yield to date however little information is available to this field nh4 n which is produced from the disintegration of nitrogen rich compounds such as proteins urea and nucleic acids could be accumulated at high concentrations in the sludge digestion or fermentation process yan et al 2010 gonzález fernández et al 2009 the nh4 n concentration in the sludge fermentation liquid is usually at 300 mg l chen et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 and this value could be up to 1500 mg l in the sludge digestion liquid wang et al 2014 almost all previous studies demonstrated that the presence of nh4 n especially at high levels showed inhibitory effects on bio gas production from anaerobic digestion for example sung and liu 2003 found that compared with the control 0 4 g l 5 0 and 5 8 g l of nh4 n resulted in 39 and 64 decreases in methane production respectively nakakubo et al 2008 reported that a 50 reduction in methane yield under thermophilic anaerobic digestion was observed at nh4 n concentration of 11 0 g l as compared with 4 6 g l nh4 n these findings suggested that it was essential to remove or reduce nh4 n levels in the anaerobic digestion process to ensure bio gas production nevertheless it was found in the current work that when 63 272 mg l nh4 n was added into the sludge mixture hydrogen yield from alkaline pretreated sludge was enhanced rather than reduced as compared to the case without nh4 n addition there were two varying parameters in these fermentation systems one is the nh4 n added as ph variation is similar among these fermentation systems thus the other varying parameter is free ammonia fa the unionized form of ammonium due to the high concentrations of ammonium added and alkaline condition maintained fa can diffuse through cell membrane shuttle protons between the two sides and result in cell inactivation kayhanian 1999 this could cause variations in the activities of function microbes involved in sludge anaerobic fermentation which thereby may affect hydrogen production however the role of fa on hydrogen production from dark fermentation of sludge has not been clarified so far it is unknown which one nh4 n or fa is the main contributor to the enhanced hydrogen production the aim of this study was to identify whether and how fa enhances dark fermentative hydrogen production first hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment ph 9 5 in the presence of nh4 n at different levels 36 308 mg l was compared to identify the potential contribution of nh4 n to hydrogen production hydrogen yield from acidic fermentation of sludge ph 5 5 was also compared at the same nh4 n levels it should be emphasized that the variations of fa level among these acidic fermenters were negligible thus the results obtained could be used to indicate the impact of nh4 n on hydrogen production finally the mechanisms for fa enhancing hydrogen production were explored the findings reported in this work reveal the details of how fa enhances hydrogen production for the first time erase the concern regarding the inhibitory effect of nh4 n or fa produced in the fermentation process on dark fermentation and may guide engineers to develop more economic strategies for hydrogen production from sludge fermentation 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sources and characteristics of waste activated sludge the sludge employed in this work was withdrawn from the secondary sedimentation tank of a municipal wwtp in changsha china the raw sludge was filtrated by a stainless steel mesh 2 0 mm and concentrated by setting at 4 c for 24 h before use the major characteristics of the concentrated sludge are as follows ph 6 8 0 1 total suspended soils tss 14920 260 mg l vss 12140 170 mg l total chemical oxygen demand cod 14780 290 mg l total carbohydrate 1650 230 mg cod l total protein 7780 310 mg cod l lipid and oil 170 20 mg cod l and nh4 n 36 4 mg l it can be seen that protein and carbohydrate are the top two organics in the sludge accounting for about 64 of total sludge cod 2 2 hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment in the presence of nh4 n at different levels this batch test was conducted in eight serum bottles with a working volume of 1 l each each serum bottle was first fed with 500 ml concentrated sludge as mentioned above then different volumes of nh4cl stock solution 4 0 m were added at the beginning of the test which resulted in the initial nh4 n concentration of 36 36 99 141 182 224 266 or 308 mg l it should be noted that nh4 n was not added to the first two bottles and 36 mg l nh4 n was the background ammonium concentration except one serum bottle with nh4 n concentration at 36 mg l set as the blank the tested sludge in all other serum bottles was pretreated under alkaline condition ph 9 5 at 35 c for 24 h before fermentation as alkaline pretreatment was demonstrated to be an effective method for enhancing biohydrogen production from waste activated sludge cai et al 2004 the nh4 n concentration temperature and ph applied gave rise to initial fa concentrations of 0 3 the blank 34 95 135 174 214 254 or 294 mg l fa concentration was determined by the formula s nh3 n nh4 n 10ph kb kw 10ph where s nh3 n nh4 n represents the concentration of nh3 n nh4 n kb represents the ionization constant of the ammonia equilibrium equation and kw represents the ionization constant of water anthonisen et al 1976 the value of kb kw was calculated via the formula of kb kw e6 344 273 t anthonisen et al 1976 after pretreatment the serum bottles were sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to ensure anaerobic condition finally all serum bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 150 rpm no extra inoculum was added into these reactors and hence the sludge was used as both fermentation substrate and inoculum in the fermentation process the ph value in all bottles was not controlled but was recorded periodically the total gas volume was measured by releasing the pressure in the bottle using a glass syringe 300 ml to equilibrate with the atmospheric pressure oh et al 2003 the cumulative volume of hydrogen gas was calculated as 1 vh i vh i 1 ch i vg i ch i 1 vg i 1 where vh i and vh i 1 are respectively the cumulative volumes of hydrogen gas in the current i and previous i 1 time intervals vg i and vg i 1 are respectively the total gas volumes in the current and previous time intervals and ch i and ch i 1 are the fractions of hydrogen gas measured by gas chromatography in the current and previous time intervals respectively 2 3 hydrogen production from acidic fermentation of sludge in the presence of nh4 n at different levels this set of batch experiments was utilized to assess the impact of nh4 n on hydrogen production to minimize the impact of fa acidic fermentation was employed eight serum bottles with a working volume of 1 l each were operated in this experiment the experimental procedure was identical to that described above except that acidic condition ph 5 5 was employed to both sludge pretreatment and dark fermentation fa concentration in these reactors varied only between 0 02 and 0 36 mg l thus the impact of fa on hydrogen yield in this set of experiments is expected to be negligible 2 4 assessing the impacts of fa on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis methonogenesis and sulfate reducing processes sludge dark fermentation generally contains several processes the rate of sludge disintegration the major rate limiting process in sludge dark fermentation is often assessed by measuring the concentrations of soluble cod and soluble proteins released in fermentation liquor zhao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 li et al 2009 besides several other bio reactions such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis methonogenesis and sulfate reducing processes are also involved in sludge dark fermentation which affect hydrogen production significantly the rates of these processes are generally evaluated by batch tests using model substrates in the literature zhao et al 2010 2016 li et al 2009 in this set of tests 20 replicate serum bottles with a working volume of 1 0 l each were performed these bottles were divided into five groups namely dextran test glucose test butyrate test h2 co2 test and h2 so4 2 test with four in each group dextran test all bottles received 450 ml of synthetic wastewater and 50 ml of same inoculum inoculum used in this test was withdrawn from an anaerobic sludge fermenter in our laboratory the synthetic wastewater contains 0 5 g dextran average molecular weight 23800 a model polysaccharide compound l ph in all the bottles was controlled at 9 0 0 1 which was close to the average ph value in the fermenters operated in the hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment in the presence of nh4 n at different levels section different volumes of nh4cl stock solution 4 0 m were added into the four serum bottles resulting in an initial concentration of nh4 n at 0 540 648 or 678 mg l all other fermentation conditions were the same as those described above the nh4 n temperature and ph applied gave rise to fa concentrations at 0 354 424 or 444 mg l the fa concentrations used in this test were respectively equal to the average fa concentrations measured from the fermenters fed with 141 266 and 308 mg l of initial nh4 n treated sludges by analyzing the degradation efficiency of dextran the effect of fa on hydrolysis process could be evaluated glucose test the operation of this test was operated with the same approach described in dextran test except that the fermentation substrate i e dextran was replaced with glucose by determining the glucose degradation the effect of fa on acidogenesis could be assessed butyrate test the operation of this experiment was carried out the same as that depicted in dextran test except that the fermentation substrate was replaced with 10 g l sodium butyrate the effect of fa on acetogenesis could be indicated by analyzing the degradation efficiency of sodium butyrate h2 co2 test each serum bottle first received 50 ml of fermented sludge mixture as inoculums and 450 ml tap water the ph and nh4 n levels in the four serum bottles were the same as those operated in dextran test all these bottles were then flushed with a combined gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to guarantee that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas finally all bottles were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an air bath shaker at stirring speed of 150 rpm the effect of fa on homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis could be assessed by comparing the consumption of hydrogen and the productions of acetic acid and methane among these fermenters h2 so4 2 test each bottle received 450 ml of synthetic wastewater and 50 ml of fermented sludge mixture the synthetic wastewater contains 1 18 g potassium sulfate l each bottle was flushed with a combined gas 45 hydrogen and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to ensure that they were filled with the synthetic hydrogen containing gas all other operations were the same as those depicted in h2 co2 test the effect of fa on sulfate reducing process could be indicated by comparing the hydrogen consumption and sulfate degradation among these fermenters 2 5 long term semi continuous reactor operation for the analysis of key enzymes two long term semi continuous reactors were operated to further explore the impact of different fa levels on sludge anaerobic fermentation from the aspect of microbial analyses the two reactors were replicate with a working volume of 1 l each and fed with alkaline ph 9 5 pretreated sludge with either 36 or 266 mg l initial nh4 n concentration in this experiment two typical sludge with either 36 or 266 mg l initial nh4 n concentration was tested as 36 mg l nh4 n was the background ammonium concentration and maximum hydrogen was achieved at 266 mg l nh4 n according to the batch test above the fermentation conditions were the same as described in section 2 2 according to the results obtained from the batch tests the sludge retention time in the reactors was maintained at 7 d thus 70 ml of fermentation mixture was withdrawn daily from each reactor and replaced with the same amount of new alkaline pretreated sludge afterwards both the reactors were sparged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to remove oxygen before they were re capped and re sealed hydrogen yield reached a stable level after approximately 50 d operation and then the assay of key enzyme activities was performed 2 6 analytical methods hydrogen and methane fractions in the generated gas were determined at normal pressure via a gas chromatograph gc112a china equipped with a thermal conductivity detector a 2 m stainless column activated carbon 60 80 mesh and with nitrogen as the carrier gas the temperatures of the injection column and detector were set at 70 140 and 140 c respectively the measurements of cod nh4 n vss and tss were performed in accordance with standard methods apha 1998 proteins carbohydrates lipids and short chain fatty acids were measured as previously described wang et al 2015 a heat extraction method was used to extract different fractions of extracellular polymeric substances eps from sludge xu et al 2017 excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba scientific france with a 450 w xe arc lamp was applied to characterize the changes of fermentation liquid luo et al 2013 sulfide concentration was determined according to the method depicted in the literature aiking et al 1982 cell membrane integrity was indicated by the lactate dehydrogenase ldh release assay using a ldh cytotoxicity assay kit biovision usa according to the manufacturer s instructions and the procedure documented in our previous study chen et al 2012b the measurement of dna released from sludge cells was conducted according to a previously established protocol liang et al 2015 for measuring the activities of key enzymes 25 ml the fermentation mixture was collected form the long term reactors cleaned using 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 sonicated at 20kha at 4 c for 10 min and finally centrifuged at 12000 rpm at 4 c for 15 min to remove the waste debris the extracts were kept on ice before analyzing the activities of the following eight key enzymes i e protease acetate kinase butyrate kinase coa transferase carbon monoxide dehydrogenase adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase coenzyme f420 and fefe hydrogenase were measured in this study with the procedures detailed in supporting information 2 7 statistical analysis all tests were conducted in triplicate an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogen production from sludge with alkaline pretreatment in the presence of nh4 n at different levels fig 1 shows the cumulative hydrogen production from dark fermentation of sludge with alkaline pretreatment ph 9 5 at different nh4 n levels hydrogen yield from the blank without ph and nh4 n adjustments was low 2 ml g vss alkaline pretreatment of sludge effectively enhanced hydrogen production consistent with previous results cai et al 2004 in the initial 168 h hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge without addition of nh4 n i e 36 mg l nh4 n sludge increased gradually and no further significant increase was found after that time p 0 05 see table s1 for statistical analysis the maximal hydrogen production and optimal fermentation time were 7 3 0 3 ml g vss and 168 h for alkaline pretreated sludge without nh4 addition similar trend of hydrogen production was also observed for other alkaline pretreated sludge several previous publications reported that nh4 n had inhibitory effects on biogas production from anaerobic digestion of sludge however fig 1 shows that hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge was not inhibited but promoted by the increase of nh4 n with the increase of initial nh4 n content from 36 to 266 mg l the maximal hydrogen yield increased from 7 3 0 3 to 15 6 0 4 ml g vss although further increase of initial nh4 n to 308 mg l caused a slight decrease of hydrogen yield to 15 0 0 3 ml g vss this value was still 2 folds of that from 36 mg l nh4 n sludge it should be noted that this decrease was considered to be statistically insignificant p 0 05 the presence of nh4 n at pertinent levels clearly enhanced dark fermentative hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge 3 2 identification of the true contributor to the increased hydrogen production two major differences among the above fermenters fed with alkaline pretreated sludge are 1 the nh4 n level and 2 the unionized form of ammonium fa level due to the alkaline pretreatment applied the initial nh4 n level varied from 36 to 308 mg l among the fermenters while the initial fa level varied from 34 to 294 mg l according to the calculation both the two parameters correlated well with the hydrogen production from dark fermentation of alkaline pretreated sludge fig s1 using food waste as the fermentation substrate pan et al 2013 also reported that the suitable addition of nh4 n e g 1 5 2 5 g l could enhance biohydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation to date however the potential impact of fa on hydrogen production has not yet been documented thus the roles of these two potential contributors require further clarification to assess the contribution of nh4 n the variation of fa should be controlled in a negligible range an acidic fermentation test ph 5 5 was employed to provide such support in this situation fa concentration in the acidic fermentation reactors varied only between 0 02 and 0 36 mg l therefore the impact of fa on hydrogen yield in this test could be neglected although nh4 n concentration in these acidic fermentation reactors still varied from 36 to 308 mg l as in the previous set of tests hydrogen yield in these reactors was almost the same table s2 suggesting that fa rather than nh4 n was the true contributor to the enhancement of hydrogen production 3 3 how does fa enhance hydrogen production sludge disintegration is generally considered the major rate limiting process in anaerobic fermentation or digestion of sludge thus the potential impact of fa on sludge disintegration was first assessed the rate of sludge disintegration is generally indicated by vss reduction and soluble cod release in fermentation liquor zhao et al 2017 xu et al 2017 wang et al 2013 2015 vss reduction after 1 d alkaline pretreatment increased from 20 3 0 5 to 25 9 1 7 when the initial fa concentration increased from 34 to 254 mg l fig 2 a no significant increase in vss reduction was observed when initial fa concentration further increased to 294 mg l 25 9 1 7 vs 26 3 1 9 p 0 05 with the increase of initial fa from 34 to 254 mg l soluble cod after 24 h pretreatment increased from 4560 140 to 5220 110 mg l which further slightly increased to 5290 120 mg l fig 2b when the initial fa was 294 mg l similar observations were also made for other pretreatment times these data were further supported by eem profiles of fermentation liquid fig 2c the eem fluorescence spectroscopy is widely employed to characterize the structure changes in either eps or fermentation liquid zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 sheng and yu 2006 a red shift blue shift of emission wavelength is usually relevant to an increase decrease of particular functional groups such as carbonyl hydroxyl alkoxyl amino and carboxyl groups while an increase decrease of fluorescence intensity of characteristic peaks is often related to an increase decrease of fluorophores concentration zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 sheng and yu 2006 as shown in fig 2c two major peaks signed as peak a and peak b in this work were identified from fluorescence spectra peak a and peak b located at the ex em of 220 340 350 and 270 280 340 350 nm in the spectra respectively which was reported to belong to aromatic proteins and tryptophan protein like substances respectively luo et al 2013 sheng and yu 2006 compared with 34 mg l fa 254 mg l fa caused not only red shifts of emission wavelength from 340 to 350 nm but also increases of fluorescence intensity from 499 to 571 in peak a and from 1308 to 1460 in peak b suggesting that 254 mg l fa led to more substrates released in the fermentation liquid than 34 mg l fa all the results revealed that the increase of fa improved sludge disintegration resulting in more soluble substrates for subsequent hydrogen production fig 3 presents the protein and carbohydrate contents extracted from loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps of sludge cells at 2 h pretreatment under different fa levels the measurements of ldh cell membrane integrity marker and dna releases suggested that the increase of fa did not cause extra leakage of intracellular substrates at 2 h pretreatment time fig s2 thus the data shown in fig 3 could be utilized to indicate the impact of fa on disruption of loosely bound eps or tightly bound eps it can be seen that the increase of fa resulted in less substrates remained in both loosely and tightly bound eps for example 49 2 and 46 1 mg g vss proteins were respectively measured in loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps from the sludge cells exposed to 34 mg l fa whereas the corresponding values were 42 5 and 37 0 mg g vss in loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps from the sludge cells exposed to 254 mg l fa respectively fig 4 shows the variations in ldh and dna releases after 24 h pretreatment under different fa levels it is known that ldh is a cell membrane integrity marker while dna is only located in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes i e bacteria and archaea their releases can therefore indicate the degree of the leakage of intracellular substrates in fig 4 the releases of both ldh and dna increased with the increase of fa level compared with 34 mg l fa 254 mg l fa enhanced ldh release by 13 5 3 6 and dna release by 10 3 3 6 the above results suggested that the increase of fa accelerated the disruption of eps and the leakage of intracellular substrates thereby benefiting sludge disintegration in the literature wei et al 2017 also demonstrated that the sludge biodegradability was enhanced after fa treatment after sludge disintegration several biological processes involved in the anaerobic fermentation are relevant to the accumulation of hydrogen fig 5 a the solubilized substrates with large molecule weight need to be hydrolyzed in the hydrolysis process before their use for hydrogen production hydrogen is directly produced in the acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes however hydrogen can serve as substrate for the production of acetate methane and hydrogen sulfide in the homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing process respectively all these processes are highly relevant to the yield of hydrogen production after alkaline pretreatment ph in the fermenters was not controlled but recorded periodically although ph in these fermenters decreased during fermentation it remained alkaline 8 4 in addition substantial amounts of nh4 n were released due to decomposition of nitrogen rich substrates such as proteins urea and nucleic acids see fig s3 for cyclic variations of ph nh4 n and fa the average fa levels in the fermenters varied from 234 to 496 mg l thus the effect of fa in this range on these processes was also evaluated table 1 summarizes the effect of fa on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing processes via a series of batch tests i e dextran test glucose test butyrate test h2 co2 test and h2 so4 2 test it was observed that the presence of fa decreased the degradation ratios of dextran and glucose the higher the fa level the lower the degradations of dextran and glucose for example when fa level increased from 0 to 424 mg l the degradation ratios of dextran glucose at 1 d fermentation decreased from 74 1 4 1 90 2 5 5 to 45 8 2 8 86 4 5 2 similar results were also made at 2 d fermentation time it should be emphasized that at 2 d fermentation 83 of dextran and glucose were degraded even at the highest fa level suggesting that although fa could inhibit the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes this inhibition did not affect the degradation of substrates substantially apart from acidogenesis acetogenesis can also produce hydrogen in this work the degradation of sodium butyrate was employed to indicate the effect of fa on this process it was found from table 1 that with the fa level increasing from 0 to 444 mg l the degradation of butyrate varied from 20 9 1 9 and 23 6 1 2 at 1 d fermentation and from 25 3 1 7 and 28 7 1 5 at 2 d fermentation table 1 statistical analysis showed that compared with the control i e fa 0 mg l all the variations caused by fa at any level investigated were insignificant p 0 05 indicating that the presence of fa did not affect the acetogenesis process as metabolic intermediates hydrogen produced can be further consumed by several anaerobes including methanogens acetogens and sulfate reducers to produce methane acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide via methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes fig 5a hydrogen and carbon dioxide could be bio converted into methane and acetate through methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis respectively while hydrogen and sulfate could be consumed through sulfate reducing process to generate hydrogen sulfide thus two hydrogen consumption tests i e h2 co2 test and h2 so4 2 test were performed to assess the impact of fa on these three processes the presence of fa largely reduced the consumption of hydrogen in the h2 co2 test table 1 for instance when fa concentration increased from 0 to 354 mg l hydrogen consumption at 2 d fermentation decreased from 68 5 3 1 to 9 5 1 0 further increase of fa concentration to 444 mg l led to a further slight decrease of hydrogen consumption 4 5 0 5 at 2 d fermentation furthermore methane was at a non detectable level in all the fa present fermenters suggesting that methanogenesis was completely inhibited by fa although acetic acid was detected in all the fermenters the amount of acetic acid produced in the fa present fermenters was much less than that in the control at 2 d fermentation 92 7 3 3 mg l acetic acid was produced in the control whereas the corresponding data were 34 3 1 2 mg l in the 354 mg l fa fermenter 18 4 1 1 mg l in the 424 mg l fa fermenter and 15 4 1 2 mg l in the 444 mg l fa fermenter the results indicated that fa severely inhibited homoacetogenesis table 1 table 1 also shows that the addition of fa significantly inhibited the sulfate reducing process as well since fa decreased both the hydrogen consumption and sulfate degradation h2 so4 2 test with the increase of fa level from 0 to 444 mg l hydrogen and sulfate consumption rates at 1 d fermentation decreased from 14 9 1 3 to 4 9 0 4 and from 4 5 0 3 to 1 5 0 2 respectively similar observations were also made at 2 d fermentation the analysis above clarified the role of fa in the anaerobic fermentation of sludge all processes relevant to the accumulation of hydrogen with the exception of acetogenesis were affected by fa fa promoted sludge disintegration process which provided more soluble substrates for the subsequent hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes although fa inhibited the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes the inhibitions did not affect the degradation of substrates such as dextran and glucose to a great extent compared with the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes the inhibition of fa to the three hydrogen consumption processes i e methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes however were much severer these explain why fa promoted hydrogen accumulation additionally as soluble cod measured at 294 mg l of fa pretreatment i e the initial nh4 n concentration of 308 mg l was not significantly higher than that measured at 254 mg l of fa pretreatment i e the initial nh4 n concentration of 266 mg l while the former level of fa caused severer inhibitions to hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes than the latter level of fa it can be understood why increasing the initial nh4 n concentration from 266 to 308 mg l did not enhance hydrogen production fig 1 no significant increase in vss reduction was observed when initial fa concentration further increased to 294 mg l 25 9 1 7 vs 26 3 1 9 p 0 05 with the increase of initial fa from 34 to 254 mg l soluble cod after 24 h pretreatment increased from 4560 140 to 5220 110 mg l which further slightly increased to 5290 120 mg l fig 2b when the initial fa was 3 4 comparison of key enzyme activities in the two long term semi continuous reactors the generation of hydrogen in sludge anaerobic fermentation is directly related to the activities of some key enzymes fig 5a thus we finally compared them in the two long term reactors fed with alkaline ph 9 5 pretreated sludge with 0 or 266 mg l nh4 n addition protease butyrate kinase acetate kinase coa transferase carbon monoxide dehydrogenase coenzyme f420 adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase and fefe hydrogenase which are key enzymes for hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis methanogenesis homoacetogenesis sulfate reducing and hydrogen production respectively were selected to be measured in this work fig 5b shows that fa inhibited the activities of all the enzymes measured to some extent it was reported that fa could diffuse through cell membrane shuttle protons between the two sides and therefore lead to cell inactivation kayhanian 1999 wang et al 2017d also found that fa treatment at 210 mg l for 24 h decreased the activities of both ammonium oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria which was in accord with our results however the inhibition of fa to the enzymes relevant to hydrogen production was much lighter than that to the enzymes relevant to hydrogen consumption for example fa caused only 7 of inhibition to fefe hydrogenase but 97 of inhibition to coenzyme f420 the observations were consistent with the chemical analyses results 3 5 implication to sludge anaerobic treatment to date almost all previous studies reported that nh4 n would inhibit bio gas methane production from anaerobic digestion of sludge pan et al 2013 showed that the addition of nh4 n e g 1 5 2 5 g l enhanced biohydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of food waste the findings obtained in this work significantly advanced the understanding of the impact nh4 n on fermentation because they did not identify the impact of fa on each step of anaerobic fermentation of sludge in this work we found that fa promoted sludge disintegration and caused severe inhibitions to the three hydrogen consumption processes i e methanogenesis homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes thus this work revealed for the first time that the presence of fa in a suitable range could enhance hydrogen accumulation from sludge anaerobic fermentation which was previously existed in sludge fermentation systems but unrecognized before this was experimentally demonstrated through the use of chemical analysis on a series of batch tests using either real sludge or model substrates and microbial analysis on the long term semi continuous experiment with the increasing demand for energy worldwide energy recovery from wwtps attracts growing attention wang et al 2017e li et al 2014 li et al 2015 compared with methane hydrogen is a more valuable product due to its higher energy yield and lower carbon footprint the findings achieved here may enlighten engineers to develop more economic strategies for hydrogen production from sludge fermentation in the past extensive efforts such as acid alkaline heat and ozone ultrasound pretreatment were dedicated to enhancing hydrogen yield these strategies require high input of either chemicals or energy in comparison fa is a waste generated renewable chemical that can be generated in situ in wwtps as a byproduct of sludge treatment i e fa can be attained directly from anaerobic digester fermenter effluent thus the fa based strategy does not have these limitations fig 6 presents an enhanced hydrogen production concept of a sludge fermentation system with the economical fa based pretreatment method applied the essential chemical for this method i e fa can be directly obtained from the anaerobic fermenter effluent the sludge fermentation liquid which is required to be returned to the head of wwtps for treatment usually contains 300 mg l nh4 n chen et al 2007 zhao et al 2015 by recycling a part of fermentation liquid into the pretreatment unit and controlling ph and temperature at suitable levels the desirable fa concentration can be readily achieved in such a sludge fermentation concept with fa supported sludge pretreatment both sludge reduction and hydrogen yield are achieved in an economic way based on the results obtained in this work it is calculated that this fa supported strategy can cause 0 8 103 t more in sludge reduction and 7 6 104 m3 more in hydrogen production annually in a wwtp q 105 m3 day as compared with the alkaline ph 9 5 pretreatment method only table s3 considering the large number of wwtps worldwide this fa based pretreatment method could have significant benefits it should be emphasized that this work mainly aimed to identify the contribution of fa to the enhanced hydrogen production and to reveal details of how fa enhances hydrogen production thus technical optimization was not carried out for example only seven nh4 n concentrations i e 36 99 141 182 224 266 and 308 mg l one pretreatment time i e 24 h and one ph value i e 9 5 were tested in this work although one hydrogen consumption process i e methanogenesis was completely inhibited hydrogen was still consumed by two other hydrogen consumption processes i e homoacetogenesis and sulfate reducing processes table 1 the hydrogen yield would be further enhanced if these two processes can be further inhibited via optimizing both the fa concentration and pretreatment time a comprehensive optimization study e g a mathematical model study or a response surface study is therefore required in the future based on the optimization study scaling up this fa supported hydrogen production method to pilot scale or full scale levels is also required in the future to further evaluate its technical and economic feasibilities under real world situations 4 conclusion in this study the contribution of fa to the increased hydrogen production from anaerobic sludge fermentation was identified and the underlying mechanism of how fa enhanced hydrogen production was investigated for the first time the results showed that with the increase of initial nh4 n level from 36 to 266 mg l the maximal hydrogen production from alkaline pretreated sludge increased from 7 3 to 15 6 ml vss further increase of nh4 n to 308 mg l caused a slight decrease of hydrogen yield 15 0 ml g vss fa instead of nh4 n was demonstrated to be the true contributor it was found that the presence of free ammonia facilitated the releases of both extracellular and intracellular constituents except for acetogenesis fa inhibited all other bio processes but its inhibition to the hydrogen consumption processes i e homoacetogenesis methanogenesis and sulfate reducing process was much severer than that to the hydrolysis and acidogenesis processes acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the project of national natural science foundation of china nsfc

19738,the widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in natural waters has raised great concerns about their potential risks on human health and ecological systems this study systematically investigates the degradation of sulfasalazine ssz and its two human metabolites sulfapyridine spd and 5 aminosalicylic acid 5 asa by uv and uv peroxydisulfate uv pds processes experimental results show that spd and 5 asa were readily degraded upon uv 254 nm direct photolysis with quantum yields measured to be 8 6 0 8 10 3 and 2 4 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 respectively although ssz was resistant to direct uv photolysis it could be effectively removed by both uv h2o2 and uv pds processes with fluence based pseudo first order rate constants determined to be 0 0030 and

degradation rate of ssz in the uv pds process increasing the dosage of pds significantly enhanced the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process which can be well predicted by the developed kinetic

2008 bonvin et al 2012 sulfasalazine ssz also known as azulfidine is a medicine widely prescribed for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease e g ulcerative colitis and crohn s disease as well as rheumatoid arthritis volin et al 2002 ssz is a conjugate of sulfapyridine spd and 5 aminosalicylic acid 5 asa linked by an azo bond see fig 1 for molecular structures it is metabolized by the bacterial azoreducates enzymes in the colon reducing the azo bond and releasing spd and 5 asa chungi et al 1989 ssz can also be biotically abiotically converted to spd and 5 asa by naturally occurring processes miao et al 2004 göbel et al 2005 while environmental relevant concentrations of ssz and its metabolites typically range from nanogram per liter to microgram per liter göbel et al 2005 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 their occurrence can cause subtle chronic and unpredicted effects on aquatic organisms and ecosystem schwarzenbach et al 2006 for example ssz can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species ros resulting in damage to proteins nucleic acids and cell membranes of aquatic organisms linares et al 2011 therefore cost effective and environmentally friendly treatment technologies are highly desirable for elimination of ssz and its metabolites from aqueous solutions minimizing potential risks associated with these compounds fan et al 2011 uv based technologies are widely applied in water and wastewater treatment for both disinfection and oxidation purpose pereira et al 2007a canonica et al 2008 fatta kassinos et al 2011 uv photolysis alone is capable of inactivating pathogenic bacteria viruses and protozoa by photochemical modification of genetic materials of the cell deoxyribonucleic acid dna or ribonucleic acid rna mamane et al 2007 uv radiation can also induce direct photodegradation of organic contaminants however such process highly depends on irradiation intensity as well as absorption behavior and quantum yield of the target compounds schwarzenbach et al 2003 fatta kassinos et al 2011 when combined with peroxides such as peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv radiation can generates highly reactive radicals e g sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho via homolytic cleavage of peroxide bond anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 antoniou et al 2010a both so4 and ho have high standard redox potentials so4 2 5 3 1 v ho 1 8

et al 2010 such uv peroxide processes also known as uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops attract growing interest in water treatment engineering early studies have reported high efficiency of uv photolysis and uv aops for removing of various organic contaminants in water and wastewater such as herbicides khan et al 2013 2014 luo et al 2016 lutze et al 2015 pesticides shah et al 2013 khan et al 2016 endocrine disrupting chemicals lau et al 2007 sharma et al 2015 pharmaceuticals duan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 deng et al 2013 tan et al 2013 kwon et al 2015 cyanotoxins antoniou et al 2010a 2010b he et al 2013 2014 and odor and taste causing compounds xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 uv based technologies bear several advantages over conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation and chlorination because there are no disinfection by products dbps formation chemical free and no sludge production anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 antoniou et al 2010a in particular uv pds appears to be more efficient for eliminating organic contaminants due to its high quantum yield of so4 1 4 1 8 for pds and 1 0 for h2o2 at 254 nm khan et al 2013 xiao et al 2016 in addition so4 is a single electron oxidant that reacts selectively with organics predominantly through electron transfer mechanism neta et al 1977 1988 enabling uv pds process more suitable for destruction of certain recalcitrant contaminants such as perfluorooctanoic acid qian et al 2016 naturally occurring species in waters have significant impacts on uv and uv aops wols et al 2013 lutze et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 these species such as natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate hco3 can screen uv light and or scavenge reactive radicals by serving as inner filters and or radical scavengers and thus may reduce the removal efficiency of target compounds lutze et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore understanding the influence of these constituents facilitates practical application of uv and uv aops to optimize the removal of contaminants kinetic modeling is a valuable tool for assessing the effects of water constituents and quantifying the efficiency of uv and uv aops xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 yao et al 2013 developed a steady state kinetic model which successfully predicted the impact of water constituents on ionophore antibiotics degradation by uv h2o2 and determined the optimal h2o2 dosage generally the degradation of organic contaminants by uv and uv aops can generate a series of intermediates products with increasing or decreasing toxicity yuan et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 identification of these intermediates products provides insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways of contaminants which is essential for risk assessment chen et al 2016 zhou et al 2017c up to now photochemical degradation of spd has been investigated by several researchers garcía galán et al 2012 2016 challis et al 2013 xu et al 2014 however little is currently known concerning the uv and uv pds based degradation of ssz and 5 asa therefore the main purpose of this contribution is 1 to investigate the efficacy of uv photolysis and uv pds advanced oxidation of ssz in aqueous solution 2 to compare the degradation efficiency of ssz with those of spd and 5 asa by both uv and uv pds processes 3 to develop a kinetic model to predict the degradation behavior of ssz by uv pds process and systematically investigate the influence of natural water constituents such as nom and hco3 and 4 to identify the intermediate products of ssz generated in the uv pds process and propose reaction pathways results obtained herein may provide useful information for applying uv and uv pds to degrade pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in natural water matrix 2 materials and methods 2 1

and lp hg lamp emission spectrum molar absorption coefficient ε λ represents the possibility that a compound absorbs light at a certain wavelength and thus undergoes photochemical reactions boreen et al 2003 schwarzenbach et al 2003 ε 254 nm values of ssz and its two metabolites spd and 5 asa were determined to be 5214 15241 and 753 m 1 cm 1 respectively fig 2 this observation suggests that ssz and its two metabolites may undergo direct photolysis upon uv 254 nm radiation ε 254 nm value of pds was found to be approximately 20 m 1 cm 1 consistent with previous studies xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 although ε 254 nm value of pds was lower compared with those of target compounds the concentration of pds applied in this study was comparatively high e g 1 mm and consequently a fraction of uv radiation would be absorbed by pds to produce so4 in the uv pds system therefore so4 mediated oxidation of ssz was likely to happen in the uv pds system see discussion below 3 2 direct photolysis of spd 5 asa and ssz 3 2 1 kinetics and mechanisms of direct photolysis after absorbing photons an organic compound can be excited to excited singlet state or triplet state that may undergo chemical reactions such as oxidation bond cleavage isomerization rearrangement etc fatta kassinos et al 2011 it was observed that direct photolysis of spd exposed to uv 254 nm was relatively fast fig 3 in agreement with its high molar absorption coefficient adsorption spectrum of spd shows two major absorption band centered at 261 and 309 nm see fig 2 corresponding to π π and n π transition respectively challis et al 2013 excitation of spd upon uv irradiation most likely generated an excited triplet state which has been reported to play an important role in the photodegradation of sulfonamides bearing six membered heterocyclic rings boreen et al 2005 challis et al 2013 despite a comparatively lower molar absorption coefficient 5 asa was susceptible to direct photolysis fig 3 implying a much higher quantum yield hydroxyl oh and amine nh2 substituents present in 5 asa molecule are electron donating groups capable of increasing electron density of the aromatic ring enabling the molecule more susceptible to excitation and more photoliable excited triplet state was proposed to be involved in the photodegradation of 5 substituted salicylic acid as evidenced recently by laser flash photolysis lfp analysis and density functional theory dft calculations tafer et al 2016 in contrast no measureable direct photolysis of ssz was observed upon uv irradiation fig 3 photostability of ssz was most likely due to the fact that excited ssz readily go back to ground state by transferring its energy to surrounding constituents such as dissolved oxygen transfer of energy from excited state of azo dyes to ground state of oxygen 3σg has been well recognized wang et al 2012 such process may lead to the formation of singlet oxygen 1 g 1o2 since the ssz molecule contains an azo group the energy transfer from excited ssz to dissolved oxygen is highly possible 3 2 2 quantum yield quantum yield φi represents the ratio of the total number of molecules of the compound photochemically transformed per total number of photons absorbed due to the compound s presence schwarzenbach et al 2003 pereira et al 2007a 2007b in a water solution containing only one solute its quantum yield can be calculated by eq 9 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 9 d c i d t e p 0 1 10 ε i c i z φ i where c i is the concentration of the specific compound m ε i is the molar absorption coefficient of the specific compound m 1 cm 1 dc dt represents the photodegradation rate of the specific compound m s 1 e p 0 and z are the same as described above according to the measured degradation rates of spd and 5 asa photolysis fig 3 their quantum yields were determined to be 8 6 0 8 10 3 and 2 4 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 respectively these values are comparable with other pharmaceuticals typically detected in natural waters such as sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine baeza and knappe 2011 wols and hofman caris 2012 the quantum yield of 5 asa was approximately 3 fold higher than that of spd which was in line with the above discussion the quantum yield of spd determined herein was ca 6 fold higher than that determined by challis et al 2013 using simulated solar irradiation i e 0 0013 0 0002 mol einstein 1 this suggests that uv 254 nm is more efficient than solar light for spd photolysis 3 2 3 photoproducts previous studies have demonstrated that spd was photoliable upon simulated solar irradiation leading to the formation of hydroxylated δ bond cleavage and so2 extrusion products challis et al 2013 garcía galán et al 2012 xu et al 2014 in this work photolysates of spd were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe and then subjected to lc ms ms analysis two products with molecular ion m h of m z 266 and 186 were identified sm fig s2 image 2 the product with m z 266 was 16 amu greater than spd m z 250 implying that it might be a hydroxylated spd ji et al 2017 ms2 spectrum of m z 266 showed two characteristic fragments corresponding to m z 172 and 124 which further confirmed that the hydroxylation should occur at the aromatic ring most likely at the ortho position with respect to the amino group sági et al 2015 another photoproduct of spd with m z 186 was proposed to be the so2 extrusion product 4 2 imino pyridin 1 2h yl aniline according to its ms2 fragmentation pattern fig s2 as well as by comparison with previous studies ji et al 2017 the photolysis of sulfonamides bearing six membered heterocyclic rings is known to generate so2 extrusion products through a smiles type rearrangement garcía galán et al 2012 challis et al 2013 such rearrangement leads to the formation of 4 2 imino pyridin 1 2h yl aniline when spd is photolyzed garcía galán et al 2012 challis et al 2013 ms analysis of the photoproducts of 5 asa revealed one intermediate with m z 155 data not shown which was confirmed to be 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid by hplc analysis using a commercially available reference standard cas no 490 79 9 sm fig s3 other intermediates products with low molecular weight e g ring opening products also likely formed tafer et al 2016 however their higher polarity might preclude their detection by spe lc ms ms due to their faster elution in the reversed phase c18 column 3 3 degradation of ssz by uv h2o2 and uv pds because ssz was resistant to direct uv photolysis the uv based aops including uv h2o2 and uv pds were investigated to evaluate their efficiency in the degradation of ssz peroxides such as h2o2 and pds are commonly utilized in combination with uv to produce free radicals with high reactivity i e ho and so4 in the present study appreciable degradation of ssz was observed in both uv h2o2 and uv pds systems with approximately 93 1 and 96 2 removal of ssz being achieved upon uv fluence of 900 mj cm 2 respectively fig 4 considering that direct photolysis of ssz was negligible such degradation should be solely attributed to oxidation by reactive radicals such as so4 the fuence based pseudo first order rate constants of transformation of ssz in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes were determined to be 0 0030 and 0 0038 cm2 mj 1 respectively apparently uv pds appeared to be more efficient than uv h2o2 for ssz degradation which can be ascribed to the higher quantum yield of so4 from pds photolysis φso4 1 4 than that of ho from h2o2 φho 1 0 antoniou et al 2010a khan et al 2014 zhou et al 2017a in addition the self recombination of so4 and the reaction of so4 with its precursor pds are much slower than that of ho r1 r4 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 therefore so4 is generated more efficiently in the uv pds system than ho in the uv h2o2 system antoniou and andersen 2015 consequently uv pds appeared to be more efficient for ssz elimination as compared to uv h2o2 process r1 s o 4

advanced oxidation of ssz 3 4 1 second order rate constant the second order rate constant for reaction of so4 with ssz k so4 ssz was determined to be 1 33 0 01 109 m 1s 1 by competition kinetic method sm text s2 and fig s4 khan et al 2013 xiao et al 2016 this value is near diffusion controlled limit indicating that ssz is susceptible to electrophilic attack by so4 3 4 2 effect of pds dosage experimental and modeling prediction no loss of ssz was observed in the presence of pds alone data not shown suggesting the importance of reactive radicals e g so4 to its degradation the degradation rate of ssz in the uv pds system increased appreciably with increasing concentration of pds fig 5 despite that excess of pds may enhance the operation cost and exacerbate undesirable side reactions r1 and r2 tistonaki et al 2010 the fluence based pseudo first order rate constant increased proportionally from 0 0004 to 0 0037 cm2 mj 1 as pds dosage increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mm sm fig s5 this suggests that side reactions if occurred had negligible impacts on the degradation of ssz thus unless otherwise stated the following experiments were conducted with initial pds concentration of 1 0 mm given that the incident photon irradiance of the uv lamp molar absorption coefficients of pds and ssz quantum yield of so4 as well as the second order rate constants of so4 reactions with pds and ssz are all known table s1 sm the degradation rate of ssz can be predicted by kinetic model developed in section 2 5 overall the model prediction agreed well with the experimental data lines in fig 5 which validated the assumption that so4 was the predominant reactive species responsible for the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process luo et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 this was also supported by experiments with radical scavengers to differentiate the predominant reactive radicals sm fig s1 note that at high pds concentration i e 0 5 and 1 0 mm the model prediction is slightly slower than experimental data the underpredicted transformation rate of ssz can be rationalized by following reasons first the concentration of pds during the reaction is assumed constant and equal to the initial concentrations in the kinetic model indeed peroxide concentrations should decrease as reaction progressed yao et al 2013 second the generation of ho by reactions of so4 with oh and or h2o r5 and r6 liang et al 2007 which was not incorporated into the kinetic model may also slightly contribute to the degradation of ssz r5 so 4 h 2 o ho so 4 2 h k h 2 o 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 r6 so 4 oh ho so 4 2 k 6 5 1 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 3 4 3 effects of natural water constituents the effects of nom and hco3 two typical natural water constituents on the degradation of ssz by the uv pds process were systematically investigated the presence of srfa that served as a surrogate of aquatic nom slowed the transformation rate of ssz appreciably fig 6 for example the uv fluence based rate constant of loss of ssz decreased from 0 0037 to 0 0029 cm2 mj 1 when 0 52 mgc l 1 as toc srfa was spiked the inhibitory effect was exacerbated as the concentration of srfa increased in the presence of 5 2 mgc l 1 srfa the rate constant further decreased by more than 80 0 0007 cm2 mj 1 this result can be rationalized by following reasons first srfa screened a fraction of light due to inner filter effect which hampered the photochemical formation of so4 from pds second srfa competitively reacted with so4 making it less available for reacting with ssz srfa molecule contains phenolic and carboxylic moieties that are vulnerable toward so4 attack via electron transfer and decarboxylation mechanisms lutze et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 the reaction rate constant between so4 and srfa k so4 srfa was determined to be 1 86 0 26 103 l mgc 1 s 1 by laser flash photolysis lfp approach in a recent study zhou et al 2017b the inhibitory effect of nom on the so4 mediated oxidation of organics has been extensively documented in literature and examples included atrazine sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen lutze et al 2015 ji et al 2015 kwon et al 2015 incorporating the light screening effect ε srfa c srfa and so4 scavenging effect

degradation in the presence of srfa as it can be seen the predicted transformation of ssz agrees well with the experimental data except that a slight overestimation is observed at higher concentration of srfa 5 2 mgc l 1 with the exception of light screening and radical scavenging effects the presence of srfa may also suppress the degradation of contaminants by aops through other mechanisms for example antioxidant moieties present in srfa molecule can serve as reductants that convert the radical intermediates of target compounds to their parent forms such back transformation effect was reported by canonica and co workers in the photosensitized degradation of aniline compounds wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2015 similar mechanism was also observed in the phenoloxidase and mno2 mediated oxidation of organic compounds during which radical intermediates were formed lu et al 2015 it is presumed that radical cation ssz a key intermediate formed during the transformation of ssz by so4 was reduced by srfa similarly r7 and r8 ji et al 2017 which was not considered in the above kinetic model production of more radical reactive dissolved organic carbon doc from srfa is another possible reason accounting for the slightly overestimated removal of ssz by kinetic modeling rosenfeldt and linden 2004 overall a combination of light screening radical scavenging and reduction effects of srfa suppressed the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process r7 so 4 ssz so 4 2 ssz r8 ssz srfa ssz srfa fig s6 shows that hco3 at low concentration e g 2 and 5 mm slightly promoted the degradation of ssz by uv pds and experimental data could be well predicted by the kinetic model eq 11 considering so4 scavenging effect of hco3 k so4 hco3 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 c hco3 0 10 mm lines in fig

thiol ethers larson and zepp 1988 huang and mabury 2000 canonica et al 2005 considering that ssz molecule contains several electron rich moieties including azo aniline and salicylic acid we speculate that co3 was involved in the degradation of ssz despite that the reactivity of co3 is relatively low the concentration of hco3 was much higher than that of ssz and therefore the steady state concentration of co3 in the uv pds system is expected to be several orders of magnitude higher than that of so4 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 2016 as a result the presence of hco3 could exhibit a positive effect on ssz degradation similar promoting effect of hco3 has previously been documented in the so4 based oxidation of sulfonamides ji et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 2016 however at higher concentration of hco3 i e 10 mm such promoting effect diminished which was likely due to the higher ionic strength huang et al 2002 3 5 identification of reactive sites in ssz molecule to obtain further insights into the mechanisms through which szz reacts with so4 the degradation of ssz was compared with that of spd and 5 asa in the uv pds system the fluence based rate constant of loss of these compounds followed the order of ssz 0 0037 cm2 mj 1 5 asa 0 0022 cm2 mj 1 spd 0 0014 cm2 mj 1 fig s7 sm while 5 asa and spd were susceptible to direct photolysis their degradation in the uv pds system could be mainly contributed to the reactions with so4 the fact that ssz was more vulnerable to degradation relative to 5 asa and spd suggests that the azo group was the main site responsible for the reactivity of ssz with so4 neta et al 1977 yao et al 2017 the above argument can be further validated by calculation of frontier electron densities feds as tabulated in table s2 sm according to frontier orbital theory positions with higher values of 2fed2 homo are more likely to be oxidized by electron extraction whereas positions with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo are more susceptible to electrophilic addition feng et al 2015 qu et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 table s2 shows that the 7n 17n 19c and 25o positions that possess higher 2fed2 homo values are more likely to be attacked by so4 through electron transfer however steric hindrance effect of adjacent so2 and cooh groups may enable 7n and 25o positions less favorable for so4 attack hence the azo group present in ssz appears to be the possible site vulnerable to electrophilic attack by so4 such oxidation can lead to the formation of nitrogen radical cations that undergo a series of reactions to form other intermediates and products anipsitakis et al 2006 this hypothesis is supported by the faster degradation rate of ssz than those of spd and 5 asa as well as the transformation products identified by lc ms ms discussed in detail below 3 6 transformation products and reaction pathways of ssz in uv pds process transformation products tps of ssz generated in the uv pds treatment was analyzed by spe lc ms ms table s3 sm total ion current chromatograms tic of the spe concentrated ssz degradation sample was shown in fig s8 a total of 4 tps were identified namely 4 2 imino pyridin 1 2h yl phenol m z 187 n 2 pyridinyl benzenesulfonamide m z 235 4 hydroxyl n 2 pyridinyl benzenesulfonamide m z 251 and the so2 extrusion product of ssz m z 335 5 4 2 pyridinylamino phenylazo salicyclic acid on the basis of the molecular structures of the tps and the radical chemistry of so4 the transformation pathways of ssz are depicted in fig 7 so4 initially attacked the azo group of ssz producing a nitrogen radical cation further hydrolysis of the nitrogen radical cation led to the products corresponding to m z 235 and 251 pathway a the product of m z 251 underwent smiles type rearrangement to give rise to the product of m z 187 such process was also found in the so4 based oxidation of spd ji et al 2017 not that m z 187 was also likely to be generated from m z 335 through azo bond cleavage induced by the electrophilic attack of so4 the n centered radical cation rendered the adjacent phenyl ring being positively charged via resonance effect i e the aromatic carbon α c adjacent to the sulfonamide was more positively charged which favored the nucleophilic attack of pyridine nitrogen such attack led to the intermolecular rearrangement smiles type and generated a so2 extrusion product pathway b fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 smiles type rearrangement followed by so2 extrusion has been well documented in the so4 based oxidation of sulfonamides bearing six membered heterocyclic rings fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 4 conclusions the results of this study can be summarized as follows direct photolysis of spd and 5 asa occurred upon uv 254 nm irradiation however ssz was found to be photostable the quantum yields of spd and 5 asa were determined to be 8 6 0 8 10 3 and 2 4 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 respectively photolysis of spd produced hydroxylated and so2 extrusion products one photoproduct identified for 5 asa direct photolysis was 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid uv h2o2 and uv pds could effectively degrade ssz with fluence based pseudo first order rate constants determined to be 0 0030 and 0 0038 cm2 mj 1 respectively second order rate constant between so4 and ssz was measured as 1 33 0 01 109 m 1s 1 by competition kinetic method a kinetic model was developed for predicting the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process increasing the dosage of pds significantly enhanced the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process which can be well predicted by kinetic modeling the presence of srfa inhibited the degradation of ssz and the inhibition was exacerbated with increasing concentration of srfa differently low concentration of hco3 slightly promoted the destruction of ssz the azo functional group of ssz molecule was predicted as the reactive site toward so4 attack by frontier electron densities calculation as well as by comparing the degradation of ssz with spd and 5 asa four intermediate products of ssz were identified by spe lc ms ms transformation pathways of ssz in the uv pds process included azo bond cleavage smiles type rearrangement followed by so2 extrusion

processes miao et al 2004 göbel et al 2005 while environmental relevant concentrations of ssz and its metabolites typically range from nanogram per liter to microgram per liter göbel et al 2005 kasprzyk hordern et al 2008 their occurrence can cause subtle chronic and unpredicted effects on aquatic organisms and ecosystem schwarzenbach et al 2006 for example ssz can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species ros resulting in damage to proteins nucleic acids and cell membranes of aquatic organisms linares et al 2011 therefore cost effective and environmentally friendly treatment technologies are highly desirable for elimination of ssz and its metabolites from aqueous solutions minimizing potential risks associated with these compounds fan et al 2011 uv based technologies are widely applied in water and wastewater treatment for both disinfection and oxidation purpose pereira et al 2007a canonica et al 2008 fatta kassinos et al 2011 uv photolysis alone is capable of inactivating pathogenic bacteria viruses and protozoa by photochemical modification of genetic materials of the cell deoxyribonucleic acid dna or ribonucleic acid rna mamane et al 2007 uv radiation can also induce direct photodegradation of organic contaminants however such process highly depends on irradiation intensity as well as absorption behavior and quantum yield of the target compounds schwarzenbach et al 2003 fatta kassinos et al 2011 when combined with peroxides such as peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv radiation can generates highly reactive radicals e g sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical ho via homolytic cleavage of peroxide bond anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 antoniou et al 2010a both so4 and ho have high standard redox potentials so4 2 5 3 1 v ho 1 8 2 7 v and can destruct a broad range of organic compounds with second order rate constants typically ranging from 106 to 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 pignatello et al 2006 tistonaki et al 2010 such uv peroxide processes also known as uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops attract growing interest in water treatment engineering early studies have reported high efficiency of uv photolysis and uv aops for removing of various organic contaminants in water and wastewater such as herbicides khan et al 2013 2014 luo et al 2016 lutze et al 2015 pesticides shah et al 2013 khan et al 2016 endocrine disrupting chemicals lau et al 2007 sharma et al 2015 pharmaceuticals duan et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 deng et al 2013 tan et al 2013 kwon et al 2015 cyanotoxins antoniou et al 2010a 2010b he et al 2013 2014 and odor and taste causing compounds xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 uv based technologies bear several advantages over conventional water treatment processes such as coagulation and chlorination because there are no disinfection by products dbps formation chemical free and no sludge production anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 antoniou et al 2010a in particular uv pds appears to be more efficient for eliminating organic contaminants due to its high quantum yield of so4 1 4 1 8 for pds and 1 0 for h2o2 at 254 nm khan et al 2013 xiao et al 2016 in addition so4 is a single electron oxidant that reacts selectively with organics predominantly through electron transfer mechanism neta et al 1977 1988 enabling uv pds process more suitable for destruction of certain recalcitrant contaminants such as perfluorooctanoic acid qian et al 2016 naturally occurring species in waters have significant impacts on uv and uv aops wols et al 2013 lutze et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 these species such as natural organic matter nom and bicarbonate hco3 can screen uv light and or scavenge reactive radicals by serving as inner filters and or radical scavengers and thus may reduce the removal efficiency of target compounds lutze et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 therefore understanding the influence of these constituents facilitates practical application of uv and uv aops to optimize the removal of contaminants kinetic modeling is a valuable tool for assessing the effects of water constituents and quantifying the efficiency of uv and uv aops xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 yao et al 2013 developed a steady state kinetic model which successfully predicted the impact of water constituents on ionophore antibiotics degradation by uv h2o2 and determined the optimal h2o2 dosage generally the degradation of organic contaminants by uv and uv aops can generate a series of intermediates products with increasing or decreasing toxicity yuan et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 identification of these intermediates products provides insights into the reaction mechanisms and pathways of contaminants which is essential for risk assessment chen et al 2016 zhou et al 2017c up to now photochemical degradation of spd has been investigated by several researchers garcía galán et al 2012 2016 challis et al 2013 xu et al 2014 however little is currently known concerning the uv and uv pds based degradation of ssz and 5 asa therefore the main purpose of this contribution is 1 to investigate the efficacy of uv photolysis and uv pds advanced oxidation of ssz in aqueous solution 2 to compare the degradation efficiency of ssz with those of spd and 5 asa by both uv and uv pds processes 3 to develop a kinetic model to predict the degradation behavior of ssz by uv pds process and systematically investigate the influence of natural water constituents such as nom and hco3 and 4 to identify the intermediate products of ssz generated in the uv pds process and propose reaction pathways results obtained herein may provide useful information for applying uv and uv pds to degrade pharmaceuticals and their metabolites in natural water matrix 2 materials and methods 2 1

and lp hg lamp emission spectrum molar absorption coefficient ε λ represents the possibility that a compound absorbs light at a certain wavelength and thus undergoes photochemical reactions boreen et al 2003 schwarzenbach et al 2003 ε 254 nm values of ssz and its two metabolites spd and 5 asa were determined to be 5214 15241 and 753 m 1 cm 1 respectively fig 2 this observation suggests that ssz and its two metabolites may undergo direct photolysis upon uv 254 nm radiation ε 254 nm value of pds was found to be approximately 20 m 1 cm 1 consistent with previous studies xie et al 2015 luo et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 although ε 254 nm value of pds was lower compared with those of target compounds the concentration of pds applied in this study was comparatively high e g 1 mm and consequently a fraction of uv radiation would be absorbed by pds to produce so4 in the uv pds system therefore so4 mediated oxidation of ssz was likely to happen in the uv pds system see discussion below 3 2 direct photolysis of spd 5 asa and ssz 3 2 1 kinetics and mechanisms of direct photolysis after absorbing photons an organic compound can be excited to excited singlet state or triplet state that may undergo chemical reactions such as oxidation bond cleavage isomerization rearrangement etc fatta kassinos et al 2011 it was observed that direct photolysis of spd exposed to uv 254 nm was relatively fast fig 3 in agreement with its high molar absorption coefficient adsorption spectrum of spd shows two major absorption band centered at 261 and 309 nm see fig 2 corresponding to π π and n π transition respectively challis et al 2013 excitation of spd upon uv irradiation most likely generated an excited triplet state which has been reported to play an important role in the photodegradation of sulfonamides bearing six membered heterocyclic rings boreen et al 2005 challis et al 2013 despite a comparatively lower molar absorption coefficient 5 asa was susceptible to direct photolysis fig 3 implying a much higher quantum yield hydroxyl oh and amine nh2 substituents present in 5 asa molecule are electron donating groups capable of increasing electron density of the aromatic ring enabling the molecule more susceptible to excitation and more photoliable excited triplet state was proposed to be involved in the photodegradation of 5 substituted salicylic acid as evidenced recently by laser flash photolysis lfp analysis and density functional theory dft calculations tafer et al 2016 in contrast no measureable direct photolysis of ssz was observed upon uv irradiation fig 3 photostability of ssz was most likely due to the fact that excited ssz readily go back to ground state by transferring its energy to surrounding constituents such as dissolved oxygen transfer of energy from excited state of azo dyes to ground state of oxygen 3σg has been well recognized wang et al 2012 such process may lead to the formation of singlet oxygen 1 g 1o2 since the ssz molecule contains an azo group the energy transfer from excited ssz to dissolved oxygen is highly possible 3 2 2 quantum yield quantum yield φi represents the ratio of the total number of molecules of the compound photochemically transformed per total number of photons absorbed due to the compound s presence schwarzenbach et al 2003 pereira et al 2007a 2007b in a water solution containing only one solute its quantum yield can be calculated by eq 9 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 9 d c i d t e p 0 1 10 ε i c i z φ i where c i is the concentration of the specific compound m ε i is the molar absorption coefficient of the specific compound m 1 cm 1 dc dt represents the photodegradation rate of the specific compound m s 1 e p 0 and z are the same as described above according to the measured degradation rates of spd and 5 asa photolysis fig 3 their quantum yields were determined to be 8 6 0 8 10 3 and 2 4 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 respectively these values are comparable with other pharmaceuticals typically detected in natural waters such as sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine baeza and knappe 2011 wols and hofman caris 2012 the quantum yield of 5 asa was approximately 3 fold higher than that of spd which was in line with the above discussion the quantum yield of spd determined herein was ca 6 fold higher than that determined by challis et al 2013 using simulated solar irradiation i e 0 0013 0 0002 mol einstein 1 this suggests that uv 254 nm is more efficient than solar light for spd photolysis 3 2 3 photoproducts previous studies have demonstrated that spd was photoliable upon simulated solar irradiation leading to the formation of hydroxylated δ bond cleavage and so2 extrusion products challis et al 2013 garcía galán et al 2012 xu et al 2014 in this work photolysates of spd were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe and then subjected to lc ms ms analysis two products with molecular ion m h of m z 266 and 186 were identified sm fig s2 image 2 the product with m z 266 was 16 amu greater than spd m z 250 implying that it might be a hydroxylated spd ji et al 2017 ms2 spectrum of m z 266 showed two characteristic fragments corresponding to m z 172 and 124 which further confirmed that the hydroxylation should occur at the aromatic ring most likely at the ortho position with respect to the amino group sági et al 2015 another photoproduct of spd with m z 186 was proposed to be the so2 extrusion product 4 2 imino pyridin 1 2h yl aniline according to its ms2 fragmentation pattern fig s2 as well as by comparison with previous studies ji et al 2017 the photolysis of sulfonamides bearing six membered heterocyclic rings is known to generate so2 extrusion products through a smiles type rearrangement garcía galán et al 2012 challis et al 2013 such rearrangement leads to the formation of 4 2 imino pyridin 1 2h yl aniline when spd is photolyzed garcía galán et al 2012 challis et al 2013 ms analysis of the photoproducts of 5 asa revealed one intermediate with m z 155 data not shown which was confirmed to be 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid by hplc analysis using a commercially available reference standard cas no 490 79 9 sm fig s3 other intermediates products with low molecular weight e g ring opening products also likely formed tafer et al 2016 however their higher polarity might preclude their detection by spe lc ms ms due to their faster elution in the reversed phase c18 column 3 3 degradation of ssz by uv h2o2 and uv pds because ssz was resistant to direct uv photolysis the uv based aops including uv h2o2 and uv pds were investigated to evaluate their efficiency in the degradation of ssz peroxides such as h2o2 and pds are commonly utilized in combination with uv to produce free radicals with high reactivity i e ho and so4 in the present study appreciable degradation of ssz was observed in both uv h2o2 and uv pds systems with approximately 93 1 and 96 2 removal of ssz being achieved upon uv fluence of 900 mj cm 2 respectively fig 4 considering that direct photolysis of ssz was negligible such degradation should be solely attributed to oxidation by reactive radicals such as so4 the fuence based pseudo first order rate constants of transformation of ssz in the uv h2o2 and uv pds processes were determined to be 0 0030 and 0 0038 cm2 mj 1 respectively apparently uv pds appeared to be more efficient than uv h2o2 for ssz degradation which can be ascribed to the higher quantum yield of so4 from pds photolysis φso4 1 4 than that of ho from h2o2 φho 1 0 antoniou et al 2010a khan et al 2014 zhou et al 2017a in addition the self recombination of so4 and the reaction of so4 with its precursor pds are much slower than that of ho r1 r4 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 therefore so4 is generated more efficiently in the uv pds system than ho in the uv h2o2 system antoniou and andersen 2015 consequently uv pds appeared to be more efficient for ssz elimination as compared to uv h2o2 process r1 s o 4

advanced oxidation of ssz 3 4 1 second order rate constant the second order rate constant for reaction of so4 with ssz k so4 ssz was determined to be 1 33 0 01 109 m 1s 1 by competition kinetic method sm text s2 and fig s4 khan et al 2013 xiao et al 2016 this value is near diffusion controlled limit indicating that ssz is susceptible to electrophilic attack by so4 3 4 2 effect of pds dosage experimental and modeling prediction no loss of ssz was observed in the presence of pds alone data not shown suggesting the importance of reactive radicals e g so4 to its degradation the degradation rate of ssz in the uv pds system increased appreciably with increasing concentration of pds fig 5 despite that excess of pds may enhance the operation cost and exacerbate undesirable side reactions r1 and r2 tistonaki et al 2010 the fluence based pseudo first order rate constant increased proportionally from 0 0004 to 0 0037 cm2 mj 1 as pds dosage increased from 0 1 to 1 0 mm sm fig s5 this suggests that side reactions if occurred had negligible impacts on the degradation of ssz thus unless otherwise stated the following experiments were conducted with initial pds concentration of 1 0 mm given that the incident photon irradiance of the uv lamp molar absorption coefficients of pds and ssz quantum yield of so4 as well as the second order rate constants of so4 reactions with pds and ssz are all known table s1 sm the degradation rate of ssz can be predicted by kinetic model developed in section 2 5 overall the model prediction agreed well with the experimental data lines in fig 5 which validated the assumption that so4 was the predominant reactive species responsible for the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process luo et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 this was also supported by experiments with radical scavengers to differentiate the predominant reactive radicals sm fig s1 note that at high pds concentration i e 0 5 and 1 0 mm the model prediction is slightly slower than experimental data the underpredicted transformation rate of ssz can be rationalized by following reasons first the concentration of pds during the reaction is assumed constant and equal to the initial concentrations in the kinetic model indeed peroxide concentrations should decrease as reaction progressed yao et al 2013 second the generation of ho by reactions of so4 with oh and or h2o r5 and r6 liang et al 2007 which was not incorporated into the kinetic model may also slightly contribute to the degradation of ssz r5 so 4 h 2 o ho so 4 2 h k h 2 o 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 r6 so 4 oh ho so 4 2 k 6 5 1 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 3 4 3 effects of natural water constituents the effects of nom and hco3 two typical natural water constituents on the degradation of ssz by the uv pds process were systematically investigated the presence of srfa that served as a surrogate of aquatic nom slowed the transformation rate of ssz appreciably fig 6 for example the uv fluence based rate constant of loss of ssz decreased from 0 0037 to 0 0029 cm2 mj 1 when 0 52 mgc l 1 as toc srfa was spiked the inhibitory effect was exacerbated as the concentration of srfa increased in the presence of 5 2 mgc l 1 srfa the rate constant further decreased by more than 80 0 0007 cm2 mj 1 this result can be rationalized by following reasons first srfa screened a fraction of light due to inner filter effect which hampered the photochemical formation of so4 from pds second srfa competitively reacted with so4 making it less available for reacting with ssz srfa molecule contains phenolic and carboxylic moieties that are vulnerable toward so4 attack via electron transfer and decarboxylation mechanisms lutze et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 the reaction rate constant between so4 and srfa k so4 srfa was determined to be 1 86 0 26 103 l mgc 1 s 1 by laser flash photolysis lfp approach in a recent study zhou et al 2017b the inhibitory effect of nom on the so4 mediated oxidation of organics has been extensively documented in literature and examples included atrazine sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen lutze et al 2015 ji et al 2015 kwon et al 2015 incorporating the light screening effect ε srfa c srfa and so4 scavenging effect k so4 srfa c srfa into eq 8 yields equation of the degradation rate of ssz in the uv pds process in the presence of srfa eq 10 10 d c ssz d t k s o 4 ssz e p 0 φ pds ε pds c pds c ssz 1 1 0 ε ssz c

degradation in the presence of srfa as it can be seen the predicted transformation of ssz agrees well with the experimental data except that a slight overestimation is observed at higher concentration of srfa 5 2 mgc l 1 with the exception of light screening and radical scavenging effects the presence of srfa may also suppress the degradation of contaminants by aops through other mechanisms for example antioxidant moieties present in srfa molecule can serve as reductants that convert the radical intermediates of target compounds to their parent forms such back transformation effect was reported by canonica and co workers in the photosensitized degradation of aniline compounds wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2015 similar mechanism was also observed in the phenoloxidase and mno2 mediated oxidation of organic compounds during which radical intermediates were formed lu et al 2015 it is presumed that radical cation ssz a key intermediate formed during the transformation of ssz by so4 was reduced by srfa similarly r7 and r8 ji et al 2017 which was not considered in the above kinetic model production of more radical reactive dissolved organic carbon doc from srfa is another possible reason accounting for the slightly overestimated removal of ssz by kinetic modeling rosenfeldt and linden 2004 overall a combination of light screening radical scavenging and reduction effects of srfa suppressed the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process r7 so 4 ssz so 4 2 ssz r8 ssz srfa ssz srfa fig s6 shows that hco3 at low concentration e g 2 and 5 mm slightly promoted the degradation of ssz by uv pds and experimental data could be well predicted by the kinetic model eq 11 considering so4 scavenging effect of hco3 k so4 hco3 1 6 106 m 1 s 1 c hco3 0 10 mm lines in fig

thiol ethers larson and zepp 1988 huang and mabury 2000 canonica et al 2005 considering that ssz molecule contains several electron rich moieties including azo aniline and salicylic acid we speculate that co3 was involved in the degradation of ssz despite that the reactivity of co3 is relatively low the concentration of hco3 was much higher than that of ssz and therefore the steady state concentration of co3 in the uv pds system is expected to be several orders of magnitude higher than that of so4 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 2016 as a result the presence of hco3 could exhibit a positive effect on ssz degradation similar promoting effect of hco3 has previously been documented in the so4 based oxidation of sulfonamides ji et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 2016 however at higher concentration of hco3 i e 10 mm such promoting effect diminished which was likely due to the higher ionic strength huang et al 2002 3 5 identification of reactive sites in ssz molecule to obtain further insights into the mechanisms through which szz reacts with so4 the degradation of ssz was compared with that of spd and 5 asa in the uv pds system the fluence based rate constant of loss of these compounds followed the order of ssz 0 0037 cm2 mj 1 5 asa 0 0022 cm2 mj 1 spd 0 0014 cm2 mj 1 fig s7 sm while 5 asa and spd were susceptible to direct photolysis their degradation in the uv pds system could be mainly contributed to the reactions with so4 the fact that ssz was more vulnerable to degradation relative to 5 asa and spd suggests that the azo group was the main site responsible for the reactivity of ssz with so4 neta et al 1977 yao et al 2017 the above argument can be further validated by calculation of frontier electron densities feds as tabulated in table s2 sm according to frontier orbital theory positions with higher values of 2fed2 homo are more likely to be oxidized by electron extraction whereas positions with higher values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo are more susceptible to electrophilic addition feng et al 2015 qu et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 table s2 shows that the 7n 17n 19c and 25o positions that possess higher 2fed2 homo values are more likely to be attacked by so4 through electron transfer however steric hindrance effect of adjacent so2 and cooh groups may enable 7n and 25o positions less favorable for so4 attack hence the azo group present in ssz appears to be the possible site vulnerable to electrophilic attack by so4 such oxidation can lead to the formation of nitrogen radical cations that undergo a series of reactions to form other intermediates and products anipsitakis et al 2006 this hypothesis is supported by the faster degradation rate of ssz than those of spd and 5 asa as well as the transformation products identified by lc ms ms discussed in detail below 3 6 transformation products and reaction pathways of ssz in uv pds process transformation products tps of ssz generated in the uv pds treatment was analyzed by spe lc ms ms table s3 sm total ion current chromatograms tic of the spe concentrated ssz degradation sample was shown in fig s8 a total of 4 tps were identified namely 4 2 imino pyridin 1 2h yl phenol m z 187 n 2 pyridinyl benzenesulfonamide m z 235 4 hydroxyl n 2 pyridinyl benzenesulfonamide m z 251 and the so2 extrusion product of ssz m z 335 5 4 2 pyridinylamino phenylazo salicyclic acid on the basis of the molecular structures of the tps and the radical chemistry of so4 the transformation pathways of ssz are depicted in fig 7 so4 initially attacked the azo group of ssz producing a nitrogen radical cation further hydrolysis of the nitrogen radical cation led to the products corresponding to m z 235 and 251 pathway a the product of m z 251 underwent smiles type rearrangement to give rise to the product of m z 187 such process was also found in the so4 based oxidation of spd ji et al 2017 not that m z 187 was also likely to be generated from m z 335 through azo bond cleavage induced by the electrophilic attack of so4 the n centered radical cation rendered the adjacent phenyl ring being positively charged via resonance effect i e the aromatic carbon α c adjacent to the sulfonamide was more positively charged which favored the nucleophilic attack of pyridine nitrogen such attack led to the intermolecular rearrangement smiles type and generated a so2 extrusion product pathway b fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 smiles type rearrangement followed by so2 extrusion has been well documented in the so4 based oxidation of sulfonamides bearing six membered heterocyclic rings fan et al 2015 ji et al 2017 4 conclusions the results of this study can be summarized as follows direct photolysis of spd and 5 asa occurred upon uv 254 nm irradiation however ssz was found to be photostable the quantum yields of spd and 5 asa were determined to be 8 6 0 8 10 3 and 2 4 0 1 10 2 mol einstein 1 respectively photolysis of spd produced hydroxylated and so2 extrusion products one photoproduct identified for 5 asa direct photolysis was 2 5 dihydroxybenzoic acid uv h2o2 and uv pds could effectively degrade ssz with fluence based pseudo first order rate constants determined to be 0 0030 and 0 0038 cm2 mj 1 respectively second order rate constant between so4 and ssz was measured as 1 33 0 01 109 m 1s 1 by competition kinetic method a kinetic model was developed for predicting the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process increasing the dosage of pds significantly enhanced the degradation of ssz in the uv pds process which can be well predicted by kinetic modeling the presence of srfa inhibited the degradation of ssz and the inhibition was exacerbated with increasing concentration of srfa differently low concentration of hco3 slightly promoted the destruction of ssz the azo functional group of ssz molecule was predicted as the reactive site toward so4 attack by frontier electron densities calculation as well as by comparing the degradation of ssz with spd and 5 asa four intermediate products of ssz were identified by spe lc ms ms transformation pathways of ssz in the uv pds process included azo bond cleavage smiles type rearrangement followed by so2 extrusion

19739,in this study a fixed bed biofiltration system biofilter that utilized indigenous microorganisms was developed for the reclamation of oil sands process affected water ospw with the assistance of quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm indigenous microorganisms from ospw were able to attach to the surface of sand media and form biofilms the number of total bacteria on the biofilter media reached a steady state 109 g after 23 days of operation ultra performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry uplc hrms analysis showed that 21 8 of the classical naphthenic acids nas removal was achieved through the circulation of raw ospw on the biofilter for 8 times equivalent to a hydraulic retention time of 16 h when ozonation with utilized ozone dose of 30 mg l was applied as pretreatment the classical nas in the ozonated ospw were removed by 89 3 with an accelerated biodegradation rate of 0 5 mg l h compared with other biofilm reactors such as moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr ozonation pretreatment could benefit the biodegradation of nas in the biofilter more classical na removal 89 3 vs 34 4 especially for those with high carbon number and cyclicity the combined ozonation biofiltration process could remove 92 7 of classical nas from raw ospw in 16 h although both ozonation and biofiltration alone did not show degradation of oxidized nas from raw ospw the combined process led to a 52 9 and 42 6 removal for o3 nas and o4 nas respectively which were the dominant oxidized na species in ospw metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that rhodococcus was the dominant bacterial genus on the sand media which may play a crucial role during the na biodegradation with the advantage of high na removal efficiency the combined ozonation biofiltration process is a promising approach for na degradation and shows high potential to be scaled up for in situ ospw treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil sands process affected water naphthenic acids biofiltration metagenomic analysis ozonation 1 introduction canada has been recognized as the country with the third largest oil reserves in the world which has more than 169 billion barrels of recoverable bitumen deposit in athabasca northern alberta brown and ulrich 2015 teare et al 2012 it was estimated that 5 4 percent of the initial established crude bitumen reserves have been produced and the bitumen production is supposed to reach 4 1 million barrels per day by 2023 teare et al 2014 the caustic hot water extraction process was applied for the extraction of bitumen from the oil sands and the wastewater generated from the extraction and following upgrading process was referred as the oil sands process affected water ospw brown and ulrich 2015 wang et al 2016a a large amount of toxic ospw has been generated and the volume is keeping on increasing with the expansion of the bitumen production the accumulation of huge amount of ospw in tailing ponds has shown serious threat to local surface and groundwater quality through the contamination of toxic compounds hodson 2013 pramanik 2016 ospw is a complex mixture of inorganic and organic compounds which shows toxic effect to a wide range of organisms such as algae fishes amphibians birds and mammals garcia garcia et al 2011 gentes et al 2007 goff et al 2013 he et al 2012 melvin et al 2013 reuse of the tailing water for bitumen extraction can reduce the demand for fresh water but can also lead to an increase of ospw toxicity due to the accumulation of toxic compounds allen 2008 therefore technically practicable and economically feasible ospw remediation methods need to be established urgently brown and ulrich 2015 pramanik 2016 naphthenic acids nas are considered as one of the main toxic constituents in ospw zhang et al 2011 nas are a mixture of alkyl substituted acyclic and cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids with a general chemical formula of cnh2n zox where n is the number of carbon atoms 7 n 26 z specifies the hydrogen deficiency due to the formation of ring or double bond structure 0 z 18 and x indicates the number of oxygen atoms present in the nas huang et al 2016a wang et al 2016b classical nas which possesses two oxygen atoms o2 nas has been regarded as the most toxic nas from the ospw morandi et al 2015 because the increase of hydrophilicity the oxidized nas which possess more oxygen atoms show less toxicity he et al 2010 therefore the removal of classical nas is considered critical for the ospw remediation as such the removal of classical nas has been used as one of the parameters for the evaluation of the ospw treatment methods huang et al 2015 in recent years studies have been conducted to develop ospw treatment methods though none of them have been tested at the full scale level huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 xue et al 2016b the ospw treatment can basically be divided into physical chemical biological methods as an example of physical treatment method petroleum coke adsorption can remove 91 of acid extractable fraction aef and 84 of nas from ospw and its toxicity toward vibrio fischeri can be reduced from 4 3 to 1 1 toxicity units gamal el din et al 2011 chemical ospw treatment methods such as ozonation can effectively remove the fluorescing aromatics sulfur containing nas and classical nas at the dose of 2 0 mm wang et al 2016b compared with physical and chemical processes biological processes are usually less effective for ospw treatment nevertheless they are economical energy efficient and environmentally sound approaches for large scale applications sediment microorganisms such as pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas fluorescens showed high degradation effect on a commercial mixture of nas and they could also reduce the toxicity of ospw through the biodegradation of aromatic compounds del rio et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 however our previous studies showed that nas cannot be considerably removed by suspended growth biological treatment processes zhang et al 2015 compared with suspended growth systems the attached growth systems are supposed to benefit microorganisms for the better adaption to the harsh conditions and faster degradation of organic compounds due to the cooperation of microorganisms with metabolic diversity by adding biofilm carriers into the ospw the attached growth biological treatment approach can remove the nas by 34 8 43 1 huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 previous research has demonstrated the bio persistence of nas with extensive cyclical molecular structures han et al 2008 indicating that pretreatment is necessary to improve the biodegradability of ospw it has been demonstrated that low dose ozone could improve the biodegradability of ospw by breaking nas with high cyclicity and long carbon chains martin et al 2010 ozonation combined biological treatment has been successfully developed and applied for ospw remediation huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 through the ozonation pretreatment the aef and na removals in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr were improved from 18 3 to 41 0 and from 34 8 to 78 8 respectively shi et al 2015 similar results were also observed by using integrated fixed film activated sludge reactors ifas and membrane bioreactors for ospw treatment huang et al 2015 xue et al 2016b however it was observed that the ozonation pretreatment itself contributed to the most na removal while it did not substantially facilitate the na removal rate in the bioreactors additionally long hydraulic retention time hrt requirement and high aeration cost of those bioreactors also limit their applications at large scale with the advantages of robustness ease and simplicity of construction and low energy input biofiltration has been widely used for water and wastewater treatment kang et al 2007 reungoat et al 2011 saminathan et al 2013 reungoat et al 2011 found that biofiltration can remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products by more than 90 and reduce the toxicity of wastewater by 28 68 in another study circulation biofilter was determined as a robust process for the degradation of pharmaceutically active compounds with a removal of 92 99 89 99 and 62 92 for ibuprofen naproxen and gemfibrozil respectively krkosek et al 2014 recently a fixed bed biofilm reactor showed high efficiency on the biodegradation of methyl tertiary butyl ether which is a recalcitrant organic compound causing groundwater contamination alfonso gordillo et al 2016 fixed bed biofilm reactors have been shown to more efficiently remove various compounds compared to mbbr choi et al 2012 however the remediation of ospw by using biofiltration process has not been investigated until now with the application of low cost natural materials and consuming low energy mild ozonation pretreatment moderate ozone dose followed by biofiltration may be a promising approach for ospw treatment which can be easily scaled up and applied by the industry in this research circulating fixed bed biofilters were established by using indigenous microorganisms from ospw in order to avoid unnecessary expenditure of chemicals and energy thereby lowering the operating cost an ozone dose of 30 mg l was used for the pretreatment of ospw prior to biofiltration our previous study has demonstrated that the nas showed a sharp decrease after ozonation up to about 50 mg l and ozone dose of 30 mg l led to the maximal toxicity reduction dong et al 2015 wang et al 2013 and ozone dose of 30 mg l could also result in the minimal mineralization during the pretreatment stage the main objective of this study was to confirm the feasibility of biofiltration process in ospw remediation and to investigate the benefit of mild ozonation pretreatment on the biofiltration performance the na removal efficiency of the biofiltration and the combined processes was investigated the impact of circulation times on the removal of classical and oxidized nas was also analyzed dominant bacteria related to na degradation were determined through the analysis of the microbial community by using the next generation sequencing technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of ospw ospw samples were taken from an active oil sands tailings pond in fort mcmurray alberta canada ospw was stored in 200 l polyvinyl chloride barrels at 4 c prior to be used in this study within one year of collection characteristics of ospw were analyzed periodically to ensure the representativeness of ospw after storage the physicochemical parameters of raw ospw were shown in table s1 2 2 ozonation briefly high purity oxygen was used for the production of ozone by an ozone generator gso 40 wedeco herford germany by using a gas diffuser and stir mixer ozone could be well mixed within the water sample with the volume of 4 l ozone monitors hc500 ozone monitor wedeco usa were used to monitor the ozone concentrations in feed and off gas lines and a wet test meter precision scientific petroleum instruments texas usa was used to continuously measure the flow rate of feed and off gas lines the concentration of ozone residual in the water samples was monitored by using the indigo method after the ozonation treatment the ozone residual in the water was removed by purging with purified nitrogen gas for 5 min gamal el din et al 2011 huang et al 2015 the utilized ozone dose of 30 mg l was calculated through the integration of the amount of used ozone minus the amount of the residual ozone 2 3 configuration and operation of the biofilters duplicate glass columns 25 mm internal diameter and 15 cm bed depth were served as biofilters the polyethylene terephthalate pet disk was set at the bottom to hold the media inside the bioreactor pure sand acros organics new jersey usa with the size of 40 100 mesh was used as media in order to support the colonization of indigenous microorganisms in the biofilters the reactors were fed with raw ospw at a flow rate of 0 61 ml min the biofilters were operated at room temperature biodegradation of raw and ozonated ospws was implemented by circulating ospw through the biofilter with an empty bed contact time of 120 min the treated ospw samples were taken for water quality analyses after 4 and 8 circulation times the untreated raw ospw was collected and used as control 2 4 water chemistry analyses raw ozonated and treated ospw samples were collected for water chemistry analyses chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by using the hach tnt test tube method tnt821 hach colorado usa aef was quantified using a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy method jivraj et al 1995 briefly 25 ml of water sample was filtered by using a nylon membrane filter with the pore size of 0 45 μm and acidified to ph 2 2 5 optima grade dichloromethane dcm was used for the extraction after evaporation the extracted aef was then dissolved in dcm with known mass ftir spectrometry perkinelmer on ca was used to measure aef by recording the absorbance of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the carboxylic groups at 1743 and 1706 cm 1 the cod and aef tests were all performed in duplicate the profiles of the nas present in different ospw samples were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry uplc tofms huang et al 2015 xue et al 2016b in brief 10 ml of water sample was collected and filtered by using nylon membrane filter with the pore size of 0 22 μm 0 5 ml of filtered water sample was mixed with 0 4 ml of methanol and 0 1 ml of myristic acid 1 13c 4 0 mg l which was used as internal standard waters uplc phenyl beh column 1 7 μm 150 mm 1 mm was used for the liquid chromatographic separation 10 mm ammonium acetate in water a and 10 mm ammonium acetate in a 50 50 methanol acetonitrile mixture b were used as the mobile phases and the elution gradient was 0 2 min 1 b 2 3 min 60 b 3 7 min 70 b 7 13 min 95 b 13 14 min back to 1 b and hold to 20 min to equilibrate the column at a flow rate of 100 μl min the temperature of the column and the sample was set at 50 c and 10 c with the electrospray ionization esi source operating in negative ion mode and tof analyzer in high resolution mode mass resolution of 40000 at m z 1431 the samples were further analyzed with a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer synapt g2 waters milford ma usa huang et al 2016a the ion mobility spectrometry ims was also conducted in a tri wave ion mobility cell by using pure nitrogen 99 as the drift gas to separate and identify different na species targetlynx ver 4 1 software was used to analyze the data for target compounds huang et al 2016b 2 5 microbial characterization the microbial samples for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr analyses were collected from the top of the fixed bed biofilm reactor which was within 1 cm of the depth of the sand media and tested for three times after staining the sand samples with syto 9 and cona conjugated with texas red molecular probes invitrogen clsm zeiss lsm 710 carl zeiss micro imaging gmbh germany was performed to characterize the distribution of deposited microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substance eps on sand media xue et al 2016a powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc ca usa was used for bacterial dna extraction from sand media 0 25 g according to the manufacturer instructions the extracted dna samples were then used for the qpcr analysis to quantify the total bacteria on the sand media zhang et al 2016 moreover illumina miseq sequencing was used to further understand the microbial communities related to ospw biodegradation on the sand media as described previously huang et al 2017 after the raw and ozonated ospw treatment the sand samples for microbial community analysis were also collected from the top level of the fixed bed biofilm reactor and used for 16s metagenomic sequencing after dna extraction more details about the microbial analysis are described in the supporting information si 3 results and discussions 3 1 the development of biofilm in biofilter raw ospw was used as feed for the development of indigenous microorganisms based biofilm on the sand media of the biofilter through monitoring the growth of total bacteria on the sand by qpcr it was found that the biofiltration system reached a relatively steady state after 23 days of operation with 3 3 0 8 109 copies g total bacteria on the sand media fig 1 a these results showed that indigenous microorganisms from raw ospw were able to attach to the surface of the sand media and form biofilm our previous study showed that a bacteria density of 109 copies g granular activated carbon gac could be reached after 30 days operation in fed batch biofilm reactors islam et al 2015 considering the much lower surface area and higher specific gravity of sand media compared with gac denser biofilm was formed on the unit area of sand media which may benefit the ospw degradation the results also indicated that the microorganisms could form biofilm more efficiently on the fixed bed media compared to moving bed media suspended gac in the fed batch reactors which was potentially associated with the lower sheering force rochex et al 2008 after 87 days of operation the thickness of the biofilm was 35 8 0 9 μm fig 1b with the bacterial density of 3 0 0 2 109 copies g the biofilm images indicated that the bacteria did not fully cover the sand surface even after 87 days there was no significant cod and aef removal in the stage of biofilm development which indicates that the sand biofilter could not absorb or trap the organic compounds present in the ospw figs s1a b 3 2 effect of ozonation ozonation has been widely used as a pretreatment method for ospw biodegradation shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 ozonation can promote the biodegradability of ospw by preferentially breaking the most bio persistent nas into species with less cyclicity and shorter carbon chains martin et al 2010 in our study with a utilized ozone dose of 30 mg l the classical nas decreased from 13 06 mg l to 8 88 mg l with a removal of 32 1 fig 2 a b however the concentration of oxidized nas was not remarkably reduced fig 2a b particularly the concentrations of o3 nas o5 nas and o6 nas were relatively stable but the concentration of o4 nas decreased by 8 0 fig 2a b this finding suggested that the oxidized nas were probably less sensitive to mild ozonation compared with classical nas the result of which was consistent with previous study zhang et al 2016 the degradation of classical nas by ozonation was further analyzed according to the carbon number and z number figs s2 s3a c based on fig s2 it is interesting to note that there was a steady descend in the nas removal with increased z number of 2 12 whereas a sharp rise of nas removal was observed with increasing z number of 14 18 our previous study also proved that ozonation has a capacity of decomposing highly branched and cyclic carboxylic nas which led to the improvement of na removal in the following bioreactors zhang et al 2016 the effect of ozonation on raw ospw was analyzed by using ims as well the result showed that the nas from the ospw could basically be separated into three clusters including oxidized nas heteroatomic nas and classical nas fig 3 it can also be observed that the classical nas from raw ospw were reduced however the concentrations of the oxidized nas from the ospw remained unchanged fig 3a c it was reported that the oxidized nas can be generated by the oxidation of classical nas sun et al 2014 thus the limited removal of oxidized nas may be attributed to the generation of new oxidized nas from classical nas moreover the concentration of o3 nas increased after ozonation which may reveal that it was easier to oxidize the classical nas to o3 nas than to o4 nas compared with classical nas oxidized nas containing more oh groups were less hydrophobic which may result in reduced toxicity wang et al 2013 3 3 biodegradation of raw and ozonated ospw in biofilter 3 3 1 removal of nas from raw ospw bioremediation of ospw by biofiltration was investigated by circulating ospw through the biofilters after 8 times of circulation with a total hrt of 16 h the na removal ratio for raw ospw was 21 8 fig 2a fig s3a b although 34 8 and 43 1 of classical na removals were achieved in mbbr and ifas reactor with an hrt of 48 h biofiltration led to lower classical na concentration in the effluent with much shorter start up and treatment time huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 particularly the na removal rate for the biofiltration process was 0 18 mg l h which is higher than that for mbbr table 1 the degradation of nas by biofiltration was analyzed based on the z number and carbon number fig 4 a b based on the z number the nas present in the ospw was clustered into two main groups with z number of 4 6 and 12 14 fig s6a through the biofiltration the dominating nas concentration were all decreased and the na with the lowest cyclicity z 4 showed the highest removal ratio 31 2 fig 4a which is consistent with previous biodegradation study zhang et al 2016 it was indicated that the classical nas with fewer rings are easier to be degraded hwang et al 2013 the nas with carbon number of 14 15 and 16 are the most abundance nas species in ospw fig s5a among them the nas with carbon number of 14 showed the highest removal 33 5 after biofiltration fig 4b to better understand how molecular carbon number and hydrogen deficiency z affected the degradation of classical nas in the biofilter figs s4a and s5 6 were generated based on the na concentrations profiles it was observed that the nas with less cyclic rings were relatively easier to be biodegraded when the carbon number was lower than 15 fig s5b which was consistent with the research findings from other studies han et al 2008 xue et al 2016b the cyclicity z did not affect the removal of nas with long carbon chains n number 16 thus adsorption of biofilter might play a role in the removal of nas with large molecular weight krkosek et al 2014 through the analysis of nas with same z number the nas with higher carbon number were found easier to be biodegraded as long as z 10 fig s6b nas with less carbon number even increased after the treatment the reason of which can probably be the biotransformation of nas with higher carbon number other studies also found that the biodegradation was lower for nas with higher z number and lower carbon number xue et al 2016b for the recalcitrant nas such as the nas with high z numbers z 10 the similar high removal effect can potentially be caused by the sorption of the biofilter as well krkosek et al 2014 the removal of oxidized nas was investigated as shown in fig 2a compared with classical nas the concentration of different oxidized nas in ospw was noticeably lower o3 nas and o4 nas are the most abundant oxidized species present in the ospw it was interesting to find that the concentration of o3 nas was increased by 12 3 after biofiltration oxidized nas were considered as the intermediates for the biodegradation of classical nas han et al 2009 which was probably the reason for the increase of o3 nas the concentration of o4 nas decreased in this study with a removal of 12 9 which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2016 because of the high cyclicity of most species of o5 nas and o6 nas no obvious degradation was observed as described previously zhang et al 2016 through biofiltration the concentration of the overall oxidized nas did not change which suggested that the oxidized nas were more resistant to the biodegradation compared with classical nas the ims result showed that the signal density of classical and heteroatomic nas clusters became less intensive after biofiltration it confirmed that the biofiltration substantially reduced the concentration of classical and heteroatomic nas in raw ospw however no obvious change of the oxidized nas was observed after biofiltration it was found that the cod and aef from the effluent of biofiltration did not decrease remarkably fig s1 it suggested that the na removal was caused by the biotransformation instead of biomineralization which is consistent with na biodegradation in a membrane bioreactor xue et al 2016b due to low removal through biofiltration physical or chemical pretreatment is needed to enhance the treatment efficiency 3 3 2 removal of nas from ozonated ospw biodegradation of ozonated ospw by biofiltration was investigated by circulating ospw through the biofilter as well it was interesting to find that the biofiltration could remove 89 3 of classical nas from the ozonated ospw fig 2b through the combination of mild ozonation and biofiltration 92 7 of the classical nas from the raw ospw were removed figs s3a and d the na removal was further analyzed according to the carbon and z numbers fig 4 similar with the treatment of raw ospw by using biofilter the removal trend for ozonated ospw also showed that nas with lower z number and higher carbon number had relatively higher removal ratio when carbon number and z number was smaller than 15 and 12 respectively figs s5 6 similar high removals 90 were observed for nas with large molecular weight carbon number 15 and z 12 which might be attributed to biofilter adsorption although ozonation or biofiltration alone was not able to remove oxidized nas the ozonation followed by biofiltration reduced the total oxidized nas by 41 7 it can also be noticed that the removal of dominating o3 nas and o4 nas species in ospw were 52 6 and 47 2 respectively fig 2b the molecular structure of nas was associated with the biodegradability and the rate of biodegradation misiti et al 2013 smith et al 2008 it was reported that internal structure of nas could contribute to the recalcitrance of nas substantially including higher degree of alkyl substituted aliphatic chains han et al 2008 smith et al 2008 tertiary substitution at positions other than the β position to the carboxylic acid of the main carbon chain methyl substitution on the cycloalkane rings herman et al 1993 smith et al 2008 increased cyclicity han et al 2008 evenness of the carbon side chain and cis isomerism in alicyclic acids headley et al 2002 holowenko et al 2002 in our study it showed that ozone had the capacity to decompose long carbon chains and cyclic carboxylic fractions of nas which were also the most biopersistent fractions in ospw in addition compounds with specific functional groups aromatic rings unsaturated hydrocarbons etc are prone to ozone attack while other compounds saturated hydrocarbons alcohols aldehydes etc which are readily degradable by microorganisms are considered to be resistant to ozone attack glaze 1987 since there were still substantial amount of classical nas with the same carbon numbers and cyclicity after the ozonation it indicated that mild ozonation pretreatment might also change the biodegradability of nas through internal structure transformation previous studies demonstrated that the molecular structure of nas was associated with the biodegradability and the rate of biodegradation as well misiti et al 2013 smith et al 2008 the internal structure change of nas can be explored further in the future studies through the functional group analyses by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and so on the ims detection also showed that only minimal classical and heteroatomic nas remained after combined treatment furthermore the signal density of oxidized nas also decreased after biodegradation showing the advantages of the combined treatment fig 3c d through the pretreatment of ospw by mild ozonation it was interesting to find that the na removal percentage of the biofiltration process could increase from 21 8 to 89 3 while the removal rate of which could improve from 0 18 to 0 50 mg l h table 1 as in previous publications this study further confirmed that the ozonation pretreatment can improve and accelerate the biodegradation of ospw shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 with the circulation of ospw on the biofilter there was no na removal after 4 circulation times for raw ospw fig 2a however there was additional na removal for ozonated ospw it was indicated that more biodegradable na species were generated by the ozonation although more contact time was needed for the degradation of those new generated na species based on the z number the biofiltration of ozonated ospw can degrade the cyclic nas by more than 95 fig 4a based on the carbon number the biofiltration showed high removal for nas with carbon number from 14 to 21 but showed less removal ratio to nas with carbon number from 10 to 13 fig 4b compared with the treatment of raw ospw biofilter showed higher removal ratio to the nas with higher carbon number and cyclicity in ozonated ospw fig s4b s5 6 it suggested that the ozonation pretreatment could probably benefit the biodegradation of nas with highly branched and cyclic carboxylic structures previous studies showed that na removal in ospw increased from 34 8 to 78 8 when ozone was used as the pretreatment for the mbbr shi et al 2015 for the ifas a na removal of 80 2 was reached when combined treatment process was applied huang et al 2015 in this study more than 92 classical nas were removed with an ultimate classical na concentration of 1 0 mg l by ozonation followed by biofiltration furthermore the na removal rates for different biofilm based treatment processes were compared in table 1 it was found that the biofilter established in this study showed the highest na removal rate which was 10 times and 5 times of the na removal rate of mbbr and ifas respectively huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 it was confirmed that ozone pretreatment accelerated the na removal in the sand based biofilter compared to mbbr and ifas it was reported that the sheering force of the bioreactor could impact the microbial community structure reduce the biofilm diversity and slow down the maturation of biofilm rochex et al 2008 the result of this study indicated that the microbial community in the biofilm formed under lower sheering force e g on the biofilter could degrade the nas from the ozonated ospw more effectively 3 4 microbial community analysis target fragment on 16s rdna from the bacteria was amplified and sequenced by using miseq technology and then applied for microbial community investigation from the phylum level the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria in indigenous microbial community with the percentage of 62 9 10 5 and 4 7 respectively fig 5 a m1 after the biofiltration of raw ospw the dominating phyla on the biofilter was proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes with the percentage of 36 6 33 7 10 7 respectively fig 5a m2 biofiltration of ozonated ospw resulted in the same dominating bacteria phyla in the biofilter with the percentage of 50 4 14 2 12 2 respectively fig 5a m3 the dominating proteobacteria was also observed in a mbbr and membrane bioreactor for the treatment of ospw islam et al 2015 shi et al 2015 xue et al 2016b in addition rhodococcus was the most dominant bacterial genus in biofilters treating both raw and ozonated ospws which accounted for 30 3 and 11 6 of the total bacterial genus in biofilters respectively fig 6 a b in contrast only 0 7 of rhodococcus was detected in the indigenous microbial community of ospw fig 6a b compared with the abundance of rhodococcus in the indigenous microbial community it was interesting to find that the abundance of rhodococcus on the biofilter increased more than 40 times after the treatment of raw ospw and more than 10 times after the treatment of ozonated ospw rhodococcus has been regarded as an active oil degrader and can be used for the biodegradation of other organic compounds such as alkanes and trichloroethene sharma and pant 2000 suttinun et al 2010 the remarkable increase of rhodococcus after biofiltration might indicate that the rhodococcus played a key role in the biodegradation of the nas during the biofiltration previously the relative abundance of rhodocyclales in a membrane bioreactor also showed a positive correlation with classical nas xue et al 2017 in addition dominating of rhodococcus may be also associated with its ability of biofilm formation on the filter media and their capacity of using other organic matters in ospw orr et al 2004 schreiberová et al 2012 however further study needs to be done to confirm the correlation between rhodococcus and na degradation furthermore the biodegradation of the nas from the ospw should be the result of the synergistic effect of the whole microbial community with the investigation of the metatranscriptomics of the microbial community by using next generation sequencing technology will probably give the further detailed mechanisms for the na biodegradation the phylogenetic analysis showed that the microbial communities in the biofilters after raw and ozonated ospw treatment had the shortest genetic distance whereas the indigenous microbial community was located in a separated branch fig 5b the diversity analysis showed that the shannon indices for the indigenous microbial community microbial communities after raw ospw treatment and combined ospw treatment were 7 31 6 33 and 7 15 respectively the higher shannon diversity may contribute to the higher efficiency on the bioremediation of the ozonated ospw the chao1 richness index of those microbial communities was 3643 9 2495 4 and 1888 6 respectively compared with the indigenous microbial community the decreased richness indicated that only bacterial species that could adapt to the new environment of the biofilter survived ultimately 4 conclusions biofiltration system which utilized indigenous microorganisms was developed successfully for the treatment of ospw through the combination of ozonation and biofiltration 92 7 of the classical na removal was achieved with less than 1 mg l of nas in the treated water compared with other biofilm reactors established previously ozonation substantively accelerated the na removal in our fixed bed biofilm reactors biofilters especially for those recalcitrant nas with high molecular weight the advantage of the combined treatment also consisted in the removal of oxidized nas compared with ozonation or biofiltration alone the rhodococcus was the dominant bacterial genus on the biofilter after ospw treatment which might play a critical role in the na biodegradation considering that the biofiltration uses gravity as part of energy source and readily available sand as media the biofiltration possesses remarkable advantages such as low energy cost and low capital demand the fixed bed biofilm reactor shows high potential to be scaled up and applied for the in situ treatment of ospw conflict

19739,in this study a fixed bed biofiltration system biofilter that utilized indigenous microorganisms was developed for the reclamation of oil sands process affected water ospw with the assistance of quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm indigenous microorganisms from ospw were able to attach to the surface of sand media and form biofilms the number of total bacteria on the biofilter media reached a steady state 109 g after 23 days of operation ultra performance liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry uplc hrms analysis showed that 21 8 of the classical naphthenic acids nas removal was achieved through the circulation of raw ospw on the biofilter for 8 times equivalent to a hydraulic retention time of 16 h when ozonation with utilized ozone dose of 30 mg l was applied as pretreatment the classical nas in the ozonated ospw were removed by 89 3 with an accelerated biodegradation rate of 0 5 mg l h compared with other biofilm reactors such as moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr ozonation pretreatment could benefit the biodegradation of nas in the biofilter more classical na removal 89 3 vs 34 4 especially for those with high carbon number and cyclicity the combined ozonation biofiltration process could remove 92 7 of classical nas from raw ospw in 16 h although both ozonation and biofiltration alone did not show degradation of oxidized nas from raw ospw the combined process led to a 52 9 and 42 6 removal for o3 nas and o4 nas respectively which were the dominant oxidized na species in ospw metagenomic sequencing analysis showed that rhodococcus was the dominant bacterial genus on the sand media which may play a crucial role during the na biodegradation with the advantage of high na removal efficiency the combined ozonation biofiltration process is a promising approach for na degradation and shows high potential to be scaled up for in situ ospw treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords oil sands process affected water naphthenic acids biofiltration metagenomic analysis ozonation 1 introduction canada has been recognized as the country with the third largest oil reserves in the world which has more than 169 billion barrels of recoverable bitumen deposit in athabasca northern alberta brown and ulrich 2015 teare et al 2012 it was estimated that 5 4 percent of the initial established crude bitumen reserves have been produced and the bitumen production is supposed to reach 4 1 million barrels per day by 2023 teare et al 2014 the caustic hot water extraction process was applied for the extraction of bitumen from the oil sands and the wastewater generated from the extraction and following upgrading process was referred as the oil sands process affected water ospw brown and ulrich 2015 wang et al 2016a a large amount of toxic ospw has been generated and the volume is keeping on increasing with the expansion of the bitumen production the accumulation of huge amount of ospw in tailing ponds has shown serious threat to local surface and groundwater quality through the contamination of toxic compounds hodson 2013 pramanik 2016 ospw is a complex mixture of inorganic and organic compounds which shows toxic effect to a wide range of organisms such as algae fishes amphibians birds and mammals garcia garcia et al 2011 gentes et al 2007 goff et al 2013 he et al 2012 melvin et al 2013 reuse of the tailing water for bitumen extraction can reduce the demand for fresh water but can also lead to an increase of ospw toxicity due to the accumulation of toxic compounds allen 2008 therefore technically practicable and economically feasible ospw remediation methods need to be established urgently brown and ulrich 2015 pramanik 2016 naphthenic acids nas are considered as one of the main toxic constituents in ospw zhang et al 2011 nas are a mixture of alkyl substituted acyclic and cycloaliphatic carboxylic acids with a general chemical formula of cnh2n zox where n is the number of carbon atoms 7 n 26 z specifies the hydrogen deficiency due to the formation of ring or double bond structure 0 z 18 and x indicates the number of oxygen atoms present in the nas huang et al 2016a wang et al 2016b classical nas which possesses two oxygen atoms o2 nas has been regarded as the most toxic nas from the ospw morandi et al 2015 because the increase of hydrophilicity the oxidized nas which possess more oxygen atoms show less toxicity he et al 2010 therefore the removal of classical nas is considered critical for the ospw remediation as such the removal of classical nas has been used as one of the parameters for the evaluation of the ospw treatment methods huang et al 2015 in recent years studies have been conducted to develop ospw treatment methods though none of them have been tested at the full scale level huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 xue et al 2016b the ospw treatment can basically be divided into physical chemical biological methods as an example of physical treatment method petroleum coke adsorption can remove 91 of acid extractable fraction aef and 84 of nas from ospw and its toxicity toward vibrio fischeri can be reduced from 4 3 to 1 1 toxicity units gamal el din et al 2011 chemical ospw treatment methods such as ozonation can effectively remove the fluorescing aromatics sulfur containing nas and classical nas at the dose of 2 0 mm wang et al 2016b compared with physical and chemical processes biological processes are usually less effective for ospw treatment nevertheless they are economical energy efficient and environmentally sound approaches for large scale applications sediment microorganisms such as pseudomonas putida and pseudomonas fluorescens showed high degradation effect on a commercial mixture of nas and they could also reduce the toxicity of ospw through the biodegradation of aromatic compounds del rio et al 2006 zhang et al 2015 however our previous studies showed that nas cannot be considerably removed by suspended growth biological treatment processes zhang et al 2015 compared with suspended growth systems the attached growth systems are supposed to benefit microorganisms for the better adaption to the harsh conditions and faster degradation of organic compounds due to the cooperation of microorganisms with metabolic diversity by adding biofilm carriers into the ospw the attached growth biological treatment approach can remove the nas by 34 8 43 1 huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 previous research has demonstrated the bio persistence of nas with extensive cyclical molecular structures han et al 2008 indicating that pretreatment is necessary to improve the biodegradability of ospw it has been demonstrated that low dose ozone could improve the biodegradability of ospw by breaking nas with high cyclicity and long carbon chains martin et al 2010 ozonation combined biological treatment has been successfully developed and applied for ospw remediation huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 through the ozonation pretreatment the aef and na removals in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr were improved from 18 3 to 41 0 and from 34 8 to 78 8 respectively shi et al 2015 similar results were also observed by using integrated fixed film activated sludge reactors ifas and membrane bioreactors for ospw treatment huang et al 2015 xue et al 2016b however it was observed that the ozonation pretreatment itself contributed to the most na removal while it did not substantially facilitate the na removal rate in the bioreactors additionally long hydraulic retention time hrt requirement and high aeration cost of those bioreactors also limit their applications at large scale with the advantages of robustness ease and simplicity of construction and low energy input biofiltration has been widely used for water and wastewater treatment kang et al 2007 reungoat et al 2011 saminathan et al 2013 reungoat et al 2011 found that biofiltration can remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products by more than 90 and reduce the toxicity of wastewater by 28 68 in another study circulation biofilter was determined as a robust process for the degradation of pharmaceutically active compounds with a removal of 92 99 89 99 and 62 92 for ibuprofen naproxen and gemfibrozil respectively krkosek et al 2014 recently a fixed bed biofilm reactor showed high efficiency on the biodegradation of methyl tertiary butyl ether which is a recalcitrant organic compound causing groundwater contamination alfonso gordillo et al 2016 fixed bed biofilm reactors have been shown to more efficiently remove various compounds compared to mbbr choi et al 2012 however the remediation of ospw by using biofiltration process has not been investigated until now with the application of low cost natural materials and consuming low energy mild ozonation pretreatment moderate ozone dose followed by biofiltration may be a promising approach for ospw treatment which can be easily scaled up and applied by the industry in this research circulating fixed bed biofilters were established by using indigenous microorganisms from ospw in order to avoid unnecessary expenditure of chemicals and energy thereby lowering the operating cost an ozone dose of 30 mg l was used for the pretreatment of ospw prior to biofiltration our previous study has demonstrated that the nas showed a sharp decrease after ozonation up to about 50 mg l and ozone dose of 30 mg l led to the maximal toxicity reduction dong et al 2015 wang et al 2013 and ozone dose of 30 mg l could also result in the minimal mineralization during the pretreatment stage the main objective of this study was to confirm the feasibility of biofiltration process in ospw remediation and to investigate the benefit of mild ozonation pretreatment on the biofiltration performance the na removal efficiency of the biofiltration and the combined processes was investigated the impact of circulation times on the removal of classical and oxidized nas was also analyzed dominant bacteria related to na degradation were determined through the analysis of the microbial community by using the next generation sequencing technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of ospw ospw samples were taken from an active oil sands tailings pond in fort mcmurray alberta canada ospw was stored in 200 l polyvinyl chloride barrels at 4 c prior to be used in this study within one year of collection characteristics of ospw were analyzed periodically to ensure the representativeness of ospw after storage the physicochemical parameters of raw ospw were shown in table s1 2 2 ozonation briefly high purity oxygen was used for the production of ozone by an ozone generator gso 40 wedeco herford germany by using a gas diffuser and stir mixer ozone could be well mixed within the water sample with the volume of 4 l ozone monitors hc500 ozone monitor wedeco usa were used to monitor the ozone concentrations in feed and off gas lines and a wet test meter precision scientific petroleum instruments texas usa was used to continuously measure the flow rate of feed and off gas lines the concentration of ozone residual in the water samples was monitored by using the indigo method after the ozonation treatment the ozone residual in the water was removed by purging with purified nitrogen gas for 5 min gamal el din et al 2011 huang et al 2015 the utilized ozone dose of 30 mg l was calculated through the integration of the amount of used ozone minus the amount of the residual ozone 2 3 configuration and operation of the biofilters duplicate glass columns 25 mm internal diameter and 15 cm bed depth were served as biofilters the polyethylene terephthalate pet disk was set at the bottom to hold the media inside the bioreactor pure sand acros organics new jersey usa with the size of 40 100 mesh was used as media in order to support the colonization of indigenous microorganisms in the biofilters the reactors were fed with raw ospw at a flow rate of 0 61 ml min the biofilters were operated at room temperature biodegradation of raw and ozonated ospws was implemented by circulating ospw through the biofilter with an empty bed contact time of 120 min the treated ospw samples were taken for water quality analyses after 4 and 8 circulation times the untreated raw ospw was collected and used as control 2 4 water chemistry analyses raw ozonated and treated ospw samples were collected for water chemistry analyses chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by using the hach tnt test tube method tnt821 hach colorado usa aef was quantified using a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy method jivraj et al 1995 briefly 25 ml of water sample was filtered by using a nylon membrane filter with the pore size of 0 45 μm and acidified to ph 2 2 5 optima grade dichloromethane dcm was used for the extraction after evaporation the extracted aef was then dissolved in dcm with known mass ftir spectrometry perkinelmer on ca was used to measure aef by recording the absorbance of the monomeric and dimeric forms of the carboxylic groups at 1743 and 1706 cm 1 the cod and aef tests were all performed in duplicate the profiles of the nas present in different ospw samples were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry uplc tofms huang et al 2015 xue et al 2016b in brief 10 ml of water sample was collected and filtered by using nylon membrane filter with the pore size of 0 22 μm 0 5 ml of filtered water sample was mixed with 0 4 ml of methanol and 0 1 ml of myristic acid 1 13c 4 0 mg l which was used as internal standard waters uplc phenyl beh column 1 7 μm 150 mm 1 mm was used for the liquid chromatographic separation 10 mm ammonium acetate in water a and 10 mm ammonium acetate in a 50 50 methanol acetonitrile mixture b were used as the mobile phases and the elution gradient was 0 2 min 1 b 2 3 min 60 b 3 7 min 70 b 7 13 min 95 b 13 14 min back to 1 b and hold to 20 min to equilibrate the column at a flow rate of 100 μl min the temperature of the column and the sample was set at 50 c and 10 c with the electrospray ionization esi source operating in negative ion mode and tof analyzer in high resolution mode mass resolution of 40000 at m z 1431 the samples were further analyzed with a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer synapt g2 waters milford ma usa huang et al 2016a the ion mobility spectrometry ims was also conducted in a tri wave ion mobility cell by using pure nitrogen 99 as the drift gas to separate and identify different na species targetlynx ver 4 1 software was used to analyze the data for target compounds huang et al 2016b 2 5 microbial characterization the microbial samples for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr analyses were collected from the top of the fixed bed biofilm reactor which was within 1 cm of the depth of the sand media and tested for three times after staining the sand samples with syto 9 and cona conjugated with texas red molecular probes invitrogen clsm zeiss lsm 710 carl zeiss micro imaging gmbh germany was performed to characterize the distribution of deposited microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substance eps on sand media xue et al 2016a powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc ca usa was used for bacterial dna extraction from sand media 0 25 g according to the manufacturer instructions the extracted dna samples were then used for the qpcr analysis to quantify the total bacteria on the sand media zhang et al 2016 moreover illumina miseq sequencing was used to further understand the microbial communities related to ospw biodegradation on the sand media as described previously huang et al 2017 after the raw and ozonated ospw treatment the sand samples for microbial community analysis were also collected from the top level of the fixed bed biofilm reactor and used for 16s metagenomic sequencing after dna extraction more details about the microbial analysis are described in the supporting information si 3 results and discussions 3 1 the development of biofilm in biofilter raw ospw was used as feed for the development of indigenous microorganisms based biofilm on the sand media of the biofilter through monitoring the growth of total bacteria on the sand by qpcr it was found that the biofiltration system reached a relatively steady state after 23 days of operation with 3 3 0 8 109 copies g total bacteria on the sand media fig 1 a these results showed that indigenous microorganisms from raw ospw were able to attach to the surface of the sand media and form biofilm our previous study showed that a bacteria density of 109 copies g granular activated carbon gac could be reached after 30 days operation in fed batch biofilm reactors islam et al 2015 considering the much lower surface area and higher specific gravity of sand media compared with gac denser biofilm was formed on the unit area of sand media which may benefit the ospw degradation the results also indicated that the microorganisms could form biofilm more efficiently on the fixed bed media compared to moving bed media suspended gac in the fed batch reactors which was potentially associated with the lower sheering force rochex et al 2008 after 87 days of operation the thickness of the biofilm was 35 8 0 9 μm fig 1b with the bacterial density of 3 0 0 2 109 copies g the biofilm images indicated that the bacteria did not fully cover the sand surface even after 87 days there was no significant cod and aef removal in the stage of biofilm development which indicates that the sand biofilter could not absorb or trap the organic compounds present in the ospw figs s1a b 3 2 effect of ozonation ozonation has been widely used as a pretreatment method for ospw biodegradation shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 ozonation can promote the biodegradability of ospw by preferentially breaking the most bio persistent nas into species with less cyclicity and shorter carbon chains martin et al 2010 in our study with a utilized ozone dose of 30 mg l the classical nas decreased from 13 06 mg l to 8 88 mg l with a removal of 32 1 fig 2 a b however the concentration of oxidized nas was not remarkably reduced fig 2a b particularly the concentrations of o3 nas o5 nas and o6 nas were relatively stable but the concentration of o4 nas decreased by 8 0 fig 2a b this finding suggested that the oxidized nas were probably less sensitive to mild ozonation compared with classical nas the result of which was consistent with previous study zhang et al 2016 the degradation of classical nas by ozonation was further analyzed according to the carbon number and z number figs s2 s3a c based on fig s2 it is interesting to note that there was a steady descend in the nas removal with increased z number of 2 12 whereas a sharp rise of nas removal was observed with increasing z number of 14 18 our previous study also proved that ozonation has a capacity of decomposing highly branched and cyclic carboxylic nas which led to the improvement of na removal in the following bioreactors zhang et al 2016 the effect of ozonation on raw ospw was analyzed by using ims as well the result showed that the nas from the ospw could basically be separated into three clusters including oxidized nas heteroatomic nas and classical nas fig 3 it can also be observed that the classical nas from raw ospw were reduced however the concentrations of the oxidized nas from the ospw remained unchanged fig 3a c it was reported that the oxidized nas can be generated by the oxidation of classical nas sun et al 2014 thus the limited removal of oxidized nas may be attributed to the generation of new oxidized nas from classical nas moreover the concentration of o3 nas increased after ozonation which may reveal that it was easier to oxidize the classical nas to o3 nas than to o4 nas compared with classical nas oxidized nas containing more oh groups were less hydrophobic which may result in reduced toxicity wang et al 2013 3 3 biodegradation of raw and ozonated ospw in biofilter 3 3 1 removal of nas from raw ospw bioremediation of ospw by biofiltration was investigated by circulating ospw through the biofilters after 8 times of circulation with a total hrt of 16 h the na removal ratio for raw ospw was 21 8 fig 2a fig s3a b although 34 8 and 43 1 of classical na removals were achieved in mbbr and ifas reactor with an hrt of 48 h biofiltration led to lower classical na concentration in the effluent with much shorter start up and treatment time huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 particularly the na removal rate for the biofiltration process was 0 18 mg l h which is higher than that for mbbr table 1 the degradation of nas by biofiltration was analyzed based on the z number and carbon number fig 4 a b based on the z number the nas present in the ospw was clustered into two main groups with z number of 4 6 and 12 14 fig s6a through the biofiltration the dominating nas concentration were all decreased and the na with the lowest cyclicity z 4 showed the highest removal ratio 31 2 fig 4a which is consistent with previous biodegradation study zhang et al 2016 it was indicated that the classical nas with fewer rings are easier to be degraded hwang et al 2013 the nas with carbon number of 14 15 and 16 are the most abundance nas species in ospw fig s5a among them the nas with carbon number of 14 showed the highest removal 33 5 after biofiltration fig 4b to better understand how molecular carbon number and hydrogen deficiency z affected the degradation of classical nas in the biofilter figs s4a and s5 6 were generated based on the na concentrations profiles it was observed that the nas with less cyclic rings were relatively easier to be biodegraded when the carbon number was lower than 15 fig s5b which was consistent with the research findings from other studies han et al 2008 xue et al 2016b the cyclicity z did not affect the removal of nas with long carbon chains n number 16 thus adsorption of biofilter might play a role in the removal of nas with large molecular weight krkosek et al 2014 through the analysis of nas with same z number the nas with higher carbon number were found easier to be biodegraded as long as z 10 fig s6b nas with less carbon number even increased after the treatment the reason of which can probably be the biotransformation of nas with higher carbon number other studies also found that the biodegradation was lower for nas with higher z number and lower carbon number xue et al 2016b for the recalcitrant nas such as the nas with high z numbers z 10 the similar high removal effect can potentially be caused by the sorption of the biofilter as well krkosek et al 2014 the removal of oxidized nas was investigated as shown in fig 2a compared with classical nas the concentration of different oxidized nas in ospw was noticeably lower o3 nas and o4 nas are the most abundant oxidized species present in the ospw it was interesting to find that the concentration of o3 nas was increased by 12 3 after biofiltration oxidized nas were considered as the intermediates for the biodegradation of classical nas han et al 2009 which was probably the reason for the increase of o3 nas the concentration of o4 nas decreased in this study with a removal of 12 9 which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2016 because of the high cyclicity of most species of o5 nas and o6 nas no obvious degradation was observed as described previously zhang et al 2016 through biofiltration the concentration of the overall oxidized nas did not change which suggested that the oxidized nas were more resistant to the biodegradation compared with classical nas the ims result showed that the signal density of classical and heteroatomic nas clusters became less intensive after biofiltration it confirmed that the biofiltration substantially reduced the concentration of classical and heteroatomic nas in raw ospw however no obvious change of the oxidized nas was observed after biofiltration it was found that the cod and aef from the effluent of biofiltration did not decrease remarkably fig s1 it suggested that the na removal was caused by the biotransformation instead of biomineralization which is consistent with na biodegradation in a membrane bioreactor xue et al 2016b due to low removal through biofiltration physical or chemical pretreatment is needed to enhance the treatment efficiency 3 3 2 removal of nas from ozonated ospw biodegradation of ozonated ospw by biofiltration was investigated by circulating ospw through the biofilter as well it was interesting to find that the biofiltration could remove 89 3 of classical nas from the ozonated ospw fig 2b through the combination of mild ozonation and biofiltration 92 7 of the classical nas from the raw ospw were removed figs s3a and d the na removal was further analyzed according to the carbon and z numbers fig 4 similar with the treatment of raw ospw by using biofilter the removal trend for ozonated ospw also showed that nas with lower z number and higher carbon number had relatively higher removal ratio when carbon number and z number was smaller than 15 and 12 respectively figs s5 6 similar high removals 90 were observed for nas with large molecular weight carbon number 15 and z 12 which might be attributed to biofilter adsorption although ozonation or biofiltration alone was not able to remove oxidized nas the ozonation followed by biofiltration reduced the total oxidized nas by 41 7 it can also be noticed that the removal of dominating o3 nas and o4 nas species in ospw were 52 6 and 47 2 respectively fig 2b the molecular structure of nas was associated with the biodegradability and the rate of biodegradation misiti et al 2013 smith et al 2008 it was reported that internal structure of nas could contribute to the recalcitrance of nas substantially including higher degree of alkyl substituted aliphatic chains han et al 2008 smith et al 2008 tertiary substitution at positions other than the β position to the carboxylic acid of the main carbon chain methyl substitution on the cycloalkane rings herman et al 1993 smith et al 2008 increased cyclicity han et al 2008 evenness of the carbon side chain and cis isomerism in alicyclic acids headley et al 2002 holowenko et al 2002 in our study it showed that ozone had the capacity to decompose long carbon chains and cyclic carboxylic fractions of nas which were also the most biopersistent fractions in ospw in addition compounds with specific functional groups aromatic rings unsaturated hydrocarbons etc are prone to ozone attack while other compounds saturated hydrocarbons alcohols aldehydes etc which are readily degradable by microorganisms are considered to be resistant to ozone attack glaze 1987 since there were still substantial amount of classical nas with the same carbon numbers and cyclicity after the ozonation it indicated that mild ozonation pretreatment might also change the biodegradability of nas through internal structure transformation previous studies demonstrated that the molecular structure of nas was associated with the biodegradability and the rate of biodegradation as well misiti et al 2013 smith et al 2008 the internal structure change of nas can be explored further in the future studies through the functional group analyses by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and so on the ims detection also showed that only minimal classical and heteroatomic nas remained after combined treatment furthermore the signal density of oxidized nas also decreased after biodegradation showing the advantages of the combined treatment fig 3c d through the pretreatment of ospw by mild ozonation it was interesting to find that the na removal percentage of the biofiltration process could increase from 21 8 to 89 3 while the removal rate of which could improve from 0 18 to 0 50 mg l h table 1 as in previous publications this study further confirmed that the ozonation pretreatment can improve and accelerate the biodegradation of ospw shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 with the circulation of ospw on the biofilter there was no na removal after 4 circulation times for raw ospw fig 2a however there was additional na removal for ozonated ospw it was indicated that more biodegradable na species were generated by the ozonation although more contact time was needed for the degradation of those new generated na species based on the z number the biofiltration of ozonated ospw can degrade the cyclic nas by more than 95 fig 4a based on the carbon number the biofiltration showed high removal for nas with carbon number from 14 to 21 but showed less removal ratio to nas with carbon number from 10 to 13 fig 4b compared with the treatment of raw ospw biofilter showed higher removal ratio to the nas with higher carbon number and cyclicity in ozonated ospw fig s4b s5 6 it suggested that the ozonation pretreatment could probably benefit the biodegradation of nas with highly branched and cyclic carboxylic structures previous studies showed that na removal in ospw increased from 34 8 to 78 8 when ozone was used as the pretreatment for the mbbr shi et al 2015 for the ifas a na removal of 80 2 was reached when combined treatment process was applied huang et al 2015 in this study more than 92 classical nas were removed with an ultimate classical na concentration of 1 0 mg l by ozonation followed by biofiltration furthermore the na removal rates for different biofilm based treatment processes were compared in table 1 it was found that the biofilter established in this study showed the highest na removal rate which was 10 times and 5 times of the na removal rate of mbbr and ifas respectively huang et al 2015 shi et al 2015 it was confirmed that ozone pretreatment accelerated the na removal in the sand based biofilter compared to mbbr and ifas it was reported that the sheering force of the bioreactor could impact the microbial community structure reduce the biofilm diversity and slow down the maturation of biofilm rochex et al 2008 the result of this study indicated that the microbial community in the biofilm formed under lower sheering force e g on the biofilter could degrade the nas from the ozonated ospw more effectively 3 4 microbial community analysis target fragment on 16s rdna from the bacteria was amplified and sequenced by using miseq technology and then applied for microbial community investigation from the phylum level the dominant phyla were proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria in indigenous microbial community with the percentage of 62 9 10 5 and 4 7 respectively fig 5 a m1 after the biofiltration of raw ospw the dominating phyla on the biofilter was proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes with the percentage of 36 6 33 7 10 7 respectively fig 5a m2 biofiltration of ozonated ospw resulted in the same dominating bacteria phyla in the biofilter with the percentage of 50 4 14 2 12 2 respectively fig 5a m3 the dominating proteobacteria was also observed in a mbbr and membrane bioreactor for the treatment of ospw islam et al 2015 shi et al 2015 xue et al 2016b in addition rhodococcus was the most dominant bacterial genus in biofilters treating both raw and ozonated ospws which accounted for 30 3 and 11 6 of the total bacterial genus in biofilters respectively fig 6 a b in contrast only 0 7 of rhodococcus was detected in the indigenous microbial community of ospw fig 6a b compared with the abundance of rhodococcus in the indigenous microbial community it was interesting to find that the abundance of rhodococcus on the biofilter increased more than 40 times after the treatment of raw ospw and more than 10 times after the treatment of ozonated ospw rhodococcus has been regarded as an active oil degrader and can be used for the biodegradation of other organic compounds such as alkanes and trichloroethene sharma and pant 2000 suttinun et al 2010 the remarkable increase of rhodococcus after biofiltration might indicate that the rhodococcus played a key role in the biodegradation of the nas during the biofiltration previously the relative abundance of rhodocyclales in a membrane bioreactor also showed a positive correlation with classical nas xue et al 2017 in addition dominating of rhodococcus may be also associated with its ability of biofilm formation on the filter media and their capacity of using other organic matters in ospw orr et al 2004 schreiberová et al 2012 however further study needs to be done to confirm the correlation between rhodococcus and na degradation furthermore the biodegradation of the nas from the ospw should be the result of the synergistic effect of the whole microbial community with the investigation of the metatranscriptomics of the microbial community by using next generation sequencing technology will probably give the further detailed mechanisms for the na biodegradation the phylogenetic analysis showed that the microbial communities in the biofilters after raw and ozonated ospw treatment had the shortest genetic distance whereas the indigenous microbial community was located in a separated branch fig 5b the diversity analysis showed that the shannon indices for the indigenous microbial community microbial communities after raw ospw treatment and combined ospw treatment were 7 31 6 33 and 7 15 respectively the higher shannon diversity may contribute to the higher efficiency on the bioremediation of the ozonated ospw the chao1 richness index of those microbial communities was 3643 9 2495 4 and 1888 6 respectively compared with the indigenous microbial community the decreased richness indicated that only bacterial species that could adapt to the new environment of the biofilter survived ultimately 4 conclusions biofiltration system which utilized indigenous microorganisms was developed successfully for the treatment of ospw through the combination of ozonation and biofiltration 92 7 of the classical na removal was achieved with less than 1 mg l of nas in the treated water compared with other biofilm reactors established previously ozonation substantively accelerated the na removal in our fixed bed biofilm reactors biofilters especially for those recalcitrant nas with high molecular weight the advantage of the combined treatment also consisted in the removal of oxidized nas compared with ozonation or biofiltration alone the rhodococcus was the dominant bacterial genus on the biofilter after ospw treatment which might play a critical role in the na biodegradation considering that the biofiltration uses gravity as part of energy source and readily available sand as media the biofiltration possesses remarkable advantages such as low energy cost and low capital demand the fixed bed biofilm reactor shows high potential to be scaled up and applied for the in situ treatment of ospw conflict
