2465,a digital elevation model dem is crucial for hydraulic hydrodynamic simulation of urban pluvial flooding to reduce the simulation error caused by the low resolution and poor vertical accuracy of dem data a novel urban terrain reconstruction method is proposed based on multisource data fusion mdf a 1d 2d coupled pluvial flood model under the typhoon rainfall scenario is built to verify the superiority of the proposed method the results show that the systematic elevation error of terrain is reduced with mdf kriging and mdf idw and the performances of simulations are improved by 5 and 23 in terms of peak water level error compared to using conventional kriging and idw methods and by 0 13m and 0 11m in terms of manhole water level accuracy compared to using raw dem moreover the temporospatial patterns of the flooding simulation results are more rational with the scattered flooding eliminated and the proportion of flood area with ground elevation lower than 8 m increased from 37 9 to 92 34 and 89 33 respectively this method is proven to be a notably effective and low cost dem reconstruction method for improving the accuracy of urban pluvial flooding simulation keywords urban pluvial flooding dem multisource data fusion terrain reconstruction method flooding simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under the dual effects of global climate change and urbanization urban pluvial flooding disasters occur more frequently resulting in significant economic and societal losses o donnell and thorne 2020 the water problem has become one of the constraints of urban development and sustainability of human society zinatloo ajabshir et al 2021 thus it is of great importance to predict pluvial flood processes accurately and quickly which is strategic for making scientific decisions in flood control operations in advance strengthen urban environmental remediation zinatloo ajabshir et al 2017 and improving social sustainability and resistance capability ma et al 2021 ostad ali as 2022 su et al 2016 common urban pluvial flooding simulation methods include hydrological hydrodynamic models and machine learning models the general approach of hydrological hydrodynamic urban flood model calculates runoff and infiltration using hydrological models describes the flow process of a drainage pipeline by solving the one dimensional saint venant equation and simulates overflow by solving the two dimensional hydrodynamics equation dong et al 2022 ostad ali askari 2022 quan et al 2010 tang et al 2019 tu et al 2020 machine learning models are based on data analysis of flood processes chen et al 2021 guo et al 2022 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 while the machine learning method is considered to be one of the most efficient methods munawar et al 2021 the hydrological hydrodynamic model is generally believed to be a more reliable and accurate method to simulate urban pluvial flooding results of which are comprehensively explainable during the process of building an urban pluvial flooding hydrodynamic model a digital elevation model is one of the most important input conditions and its data vertical accuracy directly affects the simulation results fereshtehpour and karamouz 2018 saksena and merwade 2015 therefore high precision dem data are crucial to accurately characterize the process of urban pluvial flooding and recognize the scope and depth of pluvial flooding the universally effective urban terrain reconstruction method to improve the accuracy of urban pluvial flooding simulation is a challenging task that has attracted the attention of numerous scholars and researchers in recent years avand et al 2022 chen et al 2018 hou et al 2021 muthusamy et al 2021 xing et al 2022 for urban pluvial flood simulation the characteristics of urban terrain are as follows 1 vertical mutability in the lateral direction due to the existence of urban artificial structures such as buildings roads and squares the topography of the city would change locally around the structural edges the conventional interpolation algorithms for terrain reconstruction make the topography smoother so the dem has difficulty describing the sudden elevation change in the horizontal direction 2 insignificant elevation changes within the urban roads urban terrain tends to be flatter than mountainous areas especially in plain or seashore cities which requires a more accurate elevation description of the main urban roads when constructing the pluvial flood model however the research of the dem on urban waterlogging mainly focuses on horizontal accuracy while the research on vertical accuracy is relatively insufficient according to existing studies there are two main methods to construct an urban terrain the first is surveying and mapping and the other is dem fusion for surveying and mapping remote sensing and photogrammetry can deliver fundamental dem in the wide area such terrasar x and tandem x however the resolution of the dem by these methods can only reach 10 m 30 m which is of great significance for hydrologic model of wide basins talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 but unable to meet the accuracy requirement of urban pluvial flood model leandro et al 2016 recent years the exploratory studies of urban terrain construction by means of uav tilt photography ajibola et al 2019 chen et al 2018 huang et al 2020 and laser radar mapping chu et al 2014 slatton et al 2001 are carried out by comparison these dem data have been proven to be highly precise with a resolution of 5 cm however dem reconstruction through these state of art technologies is extremely costly and time consuming which limits their application and further promotion in addition the dem data with these approaches consume considerable memory space to obtain accurate data when the resolution is much higher than the grid resolution of the pluvial flood model which is a redundancy for the flood model furthermore these models still retain the noisy data such as viaducts and woods which is unfavorable for waterlogging flooding simulation dem fusion okolie and smit 2022 is defined as the synergistic integration of two or more source dems using a certain algorithm to generate an improved dem that is more detailed than each of the sources common dem fusion methods include simple averaging leitao and de sousa 2018 weighted averaging bagheri et al 2018 pham et al 2018 variational models kuschk and d angelo 2013 wang et al 2020 kalman filtering slatton et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 and multiple point geostatistical simulation tang et al 2015 in recent years dem generation from multisource data have been proposed to improve the accuracy of dem and reduce the reconstruction cost li et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 apart from the conventional fusion methods some innovative urban terrain reconstruction methods for flood simulation have been proposed such as through a gis based dem correction method xing et al 2022 these works have proved to be effective for improving the performance of flood simulation but still inadequate for describing the urban terrain spatial heterogeneity with different data source comprehensively to improve the accuracy of dem data and reduce the error of urban pluvial flood simulation this study proposes a terrain reconstruction method based on multisource data fusion with the concept of restricted intervals fuzhou was selected as the case study area in section 2 the urban dem reconstruction method based on multisource data fusion is proposed and the urban pluvial simulation method is explained in section 3 a region in fuzhou is used as an example to reconstruct the terrain and the 1d 2d coupled urban pluvial model is built the typhoon lupit is set as the rainfall event in section 4 and 5 the accuracy of pluvial flood simulation results based on different dems and the applicability of our method are discussed finally in section 6 a summary is presented 2 method as shown in fig 1 a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic urban pluvial flooding model will be built to verify the superiorities of the method proposed in this study the two most critical and difficult steps are terrain reconstruction and urban pluvial flood modelling dems are reconstructed with multisource data using gis tools and the 1d 2d coupled flood model is established using storm water management model coupled integrated terrestrial fluxes model swmm itf 2 1 terrain construction urban terrain is complex due to the existence of artificial buildings while conventional interpolation methods usually smooth the terrain therefore a multisource data fusion terrain reconstruction method combining urban elevation points landcover and raw dem data is proposed to improve the description of vertical mutation fig 2 the description of reconstruction methods in this study is as follows 2 1 1 conventional interpolation methods 1 kriging the kriging method a spatial local interpolation is an algorithm of optimal unbiased estimation for regionalized variables in finite regions the semivariation function γ h are as follows 1 γ h 1 2 z h z x h 2 assume that there are n reference points in the neighbourhood of the interpolated point x the regionalized variable z x takes the value of z x i at the reference point x i i 1 2 3 n and the interpolation estimate z x is determined by the weighted summation of the above n known variable values which is defined as follows 2 z x i 1 n λ i z x i where z x is the estimated value of the interpolated point n is the number of reference points z x i is the value of point i and λ i is a set of weight coefficients of point i the set of weight coefficients is defined as follows 3 i 1 n λ i γ x i x j u x j x 0 j 1 n 4 i 1 n λ i 1 where u denotes the lagrange multiplier 2 idw the inverse distance weighting idw method based on tobler s first law the first law of geography is a common spatial interpolation algorithm that is widely used in the interpolation or extrapolation of spatial point data information assuming that a 1 a n are n given points a is the point to be interpolated and the distance between a 1 a n and a is d 1 d n the reciprocal summation of the distances is 5 d i 1 n 1 d i 6 a i 1 d i d 7 z x i 1 n a i z x i where z x and z x i denote the values of points to be interpolated and given points respectively 2 1 2 method proposed in this study common spatial interpolation methods li and heap 2014 such as kriging interpolation and idw interpolation are highly dependent on the density of the reference point and the distance between the interpolation point and reference points when the interpolation points are far from the reference points the reliability of the interpolation result decreases rapidly in the study of pluvial flood simulation on the one hand urban vertical spatial altimetric elevation points such as the altimetric points of the manhole ground elevation are highly concentrated in road areas rather than in the mountain region of the city on the other hand due to the vertical mutability characteristic of urban terrain such as roadside stones and building exterior walls topographic features are distinct from random spatial changes in the natural environment therefore it is difficult to describe the characteristics of urban elevation change directly using common interpolation methods for terrain reconstruction to avoid the voids caused by an insufficient density of given altimetric points and correctly describe the topographic features of the city a multisource data fusion interpolation method is proposed for urban terrain reconstruction assuming that the resolution of the raw dem is d a raster is constructed with a grid size of d in the study area which d 2 d requires the study area is divided into three parts road building and others in consideration of different land cover types within the scope of the roads the discrete altimetric points are used as reference points to assign values to each grid with the nearest neighbour interpolation method within the scope of the buildings the elevation corresponding to each grid is increased by h from the original raw dem value h 10 m in this study in other areas the raw dem is kept as the corresponding elevation value unchanged then the dems are merged as a whole in this way for each point x in the merged raster the corresponding elevation is 8 z road x z x i 9 z building x z x 0 h 10 z others x z x 0 where z road x z building x and z others x are elevation values of points in the range of roads buildings and other land cover types respectively x i denotes the nearest given elevation altimetric point to x in the road range and x 0 denotes the elevation value corresponding to raw dem in the position of x the grid points are defined of the merged raster as x j finally another raster is constructed with a grid size of d the grid points x j of the merged raster are used as the reference points to assign values of the raster with a conventional interpolation method the elevation of each grid point is 11 z x m j 1 n ε j z x j where x m denotes each grid point interpolated point n denotes the number of reference points z x j is the elevation value of x m and ε j is the weight coefficient calculated by the selected interpolation method in this study n is 16 to ensure that the distance between the interpolated point and the reference point is less than 2 d the merit of our method is that when the number of reference points is determined it is ensured that the reference points of each interpolated point must exist and the relative position is determined with certainty it is equivalent to constructing a restricted interval such that any interpolated point can only be affected by reference elevation points in a limited space range this is of great significance for terrain reconstruction around the boundary of different land cover types especially the region between roads and other types as shown in fig 3 the elevation of reference points within the roads is closer to elevation altimetric point 1 in the range outside the road due to the vertical mutability the elevation of the reference points is higher than the road elevation if the conventional interpolation method is adopted to reconstruct the terrain the elevation value of the point to be interpolated will be affected by the elevation altimetric points both inside and outside the road at the same time whether they are in the roads the conventional interpolation result tends to be smooth and is difficult to reflect the vertical mutation of the terrain by using the method of multisource data fusion with restricted intervals for the boundary area of the road only if there are reference points both inside and outside the road should the influence of vertical mutation on the elevation of the interpolated point be considered if there are only inside road reference points within the restricted interval the influence of elevation points outside the road is not considered 2 2 hydraulic model 2 2 1 1d conduit drainage pipe model one dimensional saint venant equations are used to describe the flow in the urban drainage pipe network gironas et al 2010 12 a t q x 0 13 q t g a h x g a s f q 2 a x where x is the distance t is the time q is the volumetric flow rate a is the flow area h is the hydraulic head of water in the conduit s f is the friction slope and g is the acceleration of gravity 2 2 2 2d hydraulic model the two dimensional hydraulic model is used to simulate the overland flow process due to the indistinctive change in urban terrain and the absence of shock waves or rapidly varied flow in urban pluvial floods the storage cell method is used to simulate the overland flow process the study area is divided into rectangular cells the governing equation is 14 δ h δ t δ v δ x δ y where δ h denotes the change in cell water depth δ v denotes the change in cell volume δ t denotes the time interval and x and y denote the orthogonal directions the flow of two adjacent cells is calculated using the saint venant inertial equation 15 q t δ t q t g h flow δ t s surf 1 g n 2 δ t h flow 7 3 where q t is the flow rate on the boundary of adjacent cells g is the gravity acceleration n is the roughness s surf is the water level gradient of the adjacent units and h flow is the water flow depth at the interface of the adjacent cells which is defined as follows 16 h flow max h 1 z 1 h 2 z 2 max z 1 z 2 where h 1 and z 1 h 2 and z 2 denote the water depth and ground elevation of the two adjacent cells respectively 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is located in fuzhou city fujian province china 26 08 n 119 28 e as shown in fig 4 the study area is approximately 6 36 km2 with a total of 2034 conduits 2032 manholes and 12 outfalls the data related to manholes include the bottom elevation and top elevation so they can be used as the reference for terrain reconstruction fig 4 b represents the original dem with a resolution of 2 m 2 m generally it can be determined from this figure that the elevations of subareas a and b are much higher than those of the other subareas however the elevation change trend of subarea e is not as visible and the minimum ground elevation is 7 15 m which is much higher than the minimum value of the measured elevation namely 6 85 m indicating that raw dem data are subject to random errors meanwhile the buildings whose facades block the run off flow cause a sudden change in elevation outside the street limits however these characteristics have not been well expressed in raw dem data fig 5 shows the distribution of monitoring points and drainage networks in the study area p1 is the water level monitoring of a manhole the p1 manhole is the penultimate along the drainage pipe and its ground surface elevation is 7 14 m which is the lowest one of the main conduits therefore when heavy rainfall occurs the underground drainage water would overflow from the p1 manhole with a high probability the overflow water depth monitoring point is established at p2 where the ground elevation is 7 45 m however this elevation is not the lowest point within the study area the lowest point in the study area is located at p3 and its ground surface elevation is 6 85 m consequently when the local overflow water depth is low the pluvial flood process in the study area may not be monitored urban land cover types are extremely complex including mountains green space roads buildings etc the hydraulic parameters such as runoff and confluence parameters corresponding to different land cover types are not consistent overall in the scope of artificial land such as roads buildings etc the infiltration coefficient is lower and the confluence is faster while in the scope of natural land types such as grassland and bare soil the initial infiltration ratio tends to be higher accordingly the study area can be divided into five subareas in which subareas a and b are mountainous in the city in these districts there are few drainage networks and altimetric points and the main land use types of these two subareas are grassland and wood as shown in fig 6 b rainwater mostly flows to other subareas due to the high terrain and pluvial floods do not often occur in these regions subarea c whose main land use type is road is located between two mountains and most of the rainwater flows to subarea d and subarea e through the drainage network since the surface elevation of this area is relatively high so it is not easily inundated there are a number of urban communities in subareas d and e with relatively low terrain which are vulnerable to flood risk subarea e is used as the key research area with the lowest terrain in these areas and the water level of manhole and water depth monitoring devices were installed in the pipe network and road areas in general rainwater flows from subareas a and b to c and then to d and e through the ground and underground pipe network when it rains historical pluvial flood records table 1 also indicate that subareas d and e have been prone to urban floods in the past five years 3 2 dem processing different interpolation methods were adopted to reconstruct the urban terrain fig 7 shows the dem results processed by different methods the dem was reconstructed using kriging and idw interpolation methods based on the artificially measured altimetric elevation points the study area was divided into grids with a size of 5m for each grid point 12 nearest manhole ground elevation points are selected as reference points and kriging and idw methods are used for interpolation to reconstruct the dem the kriging and idw dems as shown in fig 7 a and b can represent the elevation change trend in the road range within subarea e compared with the raw dem however the elevation beyond the road range is still interpolated referring to the elevation points within the search radius leading to the fact that the elevation of some areas outside the street is close to that of the street this increases the likelihood of surface overflowing into building areas when these dem data are used for simulation moreover the elevation in the area far from the elevation points subareas a and b is highly distorted and its distribution shows an abrupt linear ridge due to the lack of adjacent elevation point data for searching and matching therefore a multisource data fusion scheme based on kriging and idw interpolation methods is proposed namely mdf kriging and mdf idw first the study area is divided into three parts in consideration of different land cover types roads buildings and others then the nearest distance interpolation is used to reconstruct terrain in the road region by referring to 12 nearest manhole ground elevation points and the elevation vertical increment is carried out in the building region after that the elevation data within the study area are resampled d 5 m to obtain discrete elevation points finally the spatial interpolation methods kriging and idw d 2 m are used to reconstruct the terrain by referring to the 12 nearest elevation points the reconstructed dems are shown in fig 7 d and e respectively compared with raw dem and the dem processed by kriging and idw interpolation the dem by mdf kriging and mdf idw methods on the one hand can accurately characterize the elevation change trend in the street range whether along the road direction or in the cross on the other hand the abrupt elevation changes of buildings can also be well represented which avoids the low elevation description around the road boundary caused by the lack of interpolation points in conventional methods in addition the elevation features of mountainous areas are retained in the nonpluvial flood areas such as subareas a and b it is also found that the elevation value changes rapidly when the building boundary exceeds the region therefore this approach also strongly relies on the accuracy of the road and building boundaries fig 8 shows the proportion of elevation ranges of the dem with different methods in terms of the description of low elevations 7 5 m for the raw dem the area of elevation less than 7 m is 0 and the proportion in the range of 7 m 7 5 m is 0 39 however the share of altimetric points less than 7 5 m is approximately 1 5 obviously the low range elevation terrain description of the raw dem is unacceptable the dem obtained with kriging and idw methods compared with raw dem of which the proportion of less than 7 0 m increased slightly 1 94 1 78 while the proportion in the range of 7 0 m 7 5 m increased to 20 32 25 62 respectively with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods there was almost no increase in the range of less than 7 0 m 0 and 0 01 respectively while the proportion in the range of 7 0 m 7 5 m was increased to 6 67 and 6 75 respectively to a certain extent kriging and idw methods extend the elevation of points within the street to the area outside the street resulting in a large unreasonable increase in the proportion of low elevation areas the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods effectively avoid mistakes due to voids in the data kriging and idw methods lead to elevation distortions in mountainous areas buildings and other areas lacking elevation data therefore in the relatively high elevation range 8 5 m the area ratio of the raw dem 63 08 is reduced to 23 and 14 with the kriging and idw methods respectively in contrast the proportion with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods increased to 83 30 and 83 73 respectively which was largely affected by the elevation of the building range it is noteworthy that in the middle elevation range 7 5 m 8 5 m the proportion remained below 7 with both traditional and data fusion methods overall compared with the raw dem the kriging and idw methods significantly increase the area ratio of elevation 8 5 m which is close to altimetric points mdf kriging and mdf idw increased the proportion of that near road height suitably 7 m 8 m while the proportion of intermediate elevation 8 m 8 5 m decreased 3 3 construction of the pluvial flood model in this study a 1d 2d coupled pluvial flood simulation model was constructed the study area is divided into 2032 subcatchments and the 2d grid resolution is set to 2 m rainfall is set as typhoon lupit fig 9 5 august 2021 151 mm in 24 hours for the simulation of this study to exclude the influence of terrain factors on the simulation results of the pluvial flood process and ensure that the simulation of the rainwater drainage process in the pipeline before the overflow process is accurate the model is calibrated and evaluated before the manhole overflow nse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and mse mean squared error are used to evaluate the simulation before overflowing 17 mse 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 18 nse 1 t 1 n y t y t 2 t 1 n y t y t 2 where n denotes the number of monitoring data y t denotes the actual value of the monitoring point y denotes the simulation value of the monitoring point and y t denotes the average actual value of the monitoring point the range of the nse value is and the closer to 1 the nse is the better performance the simulation result shows while mse 0 represents a perfect fit between the prediction and observation the results show that the nse of all the simulations before the manhole water level rises beyond the ground are 0 97 and mse is 0 0002 which proves that the simulation results of the drainage models are reliable 4 results the simulation results are compared with the observation data of monitoring points p1 for manhole water level and p2 for ground flood depth to evaluate the accuracy of the models and the process rationality of the simulations is assessed 4 1 the results of water level at the monitoring point the rainfall of typhoon lupit 5 august 2021 is set as the precipitation input and the monitoring water level of the p1 manhole and flood depth of p2 are taken as the observations to evaluate the simulation performances fig 10 shows the simulation results of typhoon lupit where fig 10 a shows the analysis of the simulated water level of manhole p1 the monitoring water level increased beyond the ground elevation 7 15 m at 12 40 and the peak time was 13 20 with a peak level of 7 76 m that is the maximum flood depth of p1 was 0 61 m at 14 40 the water level decreased to 7 14 m and the overflow duration at p1 was 2 hours nse and mse are used to evaluate the simulation results and found that there was no significant difference among the five models compared with the raw dem simulation results whether using the kriging 0 009 and idw 0 010 methods or using the mdf kriging 0 010 and mdf idw 0 011 methods the accuracy is only slightly improved when using nse as the evaluation index a similar conclusion is drawn therefore there is a need to adopt more appropriate indicators to evaluate the simulation results in the hazard assessment of urban pluvial floods the temporospatial pattern of flood prediction is of fundamental importance therefore the simulation performance is evaluated in terms of the peak water level error pwe and its delay time dt 19 pwe z s z o 20 dt t s t o the result table 2 indicates that the simulation of the peak water level of p1 with raw dem is unacceptable pwe 0 17 m which is much lower than the observed peak water level the peak water level errors of the other four methods decreased for the kriging and idw methods the pwe values are 0 1 m and 0 14 m respectively compared with the raw dem the performances are slightly improved but the results are lower than the observations and obviously unsatisfactory while it is difficult to optimize the simulations simply by adjusting the model parameters by comparison the peak water levels of the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods are significantly increased with pwe s of 0 04 m and 0 06 m slightly higher than the observations in terms of peak water level time the results show little difference between each model the dt s of the raw dem mdf kriging and mdf idw methods were 10 min synchronously although the kriging method performs well in pwe its dt is maximal 20 min while the dt of the idw method is the minimal 5 min additionally the peak water level time of each simulation is earlier than the observation one conjecture is that it is not entirely reasonable to characterize the current rainfall as the observed rainfall is the cumulative value of 10 minutes prior to the current moment although the water level is instantaneous therefore the actual rainfall characteristics should be slightly earlier than the observed time and the simulated peak value should also be appropriately advanced considering this factor the dt of mdf kriging and mdf idw methods are less than 10 min and the simulation results are acceptable table 3 shows the flood simulation results evaluation of ground point p2 different methods bring certain changes to the elevation of point p2 compared with the raw dem 7 47 m the elevation of p2 with kriging and idw decreases significantly by 0 23 m and 0 19 m respectively and the elevation changes of point p2 with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods are modest 7 40 m and 7 46 m respectively table 4 rwe are used to evaluate the simulation results to avoid the negative influence of redundant observation data of 0 21 rwe d s d o d o 100 d s and d o denote the peak water depth of the p2 simulation and observation respectively fig 10 b shows the p2 water depth process of the simulation and observation overall the correction methods can significantly reduce the peak errors the observation peak water depth is 0 55 m by comparison the simulated water level using raw dem is much lower than the observation and the rwe is 65 5 the rwe s of kriging and idw are 14 5 and 43 6 respectively surprisingly the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods control this error at 5 5 and 1 8 respectively which are 50 0 and 63 7 higher than those with the raw dem in terms of temporal analysis the monitoring data show that the time of peak water depth is at 13 10 although the kriging method performed best in nse 0 84 its delay time was the worst 40 min it is unacceptable in forecasting and leads to improper dispatch and scheduling recommendations the dt of the idw method is 30 mins which is also 20 mins more than those of mdf kriging and mdf idw the possible reason is that the kriging and idw methods flatten the topography and enlarge the flood area resulting in a lower flow speed thereby delaying the arrival of peak water levels therefore the difference in the peak water depth results is caused by two aspects first under different dems the elevations of the water depth monitoring points are discrepant second different dems lead to inconsistent flood processes overall the results indicate that the performance of the raw data dem is poor in the peak water depth error and the kriging and idw methods bring a modest improvement in the error of the peak water depth but the time result is not reliable the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods show remarkable improvement and stable control of the simulation peak water depth and time accuracy 4 2 effects of different methods on the flood range process three lines of subarea e are used to compare the section levels and flood levels with different dem reconstruction methods fig 11 along the road central line compared with mdf dems common kriging and idw dems are smoother in the directions of across the roads when exceeding the road range the mdf dems show sudden upward trend which can correctly reflect the impact of roadside stones and building exterior walls however as well as the flood elevations the corrected dems the are significantly lower than the raw dem in both the long and across road directions figs 12 14 fig 15 shows no obvious correlation between the area of streets and the flood distribution with the raw dem the distribution of the flood area is irregular and scattered which also exists within the road and building areas the flood first appears around the boundary of the street in a sense this result might be reasonable because the ditches or rain grates are usually designed on both sides of the road however the simulated water depth is more in the range of 0 1 m 0 5 m and the areas with larger depths 0 5 m are concentrated between roads and buildings with kriging and idw methods it is indicated that the simulated flood range is centred on the lowest point of the road and gradually extends to the surrounding area although in some cases it is difficult to determine whether the flood flows into the building area through the exterior wall the runoff of the kriging and idw methods is far beyond the road range with flood depths of 0 3 m 0 5 m leading to unreasonable flood area expansion additionally kriging and idw methods show a certain delay compared with the actual situation when describing the peak risk fig 16 with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods the water inundation area is mainly within the road meanwhile compared with raw dem simulation the continuity of flood distribution is reasonable additionally the simulation results show that the time of the maximum flooding range is approximately 13 30 which reduces the peak time error compared with the kriging and idw methods fig 17 in general the simulation results show that the kriging and idw methods enlarge the inundation range but delay the peak time the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods reduce the randomness and discontinuity of flood spatial distribution 5 discussion the quality of dem determines the accuracy of flood simulation to a considerable degree whether based on mechanism or data driven method mediero et al 2022 previous researches show that the accuracy of waterlogging simulation is positively correlated with the resolution of dem chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2022 for urban areas with complex landcover type conditions it is also important to propose methods to improve the vertical accuracy of dem before our method proposed some exploratory studies were also attempted such as 3d reconstruction using uav to improve the accuracy of river channel flood simulation parizi et al 2022 however research shows that point cloud data still needs to be post processed to meet the requirements of urban waterlogging simulation such as filtering ajibola et al 2019 papaioannou et al 2013 or use 3d urban pluvial flood simulation model adaptively kim and lee 2021 however these works have proved to be complex and lack of datum elevation data for verification therefore how to make full use of multisource dem data and conduct data fusion is worth focusing on although it is realized that the results of monitoring points have been improved greatly through our method which reduces the accidental error the effect of reducing the systematic error is not confirmed therefore the implications of the dem modified algorithm for systematic error are analysed by comparing the proportion of each elevation range of the flood area fig 18 shows the area statistics of different depth ranges within subarea e the flood area with the raw dem is 4 58 ha and the water depth is mainly in the range from 0 1 m to 0 3 m the kriging and idw methods greatly increase the flood area and the proportion of the water depth in the range of 0 3 m 0 5 m the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods keep the flood area close to the original simulation but increase the proportion of the water depth over 0 5 m for the simulation results of different methods as shown in fig 19 while the raw dem simulation result shows even elevation distribution of flooded area proportion the ground elevation of flooded area with any interpolated method is mainly within the range of 7 0 7 5 m and the proportions are all over 43 for the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods although the proportion of the elevation area in the region is only increased by 6 28 and 6 36 in the calculation of pluvial floods this proportion is increased by 47 57 and 48 34 respectively in contrast in the raw dem simulation results only 1 1 of the water is accumulated within the elevation range of less than 7 5 m in addition the surface elevation ratios from high to low are 7 5 8 m 36 87 8 8 5 m 33 63 and 8 5 m 28 33 and the proportions are similar these results indicate that raw data have a systematic elevation error in the street area and its value is higher than the real surface elevation data which leads to the far lower water depth in the simulation results than the monitoring value therefore it could be inferred that the interpolation algorithm can reduce the systematic error caused by surface elevation in the simulations compared with traditional dem interpolation methods multisource data fusion interpolation can effectively avoid the unreasonable distribution characteristics of pluvial floods as it is presumed that the boundary of the buildings is external walls the default is the inability for the water to flow into the house thus this method is mainly applicable to the simulation of the minor pluvial flood or that occurs in the roads in reality if the flood is too serious and flows into the buildings through the facades even into the underground space such as underground parking garages underground tunnels etc leading to a deeper but smaller area flood simulation result it would require us to acquire more longitudinal spatial data and put forward novel simulation methods according to different spatial utilizations additionally table 5 shows the flood duration fd of each simulation 22 fd d s d o to avoid monitoring errors an inundation depth of 0 1 m is set as the threshold that is d s and d o denote the duration of the simulation and observation respectively while the depth is over 0 1 m the d o values of points p1 and p2 are 90 mins and 120 mins respectively the results show that the simulation results of the multisource data fusion method do not show obvious advantages compared with the traditional method in contrast the original interpolation algorithm especially the kriging method performs better in the inundation duration error however these errors might be reduced to a certain extent by optimizing the model parameters undoubtedly the research method proposed in this study would inevitably introduce multisource error while introducing multisource data therefore the simulation accuracy also depends on the accuracy of land cover type data and altimetric point elevation data to a great extent using the land cover type data as an example as shown in fig 20 the poor performance in building division leads to excessive building scope and unreasonably increases the elevation within certain road areas consequently it should be concerned that how to reduce multi source errors 6 conclusions dem play a significant role in urban waterlogging simulation to reduce the urban pluvial flood simulation error caused by insufficient vertical accuracy of the dem data a terrain reconstruction method based on multisource data fusion mdf was proposed with the concept of restricted intervals the mdf method was combined with traditional kriging and idw methods in this study and it was confirmed that the proposed method perform better for the 1d 2d coupled simulation of pluvial floods the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the dem reconstruction method used in this study has proved to be successful in improving the accuracy of waterlogging simulation compared with the raw dem and the traditional kriging and idw methods the simulation with mdf kriging and mdf idw significantly improved both the water level of the 1d manhole 0 06m and 0 08m and the water depth of the 2d overflow 5 and 23 achieving stable control of the peak time error 2 terrain reconstruction effectively reduces the systematic flood depth error caused by the insufficient accuracy of dem data in the simulation compared with raw dem the elevation of the flood area simulated by the reconstructed terrain shows more obvious correlation with the low elevation area 3 the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods improve the temporospatial distribution of the flood process the raw dem leads to scattered flood distribution irrationally the conventional interpolation method improves the continuity of flood distribution while the flat terrain will lead to the expansion of the simulated flood range and the reduction of the flood depth dem reconstructed based on multisource data fusion method is proved to be effective in reducing the uncertainty of urban pluvial flood simulation this research could be regarded as the starting point of the research on multi source data fusion dem for urban pluvial flood simulation the method on making full use of more advanced 3d reconstruction tools to obtain more effective terrain data while reducing the multi source error will be studied in the future credit authorship contribution

2465,a digital elevation model dem is crucial for hydraulic hydrodynamic simulation of urban pluvial flooding to reduce the simulation error caused by the low resolution and poor vertical accuracy of dem data a novel urban terrain reconstruction method is proposed based on multisource data fusion mdf a 1d 2d coupled pluvial flood model under the typhoon rainfall scenario is built to verify the superiority of the proposed method the results show that the systematic elevation error of terrain is reduced with mdf kriging and mdf idw and the performances of simulations are improved by 5 and 23 in terms of peak water level error compared to using conventional kriging and idw methods and by 0 13m and 0 11m in terms of manhole water level accuracy compared to using raw dem moreover the temporospatial patterns of the flooding simulation results are more rational with the scattered flooding eliminated and the proportion of flood area with ground elevation lower than 8 m increased from 37 9 to 92 34 and 89 33 respectively this method is proven to be a notably effective and low cost dem reconstruction method for improving the accuracy of urban pluvial flooding simulation keywords urban pluvial flooding dem multisource data fusion terrain reconstruction method flooding simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under the dual effects of global climate change and urbanization urban pluvial flooding disasters occur more frequently resulting in significant economic and societal losses o donnell and thorne 2020 the water problem has become one of the constraints of urban development and sustainability of human society zinatloo ajabshir et al 2021 thus it is of great importance to predict pluvial flood processes accurately and quickly which is strategic for making scientific decisions in flood control operations in advance strengthen urban environmental remediation zinatloo ajabshir et al 2017 and improving social sustainability and resistance capability ma et al 2021 ostad ali as 2022 su et al 2016 common urban pluvial flooding simulation methods include hydrological hydrodynamic models and machine learning models the general approach of hydrological hydrodynamic urban flood model calculates runoff and infiltration using hydrological models describes the flow process of a drainage pipeline by solving the one dimensional saint venant equation and simulates overflow by solving the two dimensional hydrodynamics equation dong et al 2022 ostad ali askari 2022 quan et al 2010 tang et al 2019 tu et al 2020 machine learning models are based on data analysis of flood processes chen et al 2021 guo et al 2022 ostad ali askari and shayannejad 2021 while the machine learning method is considered to be one of the most efficient methods munawar et al 2021 the hydrological hydrodynamic model is generally believed to be a more reliable and accurate method to simulate urban pluvial flooding results of which are comprehensively explainable during the process of building an urban pluvial flooding hydrodynamic model a digital elevation model is one of the most important input conditions and its data vertical accuracy directly affects the simulation results fereshtehpour and karamouz 2018 saksena and merwade 2015 therefore high precision dem data are crucial to accurately characterize the process of urban pluvial flooding and recognize the scope and depth of pluvial flooding the universally effective urban terrain reconstruction method to improve the accuracy of urban pluvial flooding simulation is a challenging task that has attracted the attention of numerous scholars and researchers in recent years avand et al 2022 chen et al 2018 hou et al 2021 muthusamy et al 2021 xing et al 2022 for urban pluvial flood simulation the characteristics of urban terrain are as follows 1 vertical mutability in the lateral direction due to the existence of urban artificial structures such as buildings roads and squares the topography of the city would change locally around the structural edges the conventional interpolation algorithms for terrain reconstruction make the topography smoother so the dem has difficulty describing the sudden elevation change in the horizontal direction 2 insignificant elevation changes within the urban roads urban terrain tends to be flatter than mountainous areas especially in plain or seashore cities which requires a more accurate elevation description of the main urban roads when constructing the pluvial flood model however the research of the dem on urban waterlogging mainly focuses on horizontal accuracy while the research on vertical accuracy is relatively insufficient according to existing studies there are two main methods to construct an urban terrain the first is surveying and mapping and the other is dem fusion for surveying and mapping remote sensing and photogrammetry can deliver fundamental dem in the wide area such terrasar x and tandem x however the resolution of the dem by these methods can only reach 10 m 30 m which is of great significance for hydrologic model of wide basins talebmorad and ostad ali askari 2022 but unable to meet the accuracy requirement of urban pluvial flood model leandro et al 2016 recent years the exploratory studies of urban terrain construction by means of uav tilt photography ajibola et al 2019 chen et al 2018 huang et al 2020 and laser radar mapping chu et al 2014 slatton et al 2001 are carried out by comparison these dem data have been proven to be highly precise with a resolution of 5 cm however dem reconstruction through these state of art technologies is extremely costly and time consuming which limits their application and further promotion in addition the dem data with these approaches consume considerable memory space to obtain accurate data when the resolution is much higher than the grid resolution of the pluvial flood model which is a redundancy for the flood model furthermore these models still retain the noisy data such as viaducts and woods which is unfavorable for waterlogging flooding simulation dem fusion okolie and smit 2022 is defined as the synergistic integration of two or more source dems using a certain algorithm to generate an improved dem that is more detailed than each of the sources common dem fusion methods include simple averaging leitao and de sousa 2018 weighted averaging bagheri et al 2018 pham et al 2018 variational models kuschk and d angelo 2013 wang et al 2020 kalman filtering slatton et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 and multiple point geostatistical simulation tang et al 2015 in recent years dem generation from multisource data have been proposed to improve the accuracy of dem and reduce the reconstruction cost li et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 apart from the conventional fusion methods some innovative urban terrain reconstruction methods for flood simulation have been proposed such as through a gis based dem correction method xing et al 2022 these works have proved to be effective for improving the performance of flood simulation but still inadequate for describing the urban terrain spatial heterogeneity with different data source comprehensively to improve the accuracy of dem data and reduce the error of urban pluvial flood simulation this study proposes a terrain reconstruction method based on multisource data fusion with the concept of restricted intervals fuzhou was selected as the case study area in section 2 the urban dem reconstruction method based on multisource data fusion is proposed and the urban pluvial simulation method is explained in section 3 a region in fuzhou is used as an example to reconstruct the terrain and the 1d 2d coupled urban pluvial model is built the typhoon lupit is set as the rainfall event in section 4 and 5 the accuracy of pluvial flood simulation results based on different dems and the applicability of our method are discussed finally in section 6 a summary is presented 2 method as shown in fig 1 a 1d 2d coupled hydraulic urban pluvial flooding model will be built to verify the superiorities of the method proposed in this study the two most critical and difficult steps are terrain reconstruction and urban pluvial flood modelling dems are reconstructed with multisource data using gis tools and the 1d 2d coupled flood model is established using storm water management model coupled integrated terrestrial fluxes model swmm itf 2 1 terrain construction urban terrain is complex due to the existence of artificial buildings while conventional interpolation methods usually smooth the terrain therefore a multisource data fusion terrain reconstruction method combining urban elevation points landcover and raw dem data is proposed to improve the description of vertical mutation fig 2 the description of reconstruction methods in this study is as follows 2 1 1 conventional interpolation methods 1 kriging the kriging method a spatial local interpolation is an algorithm of optimal unbiased estimation for regionalized variables in finite regions the semivariation function γ h are as follows 1 γ h 1 2 z h z x h 2 assume that there are n reference points in the neighbourhood of the interpolated point x the regionalized variable z x takes the value of z x i at the reference point x i i 1 2 3 n and the interpolation estimate z x is determined by the weighted summation of the above n known variable values which is defined as follows 2 z x i 1 n λ i z x i where z x is the estimated value of the interpolated point n is the number of reference points z x i is the value of point i and λ i is a set of weight coefficients of point i the set of weight coefficients is defined as follows 3 i 1 n λ i γ x i x j u x j x 0 j 1 n 4 i 1 n λ i 1 where u denotes the lagrange multiplier 2 idw the inverse distance weighting idw method based on tobler s first law the first law of geography is a common spatial interpolation algorithm that is widely used in the interpolation or extrapolation of spatial point data information assuming that a 1 a n are n given points a is the point to be interpolated and the distance between a 1 a n and a is d 1 d n the reciprocal summation of the distances is 5 d i 1 n 1 d i 6 a i 1 d i d 7 z x i 1 n a i z x i where z x and z x i denote the values of points to be interpolated and given points respectively 2 1 2 method proposed in this study common spatial interpolation methods li and heap 2014 such as kriging interpolation and idw interpolation are highly dependent on the density of the reference point and the distance between the interpolation point and reference points when the interpolation points are far from the reference points the reliability of the interpolation result decreases rapidly in the study of pluvial flood simulation on the one hand urban vertical spatial altimetric elevation points such as the altimetric points of the manhole ground elevation are highly concentrated in road areas rather than in the mountain region of the city on the other hand due to the vertical mutability characteristic of urban terrain such as roadside stones and building exterior walls topographic features are distinct from random spatial changes in the natural environment therefore it is difficult to describe the characteristics of urban elevation change directly using common interpolation methods for terrain reconstruction to avoid the voids caused by an insufficient density of given altimetric points and correctly describe the topographic features of the city a multisource data fusion interpolation method is proposed for urban terrain reconstruction assuming that the resolution of the raw dem is d a raster is constructed with a grid size of d in the study area which d 2 d requires the study area is divided into three parts road building and others in consideration of different land cover types within the scope of the roads the discrete altimetric points are used as reference points to assign values to each grid with the nearest neighbour interpolation method within the scope of the buildings the elevation corresponding to each grid is increased by h from the original raw dem value h 10 m in this study in other areas the raw dem is kept as the corresponding elevation value unchanged then the dems are merged as a whole in this way for each point x in the merged raster the corresponding elevation is 8 z road x z x i 9 z building x z x 0 h 10 z others x z x 0 where z road x z building x and z others x are elevation values of points in the range of roads buildings and other land cover types respectively x i denotes the nearest given elevation altimetric point to x in the road range and x 0 denotes the elevation value corresponding to raw dem in the position of x the grid points are defined of the merged raster as x j finally another raster is constructed with a grid size of d the grid points x j of the merged raster are used as the reference points to assign values of the raster with a conventional interpolation method the elevation of each grid point is 11 z x m j 1 n ε j z x j where x m denotes each grid point interpolated point n denotes the number of reference points z x j is the elevation value of x m and ε j is the weight coefficient calculated by the selected interpolation method in this study n is 16 to ensure that the distance between the interpolated point and the reference point is less than 2 d the merit of our method is that when the number of reference points is determined it is ensured that the reference points of each interpolated point must exist and the relative position is determined with certainty it is equivalent to constructing a restricted interval such that any interpolated point can only be affected by reference elevation points in a limited space range this is of great significance for terrain reconstruction around the boundary of different land cover types especially the region between roads and other types as shown in fig 3 the elevation of reference points within the roads is closer to elevation altimetric point 1 in the range outside the road due to the vertical mutability the elevation of the reference points is higher than the road elevation if the conventional interpolation method is adopted to reconstruct the terrain the elevation value of the point to be interpolated will be affected by the elevation altimetric points both inside and outside the road at the same time whether they are in the roads the conventional interpolation result tends to be smooth and is difficult to reflect the vertical mutation of the terrain by using the method of multisource data fusion with restricted intervals for the boundary area of the road only if there are reference points both inside and outside the road should the influence of vertical mutation on the elevation of the interpolated point be considered if there are only inside road reference points within the restricted interval the influence of elevation points outside the road is not considered 2 2 hydraulic model 2 2 1 1d conduit drainage pipe model one dimensional saint venant equations are used to describe the flow in the urban drainage pipe network gironas et al 2010 12 a t q x 0 13 q t g a h x g a s f q 2 a x where x is the distance t is the time q is the volumetric flow rate a is the flow area h is the hydraulic head of water in the conduit s f is the friction slope and g is the acceleration of gravity 2 2 2 2d hydraulic model the two dimensional hydraulic model is used to simulate the overland flow process due to the indistinctive change in urban terrain and the absence of shock waves or rapidly varied flow in urban pluvial floods the storage cell method is used to simulate the overland flow process the study area is divided into rectangular cells the governing equation is 14 δ h δ t δ v δ x δ y where δ h denotes the change in cell water depth δ v denotes the change in cell volume δ t denotes the time interval and x and y denote the orthogonal directions the flow of two adjacent cells is calculated using the saint venant inertial equation 15 q t δ t q t g h flow δ t s surf 1 g n 2 δ t h flow 7 3 where q t is the flow rate on the boundary of adjacent cells g is the gravity acceleration n is the roughness s surf is the water level gradient of the adjacent units and h flow is the water flow depth at the interface of the adjacent cells which is defined as follows 16 h flow max h 1 z 1 h 2 z 2 max z 1 z 2 where h 1 and z 1 h 2 and z 2 denote the water depth and ground elevation of the two adjacent cells respectively 3 case study 3 1 study area the study area is located in fuzhou city fujian province china 26 08 n 119 28 e as shown in fig 4 the study area is approximately 6 36 km2 with a total of 2034 conduits 2032 manholes and 12 outfalls the data related to manholes include the bottom elevation and top elevation so they can be used as the reference for terrain reconstruction fig 4 b represents the original dem with a resolution of 2 m 2 m generally it can be determined from this figure that the elevations of subareas a and b are much higher than those of the other subareas however the elevation change trend of subarea e is not as visible and the minimum ground elevation is 7 15 m which is much higher than the minimum value of the measured elevation namely 6 85 m indicating that raw dem data are subject to random errors meanwhile the buildings whose facades block the run off flow cause a sudden change in elevation outside the street limits however these characteristics have not been well expressed in raw dem data fig 5 shows the distribution of monitoring points and drainage networks in the study area p1 is the water level monitoring of a manhole the p1 manhole is the penultimate along the drainage pipe and its ground surface elevation is 7 14 m which is the lowest one of the main conduits therefore when heavy rainfall occurs the underground drainage water would overflow from the p1 manhole with a high probability the overflow water depth monitoring point is established at p2 where the ground elevation is 7 45 m however this elevation is not the lowest point within the study area the lowest point in the study area is located at p3 and its ground surface elevation is 6 85 m consequently when the local overflow water depth is low the pluvial flood process in the study area may not be monitored urban land cover types are extremely complex including mountains green space roads buildings etc the hydraulic parameters such as runoff and confluence parameters corresponding to different land cover types are not consistent overall in the scope of artificial land such as roads buildings etc the infiltration coefficient is lower and the confluence is faster while in the scope of natural land types such as grassland and bare soil the initial infiltration ratio tends to be higher accordingly the study area can be divided into five subareas in which subareas a and b are mountainous in the city in these districts there are few drainage networks and altimetric points and the main land use types of these two subareas are grassland and wood as shown in fig 6 b rainwater mostly flows to other subareas due to the high terrain and pluvial floods do not often occur in these regions subarea c whose main land use type is road is located between two mountains and most of the rainwater flows to subarea d and subarea e through the drainage network since the surface elevation of this area is relatively high so it is not easily inundated there are a number of urban communities in subareas d and e with relatively low terrain which are vulnerable to flood risk subarea e is used as the key research area with the lowest terrain in these areas and the water level of manhole and water depth monitoring devices were installed in the pipe network and road areas in general rainwater flows from subareas a and b to c and then to d and e through the ground and underground pipe network when it rains historical pluvial flood records table 1 also indicate that subareas d and e have been prone to urban floods in the past five years 3 2 dem processing different interpolation methods were adopted to reconstruct the urban terrain fig 7 shows the dem results processed by different methods the dem was reconstructed using kriging and idw interpolation methods based on the artificially measured altimetric elevation points the study area was divided into grids with a size of 5m for each grid point 12 nearest manhole ground elevation points are selected as reference points and kriging and idw methods are used for interpolation to reconstruct the dem the kriging and idw dems as shown in fig 7 a and b can represent the elevation change trend in the road range within subarea e compared with the raw dem however the elevation beyond the road range is still interpolated referring to the elevation points within the search radius leading to the fact that the elevation of some areas outside the street is close to that of the street this increases the likelihood of surface overflowing into building areas when these dem data are used for simulation moreover the elevation in the area far from the elevation points subareas a and b is highly distorted and its distribution shows an abrupt linear ridge due to the lack of adjacent elevation point data for searching and matching therefore a multisource data fusion scheme based on kriging and idw interpolation methods is proposed namely mdf kriging and mdf idw first the study area is divided into three parts in consideration of different land cover types roads buildings and others then the nearest distance interpolation is used to reconstruct terrain in the road region by referring to 12 nearest manhole ground elevation points and the elevation vertical increment is carried out in the building region after that the elevation data within the study area are resampled d 5 m to obtain discrete elevation points finally the spatial interpolation methods kriging and idw d 2 m are used to reconstruct the terrain by referring to the 12 nearest elevation points the reconstructed dems are shown in fig 7 d and e respectively compared with raw dem and the dem processed by kriging and idw interpolation the dem by mdf kriging and mdf idw methods on the one hand can accurately characterize the elevation change trend in the street range whether along the road direction or in the cross on the other hand the abrupt elevation changes of buildings can also be well represented which avoids the low elevation description around the road boundary caused by the lack of interpolation points in conventional methods in addition the elevation features of mountainous areas are retained in the nonpluvial flood areas such as subareas a and b it is also found that the elevation value changes rapidly when the building boundary exceeds the region therefore this approach also strongly relies on the accuracy of the road and building boundaries fig 8 shows the proportion of elevation ranges of the dem with different methods in terms of the description of low elevations 7 5 m for the raw dem the area of elevation less than 7 m is 0 and the proportion in the range of 7 m 7 5 m is 0 39 however the share of altimetric points less than 7 5 m is approximately 1 5 obviously the low range elevation terrain description of the raw dem is unacceptable the dem obtained with kriging and idw methods compared with raw dem of which the proportion of less than 7 0 m increased slightly 1 94 1 78 while the proportion in the range of 7 0 m 7 5 m increased to 20 32 25 62 respectively with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods there was almost no increase in the range of less than 7 0 m 0 and 0 01 respectively while the proportion in the range of 7 0 m 7 5 m was increased to 6 67 and 6 75 respectively to a certain extent kriging and idw methods extend the elevation of points within the street to the area outside the street resulting in a large unreasonable increase in the proportion of low elevation areas the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods effectively avoid mistakes due to voids in the data kriging and idw methods lead to elevation distortions in mountainous areas buildings and other areas lacking elevation data therefore in the relatively high elevation range 8 5 m the area ratio of the raw dem 63 08 is reduced to 23 and 14 with the kriging and idw methods respectively in contrast the proportion with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods increased to 83 30 and 83 73 respectively which was largely affected by the elevation of the building range it is noteworthy that in the middle elevation range 7 5 m 8 5 m the proportion remained below 7 with both traditional and data fusion methods overall compared with the raw dem the kriging and idw methods significantly increase the area ratio of elevation 8 5 m which is close to altimetric points mdf kriging and mdf idw increased the proportion of that near road height suitably 7 m 8 m while the proportion of intermediate elevation 8 m 8 5 m decreased 3 3 construction of the pluvial flood model in this study a 1d 2d coupled pluvial flood simulation model was constructed the study area is divided into 2032 subcatchments and the 2d grid resolution is set to 2 m rainfall is set as typhoon lupit fig 9 5 august 2021 151 mm in 24 hours for the simulation of this study to exclude the influence of terrain factors on the simulation results of the pluvial flood process and ensure that the simulation of the rainwater drainage process in the pipeline before the overflow process is accurate the model is calibrated and evaluated before the manhole overflow nse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and mse mean squared error are used to evaluate the simulation before overflowing 17 mse 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 18 nse 1 t 1 n y t y t 2 t 1 n y t y t 2 where n denotes the number of monitoring data y t denotes the actual value of the monitoring point y denotes the simulation value of the monitoring point and y t denotes the average actual value of the monitoring point the range of the nse value is and the closer to 1 the nse is the better performance the simulation result shows while mse 0 represents a perfect fit between the prediction and observation the results show that the nse of all the simulations before the manhole water level rises beyond the ground are 0 97 and mse is 0 0002 which proves that the simulation results of the drainage models are reliable 4 results the simulation results are compared with the observation data of monitoring points p1 for manhole water level and p2 for ground flood depth to evaluate the accuracy of the models and the process rationality of the simulations is assessed 4 1 the results of water level at the monitoring point the rainfall of typhoon lupit 5 august 2021 is set as the precipitation input and the monitoring water level of the p1 manhole and flood depth of p2 are taken as the observations to evaluate the simulation performances fig 10 shows the simulation results of typhoon lupit where fig 10 a shows the analysis of the simulated water level of manhole p1 the monitoring water level increased beyond the ground elevation 7 15 m at 12 40 and the peak time was 13 20 with a peak level of 7 76 m that is the maximum flood depth of p1 was 0 61 m at 14 40 the water level decreased to 7 14 m and the overflow duration at p1 was 2 hours nse and mse are used to evaluate the simulation results and found that there was no significant difference among the five models compared with the raw dem simulation results whether using the kriging 0 009 and idw 0 010 methods or using the mdf kriging 0 010 and mdf idw 0 011 methods the accuracy is only slightly improved when using nse as the evaluation index a similar conclusion is drawn therefore there is a need to adopt more appropriate indicators to evaluate the simulation results in the hazard assessment of urban pluvial floods the temporospatial pattern of flood prediction is of fundamental importance therefore the simulation performance is evaluated in terms of the peak water level error pwe and its delay time dt 19 pwe z s z o 20 dt t s t o the result table 2 indicates that the simulation of the peak water level of p1 with raw dem is unacceptable pwe 0 17 m which is much lower than the observed peak water level the peak water level errors of the other four methods decreased for the kriging and idw methods the pwe values are 0 1 m and 0 14 m respectively compared with the raw dem the performances are slightly improved but the results are lower than the observations and obviously unsatisfactory while it is difficult to optimize the simulations simply by adjusting the model parameters by comparison the peak water levels of the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods are significantly increased with pwe s of 0 04 m and 0 06 m slightly higher than the observations in terms of peak water level time the results show little difference between each model the dt s of the raw dem mdf kriging and mdf idw methods were 10 min synchronously although the kriging method performs well in pwe its dt is maximal 20 min while the dt of the idw method is the minimal 5 min additionally the peak water level time of each simulation is earlier than the observation one conjecture is that it is not entirely reasonable to characterize the current rainfall as the observed rainfall is the cumulative value of 10 minutes prior to the current moment although the water level is instantaneous therefore the actual rainfall characteristics should be slightly earlier than the observed time and the simulated peak value should also be appropriately advanced considering this factor the dt of mdf kriging and mdf idw methods are less than 10 min and the simulation results are acceptable table 3 shows the flood simulation results evaluation of ground point p2 different methods bring certain changes to the elevation of point p2 compared with the raw dem 7 47 m the elevation of p2 with kriging and idw decreases significantly by 0 23 m and 0 19 m respectively and the elevation changes of point p2 with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods are modest 7 40 m and 7 46 m respectively table 4 rwe are used to evaluate the simulation results to avoid the negative influence of redundant observation data of 0 21 rwe d s d o d o 100 d s and d o denote the peak water depth of the p2 simulation and observation respectively fig 10 b shows the p2 water depth process of the simulation and observation overall the correction methods can significantly reduce the peak errors the observation peak water depth is 0 55 m by comparison the simulated water level using raw dem is much lower than the observation and the rwe is 65 5 the rwe s of kriging and idw are 14 5 and 43 6 respectively surprisingly the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods control this error at 5 5 and 1 8 respectively which are 50 0 and 63 7 higher than those with the raw dem in terms of temporal analysis the monitoring data show that the time of peak water depth is at 13 10 although the kriging method performed best in nse 0 84 its delay time was the worst 40 min it is unacceptable in forecasting and leads to improper dispatch and scheduling recommendations the dt of the idw method is 30 mins which is also 20 mins more than those of mdf kriging and mdf idw the possible reason is that the kriging and idw methods flatten the topography and enlarge the flood area resulting in a lower flow speed thereby delaying the arrival of peak water levels therefore the difference in the peak water depth results is caused by two aspects first under different dems the elevations of the water depth monitoring points are discrepant second different dems lead to inconsistent flood processes overall the results indicate that the performance of the raw data dem is poor in the peak water depth error and the kriging and idw methods bring a modest improvement in the error of the peak water depth but the time result is not reliable the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods show remarkable improvement and stable control of the simulation peak water depth and time accuracy 4 2 effects of different methods on the flood range process three lines of subarea e are used to compare the section levels and flood levels with different dem reconstruction methods fig 11 along the road central line compared with mdf dems common kriging and idw dems are smoother in the directions of across the roads when exceeding the road range the mdf dems show sudden upward trend which can correctly reflect the impact of roadside stones and building exterior walls however as well as the flood elevations the corrected dems the are significantly lower than the raw dem in both the long and across road directions figs 12 14 fig 15 shows no obvious correlation between the area of streets and the flood distribution with the raw dem the distribution of the flood area is irregular and scattered which also exists within the road and building areas the flood first appears around the boundary of the street in a sense this result might be reasonable because the ditches or rain grates are usually designed on both sides of the road however the simulated water depth is more in the range of 0 1 m 0 5 m and the areas with larger depths 0 5 m are concentrated between roads and buildings with kriging and idw methods it is indicated that the simulated flood range is centred on the lowest point of the road and gradually extends to the surrounding area although in some cases it is difficult to determine whether the flood flows into the building area through the exterior wall the runoff of the kriging and idw methods is far beyond the road range with flood depths of 0 3 m 0 5 m leading to unreasonable flood area expansion additionally kriging and idw methods show a certain delay compared with the actual situation when describing the peak risk fig 16 with the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods the water inundation area is mainly within the road meanwhile compared with raw dem simulation the continuity of flood distribution is reasonable additionally the simulation results show that the time of the maximum flooding range is approximately 13 30 which reduces the peak time error compared with the kriging and idw methods fig 17 in general the simulation results show that the kriging and idw methods enlarge the inundation range but delay the peak time the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods reduce the randomness and discontinuity of flood spatial distribution 5 discussion the quality of dem determines the accuracy of flood simulation to a considerable degree whether based on mechanism or data driven method mediero et al 2022 previous researches show that the accuracy of waterlogging simulation is positively correlated with the resolution of dem chen et al 2018 jiang et al 2022 for urban areas with complex landcover type conditions it is also important to propose methods to improve the vertical accuracy of dem before our method proposed some exploratory studies were also attempted such as 3d reconstruction using uav to improve the accuracy of river channel flood simulation parizi et al 2022 however research shows that point cloud data still needs to be post processed to meet the requirements of urban waterlogging simulation such as filtering ajibola et al 2019 papaioannou et al 2013 or use 3d urban pluvial flood simulation model adaptively kim and lee 2021 however these works have proved to be complex and lack of datum elevation data for verification therefore how to make full use of multisource dem data and conduct data fusion is worth focusing on although it is realized that the results of monitoring points have been improved greatly through our method which reduces the accidental error the effect of reducing the systematic error is not confirmed therefore the implications of the dem modified algorithm for systematic error are analysed by comparing the proportion of each elevation range of the flood area fig 18 shows the area statistics of different depth ranges within subarea e the flood area with the raw dem is 4 58 ha and the water depth is mainly in the range from 0 1 m to 0 3 m the kriging and idw methods greatly increase the flood area and the proportion of the water depth in the range of 0 3 m 0 5 m the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods keep the flood area close to the original simulation but increase the proportion of the water depth over 0 5 m for the simulation results of different methods as shown in fig 19 while the raw dem simulation result shows even elevation distribution of flooded area proportion the ground elevation of flooded area with any interpolated method is mainly within the range of 7 0 7 5 m and the proportions are all over 43 for the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods although the proportion of the elevation area in the region is only increased by 6 28 and 6 36 in the calculation of pluvial floods this proportion is increased by 47 57 and 48 34 respectively in contrast in the raw dem simulation results only 1 1 of the water is accumulated within the elevation range of less than 7 5 m in addition the surface elevation ratios from high to low are 7 5 8 m 36 87 8 8 5 m 33 63 and 8 5 m 28 33 and the proportions are similar these results indicate that raw data have a systematic elevation error in the street area and its value is higher than the real surface elevation data which leads to the far lower water depth in the simulation results than the monitoring value therefore it could be inferred that the interpolation algorithm can reduce the systematic error caused by surface elevation in the simulations compared with traditional dem interpolation methods multisource data fusion interpolation can effectively avoid the unreasonable distribution characteristics of pluvial floods as it is presumed that the boundary of the buildings is external walls the default is the inability for the water to flow into the house thus this method is mainly applicable to the simulation of the minor pluvial flood or that occurs in the roads in reality if the flood is too serious and flows into the buildings through the facades even into the underground space such as underground parking garages underground tunnels etc leading to a deeper but smaller area flood simulation result it would require us to acquire more longitudinal spatial data and put forward novel simulation methods according to different spatial utilizations additionally table 5 shows the flood duration fd of each simulation 22 fd d s d o to avoid monitoring errors an inundation depth of 0 1 m is set as the threshold that is d s and d o denote the duration of the simulation and observation respectively while the depth is over 0 1 m the d o values of points p1 and p2 are 90 mins and 120 mins respectively the results show that the simulation results of the multisource data fusion method do not show obvious advantages compared with the traditional method in contrast the original interpolation algorithm especially the kriging method performs better in the inundation duration error however these errors might be reduced to a certain extent by optimizing the model parameters undoubtedly the research method proposed in this study would inevitably introduce multisource error while introducing multisource data therefore the simulation accuracy also depends on the accuracy of land cover type data and altimetric point elevation data to a great extent using the land cover type data as an example as shown in fig 20 the poor performance in building division leads to excessive building scope and unreasonably increases the elevation within certain road areas consequently it should be concerned that how to reduce multi source errors 6 conclusions dem play a significant role in urban waterlogging simulation to reduce the urban pluvial flood simulation error caused by insufficient vertical accuracy of the dem data a terrain reconstruction method based on multisource data fusion mdf was proposed with the concept of restricted intervals the mdf method was combined with traditional kriging and idw methods in this study and it was confirmed that the proposed method perform better for the 1d 2d coupled simulation of pluvial floods the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the dem reconstruction method used in this study has proved to be successful in improving the accuracy of waterlogging simulation compared with the raw dem and the traditional kriging and idw methods the simulation with mdf kriging and mdf idw significantly improved both the water level of the 1d manhole 0 06m and 0 08m and the water depth of the 2d overflow 5 and 23 achieving stable control of the peak time error 2 terrain reconstruction effectively reduces the systematic flood depth error caused by the insufficient accuracy of dem data in the simulation compared with raw dem the elevation of the flood area simulated by the reconstructed terrain shows more obvious correlation with the low elevation area 3 the mdf kriging and mdf idw methods improve the temporospatial distribution of the flood process the raw dem leads to scattered flood distribution irrationally the conventional interpolation method improves the continuity of flood distribution while the flat terrain will lead to the expansion of the simulated flood range and the reduction of the flood depth dem reconstructed based on multisource data fusion method is proved to be effective in reducing the uncertainty of urban pluvial flood simulation this research could be regarded as the starting point of the research on multi source data fusion dem for urban pluvial flood simulation the method on making full use of more advanced 3d reconstruction tools to obtain more effective terrain data while reducing the multi source error will be studied in the future credit authorship contribution

2466,to increase our understanding of multidecadal and longer term variations in storm surges around the world we require long term and trustworthy data the quantile delta mapping method was used to rectify the statistical biases of storm surge levels using data driven methodologies to produce high quality data on long term storm surge levels the results showed that the bias adjusted surge levels were better than those from the raw era 20c reconstruction bias adjusted surge levels indicated that most tide gauges globally showed an overall positive trend from 1900 to 2010 and more extreme storm surges occurred after the 1960s the el niño southern oscillation enso has been identified as one of the key climate patterns influencing storm surges globally especially at tide gauges around the pacific ocean coast in north america the northwestern atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea at regions of the mediterranean sea northwestern atlantic and pacific in north america the north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao were significantly negatively correlated with storm surge in contrast the storm surges along the coast of northern europe were considerably positively correlated with the ao storm surges were positively correlated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo at various tide gauges along the mediterranean coasts the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america keywords storm surge climate change quantile delta mapping method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction storm surge the primary cause of coastal flooding has enormous socioeconomic effects worldwide jongman et al 2012 low air pressure and strong winds which are characteristics of tropical and extratropical cyclones cause storm surges salmun and molod 2015 storm surges pose the greatest threat of all the geophysical threats to coastal areas von storch and woth 2008 hurricane katrina in 2005 cyclone nargis in 2008 cyclone xynthia in 2010 hurricane isaac in 2012 and laura in 2020 are all examples of storm surges that have caused substantial loss of life and property storm surge is thought to be directly related to hurricane intensity maximum sustained wind speed and minimum central pressure feng et al 2014 other meteorological properties such as hurricane size and angle of approach and geophysical characteristics such as topography bottom friction and coastal geography can have a substantial impact on the generation and propagation of storm surges weaver and slinn 2010 ramos valle et al 2020 numerous studies have examined the variability and changes in storm surges using data from tide gauges bromirski et al 2003 wahl et al 2015 feng et al 2018 feng et al 2021a however most studies are focused locally and rely on limited observation data collected over a brief period of time inadequate and incomplete data from tide gauges around the world makes it difficult to gain a thorough picture of the variability and changes in storm surges temporally and spatially caldwell et al 2015 additionally to the derivation of long term trends of climate related variables require reliable long term data for example at least 60 years of data is necessary to determine the long term trend in global mean sea level chambers et al 2012 boretti 2021 it is indispensable to have long term data series when examining the long term trends and multidecadal variability of storm surge which is significant for a better understanding of storm surge globally and beneficial for coastal protection conservation of coastal ecosystems and future planning in recent years a number of global storm surge datasets have been produced utilizing dynamic numerical techniques and data driven methodologies muis et al 2016 produced the global tide and surge reanalysis dataset for the period 1979 2014 by driving the global tide and surge model with era interim data dee et al 2011 cid et al 2017 used the multiple linear regression approach to create a worldwide storm surge database from 1871 to 2010 by linking mean slp and gradients from era interim reanalysis and using the twentieth century reanalysis 20cr tadesse et al 2020 employed a data driven modeling methodology to create databases of global storm surge reconstructions they provided five distinct datasets that were reconstructed from several atmospheric reanalysis products from 1836 to 2019 storm surge reconstructions based on era 20c atmospheric reanalysis era 20c reconstruction and 20 cr reconstruction are two datasets that span more than 100 years when compared to data from the era interim era5 and merra reanalysis tadesse and wahl 2021 discovered that storm surge data generated from era 20c and 20 cr display weaker correlation coefficients and greater rmses when compared with the observations bias correction techniques have been increasingly popular in recent years for correcting model output data for climate impact research teutschbein and seibert 2012 studies revealed that bias adjusted climate variables capture extreme events better than uncorrected climate variables dosio and paruolo 2011 bias correction techniques are commonly applied to precipitation temperature wind and waves dosio et al 2012 chen et al 2013 li et al 2019 as well as storm surges lin et al 2016 indicated that storm surges generated by climate model projections can be biased and they should be bias corrected before application cid et al 2018 found that the highest surge events from the multiple linear regression model are often underestimated and the quantile mapping bias correction can remove these biases dullaart et al 2021 found that the bias correction can remove the bias between simulated storm surges caused by typhoons and observations at locations where simulated storm surge level return periods fall outside the 5th 95th percentiles however most studies are focused locally and the bias correction was mostly used in storm surges caused by typhoons further studies are required to determine whether the bias correction techniques work globally and for storm surges caused by other atmospheric disturbances using dataset provided by tadesse and wahl 2021 we intend to obtain a thorough picture of the variability and changes in storm surges globally and throughout the 20th century for the first time in this study we investigate the bias correction approach for correcting the statistical features of tadesse and wahl s daily maximum surge level projections 2021 we further examined the long term trends in storm surges at the global scale from 1900 to 2010 the relationship between storm surge variability and large scale climate modes like the north atlantic oscillation nao arctic oscillation ao el niño southern oscillation enso and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo was also investigated 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the global extreme sea level analysis gesla 2 datasets https www gesla org were used as the observed sea level data from tide gauges woodworth et al 2017 the gesla 2 contains hourly sea level information from 1355 tide gauges worldwide table 2 and the average record length is 29 years woodworth et al 2017 common mistakes such as data splices and fictitious records were thoroughly scrutinized in this work the years with data that were less than 70 complete were excluded the tide levels were calculated using the t tide matlab package pawlowicz et al 2002 with the standard set of 67 constituents for each calendar year of the tide gauge record by subtracting the predicted tide from the measured water level the residual water level storm surge was obtained and the daily maximum surge was derived the data for the global storm surge reconstruction came from an interactive web map http gssr info including surge reconstruction from 20 cr era 20c era interim merra 2 and era5 each reconstruction contains hourly sea level information from 1355 tide gauges worldwide same as the gesla 2 the era 20c surge reconstruction https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 12971054 was used in this work for its longer period and the biases in surface pressure observations from ships and buoys being adjusted in generating the surge reconstruction stations with a correlation coefficient between observations and reconstructed surges greater than 0 5 were chosen to generate more reliable results for changes in storm surges additionally tide gauges with insufficiently long observation periods were decommissioned the noaa physical sciences

in climate impact research including linear scaling correction histogram equalization ranking matching power transformation and quantile mapping dosio et al 2012 chen et al 2013 li et al 2019 there are also studies that evaluated the efficacy of many different bias correction approaches and concluded that the quantile mapping qm method beats the others gudmundsson et al 2012 chen et al 2013 however it is hard to obtain the probability distribution of variables for a period without observations using these approaches for example the probability distribution of the observed data for a future period is assumed to be the same in qm the implicit trend or variation in the observation data is ignored bürger et al 2013 several initiatives have been made in recent years to address this issue cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 cannon 2018 the quantile delta mapping qdm method was suggested by cannon et al 2015 because it directly reflects the discrepancies between historical and future scenario data as a result the bias adjustment has no effect on the underlying climate mode s climate sensitivity to reduce the statistical biases of different orders in the era 20c surge reconstruction dataset we used the qdm approach during the observation period time range of tide gauge data and reconstruction period the qdm can be written as follows 1 δ f t q s f t f s r 1 f s f q s f t 2 q m t f o 1 f s f q s f t δ f t where δ f t is the difference in the tth quantile between the reference and simulated data over time and q s f t is the difference in the tth quantile between the reference and the tth quantile of the simulated data over time f s f is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the simulated data during a predefined period and f s r 1 is the inverse cdf of the simulated data during the reference period f o is the cdf of the observations the qdm procedure can be divided into two steps a the absolute or relative changes δ f t in eq 1 in the quantiles between the reference and prescribed periods is determined b bias adjusted future projections q m t in eq 2 are generated by multiplying the relative changes by historical bias adjusted value δ f t detrending by quantile and subsequent quantile mapping mean that f o 1 f s f q s f t takes on the statistical characteristics of the historical observations this is where biases between the modeled and observed quantiles are modified relative changes in modeled quantiles are preserved when the projected climate change signal is multiplied by the bias correlated series δ f t cannon et al 2015 provided more information on the concepts and algorithm of qdm the following procedures were used to evaluate the qdm method s performance piani et al 2010 first the observations and 20 cr surge reconstruction were divided into two periods control and evaluation second the years of the control period were used to calibrate the qdm approach and the years of the evaluation period served as a validation period third using several statistical criteria the corrected data from the evaluation period was compared to observations the correlation value and root mean square error rmse were determined to assess the skill of the qdm approach in this study to determine the long term trends in storm surges three indices described by zhang et al 2000 were employed as proxies the following are the indices 1 storm surge count the annual number of storm surges that exceed a certain threshold 2 strom surge duration the number of hours per year when the surge level exceeds the threshold 3 strom surge intensity the annual total integral if the sea level curve is over the threshold in this study the storm surge level of 99 percent was chosen as the threshold t test were used to determine the significance of the correlations whereas mann kendall test were used to determine the significance of the trends von storch and zwiers 1999 feng et al 2015 we get the linear relationship between these three indices and time year in this work using the linear regression method after that we get the increase decrease rate of storm surge indices 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bias adjusted storm surges we evaluated the performance of the qdm method at several tide gauges here we use xiamen as an example fig 1 at the xiamen 118 067oe 24 45on station the control period was 1954 1974 and the evaluation period was 1977 1997 the results fig 1a showed that the monthly mean daily maximum surge at xiamen ranged from 0 09 to 0 33 m with a higher value from august to january and a lower value from february to july the era 20c reconstruction overestimated the monthly mean value from february to july and underestimated the monthly mean value from august to january the bias adjusted results showed more consistency with the observations from august to november the bias adjusted results overestimated the monthly mean value however the maximum deviation of the bias adjusted 0 04 m was smaller than that of the era 20c reconstruction 0 07 m the correlation coefficient corr normalized centered mean square error ncmse and normalized standard deviation nstd are summarized in a taylor diagram fig 1b taylor 2001 which showed that the bias adjusted surge levels were better correlated with the observations with a value of approximately 0 74 and the nstd of the bias adjusted surge level was close to 1 1 02 the corr between the era 20c reconstruction and observations was approximately 0 68 and the ntsd was approximately 0 73 the ncmses of bias adjusted 0 74 and era 20c reconstruction 0 72 were nearly the same the probability distribution function showed that the era 20c reconstruction has a large deviation from the observations fig 1c the results demonstrated that the observations and era 20c for the historical period have approximately the same mean but the relative frequency of high values of era 20c is lower than that of observations these deviations can be largely reduced by the bias correction method additionally the daily maximum surge taylor diagrams at the other four tide gauges were calculated table s1 fig s1 the results also indicated that the bias adjustment has indeed improved the accuracy in addition the corr and root mean square error rmse of the era 20c reconstruction and bias adjusted values periods are the same as the observations against the observations were also calculated fig 2 the results showed that the average correlation coefficient of the bias adjusted values was 0 66 the era 20c reconstruction was 0 59 and the correlation coefficient was above 0 70 at 26 of tide gauge locations 18 of the era 20c reconstruction the correlation coefficient was larger in the subtropical extratropical regions the correlation coefficient of the bias adjusted values was larger than that of the era 20c reconstruction by approximately 0 01 to 0 29 and the mean value was approximately 0 08 the rmse of the bias adjusted values ranged from 0 05 to 0 23 m 0 06 to 0 28 of the era 20c reconstruction and the average rmse was 0 11 m 0 13 of the era 20c reconstruction at 68 of the tide gauges the rmse of the bias adjusted values was smaller than that of the era 20c reconstruction the above results indicated that the bias adjusted surge levels improved compared with those of the era 20c reconstruction 3 2 storm surge variations the mean values of storm surge number duration and intensity from 1900 to 2010 were calculated and shown in fig 3 the results showed that the mean values of storm surge number ranged from 2 to 3 5 and the higher values mostly occurred on the western european coast the northwestern atlantic coast the coast of japan the northeast pacific coast and some islands located in the southwest pacific the spatial differences in the mean value of storm surge duration were smaller than those of storm surge number and intensity ranging from 3 5 4 days the spatial differences of mean values of storm surge intensity was largest ranged from 1 2 to 6 0 day m the highest values are located on the western european coast and higher values occurred on the northwestern atlantic coast the coast of japan and the northeast pacific coast fig 4 in terms of long term trends we found that the annual storm surge number showed increasing trends at 93 6 of the tide gauges with 70 1 featured trends of 0 001 to 0 039 per year at a 95 significance level the higher increase rate mostly occurred on the western european coast united kingdom and the coasts of the north sea the northwestern atlantic coast and the coast of japan the trends showed spatial coherence which also enhanced the confidence in the analysis and the data quality there were only two tide gauges located in the southwestern pacific of which the annual storm surge number showed significant decreasing trends the storm surge duration showed increasing trends at 92 6 of the tide gauges with 67 2 ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 day yr at a 95 significance level the spatial distribution of the trends in storm surge duration was quite similar to that of the annual storm surge numbers the storm surge intensity showed increasing trends at 92 6 of the tide gauges with 66 2 of the tide gauges showing trends of 0 001 to 0 033 day m yr at a 95 significance level the higher increase rates mostly occurred on the western european coast the above results indicate that a general increase existed at most of the tide gauges available for analysis from 1900 to 2010 the seasonal and decadal variations in extreme storm surges with a maximum surge level above 2 0 m were also analyzed in this work fig 5 the results showed that these extreme storm surge events mostly occurred from october to february these results were related to the locations of tide gauges that have more than one storm surge larger than 2 m these tide gauges are mostly concentrated on the western european coast and the northwestern atlantic coast at the tide gauges on the northwestern atlantic coast extreme storm surge events mostly occur from october to january on the western european coast extreme storm surge events mostly occur from december to february from march to september only 11 2 of extreme storm surge events occurred because fewer tide gauges located on the japanese and chinese coasts were selected in this work where the extreme storm surge events generally occur due to tropical cyclones previous studies have shown that storm surges mostly occur from july to september when typhoons propagate into the pacific ocean feng et al 2021a feng et al 2021b the results also showed that extreme storm surges showed increasing trends from 1900 to 2010 the number of extreme storm surges was highest during 1990 and 1999 approximately 15 72 and lowest during 1900 and 1909 approximately 2 55 more extreme storm surges occurred after 1960 approximately 67 85 than before 1960 3 3 links with large scale climate indices when analyzing the variations in storm surges it was vital to see if the variability was related to regional climate patterns which are commonly reflected by teleconnection indices woodworth and blackman 2010 feng et al 2018 feng et al 2021a to examine if enso had any effect on storm surges we looked at the differences in storm surge indices between el niño years and la niña years from 1900 to 2010 el niño years and neutral years and la niña years and neutral years fig 6 the results showed spatial disparities the storm surge number of el niño years was greater than that of la niña years at 65 2 percent of the tide gauges fig 6a these tide gauges were mostly located on the and some were located on the southwestern coast of australia and the coast of japan the differences in the values were largest in the northeastern pacific in contrast at most tide gauges on the northern european coast and at some gauges on the southern pacific coast and the eastern coast of australia the storm surge number of la niña years was larger than that of el niño years the results for storm surge duration were quite similar to those for the annual storm surge number compared with those in the annual storm surge number and duration the differences in the storm surge intensity were smaller at 59 8 of the tide gauges the annual storm surge number in el niño years was larger than that in neutral years fig 6b the spatial distribution of these tide gauges was similar to that shown in fig 6a at 70 1 of the tide gauges the annual storm surge number in la niña years was smaller than that in neutral years these tide gauges were mostly located on the pacific coast of north america the northwestern atlantic coast and the northern european coast and some gauges were located on the coast of australia and the coast of japan in contrast at some tide gauges on the mediterranean coast and southwestern pacific coast the annual storm surge number in la niña years was larger than that in neutral years the results for storm surge duration were similar to those for the annual storm surge number similar to fig 6a the differences in storm surge intensity were smaller than those in the annual storm surge number and duration the effects of enso on storm surges were also calculated using the era 20c reconstruction fig s2 the patterns were quite similar using the original era 20c dataset and the bias adjusted dataset however differences still exist the difference in intensity of storm surges using the bias adjusted dataset was more obvious than using the era 20c dataset previous studies suggest that during enso anomalous ocean atmosphere conditions can influence storm intensities frequencies and paths thereby impacting storm surges saunders et al 2000 eichler and higgins 2006 feng and tsimplis 2014 enso influences the frequency and storm tracks of winter storms in the northwestern atlantic many studies have found that during el niño circumstances a higher number of storms are reported along the eastern coast of north america as a result of frequent localized northeasterly wind forcing eichler and higgins 2006 colle et al 2010 as a result storm surges and enso have a strong positive relationship sweet and zervas 2011 bromirski et al 2003 found that storm surges are well associated with sea level pressure but poorly correlated with local wind along the pacific coast of north america indicating that the inverse barometer effect is the primary contributor to storm surge in these places during el niño strong storm systems are linked to the intensification of the aleutian low bromirski et al 2016 enso s climatic consequences over the euro mediterranean region are insecure at multidecadal scales greatbach et al 2004 over the euro mediterranean sector the enso associated significant changes are noted in the upper and lower tropospheric height anomalies this teleconnection may largely influence the storm activity frequency and intensity over this region ehsan et al 2013 kamil et al 2017 according to kamil et al 2017 the association between euro mediterranean storm activity and enso varies due to the alteration in central eastern pacific ocean sst anomalies associated with enso they found that from 1950 to 1979 storms were adversely connected 0 24 with enso but from 1987 to 2016 they were positively correlated 0 44 these nonstationary characteristics could explain why differences in storm surge indices between el niño and la niña years in the mediterranean and europe were smaller than in other locations fig 6 the 5 year running mean storm surge indices from 1900 to 2010 were correlated with the 5 year running mean climate indices ao iod nao pdo ipo and amo fig 7 the data showed that the annual storm surge numbers were significantly negatively linked with the nao at 36 8 of the tide gauges with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 79 to 0 30 these tide gauges were mainly located on the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america and gauges were also located in the southern hemisphere the duration and intensity of storm surges yielded comparable results to the annual storm surge number however the correlation coefficient was smaller than that of the annual storm surge number at 13 2 of the tide gauges storm surge numbers were significantly positively correlated with the ao and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 30 to 0 51 positive relations were obtained for the northern european stations mostly north of 45 n at the same time the annual storm surge numbers were significantly negatively correlated with the ao at 27 9 of the tide gauges and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 65 to 0 31 these tide gauges are mainly located on the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america these findings were identical to the nao s the duration and intensity of storm surges showed similar results to those for the annual storm surge number at 19 6 of the tide gauges the annual storm surge numbers were significantly positively correlated with the amo with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 30 to 0 60 positive relations were obtained for the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america at the same time at 4 4 of the tide gauges annual storm surge numbers were significantly positively correlated with the amo these tide gauges are mostly located on the southwestern pacific coast the results for storm surge duration were similar to those for the annual storm surge number compared with the annual storm surge number storm surge intensity was significantly positively correlated with the amo at fewer tide gauges approximately 15 2 especially on the mediterranean coast the relationships between storm surge indices and nao ao and amo were also calculated using the era 20c reconstruction fig s3 similar to the results of enso the correlations between storm surge intensity of bias adjusted and nao ao and amo were all larger than that of era 20c our results were in consistent with previous studies menéndez and woodworth 2010 also obtained a positive significant relationship with ao at northern european stations and a negative correlation in southern europe according to mawdsley and haigh 2016 storm surges in the northeastern pacific have a strong negative connection with ao tropical cyclonic activity over the tropical pacific and atlantic has been demonstrated to be influenced by ao in previous research choi et al 2012 the boreal winter enso and associated sst anomalies are closely correlated with the spring ao according to studies gong et al 2001 chen et al 2016 some low pressure systems over the mediterranean sea can have a dynamic evolution similar to that of tropical cyclones in some mediterranean locations cid et al 2015 discovered positive trends in storm surge duration the western mediterranean basin shows a notable susceptibility to storm surges to a negative nao index a negative nao according to the authors can lead to an increase in the number and intensity of storm surge events decadal fluctuations in extreme storm surge events appear to be anticorrelated with decadal variations in the nao over the u s east coast according to previous research ezer and atkinson 2014 a positive nao is linked to increased storminess and a higher latitude recurving hurricane making the east coast of north america more vulnerable to catastrophic hurricanes dawson et al 2002 according to mawdsley and haigh 2016 storm surge in the northeastern pacific has a strong negative connection with the nao previous research has also found a link between the amo and storm surge along the east coast of north america park et al 2011 according to goldenberg et al 2001 the amo and major hurricanes show similar multidecadal scale trends in the atlantic zhang and delworth 2006 found that vertical shear decreased during the positive amo phase and this reduction along with the higher sst and lower sea level pressure will result in above normal atlantic hurricane activity furthermore walter and graf 2002 indicated that during the cool amo phase the amo is negatively correlated with the nao whereas during the warm amo phase the correlation is negligible the relationship between climate indicators and storm surges can help improve seasonal to decadal predictions see rahid and wahl 2020 and coastal flood assessments for both the present and future 4 discussion a general upward trend was observed for most of the tide gauges and more extreme storm surges occurred after the 1960s these findings support the hypothesis that storm surges increased globally over the 20th century similar findings have been seen in some regional studies for example langenberg et al 1999 discovered that because of atmospheric forcing the high water levels along the north sea coast rose in the winter from 1899 to 1993 according to von storch and woth 2008 storm surges were in a calm period in hamburg from 1855 to 1962 but have since started to rise grinsted et al 2012 found a statistically significant increase in the frequency of severe storm surge events in the western atlantic beginning in 1923 and they concluded that these changes were affected by the warmer sea surface temperatures ezer and atkinson 2014 found that in norfolk only 6 out of 17 top storm surges happened between 1930 and 1960 and 11 top storm surges occurred after the 1960s using storm surge reconstruction from 1866 to 2012 cid et al 2018 discovered an increase in southeast asia s 50 year return water levels that was unrelated to the mean sea level in the 1950s and they also discovered that this increase was less visible when simply comparing recent eras since 1950 bromirski et al 2003 discovered a considerable increase in extratropical surges in san francisco using spatial bayesian methods calafat et al 2022 found that the trends in storm surge extremes were comparable with those in mean sea level in europe since 1960s changes in tropical cyclones can explain some of the overall increase in storm surges the ambient potential intensity of tropical cyclones will increase as a result of global warming and changes in tropical cyclones should shift the distribution of storm surge intensities upwards seneviratne et al 2012 according to knutson and tuleya 2004 the maximum intensities of hurricanes will increase 4 for every degree of sst warming records showed that from 1878 to the present the atlantic tropical storm or hurricane numbers showed a pronounced upward trend which was correlated with rising ssts vecchi and knutson 2007 according to emanuel 2005 and webster et al 2005 the destructiveness of tropical cyclones has increased dramatically since the mid 1970s as a result of global warming according to mei and xie 2016 typhoons that affected east asia and southeast asia have intensified 12 to 15 since the 1970s meanwhile since the 1950s both the atlantic and north pacific have seen a net rise in the intensity and frequency of extra tropical storms trenberth et al 2007 over the last six decades the number of deep cyclones 980 hpa in the baltic sea region has remained positive which is consistent with ncep reanalysis results over the northern north atlantic ocean since 1958 lehmann et al 2011 and according to schenk 2015 the increase in deep lows over this region since 1850 may be unparalleled using pressure time series at sites in southern england alexander et al 2005 discovered an increase in several storms since the 1950s using pressure data from sweden barring and von storch 2004 discovered a reduction in cyclone activity during the late 19th century with a minimum around 1960 and then an increase in the 20th century reaching a maximum in around 1990 there are also some limitations to bias adjusted storm surge determinations first the validation showed that although the bias adjusted surge levels improved over those of the era 20c reconstruction the rmses remained higher than those of the era 5 and era interim reconstructions tadesse and wahl 2021 this is an unavoidable consequence of the era 20c 1 125 x 1 125 meteorological forcing s relatively coarse resolution this could be particularly hazardous in the case of storm surges induced by tropical cyclones for future research forces derived from numerical downscaling results could be utilized in data driven models second the majority of the tide gauges chosen were along the coasts of europe the mediterranean sea the northeastern united states and canada the northeastern pacific and the southwestern pacific other areas such as china hallegatte et al 2013 feng et al 2018 feng et al 2021a and the bay of bengal dube et al 2000 hussain et al 2017 are also heavily affected by storm surges however tide gauges are rather few in these areas satellite altimetry storm surge monitoring which can overcome the shortcomings of tide gauge data ji et al 2020 can be used in data driven models in future work in recent years an increasing number of studies find that the adverse consequences of floods caused by more than one driver also called compound events are often greatly exacerbated lai et al 2021 in coastal areas the complex interplay between precipitation and storm surge can lead to or exacerbate the impacts of flooding wahl et al 2015 in the future a better understanding of changes in the characteristics of compound flood events is needed for flood risk management in coastal regions across the globe 5 conclusions the statistical features of daily maximum surge levels of the era 20c reconstruction established by tadesse and wahl 2021 were corrected using the quantile delta mapping qdm tide gauges with correlation coefficients larger than 0 5 were selected in this work both the correlations and root mean square error rmse results showed that the bias adjusted surge levels reasonably improved compared with those of the era 20c reconstruction the evaluation results enhanced the confidence in using the bias adjusted surge levels to determine changes in storm surges on a global scale from 1900 to 2010 at more than 90 of the tide gauges all three storm surge indices number duration and intensity showed increasing trends the increasing trends were more significant at tide gauges located along the coasts of western europe the east coast of north america and the coast of japan than at those located on the other coasts examined in this study in addition to this general increase more extreme storm surge events occurred after the 1960s the variability in storm surges was linked to large scale climate processes an effect of el niño was found at 65 2 of the tide gauges which were largely on the pacific coast of north america the northwest atlantic coast and the mediterranean coast during el niño years storm surge indices were higher than during la niña years and neutral years on a worldwide scale enso was discovered to be one of the most important coupled ocean atmosphere processes affecting storm surges the storm surge indices were significantly negatively correlated with the nao at more than 36 of the tide gauges which were located on the mediterranean coast northwestern atlantic coast and pacific coast of north america the results of the ao index revealed a similar spatial pattern as that for the nao except that approximately 13 of the tide gauge storm surge indices were significantly positively correlated with the ao mostly in northern europe the storm surges were positively correlated with the amo at approximately 19 of the tide gauges which were mostly located on the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america in conclusion we demonstrated that the bias correction method can improve the quality of storm surge values derived from data driven methods these bias adjusted results improved the understanding of storm surge globally and at a longer time scale further improvements may also occur by enhancing the resolution of the meteorological forcing and using satellite altimetry for storm surge monitoring in data driven models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

2466,to increase our understanding of multidecadal and longer term variations in storm surges around the world we require long term and trustworthy data the quantile delta mapping method was used to rectify the statistical biases of storm surge levels using data driven methodologies to produce high quality data on long term storm surge levels the results showed that the bias adjusted surge levels were better than those from the raw era 20c reconstruction bias adjusted surge levels indicated that most tide gauges globally showed an overall positive trend from 1900 to 2010 and more extreme storm surges occurred after the 1960s the el niño southern oscillation enso has been identified as one of the key climate patterns influencing storm surges globally especially at tide gauges around the pacific ocean coast in north america the northwestern atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea at regions of the mediterranean sea northwestern atlantic and pacific in north america the north atlantic oscillation nao and arctic oscillation ao were significantly negatively correlated with storm surge in contrast the storm surges along the coast of northern europe were considerably positively correlated with the ao storm surges were positively correlated with the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo at various tide gauges along the mediterranean coasts the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america keywords storm surge climate change quantile delta mapping method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction storm surge the primary cause of coastal flooding has enormous socioeconomic effects worldwide jongman et al 2012 low air pressure and strong winds which are characteristics of tropical and extratropical cyclones cause storm surges salmun and molod 2015 storm surges pose the greatest threat of all the geophysical threats to coastal areas von storch and woth 2008 hurricane katrina in 2005 cyclone nargis in 2008 cyclone xynthia in 2010 hurricane isaac in 2012 and laura in 2020 are all examples of storm surges that have caused substantial loss of life and property storm surge is thought to be directly related to hurricane intensity maximum sustained wind speed and minimum central pressure feng et al 2014 other meteorological properties such as hurricane size and angle of approach and geophysical characteristics such as topography bottom friction and coastal geography can have a substantial impact on the generation and propagation of storm surges weaver and slinn 2010 ramos valle et al 2020 numerous studies have examined the variability and changes in storm surges using data from tide gauges bromirski et al 2003 wahl et al 2015 feng et al 2018 feng et al 2021a however most studies are focused locally and rely on limited observation data collected over a brief period of time inadequate and incomplete data from tide gauges around the world makes it difficult to gain a thorough picture of the variability and changes in storm surges temporally and spatially caldwell et al 2015 additionally to the derivation of long term trends of climate related variables require reliable long term data for example at least 60 years of data is necessary to determine the long term trend in global mean sea level chambers et al 2012 boretti 2021 it is indispensable to have long term data series when examining the long term trends and multidecadal variability of storm surge which is significant for a better understanding of storm surge globally and beneficial for coastal protection conservation of coastal ecosystems and future planning in recent years a number of global storm surge datasets have been produced utilizing dynamic numerical techniques and data driven methodologies muis et al 2016 produced the global tide and surge reanalysis dataset for the period 1979 2014 by driving the global tide and surge model with era interim data dee et al 2011 cid et al 2017 used the multiple linear regression approach to create a worldwide storm surge database from 1871 to 2010 by linking mean slp and gradients from era interim reanalysis and using the twentieth century reanalysis 20cr tadesse et al 2020 employed a data driven modeling methodology to create databases of global storm surge reconstructions they provided five distinct datasets that were reconstructed from several atmospheric reanalysis products from 1836 to 2019 storm surge reconstructions based on era 20c atmospheric reanalysis era 20c reconstruction and 20 cr reconstruction are two datasets that span more than 100 years when compared to data from the era interim era5 and merra reanalysis tadesse and wahl 2021 discovered that storm surge data generated from era 20c and 20 cr display weaker correlation coefficients and greater rmses when compared with the observations bias correction techniques have been increasingly popular in recent years for correcting model output data for climate impact research teutschbein and seibert 2012 studies revealed that bias adjusted climate variables capture extreme events better than uncorrected climate variables dosio and paruolo 2011 bias correction techniques are commonly applied to precipitation temperature wind and waves dosio et al 2012 chen et al 2013 li et al 2019 as well as storm surges lin et al 2016 indicated that storm surges generated by climate model projections can be biased and they should be bias corrected before application cid et al 2018 found that the highest surge events from the multiple linear regression model are often underestimated and the quantile mapping bias correction can remove these biases dullaart et al 2021 found that the bias correction can remove the bias between simulated storm surges caused by typhoons and observations at locations where simulated storm surge level return periods fall outside the 5th 95th percentiles however most studies are focused locally and the bias correction was mostly used in storm surges caused by typhoons further studies are required to determine whether the bias correction techniques work globally and for storm surges caused by other atmospheric disturbances using dataset provided by tadesse and wahl 2021 we intend to obtain a thorough picture of the variability and changes in storm surges globally and throughout the 20th century for the first time in this study we investigate the bias correction approach for correcting the statistical features of tadesse and wahl s daily maximum surge level projections 2021 we further examined the long term trends in storm surges at the global scale from 1900 to 2010 the relationship between storm surge variability and large scale climate modes like the north atlantic oscillation nao arctic oscillation ao el niño southern oscillation enso and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo was also investigated 2 data and methodology 2 1 data the global extreme sea level analysis gesla 2 datasets https www gesla org were used as the observed sea level data from tide gauges woodworth et al 2017 the gesla 2 contains hourly sea level information from 1355 tide gauges worldwide table 2 and the average record length is 29 years woodworth et al 2017 common mistakes such as data splices and fictitious records were thoroughly scrutinized in this work the years with data that were less than 70 complete were excluded the tide levels were calculated using the t tide matlab package pawlowicz et al 2002 with the standard set of 67 constituents for each calendar year of the tide gauge record by subtracting the predicted tide from the measured water level the residual water level storm surge was obtained and the daily maximum surge was derived the data for the global storm surge reconstruction came from an interactive web map http gssr info including surge reconstruction from 20 cr era 20c era interim merra 2 and era5 each reconstruction contains hourly sea level information

pressure observations from ships and buoys being adjusted in generating the surge reconstruction stations with a correlation coefficient between observations and reconstructed surges greater than 0 5

in climate impact research including linear scaling correction histogram equalization ranking matching power transformation and quantile mapping dosio et al 2012 chen et al 2013 li et al 2019 there are also studies that evaluated the efficacy of many different bias correction approaches and concluded that the quantile mapping qm method beats the others gudmundsson et al 2012 chen et al 2013 however it is hard to obtain the probability distribution of variables for a period without observations using these approaches for example the probability distribution of the observed data for a future period is assumed to be the same in qm the implicit trend or variation in the observation data is ignored bürger et al 2013 several initiatives have been made in recent years to address this issue cannon et al 2015 eum and cannon 2017 cannon 2018 the quantile delta mapping qdm method was suggested by cannon et al 2015 because it directly reflects the discrepancies between historical and future scenario data as a result the bias adjustment has no effect on the underlying climate mode s climate sensitivity to reduce the statistical biases of different orders in the era 20c surge reconstruction dataset we used the qdm approach during the observation period time range of tide gauge data and reconstruction period the qdm can be written as follows 1 δ f t q s f t f s r 1 f s f q s f t 2 q m t f o 1 f s f q s f t δ f t where δ f t is the difference in the tth quantile between the reference and simulated data over time and q s f t is the difference in the tth quantile between the reference and the tth quantile of the simulated data over time f s f is the cumulative distribution function cdf of the simulated data during a predefined period and f s r 1 is the inverse cdf of the simulated data during the reference period f o is the cdf of the observations the qdm procedure can be divided into two steps a the absolute or relative changes δ f t in eq 1 in the quantiles between the reference and prescribed periods is determined b bias adjusted future projections q m t in eq 2 are generated by multiplying the relative changes by historical bias adjusted value δ f t detrending by quantile and subsequent quantile mapping mean that f o 1 f s f q s f t takes on the statistical characteristics of the historical observations this is where biases between the modeled and observed quantiles are modified relative changes in modeled quantiles are preserved when the projected climate change signal is multiplied by the bias correlated series δ f t cannon et al 2015 provided more information on the concepts and algorithm of qdm the following procedures were used to evaluate the qdm method s performance piani et al 2010 first the observations and 20 cr surge reconstruction were divided into two periods control and evaluation second the years of the control period were used to calibrate the qdm approach and the years of the evaluation period served as a validation period third using several statistical criteria the corrected data from the evaluation period was compared to observations the correlation value and root mean square error rmse were determined to assess the skill of the qdm approach in this study to determine the long term trends in storm surges three indices described by zhang et al 2000 were employed as proxies the following are the indices 1 storm surge count the annual number of storm surges that exceed a certain threshold 2 strom surge duration the number of hours per year when the surge level exceeds the threshold 3 strom surge intensity the annual total integral if the sea level curve is over the threshold in this study the storm surge level of 99 percent was chosen as the threshold t test were used to determine the significance of the correlations whereas mann kendall test were used to determine the significance of the trends von storch and zwiers 1999 feng et al 2015 we get the linear relationship between these three indices and time year in this work using the linear regression method after that we get the increase decrease rate of storm surge indices 3 results 3 1 evaluation of bias adjusted storm surges we evaluated the performance of the qdm method at several tide gauges here we use xiamen as an example fig 1 at the xiamen 118 067oe 24 45on station the control period was 1954 1974 and the evaluation period was 1977 1997 the results fig 1a showed that the monthly mean daily maximum surge at xiamen ranged from 0 09 to 0 33 m with a higher value from august to january and a lower value from february to july the era 20c reconstruction overestimated the monthly mean value from february to july and underestimated the monthly mean value from august to january the bias adjusted results showed more consistency with the observations from august to november the bias adjusted results overestimated the monthly mean value however the maximum deviation of the bias adjusted 0 04 m was smaller than that of the era 20c reconstruction 0 07 m the correlation coefficient corr normalized centered mean square error ncmse and normalized standard deviation nstd are summarized in a taylor diagram fig 1b taylor 2001 which showed that the bias adjusted surge levels were better correlated with the observations with a value of approximately 0 74 and the nstd of the bias adjusted surge level was close to 1 1 02 the corr between the era 20c reconstruction and observations was approximately 0 68 and the ntsd was approximately 0 73 the ncmses of bias adjusted 0 74 and era 20c reconstruction 0 72 were nearly the same the probability distribution function showed that the era 20c reconstruction has a large deviation from the observations fig 1c the results demonstrated that the observations and era 20c for the historical period have approximately the same mean but the relative frequency of high values of era 20c is lower than that of observations these deviations can be largely reduced by the bias correction method additionally the daily maximum surge taylor diagrams at the other four tide gauges were calculated table s1 fig s1 the results also indicated that the bias adjustment has indeed improved the accuracy in addition the corr and root mean square error rmse of the era 20c reconstruction and bias adjusted values periods are the same as the observations against the observations were also calculated fig 2 the results showed that the average correlation coefficient of the bias adjusted values was 0 66 the era 20c reconstruction was 0 59 and the correlation coefficient was above 0 70 at 26 of tide gauge locations 18 of the era 20c reconstruction the correlation coefficient was larger in the subtropical extratropical regions the correlation coefficient of the bias adjusted values was larger than that of the era 20c reconstruction by approximately 0 01 to 0 29 and the mean value was approximately 0 08 the rmse of the bias adjusted values ranged from 0 05 to 0 23 m 0 06 to 0 28 of the era 20c reconstruction and the average rmse was 0 11 m 0 13 of the era 20c reconstruction at 68 of the tide gauges the rmse of the bias adjusted values was smaller than that of the era 20c reconstruction the above results indicated that the bias adjusted surge levels improved compared with those of the era 20c reconstruction 3 2 storm surge variations the mean values of storm surge number duration and intensity from 1900 to 2010 were calculated and shown in fig 3 the results showed that the mean values of storm surge number ranged from 2 to 3 5 and the higher values mostly occurred on the western european coast the northwestern atlantic coast the coast of japan the northeast pacific coast and some islands located in the southwest pacific the spatial differences in the mean value of storm surge duration were smaller than those of storm surge number and intensity ranging from 3 5 4 days the spatial differences of mean values of storm surge intensity was largest ranged from 1 2 to 6 0 day m the highest values are located on the western european coast and higher values occurred on the northwestern atlantic coast the coast of japan and the northeast pacific coast fig 4 in terms of long term trends we found that the annual storm surge number showed increasing trends at 93 6 of the tide gauges with 70 1 featured trends of 0 001 to 0 039 per year at a 95 significance level the higher increase rate mostly occurred on the western european coast united kingdom and the coasts of the north sea the northwestern atlantic coast and the coast of japan the trends showed spatial coherence which also enhanced the confidence in the analysis and the data quality there were only two tide gauges located in the southwestern pacific of which the annual storm surge number showed significant decreasing trends the storm surge duration showed increasing trends at 92 6 of the tide gauges with 67 2 ranging from 0 01 to 0 05 day yr at a 95 significance level the spatial distribution of the trends in storm surge duration was quite similar to that of the annual storm surge numbers the storm surge intensity showed increasing trends at 92 6 of the tide gauges with 66 2 of the tide gauges showing trends of 0 001 to 0 033 day m yr at a 95 significance level the higher increase rates mostly occurred on the western european coast the above results indicate that a general increase existed at most of the tide gauges available for analysis from 1900 to 2010 the seasonal and decadal variations in extreme storm surges with a maximum surge level above 2 0 m were also analyzed in this work fig 5 the results showed that these extreme storm surge events mostly occurred from october to february these results were related to the locations of tide gauges that have more than one storm surge larger than 2 m these tide gauges are mostly concentrated on the western european coast and the northwestern atlantic coast at the tide gauges on the northwestern atlantic coast extreme storm surge events mostly occur from october to january on the western european coast extreme storm surge events mostly occur from december to february from march to september only 11 2 of extreme storm surge events occurred because fewer tide gauges located on the japanese and chinese coasts were selected in this work where the extreme storm surge events generally occur due to tropical cyclones previous studies have shown that storm surges mostly occur from july to september when typhoons propagate into the pacific ocean feng et al 2021a feng et al 2021b the results also showed that extreme storm surges showed increasing trends from 1900 to 2010 the number of extreme storm surges was highest during 1990 and 1999 approximately 15 72 and lowest during 1900 and 1909 approximately 2 55 more extreme storm surges occurred after 1960 approximately 67 85 than before 1960 3 3 links with large scale climate indices when analyzing the variations in storm surges it was vital to see if the variability was related to regional climate patterns which are commonly reflected by teleconnection indices woodworth and blackman 2010 feng et al 2018 feng et al 2021a to examine if enso had any effect on storm surges we looked at the differences in storm surge indices between el niño years and la niña years from 1900 to 2010 el niño years and neutral years and la niña years and neutral years fig 6 the results showed spatial disparities the storm surge number of el niño years was greater than that of la niña years at 65 2 percent of the tide gauges fig 6a these tide gauges were mostly located on the and some were located on the southwestern coast of australia and the coast of japan the differences in the values were largest in the northeastern pacific in contrast at most tide gauges on the northern european coast and at some gauges on the southern pacific coast and the eastern coast of australia the storm surge number of la niña years was larger than that of el niño years the results for storm surge duration were quite similar to those for the annual storm surge number compared with those in the annual storm surge number and duration the differences in the storm surge intensity were smaller at 59 8 of the tide gauges the annual storm surge number in el niño years was larger than that in neutral years fig 6b the spatial distribution of these tide gauges was similar to that shown in fig 6a at 70 1 of the tide gauges the annual storm surge number in la niña years was smaller than that in neutral years these tide gauges were mostly located on the pacific coast of north america the northwestern atlantic coast and the northern european coast and some gauges were located on the coast of australia and the coast of japan in contrast at some tide gauges on the mediterranean coast and southwestern pacific coast the annual storm surge number in la niña years was larger than that in neutral years the results for storm surge duration were similar to those for the annual storm surge number similar to fig 6a the differences in storm surge intensity were smaller than those in the annual storm surge number and duration the effects of enso on storm surges were also calculated using the era 20c reconstruction fig s2 the patterns were quite similar using the original era 20c dataset and the bias adjusted dataset however differences still exist the difference in intensity of storm surges using the bias adjusted dataset was more obvious than using the era 20c dataset previous studies suggest that during enso anomalous ocean atmosphere conditions can influence storm intensities frequencies and paths thereby impacting storm surges saunders et al 2000 eichler and higgins 2006 feng and tsimplis 2014 enso influences the frequency and storm tracks of winter storms in the northwestern atlantic many studies have found that during el niño circumstances a higher number of storms are reported along the eastern coast of north america as a result of frequent localized northeasterly wind forcing eichler and higgins 2006 colle et al 2010 as a result storm surges and enso have a strong positive relationship sweet and zervas 2011 bromirski et al 2003 found that storm surges are well associated with sea level pressure but poorly correlated with local wind along the pacific coast of north america indicating that the inverse barometer effect is the primary contributor to storm surge in these places during el niño strong storm systems are linked to the intensification of the aleutian low bromirski et al 2016 enso s climatic consequences over the euro mediterranean region are insecure at multidecadal scales greatbach et al 2004 over the euro mediterranean sector the enso associated significant changes are noted in the upper and lower tropospheric height anomalies this teleconnection may largely influence the storm activity frequency and intensity over this region ehsan et al 2013 kamil et al 2017 according to kamil et al 2017 the association between euro mediterranean storm activity and enso varies due to the alteration in central eastern pacific ocean sst anomalies associated with enso they found that from 1950 to 1979 storms were adversely connected 0 24 with enso but from 1987 to 2016 they were positively correlated 0 44 these nonstationary characteristics could explain why differences in storm surge indices between el niño and la niña years in the mediterranean and europe were smaller than in other locations fig 6 the 5 year running mean storm surge indices from 1900 to 2010 were correlated with the 5 year running mean climate indices ao iod nao pdo ipo and amo fig 7 the data showed that the annual storm surge numbers were significantly negatively linked with the nao at 36 8 of the tide gauges with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 79 to 0 30 these tide gauges were mainly located on the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america and gauges were also located in the southern hemisphere the duration and intensity of storm surges yielded comparable results to the annual storm surge number however the correlation coefficient was smaller than that of the annual storm surge number at 13 2 of the tide gauges storm surge numbers were significantly positively correlated with the ao and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 30 to 0 51 positive relations were obtained for the northern european stations mostly north of 45 n at the same time the annual storm surge numbers were significantly negatively correlated with the ao at 27 9 of the tide gauges and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 65 to 0 31 these tide gauges are mainly located on the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america these findings were identical to the nao s the duration and intensity of storm surges showed similar results to those for the annual storm surge number at 19 6 of the tide gauges the annual storm surge numbers were significantly positively correlated with the amo with a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 30 to 0 60 positive relations were obtained for the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america at the same time at 4 4 of the tide gauges annual storm surge numbers were significantly positively correlated with the amo these tide gauges are mostly located on the southwestern pacific coast the results for storm surge duration were similar to those for the annual storm surge number compared with the annual storm surge number storm surge intensity was significantly positively correlated with the amo at fewer tide gauges approximately 15 2 especially on the mediterranean coast the relationships between storm surge indices and nao ao and amo were also calculated using the era 20c reconstruction fig s3 similar to the results of enso the correlations between storm surge intensity of bias adjusted and nao ao and amo were all larger than that of era 20c our results were in consistent with previous studies menéndez and woodworth 2010 also obtained a positive significant relationship with ao at northern european stations and a negative correlation in southern europe according to mawdsley and haigh 2016 storm surges in the northeastern pacific have a strong negative connection with ao tropical cyclonic activity over the tropical pacific and atlantic has been demonstrated to be influenced by ao in previous research choi et al 2012 the boreal winter enso and associated sst anomalies are closely correlated with the spring ao according to studies gong et al 2001 chen et al 2016 some low pressure systems over the mediterranean sea can have a dynamic evolution similar to that of tropical cyclones in some mediterranean locations cid et al 2015 discovered positive trends in storm surge duration the western mediterranean basin shows a notable susceptibility to storm surges to a negative nao index a negative nao according to the authors can lead to an increase in the number and intensity of storm surge events decadal fluctuations in extreme storm surge events appear to be anticorrelated with decadal variations in the nao over the u s east coast according to previous research ezer and atkinson 2014 a positive nao is linked to increased storminess and a higher latitude recurving hurricane making the east coast of north america more vulnerable to catastrophic hurricanes dawson et al 2002 according to mawdsley and haigh 2016 storm surge in the northeastern pacific has a strong negative connection with the nao previous research has also found a link between the amo and storm surge along the east coast of north america park et al 2011 according to goldenberg et al 2001 the amo and major hurricanes show similar multidecadal scale trends in the atlantic zhang and delworth 2006 found that vertical shear decreased during the positive amo phase and this reduction along with the higher sst and lower sea level pressure will result in above normal atlantic hurricane activity furthermore walter and graf 2002 indicated that during the cool amo phase the amo is negatively correlated with the nao whereas during the warm amo phase the correlation is negligible the relationship between climate indicators and storm surges can help improve seasonal to decadal predictions see rahid and wahl 2020 and coastal flood assessments for both the present and future 4 discussion a general upward trend was observed for most of the tide gauges and more extreme storm surges occurred after the 1960s these findings support the hypothesis that storm surges increased globally over the 20th century similar findings have been seen in some regional studies for example langenberg et al 1999 discovered that because of atmospheric forcing the high water levels along the north sea coast rose in the winter from 1899 to 1993 according to von storch and woth 2008 storm surges were in a calm period in hamburg from 1855 to 1962 but have since started to rise grinsted et al 2012 found a statistically significant increase in the frequency of severe storm surge events in the western atlantic beginning in 1923 and they concluded that these changes were affected by the warmer sea surface temperatures ezer and atkinson 2014 found that in norfolk only 6 out of 17 top storm surges happened between 1930 and 1960 and 11 top storm surges occurred after the 1960s using storm surge reconstruction from 1866 to 2012 cid et al 2018 discovered an increase in southeast asia s 50 year return water levels that was unrelated to the mean sea level in the 1950s and they also discovered that this increase was less visible when simply comparing recent eras since 1950 bromirski et al 2003 discovered a considerable increase in extratropical surges in san francisco using spatial bayesian methods calafat et al 2022 found that the trends in storm surge extremes were comparable with those in mean sea level in europe since 1960s changes in tropical cyclones can explain some of the overall increase in storm surges the ambient potential intensity of tropical cyclones will increase as a result of global warming and changes in tropical cyclones should shift the distribution of storm surge intensities upwards seneviratne et al 2012 according to knutson and tuleya 2004 the maximum intensities of hurricanes will increase 4 for every degree of sst warming records showed that from 1878 to the present the atlantic tropical storm or hurricane numbers showed a pronounced upward trend which was correlated with rising ssts vecchi and knutson 2007 according to emanuel 2005 and webster et al 2005 the destructiveness of tropical cyclones has increased dramatically since the mid 1970s as a result of global warming according to mei and xie 2016 typhoons that affected east asia and southeast asia have intensified 12 to 15 since the 1970s meanwhile since the 1950s both the atlantic and north pacific have seen a net rise in the intensity and frequency of extra tropical storms trenberth et al 2007 over the last six decades the number of deep cyclones 980 hpa in the baltic sea region has remained positive which is consistent with ncep reanalysis results over the northern north atlantic ocean since 1958 lehmann et al 2011 and according to schenk 2015 the increase in deep lows over this region since 1850 may be unparalleled using pressure time series at sites in southern england alexander et al 2005 discovered an increase in several storms since the 1950s using pressure data from sweden barring and von storch 2004 discovered a reduction in cyclone activity during the late 19th century with a minimum around 1960 and then an increase in the 20th century reaching a maximum in around 1990 there are also some limitations to bias adjusted storm surge determinations first the validation showed that although the bias adjusted surge levels improved over those of the era 20c reconstruction the rmses remained higher than those of the era 5 and era interim reconstructions tadesse and wahl 2021 this is an unavoidable consequence of the era 20c 1 125 x 1 125 meteorological forcing s relatively coarse resolution this could be particularly hazardous in the case of storm surges induced by tropical cyclones for future research forces derived from numerical downscaling results could be utilized in data driven models second the majority of the tide gauges chosen were along the coasts of europe the mediterranean sea the northeastern united states and canada the northeastern pacific and the southwestern pacific other areas such as china hallegatte et al 2013 feng et al 2018 feng et al 2021a and the bay of bengal dube et al 2000 hussain et al 2017 are also heavily affected by storm surges however tide gauges are rather few in these areas satellite altimetry storm surge monitoring which can overcome the shortcomings of tide gauge data ji et al 2020 can be used in data driven models in future work in recent years an increasing number of studies find that the adverse consequences of floods caused by more than one driver also called compound events are often greatly exacerbated lai et al 2021 in coastal areas the complex interplay between precipitation and storm surge can lead to or exacerbate the impacts of flooding wahl et al 2015 in the future a better understanding of changes in the characteristics of compound flood events is needed for flood risk management in coastal regions across the globe 5 conclusions the statistical features of daily maximum surge levels of the era 20c reconstruction established by tadesse and wahl 2021 were corrected using the quantile delta mapping qdm tide gauges with correlation coefficients larger than 0 5 were selected in this work both the correlations and root mean square error rmse results showed that the bias adjusted surge levels reasonably improved compared with those of the era 20c reconstruction the evaluation results enhanced the confidence in using the bias adjusted surge levels to determine changes in storm surges on a global scale from 1900 to 2010 at more than 90 of the tide gauges all three storm surge indices number duration and intensity showed increasing trends the increasing trends were more significant at tide gauges located along the coasts of western europe the east coast of north america and the coast of japan than at those located on the other coasts examined in this study in addition to this general increase more extreme storm surge events occurred after the 1960s the variability in storm surges was linked to large scale climate processes an effect of el niño was found at 65 2 of the tide gauges which were largely on the pacific coast of north america the northwest atlantic coast and the mediterranean coast during el niño years storm surge indices were higher than during la niña years and neutral years on a worldwide scale enso was discovered to be one of the most important coupled ocean atmosphere processes affecting storm surges the storm surge indices were significantly negatively correlated with the nao at more than 36 of the tide gauges which were located on the mediterranean coast northwestern atlantic coast and pacific coast of north america the results of the ao index revealed a similar spatial pattern as that for the nao except that approximately 13 of the tide gauge storm surge indices were significantly positively correlated with the ao mostly in northern europe the storm surges were positively correlated with the amo at approximately 19 of the tide gauges which were mostly located on the mediterranean coast and the northwestern atlantic and pacific coasts of north america in conclusion we demonstrated that the bias correction method can improve the quality of storm surge values derived from data driven methods these bias adjusted results improved the understanding of storm surge globally and at a longer time scale further improvements may also occur by enhancing the resolution of the meteorological forcing and using satellite altimetry for storm

the kemm dm ketime zku and ketime zka relations on the other hand a clear seasonal differences in the rainfall ke relations are noticed at each observational site the established relations showed reasonable agreement in estimating the ke from the gpm dpr however in determining the ke the kemm dm relation showed outperformance over the remaining three relations ketime i ketime zku and ketime zka relations data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction raindrops falling from the cloud base with adequate kinetic energy can erode the soil surface and lead to soil erosion the kinetic energy of the raindrops or rainfall kinetic energy ke is one of the major driving factors in assessing the rainfall erosivity factor and the soil erosion kinnell 1987 salles et al 2000 wischmeier and smith 1958 accurate estimation and evaluation of rainfall ke provide the opportunity to improve the observational and modeling simulations of rainfall erosivity dai et al 2020 janapati et al 2019 nissan and toumi 2013 the rainfall ke was found to vary with geographic locations weather conditions and seasons bezak et al 2021 janapati et al 2021 nanko et al 2016 rosewell 1986 seela et al 2021 van dijk et al 2005 as the direct measurement of rainfall ke requires expensive experimental setups raindrop size distribution information has been used as an alternative approach to estimate the rainfall ke jayawardena and rezaur 2000 kinnell 1981 van dijk et al 2002 filter paper cerdá 1997 lu et al 2008 flour pellet carter et al 1974 impact fornis et al 2005 jayawardena and rezaur 2000 steiner and smith 2000 and optical angulo martinez and barros 2015 petan et al 2010 methods have been adopted to measure the raindrop size distribution the rainfall ke and intensity ke i relations are used in assessing the rainfall erosivity factor or r factor these relations have been developed in different functional forms like liner power logarithmic exponential and polynomial carter et al 1974 kinnell 1981 lim et al 2015 park et al 1982 sempere torres et al 1992 wischmeier and smith 1958 taiwan an island in the northwest pacific region with complex topography has been affected by severe weather events like frontal systems convective storms and tropical cyclones chen et al 2010 cheung et al 2008 tu et al 2022 these severe weather systems can produce floods sediment discharge landslides and debris flow chen et al 2016 chen et al 2019 chen et al 2013 galewsky et al 2006 lin and chen 2012 a better understanding and improved prediction of landslides debris flows and soil erosion can be achieved through rainfall ke and rainfall erosivity information there have been reports on rainfall ke and erosivity in the taiwan region for instance using filter paper measurements from four different locations in taiwan yang ming mountain keelung taichung lien hua chi lu et al 2008 established do r ke i relations and they noticed substantial regional variations in rainfall erosivity in taiwan using joss waldvogel disdrometer jwd measurements chang et al 2017 evaluated the rainfall ke i relation for north shihmen and xiayun reservoir area and southern jiaxian taiwan they noticed dissimilarities between north and south taiwan the rainfall ke i relations reported using long term jwd measurements in north taiwan exhibited differences between typhoon and non typhoon rainfall events janapati et al 2021 using laws and parsons 1943 ke i relations daily monthly and annual precipitation data lee and lin 2015 estimated the rainfall erosivity index for kaohsiung city and pingtung country in southern taiwan they showed that the annual and monthly models can produce better results with the observed r factor liao et al 2019 evaluated the rainfall ke and erosivity for north taiwan using jwd measurements from four observational sites zhongli quchi fuxing and hanxi they argued that localized ke i relations can provide better rainfall erosivity using 15 years of jwd measurements and 60 years of hourly rain gauge data janapati et al 2019 assessed the typhoons rainfall ke erosivity and erosivity density their results exhibited relatively larger erosivity and erosivity density over southern taiwan than the rest moreover they also noticed a significant increasing trend in typhoon rainfall erosivity for south and eastern taiwan by adopting ke i relations to the locations with the rain gauge measurements one can estimate the rainfall ke and the rainfall erosivity dai et al 2020 janapati et al 2019 panagos et al 2015 however for complex topographic regions like taiwan especially mountain areas without rain gauge measurements an alternative way to estimate the ke is using rainfall information from remote sensing instruments like global precipitation measurement gpm dual frequency precipitation radar dpr the gpm core satellite is a joint project between nasa national aeronautics and space administration and jaxa japan aerospace exploration agency launched on 27 february 2014 the gpm dpr operating at ku band 13 6 ghz and ka band 35 5 ghz frequencies can measure the cloud and precipitation properties globally with a spatial coverage of 65 n to 65 s kidd et al 2020 skofronick jackson et al 2017 the dual frequency capabilities of gpm dpr can provide the precipitation size distribution raindrop size distribution information especially mass weighted mean diameter dm normalized intercept parameter log10 nw and other rain parameters like radar reflectivity at ku ka band zku zka and precipitation rate iguchi et al 2010 seto et al 2021 the ke expressed in terms of these gpm dpr products can offer the opportunity to estimate the rainfall ke at harsh locations like mountain areas without disdrometers and rain gauges a reasonable agreement reported between the rsd parameters of gpm dpr and ground based disdrometers confirms the reliability of gpm dpr data products for the hydro meteorological implications adirosi et al 2021 ryu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 moreover zhu et al 2021 also pointed out that the gpm dpr data products can be adapted to estimate the rainfall ke with acceptable errors recent reports have expressed the rainfall ke relations using dm zku and zku janapati et al 2021 seela et al 2021 seela et al 2022 nevertheless those studies didn t validate their relations with the gpm dpr data sets therefore the current study is conducted with the major objective like 1 to estimate the rainfall ke functional relations in terms of gpm dpr data products rainfall intensity mass weighted mean diameter radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies for north taiwan 2 to find out whether the obtained ke relations show seasonal and spatial variations 3 to validate the ke relations using gpm dpr data products and to figure out the superior performer among the four ke relations to our knowledge this is a kind of the first attempt to take advantage of remote sensing capabilities gpm dpr for estimating rainfall ke at locations with a scarcity of rain gauges or disdrometers the present work contributes to the improvement of rainfall erosivity estimation 2 data and methodology 2 1 study

december february spring march 15 may mei yu 16 may 15 june summer 16 june august autumn september november and typhoons due to the disparities in the raindrop size distribution characteristics of north taiwan s seasonal rainfall janapati et al 2021 lee et al 2019 seela et al 2018 the combined jwd measurements of three locations recorded a total number of 700 347 482 783 220 427 173 153 511 717 and 230 614 1 min rsd samples with rainfall intensities 0 1 mm 1 respectively for winter spring mei yu summer autumn and typhoon in this study taiwan central weather bureau cwb typhoon warning periods are considered as typhoon days the statistical information minimum maximum mean median and standard deviation of mass weighted mean diameter dm mm rainfall intensity i mm h 1 radar reflectivity at ku

parameters dm i zku zka ketime and kemm for six seasons are portrayed in fig 3 apparent disparities in rsd and rainfall ke parameters can be seen with relatively higher mean and median values in summer mei yu and typhoon than in winter spring and autumn more large drops from deep and intense cloud systems in summer mei yu and typhoon seasons can be attributed to higher rsd and ke parameters than in the rest three seasons winter spring and autumn lee et al 2019 3 1 estimation of ketime zka and ketime zku relations the distribution of rainfall kinetic energy expenditure ketime with radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies zku and zka are depicted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the minimum detectable signals of ku and ka band radars were initially set to 18 dbz and 12 dbz respectively hou et al 2014 iguchi et al 2010 moreover a recent study demonstrated that the ku band ka band ms and hs modes showed minimum values of 12 7 dbz 15 61 dbz 10 40 dbz respectively masaki et al 2022 however the gpm overpasses over north taiwan indicated minimum zku and zka values of 15 11 dbz and 14 53 dbz respectively hence these minimum values are considered as the threshold for estimating ketime zku and ketime zka relations distribution of all three locations ketime with zku and zka are represented with yellow and green scatter data points in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively from fig 4 and fig 5 it is clear that the ketime is directly proportional to the zku and zka i e the ketime increases with the increase in zku fig 4 and zka fig 5 for six seasons to deduce the ketime zku and ketime zka empirical relations nonlinear least squares power regression model is applied to ketime and zku zka data points of each individual location and season separately in fig 4 and fig 5 these power fit lines are plotted with dotted dashed and dash doted black lines for feitsui hsiayuan and ncu respectively three locations feitsui hsiayun ncu power law fit lines of ketime zka and ketime zku relations overlap for all the seasons which indicates that there are inadequate spatial disparities in these relations for a given season the coefficient and exponent values of ketime azku b and ketime azka b relations for three locations and six seasons are given in table 4 and table 5 respectively relatively higher correlation coefficients and smaller normalized root mean square error values for ketime and zku zka data points indicates the better performance of the derived ketime zka and ketime zku relations 3 2 estimation of ketime i and kemm dm relations while estimating ke i relations for soil erosion previous studies suggested to use ke expenditure ketime rather than ke content kemm janapati et al 2019 salles et al 2002 verstraeten et al 2006 yu et al 2012 hence in the present study we establish the relationship between ke expenditure ketime and rainfall intensity fig 6 illustrates the distribution of ke expenditure ketime with rainfall intensity i for six seasons and three locations irrespective of the season the ketime spread increase with the increase in rainfall intensity in a conical fashion especially in spring mei yu and summer relatively low rainfall intensities and less ketime dispersion in winter than in the rest of the seasons can be related to warm clouds with relatively uniform precipitation lee et al 2019 seela et al 2018 furthermore while estimating the relationship between ketime and rainfall intensity previous studies demonstrated that the power law can provide the better fit hence here we estimated the ketime i relations in the form of power law the ketime i fitting lines of three locations are also displayed in fig 6 the three locations fit lines do not show much variation for the rainfall intensities up 60 mm h 1 and these lines exhibit dissimilarities for rainfall intensity above 60 mm h 1 the ketime i fit lines are distinctly different for the mei yu season and nearly identical for typhoons the ketime i relations of three locations for six seasons are given in table 6 the coefficient values of ketime i relations ketime a ib are relatively higher in summer than the remaining seasons if we look at each observational site the coefficient values are higher in mei yu and summer for feitsui and hsiayuan and in summer and spring for ncu the scatter plots between the rainfall kinetic energy content kemm and mass weighted mean diameter dm for three locations and six seasons are portrayed in fig 7 the figure shows an increase in kemm with the dm values for all six seasons while relating the kemm with dm values power exponential first and second order polynomial fit equations were performed and we noticed that the second order polynomial equation showed a better fit moreover the previous researchers also used second order polynomial fit equation janapati et al 2021 wen et al 2019 zeng et al 2022 hence we also used second order polynomial equation to relate the kemm with dm values for the considered locations and seasons it is worth noting that the three locations fit lines overlap with one over the other for most of the seasons the coefficient values of kemm dm relations kemm a dm 2 b dm c for three locations and six seasons are given in table 7 3 3 validation and discussion the rainfall ke empirical relations expressed in gpm dpr data products ketime zka ketime zku ketime i and kemm dm relations from the disdrometer measurements are validated using the gpm dpr overpasses data during 2014 2022 we noticed a total number of 122 overpasses with 87 matched data points more details on the number of overpasses for different scan modes at three locations are provided in table 8 because of the difficulty in finding the accurate pixel related to the disdrometer measured precipitation previous researchers proposed two alternative approaches namely average and optimal methods to compare the gpm dpr data products with ground based disdrometers adirosi et al 2021 the optimal method selects one of the dpr pixels located with a 3 3 box of the disdrometer whose reflectivity matches the disdrometer in the average method the dpr pixels with a radius of 5 km from the disdrometer site are averaged adirosi et al 2021 suggested considering 10 min average of disdrometer measurements to reduce the differences in the space and time sampling between gpm dpr and disdrometer hence while validating the rainfall ke empirical relations in the present study the nearest surface bin gpm dpr data products over the disdrometer site were considered using the average method the disdrometer measurements are averaged for a 10 min time window that corresponds to the gpm overpasses the jwd rsd measurements during the gpm overpasses are set aside for validation purposes by inputting the disdrometers and gpm dpr measurements zku zka i and dm into the function relations listed in tables 4 7 the rainfall kes are computed for each location and season in order to find out the better performing functional relation and scan mode inter comparison of ke derived from zku and zka from disdrometers and different scans of the gpm dpr are illustrated with a scatter plot in fig 8 similarly fig 9 shows the scatter plots of ke resulting from rainfall intensity and mass weighted mean diameter from disdrometers and different scans of the gpm dpr the dashed diagonal line in fig 8 fig 9 corresponds to a one to one relation line the ke values estimated from the rsd parameters of each dpr scan and the disdrometers are mostly aligned near to the one to one line fig 8 fig 9 nevertheless the ke values computed from different scans dm values are more diligently aligned to the one one line the statistical indices correlation coefficient root mean square error normalized mean bias and mean absolute error values obtained for comparing the ke values estimated from the rsd parameters of the disdrometer and different scans of gpm dpr are provided in table 9 and illustrated in fig 10 except for the dpr hs scan mode the ke estimated from four rsd parameters of gpm dpr showed a cc of greater than 0 4 the full scan modes of dpr ka and ku band radar dpr fs ka fs and ku fs indicated relatively higher cc than the high sensitivity scan mode dpr hs ka hs the ke values estimated from the dm values kemm dm of all scans dpr fs dpr hs ka fs ka hs and ku fs showed relatively smaller rmse than the rest three parameters i zku and zka the kemm dm ketime zku relations show smaller positive negative nmb values than the remaining ke relations for a given scan type similarly these two relations kemm dm and ketime zku show smaller mae values than the rest two equations for both full scan and high sensitivity scan modes of dpr ka and ku band radars table 9 and fig 10 confirm that the ke estimated from the dm values of gpm dpr can provide superior performance than the raining three parameters i zku and zka moreover the ketime zku relations showed a second better performance in estimating the ke from the gpm dpr on the other hand irrespective of the rsd parameters of the gpm dpr the ke values calculated from the full scan mode fs showed superior performance than the high sensitivity mode hs mode in the present study long terms disdrometer measurements from three locations in north taiwan are used to establish the statistically robust rainfall ke empirical relations in terms of gpm dpr data products earlier to the present work there were reports on the rainfall ke estimations over taiwan for instance lu et al 2008 generated the isoerodent map for taiwan using rainfall ke estimated using dyed filter methods even other previous rainfall ke studies over taiwan were limited to the few seasons or short duration data sets chang et al 2017 janapati et al 2021 all the previous studies over taiwan were conducted either by short duration data sets or they didn t reported the ke relations in terms of gpm dpr products like zku zka and dm hence the results presented in this study will aid to estimate the rainfall ke for taiwan region more specifically for north taiwan using gpm dpr data products 4 summary and conclusions taiwan is primarily influenced by extreme events like typhoons thunderstorms and frontal systems these severe events can lead to flash floods rainfall soil erosion and even landslides the functional relations between the rainfall ke and gpm dpr data products can help to find the rainfall ke at the harsh locations of taiwan especially in the mountain area where there are no rain gauge measurements hence in the present study long term raindrop size distribution information from three ground based disdrometers in north taiwan for six seasons winter spring mei yu summer autumn and typhoon are used to express functional relationships between the rainfall ke and gpm dpr data products namely radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies zku zka dbz rainfall intensity i mm h 1 mass weighted mean diameter dm mm except for ketime i relations the remaining three ke relations ketime zku ketime zka and kemm dm showed no spatial variation for a given season inter comparison of rainfall ke calculated from the disdrometer and gpm dpr demonstrated the reasonable reliability of the estimated ke relations ketime zku ketime zka and kemm dm and ketime i relations nevertheless among four ke relations kemm dm relation showed superior performance considering the performance of ke relations concerning the gpm dpr scan types the full san mode dpr fs provided better estimates than the high sensitivity mode dpr hs and ka hs despite of gpm dpr measurement limitations such as attenuation ground clutter multiple scattering and non uniform beam filling effects the ke empirical relations obtained in this study can enhance rainfall ke values from the gpm dpr data products for north taiwan this allows us to better estimate north taiwan s rainfall erosivity factor and soil erosion even though the present study provides robust results it is limited to north taiwan region only as an extension of the present study more disdrometers measurements from the whole island will be considered to express the rainfall ke in terms of gpm dpr data products in our subsequent work further to figure out superior performer among the four rainfall ke functional relations there is need to estimate and validate the rainfall ke relations with gpm dpr data products for other geographical locations credit authorship contribution statement jayalakshmi janapati conceptualization formal analysis

2467,the kinetic energy ke of rainfall is an important parameter in estimating the rainfall erosivity factor an essential parameter in the soil erosion equation the global precipitation measurement dual frequency precipitation radar gpm dpr can provide radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies zku and zka rainfall rate i mm h 1 and drop size distribution parameters mass weighed mean diameter dm in mm and normalized intercept parameter log10 nw nw in m 3 mm 1 the empirical relations between rainfall ke and gpm dpr parameters ketime i kemm dm ketime zku and ketime zka relations can allow us to estimate the ke at the locations where there are no ground based measurements in the present work long term measurements of impact type disdrometers located at three different locations zhongli feitsui and hsiayun in north taiwan are used to collect the raindrop size distribution rsd information of six seasons spring mei yu summer autumn winter and typhoon measured rsds in six seasons are used to estimate the rainfall intensity mass weighted mean diameter rainfall ke flux ketime j m 2 h 1 ke content kemm j m 2 mm 1 radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies for the

rainfall ke and gpm dpr parameters i dm zku and zka are established for six seasons of each disdrometer location derived ke relations did not show any spatial disparity for a given season especially the kemm dm ketime zku and ketime zka relations on the other hand a clear seasonal differences in the rainfall ke relations are noticed at each observational site the established relations showed reasonable agreement in estimating the ke from the gpm dpr however in determining the ke the kemm dm relation showed outperformance over the remaining three relations ketime i ketime zku and ketime zka relations data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction raindrops falling from the cloud base with adequate kinetic energy can erode the soil surface and lead to soil erosion the kinetic energy of the raindrops or rainfall kinetic energy ke is one of the major driving factors in assessing the rainfall erosivity factor and the soil erosion kinnell 1987 salles et al 2000 wischmeier and smith 1958 accurate estimation and evaluation of rainfall ke provide the opportunity to improve the observational and modeling simulations of rainfall erosivity dai et al 2020 janapati et al 2019 nissan and toumi 2013 the rainfall ke was found to vary with geographic locations weather conditions and seasons bezak et al 2021 janapati et al 2021 nanko et al 2016 rosewell 1986 seela et al 2021 van dijk et al 2005 as the direct measurement of rainfall ke requires expensive experimental setups raindrop size distribution information has been used as an alternative approach to estimate the rainfall ke jayawardena and rezaur 2000 kinnell 1981 van dijk et al 2002 filter paper cerdá 1997 lu et al 2008 flour pellet carter et al 1974 impact fornis et al 2005 jayawardena and rezaur 2000 steiner and smith 2000 and optical angulo martinez and barros 2015 petan et al 2010 methods have been adopted to measure the raindrop size distribution the rainfall ke and intensity ke i relations are used in assessing the rainfall erosivity factor or r factor these relations have been developed in different functional forms like liner power logarithmic exponential and polynomial carter et al 1974 kinnell 1981 lim et al 2015 park et al 1982 sempere torres et al 1992 wischmeier and smith 1958 taiwan an island in the northwest pacific region with complex topography has been affected by severe weather events like frontal systems convective storms and tropical cyclones chen et al 2010 cheung et al 2008 tu et al 2022 these severe weather systems can produce floods sediment discharge landslides and debris flow chen et al 2016 chen et al 2019 chen et al 2013 galewsky et al 2006 lin and chen 2012 a better understanding and improved prediction of landslides debris flows and soil erosion can be achieved through rainfall ke and rainfall erosivity information there have been reports on rainfall ke and erosivity in the taiwan region for instance using filter paper measurements from four different locations in taiwan yang ming mountain keelung taichung lien hua chi lu et al 2008 established do r ke i relations and they noticed substantial regional variations in rainfall erosivity in taiwan using joss waldvogel disdrometer jwd measurements chang et al 2017 evaluated the rainfall ke i relation for north shihmen and xiayun reservoir area and southern jiaxian taiwan they noticed dissimilarities between north and south taiwan the rainfall ke i relations reported using long term jwd measurements in north taiwan exhibited differences between typhoon and non typhoon rainfall events janapati et al 2021 using laws and parsons 1943 ke i relations daily monthly and annual precipitation data lee and lin 2015 estimated the rainfall erosivity index for kaohsiung city and pingtung country in southern taiwan they showed that the annual and monthly models can produce better results with the observed r factor liao et al 2019 evaluated the rainfall ke and erosivity for north taiwan using jwd measurements from four observational sites zhongli quchi fuxing and hanxi they argued that localized ke i relations can provide better rainfall erosivity using 15 years of jwd measurements and 60 years of hourly rain gauge data janapati et al 2019 assessed the typhoons rainfall ke erosivity and erosivity density their results exhibited relatively larger erosivity and erosivity density over southern taiwan than the rest moreover they also noticed a significant increasing trend in typhoon rainfall erosivity for south and eastern taiwan by adopting ke i relations to the locations with the rain gauge measurements one can estimate the rainfall ke and the rainfall erosivity dai et al 2020 janapati et al 2019 panagos et al 2015 however for complex topographic regions like taiwan especially mountain areas without rain gauge measurements an alternative way to estimate the ke is using rainfall information from remote sensing instruments like global precipitation measurement gpm dual frequency precipitation radar dpr the gpm core satellite is a joint project between nasa national aeronautics and space administration and jaxa japan aerospace exploration agency launched on 27 february 2014 the gpm dpr operating at ku band 13 6 ghz and ka band 35 5 ghz frequencies can measure the cloud and precipitation properties globally with a spatial coverage of 65 n to 65 s kidd et al 2020 skofronick jackson et al 2017 the dual frequency capabilities of gpm dpr can provide the precipitation size distribution raindrop size distribution information especially mass weighted mean diameter dm normalized intercept parameter log10 nw and other rain parameters like radar reflectivity at ku ka band zku zka and precipitation rate iguchi et al 2010 seto et al 2021 the ke expressed in terms of these gpm dpr products can offer the opportunity to estimate the rainfall ke at harsh locations like mountain areas without disdrometers and rain gauges a reasonable agreement reported between the rsd parameters of gpm dpr and ground based disdrometers confirms the reliability of gpm dpr data products for the hydro meteorological implications adirosi et al 2021 ryu et al 2021 wu et al 2019 moreover zhu et al 2021 also pointed out that the gpm dpr data products can be adapted to estimate the rainfall ke with acceptable errors recent reports have expressed the rainfall ke relations using dm zku and zku janapati et al 2021 seela et al 2021 seela et al 2022 nevertheless those studies didn t validate their relations with the gpm dpr data sets therefore the current study is conducted with the major objective like 1 to estimate the rainfall ke functional relations in terms of gpm dpr data products rainfall intensity mass weighted mean diameter radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies for north taiwan 2 to find out whether the obtained ke relations show seasonal and spatial variations 3 to validate the ke relations using gpm dpr data products and to figure out the superior performer among the four ke relations to our knowledge this is a kind of the first attempt to take advantage of remote sensing capabilities gpm dpr for estimating rainfall ke at locations with a scarcity of rain gauges or disdrometers the present work contributes to the improvement of rainfall erosivity estimation 2 data and methodology 2 1 study

a styrofoam cone of 50 cm2 cross sectional area joss and waldvogel 1969 and can measure the raindrops of diameter ranging from 0 3 to 5 3 mm measurement accuracy 5 the raindrops ranging from 0 3 to 5

gpm dpr data the onboard global precipitation measurement gpm mission core satellite is a joint research project between the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa it is equipped with a dual frequency precipitation radar with a spatial coverage of 65 n to 65 s skofronick jackson et al 2017 the gpm dpr contains ka band 35 5 ghz and ku band 13 6 ghz radars with a near surface horizontal resolution of 5 km the gpm dpr provides its data products in different scan modes namely normal scan ns matched scan ms and high sensitivity mode hs the ku band radar performs the ns mode and the ka band radar performs the hs and ms modes in ns mode the ku band radar covers a swath of 245 km with 49 footprints of 5 km in diameter each among 49

december february spring march 15 may mei yu 16 may 15 june summer 16 june august autumn september november and typhoons due to the disparities in the raindrop size distribution characteristics of north taiwan s seasonal rainfall janapati et al 2021 lee et al 2019 seela et al 2018 the combined jwd measurements of three locations recorded a total number of 700 347 482 783 220 427 173 153 511 717 and 230 614 1 min rsd samples with rainfall intensities 0 1 mm 1 respectively for winter spring mei yu summer autumn and typhoon in this study taiwan central weather bureau cwb typhoon warning periods are considered as typhoon days the statistical information minimum maximum mean median and standard deviation of mass weighted mean diameter dm mm rainfall intensity i mm h 1 radar reflectivity at ku

parameters dm i zku zka ketime and kemm for six seasons are portrayed in fig 3 apparent disparities in rsd and rainfall ke parameters can be seen with relatively higher mean and median values in summer mei yu and typhoon than in winter spring and autumn more large drops from deep and intense cloud systems in summer mei yu and typhoon seasons can be attributed to higher rsd and ke parameters than in the rest three seasons winter spring and autumn lee et al 2019 3 1 estimation of ketime zka and ketime zku relations the distribution of rainfall kinetic energy expenditure ketime with radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies zku and zka are depicted in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the minimum detectable signals of ku and ka band radars were initially set to 18 dbz and 12 dbz respectively hou et al 2014 iguchi et al 2010 moreover a recent study demonstrated that the ku band ka band ms and hs modes showed minimum values of 12 7 dbz 15 61 dbz 10 40 dbz respectively masaki et al 2022 however the gpm overpasses over north taiwan indicated minimum zku and zka values of 15 11 dbz and 14 53 dbz respectively hence these minimum values are considered as the threshold for estimating ketime zku and ketime zka relations distribution of all three locations ketime with zku and zka are represented with yellow and green scatter data points in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively from fig 4 and fig 5 it is clear that the ketime is directly proportional to the zku and zka i e the ketime increases with the increase in zku fig 4 and zka fig 5 for six seasons to deduce the ketime zku and ketime zka empirical relations nonlinear least squares power regression model is applied to ketime and zku zka data points of each individual location and season separately in fig 4 and fig 5 these power fit lines are plotted with dotted dashed and dash doted black lines for feitsui hsiayuan and ncu respectively three locations feitsui hsiayun ncu power law fit lines of ketime zka and ketime zku relations overlap for all the seasons which indicates that there are inadequate spatial disparities in these relations for a given season the coefficient and exponent values of ketime azku b and ketime azka b relations for three locations and six seasons are given in table 4 and table 5 respectively relatively higher correlation coefficients and smaller normalized root mean square error values for ketime and zku zka data points indicates the better performance of the derived ketime zka and ketime zku relations 3 2 estimation of ketime i and kemm dm relations while estimating ke i relations for soil erosion previous studies suggested to use ke expenditure ketime rather than ke content kemm janapati et al 2019 salles et al 2002 verstraeten et al 2006 yu et al 2012 hence in the present study we establish the relationship between ke expenditure ketime and rainfall intensity fig 6 illustrates the distribution of ke expenditure ketime with rainfall intensity i for six seasons and three locations irrespective of the season the ketime spread increase with the increase in rainfall intensity in a conical fashion especially in spring mei yu and summer relatively low rainfall intensities and less ketime dispersion in winter than in the rest of the seasons can be related to warm clouds with relatively uniform precipitation lee et al 2019 seela et al 2018 furthermore while estimating the relationship between ketime and rainfall intensity previous studies demonstrated that the power law can provide the better fit hence here we estimated the ketime i relations in the form of power law the ketime i fitting lines of three locations are also displayed in fig 6 the three locations fit lines do not show much variation for the rainfall intensities up 60 mm h 1 and these lines exhibit dissimilarities for rainfall intensity above 60 mm h 1 the ketime i fit lines are distinctly different for the mei yu season and nearly identical for typhoons the ketime i relations of three locations for six seasons are given in table 6 the coefficient values of ketime i relations ketime a ib are relatively higher in summer than the remaining seasons if we look at each observational site the coefficient values are higher in mei yu and summer for feitsui and hsiayuan and in summer and spring for ncu the scatter plots between the rainfall kinetic energy content kemm and mass weighted mean diameter dm for three locations and six seasons are portrayed in fig 7 the figure shows an increase in kemm with the dm values for all six seasons while relating the kemm with dm values power exponential first and second order polynomial fit equations were performed and we noticed that the second order polynomial equation showed a better fit moreover the previous researchers also used second order polynomial fit equation janapati et al 2021 wen et al 2019 zeng et al 2022 hence we also used second order polynomial equation to relate the kemm with dm values for the considered locations and seasons it is worth noting that the three locations fit lines overlap with one over the other for most of the seasons the coefficient values of kemm dm relations kemm a dm 2 b dm c for three locations and six seasons are given in table 7 3 3 validation and discussion the rainfall ke empirical relations expressed in gpm dpr data products ketime zka ketime zku ketime i and kemm dm relations from the disdrometer measurements are validated using the gpm dpr overpasses data during 2014 2022 we noticed a total number of 122 overpasses with 87 matched data points more details on the number of overpasses for different scan modes at three locations are provided in table 8 because of the difficulty in finding the accurate pixel related to the disdrometer measured precipitation previous researchers proposed two alternative approaches namely average and optimal methods to compare the gpm dpr data products with ground based disdrometers adirosi et al 2021 the optimal method selects one of the dpr pixels located with a 3 3 box of the disdrometer whose reflectivity matches the disdrometer in the average method the dpr pixels with a radius of 5 km from the disdrometer site are averaged adirosi et al 2021 suggested considering 10 min average of disdrometer measurements to reduce the differences in the space and time sampling between gpm dpr and disdrometer hence while validating the rainfall ke empirical relations in the present study the nearest surface bin gpm dpr data products over the disdrometer site were considered using the average method the disdrometer measurements are averaged for a 10 min time window that corresponds to the gpm overpasses the jwd rsd measurements during the gpm overpasses are set aside for validation purposes by inputting the disdrometers and gpm dpr measurements zku zka i and dm into the function relations listed in tables 4 7 the rainfall kes are computed for each location and season in order to find out the better performing functional relation and scan mode inter comparison of ke derived from zku and zka from disdrometers and different scans of the gpm dpr are illustrated with a scatter plot in fig 8 similarly fig 9 shows the scatter plots of ke resulting from rainfall intensity and mass weighted mean diameter from disdrometers and different scans of the gpm dpr the dashed diagonal line in fig 8 fig 9 corresponds to a one to one relation line the ke values estimated from the rsd parameters of each dpr scan and the disdrometers are mostly aligned near to the one to one line fig 8 fig 9 nevertheless the ke values computed from different scans dm values are more diligently aligned to the one one line the statistical indices correlation coefficient root mean square error normalized mean bias and mean absolute error values obtained for comparing the ke values estimated from the rsd parameters of the disdrometer and different scans of gpm dpr are provided in table 9 and illustrated in fig 10 except for the dpr hs scan mode the ke estimated from four rsd parameters of gpm dpr showed a cc of greater than 0 4 the full scan modes of dpr ka and ku band radar dpr fs ka fs and ku fs indicated relatively higher cc than the high sensitivity scan mode dpr hs ka hs the ke values estimated from the dm values kemm dm of all scans dpr fs dpr hs ka fs ka hs and ku fs showed relatively smaller rmse than the rest three parameters i zku and zka the kemm dm ketime zku relations show smaller positive negative nmb values than the remaining ke relations for a given scan type similarly these two relations kemm dm and ketime zku show smaller mae values than the rest two equations for both full scan and high sensitivity scan modes of dpr ka and ku band radars table 9 and fig 10 confirm that the ke estimated from the dm values of gpm dpr can provide superior performance than the raining three parameters i zku and zka moreover the ketime zku relations showed a second better performance in estimating the ke from the gpm dpr on the other hand irrespective of the rsd parameters of the gpm dpr the ke values calculated from the full scan mode fs showed superior performance than the high sensitivity mode hs mode in the present study long terms disdrometer measurements from three locations in north taiwan are used to establish the statistically robust rainfall ke empirical relations in terms of gpm dpr data products earlier to the present work there were reports on the rainfall ke estimations over taiwan for instance lu et al 2008 generated the isoerodent map for taiwan using rainfall ke estimated using dyed filter methods even other previous rainfall ke studies over taiwan were limited to the few seasons or short duration data sets chang et al 2017 janapati et al 2021 all the previous studies over taiwan were conducted either by short duration data sets or they didn t reported the ke relations in terms of gpm dpr products like zku zka and dm hence the results presented in this study will aid to estimate the rainfall ke for taiwan region more specifically for north taiwan using gpm dpr data products 4 summary and conclusions taiwan is primarily influenced by extreme events like typhoons thunderstorms and frontal systems these severe events can lead to flash floods rainfall soil erosion and even landslides the functional relations between the rainfall ke and gpm dpr data products can help to find the rainfall ke at the harsh locations of taiwan especially in the mountain area where there are no rain gauge measurements hence in the present study long term raindrop size distribution information from three ground based disdrometers in north taiwan for six seasons winter spring mei yu summer autumn and typhoon are used to express functional relationships between the rainfall ke and gpm dpr data products namely radar reflectivity at ku and ka band frequencies zku zka dbz rainfall intensity i mm h 1 mass weighted mean diameter dm mm except for ketime i relations the remaining three ke relations ketime zku ketime zka and kemm dm showed no spatial variation for a given season inter comparison of rainfall ke calculated from the disdrometer and gpm dpr demonstrated the reasonable reliability of the estimated ke relations ketime zku ketime zka and kemm dm and ketime i relations nevertheless among four ke relations kemm dm relation showed superior performance considering the performance of ke relations concerning the gpm dpr scan types the full san mode dpr fs provided better estimates than the high sensitivity mode dpr hs and ka hs despite of gpm dpr measurement limitations such as attenuation ground clutter multiple scattering and non uniform beam filling effects the ke empirical relations obtained in this study can enhance rainfall ke values from the gpm dpr data products for north taiwan this allows us to better estimate north taiwan s rainfall erosivity factor and soil erosion even though the present study provides robust results it is limited to north taiwan region only as an extension of the present study more disdrometers measurements from the whole island will be considered to express the rainfall ke in terms of gpm dpr data products in our subsequent work further to figure out superior performer among the four rainfall ke functional relations there is need to estimate and validate the rainfall ke relations with gpm dpr data products for other geographical locations credit authorship contribution statement jayalakshmi janapati conceptualization formal analysis

2468,noah with multiparameterization noah mp is a new generation land surface model that is enhanced by noah and has multiparameterization as a major feature although various schemes have improved the applicability of this model the ability to reduce the uncertainties of the simulation results remains a challenge to improve the accuracy of snow depth prediction based on the multiparameterization schemes within the noah mp model we proposed a novel snow data assimilation framework configured using bayesian model averaging bma and genetic particle filter gpf within this framework we employed a kernel density smoother to create a probability density function of the model ensembles that are created using the gpf we selected representative parameterization scheme combinations within the noah mp model to conduct the simulation experiments we examined the feasibility of bma applied in snow depth prediction on this basis we investigated the performance of the bma gpf at eight seasonally snow covered study sites with different snow climates the results showed that bma can be used to obtain a deterministic snow depth prediction with a determination coefficient of 93 51 and a containing ration of prediction interval of 94 68 these results were significantly higher than the four scheme combinations within the training period however the bias of deterministic prediction was well below expectations the containing ration of uncertainty prediction interval was just 70 and was even lower than the four scheme combinations within the test period the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework helped to obtain snow depth prediction with a containing ration that ranged from 95 to 98 at eight sites and could be used in different snow climates further comparative results indicated that the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework no longer depended on the correction coefficients of the model prediction and the assumption that the posterior probability of the state variable obeys the gaussian distribution was not required finally we concluded that the bma gpf is a suitable candidate approach to snow depth multimodel ensemble simulation keywords bma methodology particle filter multiparameterization ensemble simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an indicator of climate change snow responds quickly to global warming snow being widely distributed and with its high sensitivity to climate evolution serves as a tool in global climate change research zhang et al 2014 takala et al 2011 snowmelt is an important water resource and more than one sixth of the earth s population relies on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply barnett et al 2005 griessinger et al 2016 oaida et al 2019 moreover its unique characteristics such as the snow surface albedo regulate the energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere thirel et al 2013 you et al 2020a snow can insulate the underlying soil and affect the temperature and energy balance of the soil because of its low thermal conductivity zhang 2005 piazzi et al 2019 furthermore snowmelt has a significant impact on water cycle processes and often contributes to flooding consequently the ability to make appropriate descriptions and correct simulations of snow processes has become extremely important and such research holds great significance in improving the prediction level of the regional climate and enhancing the ability to prevent disasters with the rapid development of computational power and numerical models snow processes can be simulated using a number of land surface and hydrological models that have emerged in recent years the degree of accuracy of snow simulations from different models is inconsistent however because these models have been developed with a highly variable degree of complexity according to their target applications piazzi et al 2019 despite progressive improvements the uncertainty in the model parameterization remains a root cause of these flaws which cannot be ignored fei et al 2021 to identify the simulation performance of models with different levels of snow processes several intercomparison projects to assess the impact of the model structure on the simulations have been conducted etchevers et al 2004 boone et al 2004 essery et al 2013 kim et al 2021 for example the snow model inter comparison project snowmip was implemented in 1999 and a comparative experiment involving 26 snow models was conducted on four meteorological observation sites in france canada the united states and switzerland etchevers et al 2002 the simulation performances of the snow models in forests was evaluated in the snowmip2 project in this project the simulation performances of 33 snow models including the snow module within the land surface model was investigated under the conditions of forest cover essery et al 2009 the impact of the model s complexity on the snow cover simulation was explored and the simulation performance of five snow models with different complexities was compared at different geographical locations including forest cover using the measurements from the cold land processes field experiment clpx feng et al 2008 a range of studies have focused on validating the modeling seasonal snowpack evolution using third party models in complex terrain or at a regional scale chen et al 2014 broxton et al 2016 dawson et al 2018 saxe et al 2021 these independent studies have not identified an overall best model for all situations and the model complexity and parameterizations of the physical processes were the main reasons for the uncertainty of the simulation under the condition of perfect forcing rutter et al 2009 unlike the substantial progress made with regard to the uncertainties in the forcing and parameters the uncertainties caused by the model s complexity seem unavoidable considering that studies on the uncertainty in the model s structure have been relatively limited you et al 2020a multimodel ensembles generally outperform the individual members of an ensemble because they can take advantage of the simulation capabilities of the distinct models and reduce the uncertainties of the simulation results hagedorn et al 2005 duan et al 2007 barfus and bernhofer 2014 yan et al 2016 additionally combining multimodel ensemble simulations or forecasts using appropriate statistical methods is an effective approach to describing simulation uncertainties and representing the possible range of prognostic variables chen et al 2015 sanderson and knutti 2012 fang and li 2016 bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical postprocessing scheme that is used to assign multimodel ensemble simulations with unequal weights to create predictive probability density functions compared with the traditional equal weighted method bma provides not only prediction expectation but also a reliable description of the predictive uncertainty that accounts for both between model and within model variances raftery et al 2005 recently bma has been widely used to improve the prediction accuracy of hydrological models duan et al 2007 weather forecasting liu and xie 2014 wu et al 2012 evapotranspiration estimations zhu et al 2016 and paleoclimate reconstruction fang and li 2016 other multimodel ensemble methods such as the direct averaging method and multiple regression have been compared with bma and it has been found that a better estimation can be obtained using bma sloughter et al 2007 ellison 2004 the objective of the data assimilation methodology is to obtain the most likely estimation of the snowpack state by combining different sources of information while considering prior errors such as errors in the model observations and parameters magnusson et al 2017 piazzi et al 2019 snow data assimilation can effectively improve the accuracy of snow depth simulations because it can merge these observations into a snow model framework in real time a series of data assimilation methods with different degrees of complexity have been proposed and employed for snow data assimilation the primary level of complex methods includes direct insertion rodell and houser 2004 malik et al 2012 the cressman scheme drusch et al 2004 dee et al 2011 the optimal interpolation method liston and hiemstra 2008 and the nudging method boni et al 2010 the higher level of complex methods includes the kalman filter and its variants such as the ensemble kalman filter evensen 2003 the extended kalman filter moradkhani 2008 sun et al 2004 and the ensemble transform kalman filter seo et al 2021 similar to the kalman filter and its variants the particle filter pf is another bayesian recursive estimation technique for state and parameter updates which approximates the posterior probability distributions of the model s state using a finite set of particles arulampalam et al 2002 the pf offers absolute advantages over the kalman filter variants because the pf can be used for nonlinear systems whereas the kalman updates are appropriate only for linear models van leeuwen 2009 smyth et al 2019a smyth et al 2019b in addition the pf not only has been proven to be more computationally efficient than the ensemble kalman filter but also has been argued to be able to handle models with a varying number of layers margulis et al 2015 charrois et al 2016 despite the success of the pf in snow data assimilation particle degeneracy and impoverishment are potential limitations that remain to be solved piazzi et al 2018 smyth et al 2019 smyth et al 2020 cluzet et al 2021 to alleviate the particle degeneracy problem a genetic algorithm has been employed in the resampling process that is the genetic particle filter gpf sawada et al 2015 currently the gpf algorithm is considered to be an effective method and has received significant attention for instance the gpf algorithm has been applied to land surface temperature downscaling mechri et al 2014 assimilation of the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 observed brightness temperature in the land surface model sawada et al 2015 and nonlinear state estimations uosaki et al 2004 these studies have demonstrated that the gpf algorithm can overcome the degeneracy limitation and that it has a higher computational efficiency than the pf therefore in this study we employed the gpf to improve the modeled snow depth of the representative scheme combinations within the noah mp model yang et al 2011 niu et al 2011 both data assimilation and bma are optimal posterior estimation methods that can be used to reduce the uncertainties of the simulated snow depth in single and multiple models in this study the main goal was to improve the accuracy of the snow depth simulated by multiple scheme combinations within the noah mp model to this end we employed gpf to improve the accuracy of the modeled snow depth from the perspective of a single scheme combination and used bma to merge the snow depth simulated by multiple scheme combinations with the expectation that we would obtain a reliable forecast on this basis we developed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework which is appropriate for multiple scheme combinations and investigated its performance in different snow climates this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the representative scheme combinations within noah mp model the theory of the gpf data assimilation scheme static bma and the process of the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework section 3 describes the study sites and design of numerical experiment section 4 presents the results of the static bma and bma gpf experiment section 5 summarizes the findings of this study 2 methods 2 1 representative scheme combinations within the noah mp model the noah mp model was augmented for different physical processes using recently improved physics in the land surface models lsms from noah ek et al 2003 chen et al 2007 and a varying number of parameterization schemes were incorporated into different physical processes all of the parameterization schemes are presented in table 1 yang et al 2011 niu et al 2011 in our previous study we determined that the simulated snow depth and snow water equivalent swc were sensitive to the parameterization schemes of surface layer drag coefficient sfc lower boundary condition of the soil temperature tbot partitioning of precipitation into rainfall and snowfall pcp and the first snow layer or soil temperature time scheme temp you et al 2020a you et al 2020b furthermore the sfc and temp were highly sensitive in most snow climates and selecting different parameterization schemes in physical process sfc and temp resulted in large differences in the simulation results therefore we created a total of four scheme combinations through sfc and temp parameterizations and set the parameterization options of nine other physical processes as the defaults sfc 1 temp 1 sfc 1 temp 2 sfc 2 temp 1 and sfc 2 temp 2 you et al 2020b these four scheme combinations had significant different ablation mechanisms because the parameterizations for highly sensitive physical processes were different which were equivalent to the four types of snow models to reduce the uncertainty of simulated snow depth and improve the simulation accuracy we employed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework for these four scheme combinations and investigated the performance across snow climates 2 2 genetic particle filter the pf is a widely used sequential data assimilation approach and is appropriate for nonlinear models as well as for various probability distributions magnusson et al 2017 the essence of pf is to replicate a large number of random realizations i e particles of the system state to represent the posterior distribution p x t y equation 1 parrish et al 2012 the particles are propagated forward in time as the model is integrated with uncertain forcing data when an observation occurs it is assimilated into the forward model i e the noah mp model and the weights associated with the particles are updated based on the likelihood of each particle s simulated proximity to the real observation then the posterior distribution is approximated by summing the discrete measurements as follows 1 p x t y i 1 n w t i δ x t x t i where n is the number of particles w t i is the posterior normalized weight of the i th particle and δ is the dirac delta function assuming there are n realizations x k i w k i i 1 n the initial estimate of the state is x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 n and the weight of each particle is set as w t 1 n 1 n the state prediction can be obtained through the forward model as follows 2 x t i f x t 1 i u k w t w t n 0 q t in addition the observation simulation can be obtained using the observation operator as follows 3 y t i h x t i v t v t n 0 r t when there are observation data z t the observed data at the corresponding time are assimilated into the system and the weights associated with the particles are updated thus we have the following 4 w t i w t 1 i p z t x t i p x t i x t 1 i q x t i x t 1 i z t in this study x t i is the snow depth value simulated by the noah mp model z t is the observed snow depth data p z t x t i is the likelihood function which is calculated using the snow depth simulated by the observation operator and observation data and q x t i x t 1 i z t is the importance sampling function the model transition probability function can also be called the prior probability density function p x t i x t 1 i and generally is chosen as an important sampling function to simplify the calculation magnusson et al 2017 li et al 2019 which is given as follows 5 q x t i x t 1 i z t p x t i x t 1 i for the experiments conducted in this study a gaussian error distribution was considered to perturb the observation values the likelihood function was defined to represent the errors 6 p z t x t i n z t x t i σ where n is the normal probability distribution of the residuals between the observed z t and simulated x t snow depth m then the weight of the particles can be updated as follows 7 w t i w t 1 i p z t x t i finally the weights of the updated snow depth can be normalized as follows 8 w t i w t i i 1 n w t i the assimilated value of snow depth is the weighted average of all of the snow depth values at time t and is given by the following 9 x t i 1 n w t i x t i for the pf algorithm particle degeneration can pose a significant challenge because the weights of most particles will become very small and only a few particles will have weights after several particle iterations extensive calculations are required to update the particle weights that are almost zero to overcome this degeneration problem in the pf algorithm the particles were resampled using the resampling methods if the effective sample size 10 n eff 1 i 1 n w t i 2 fell below a specified number of particles although the degeneracy problem can be eliminated through resampling methods resampling can lead to sample impoverishment or to a lack of particle diversity especially when the processing noise is low leisenring and moradkhani 2011 traditional resampling methods such as the multinominal resampling and systematic resampling methods are simple to implement and can solve the particle degeneration problem effectively but these methods suffer from particle impoverishment because of the implementation of resampling at every time step arulampalam et al 2002 leisenring and moradkhani 2011 in our case we employed the gpf as the data assimilation scheme the gpf not only maintained the diversity of particles in the resampling process but also has been proven to have strong robustness for details on the gpf implementation see kwok et al 2005 and mechri et al 2014 2 3 static bayesian model averaging bma was proposed by raftery et al 2005 as a statistical probabilistic scheme for multimodel combination and it was first implemented in the field of hydrology by duan et al 2007 essentially bma prediction is the average of individual predictions and better performing models will receive higher weights this approach seeks to find the static parameters weights and model variances from a training period with a set of observations d consider a quantity y to be forecasted such as the snow depth in this study assuming y f y f 1 y f 2 y f i are independent model predictions obtained from i different models i 4 in this study m m 1 m 2 m k p y t y f i d is the posterior distribution of y given the model prediction y f i and the observational dataset d according to the law of total probability the posterior distribution of the bma prediction of y conditioned on the model s forecast y f i and the training period observations d can be expressed as follows 11 p y t m 1 m 2 m k d i 1 k p y f i d p y t y f i d where p y f i d is the posterior probability of the forecast y f i being the best one given the observational data d in general it is denoted as w i p y f i d and we should obtain i 1 k w i 1 in most applications to determine the weights and model variances for a fixed training period the conditional posterior distribution of y based only on model y f i p y t y f i d was supposed to have a gaussian distribution centered at the linear function of the original forecast a i y f i b i where a i and b i are the bias correction coefficients that are derived by a simple linear regression of y t on y f i for each of the individual ensemble members from the training data with standard deviation σ i which is denoted as g y t y f i σ i 2 then equation 1 can be rewritten to describe the likelihood that a particular observation is predicted 12 p y t m 1 m 2 m i d i 1 k w i g y t y f i σ i 2 for numerical stability and algebraic simplicity the log of 12 is considered 13 l o g p y t m 1 m 2 m i d l o g i 1 k w i g y t y f i σ i 2 by summing this over the training period let θ w i σ i 2 i 1 2 k an objective function can be maximized and written as follows 14 ℓ θ m a x t 1 t l o g i 1 k w i g y t y f i σ i 2 we then need to find the optimal weights w i and variance σ i 2 for each model to maximize equation 14 however it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution for θ in this study we employed the expectation maximization em algorithm raftery et al 2005 to search the optimal value of w i and σ i 2 2 4 bma gpf snow data assimilation framework it is possible to relax the assumption that the posterior distribution is a normal distribution using the pf for which the forecast is a distribution that can act directly as the posterior distribution of y given the past model predictions and observations parrish et al 2012 as explained in the previous section in the description of a static bma method the posterior probability of the quantity y is usually assumed be a gaussian distribution in the em solving algorithm p y t m i y g y t y t f i σ i 2 snow depth however does not obey a gaussian distribution therefore the simulated and observed snow depths need to be normalized before applying the bma method to estimate the weights in the model moreover bma deeply relies on the model bias correction coefficients which results in significant limitations when applied in long sequence snow depth prediction in this framework we employed the kernel density smoother wilks 2006 to configure the posterior probability density function in the particle ensemble of the gpf algorithm and then we used the posterior probability density function to calculate the bma weights this improvement made it unnecessary to assume that the posterior probability obeys a gaussian distribution in the bma method the posterior probability density function calculated using the particle samples likely would be closer to the real state an additional advantage of using the pf is that the multimodality or the skewness of state can be determined in the state estimation stage moreover the result transformed by the observation operator is also multimodality or skewness assuming that the resampled particles of state are x t at time t the posterior probability distribution of state can be approximately obtained as follows 15 x t x t 1 x t 2 x t 3 x t n p x t y t i 1 n w t i δ x t x t i in this study we obtained the prediction ensemble of a state variable by evolving the noah mp model and transformed the prediction ensemble into the observation space using an observation operator then it was used to calculate the posterior probability density function of the state variable p y t m i y t 1 here we used the particle ensemble to construct the posterior probability density function using the kernel density smoother fig 1 shows the flowchart for calculating the particle posterior probability distribution because we did not use satellite observation data in this data assimilation experiment the observation operator is the identity matrix similar to a histogram we divided the particle ensemble into intervals and calculated the probability for the center of each interval using the kernel density smoother unlike a histogram these intervals could overlap and act more like a sliding window moving across the ensemble members thus creating a more continuous curve parrish et al 2012 in addition the probability at the center of the interval was based on a weighted average of a kernel rather than just a tally of the ensemble members in our study we configured the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework by combining the advantages of bma and gpf and thus integrated multiple parameterization scheme combinations within the noah mp model with snow observation data fig 2 shows the framework of the bma gpf method we selected four representative parameterization scheme combinations within the noah mp model as the model operators the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework included the following six steps 1 snow depth initialization the forcing data were perturbed and input into the model and the initial snow depth ensemble of the four scheme combinations was obtained 2 snow depth prediction the snow depth prediction ensemble at the current moment was simulated using the four scheme combinations 3 observation forecasting the ensemble of the current observation forecast was obtained using the observation operator 4 snow depth analyzation the snow depth analysis ensemble of the four scheme combinations was obtained from the assimilation observation data using the gpf 5 posterior probability density function calculation the kernel density smoother method was used to calculate the posterior probability density function of the particles at the current moment in the observation forecasting ensemble 6 average of the simulated snow depth of multiple scheme combinations based on the observation data the posterior probability density function estimated using the kernel density smoother was used to obtain the optimal posterior estimation of snow depth in the bma method 3 experimental setup 3 1 study sites we selected the altay meteorological observation station aty 735 3 m located in northern xinjiang in china to validate the feasibility of the bma method used in snow depth prediction high quality meteorological forcing data for the model such as the near surface air temperature pressure relative humidity and snow depth were obtained at this site we selected eight seasonally snow covered study sites including the aty site in distinct snow climates trujillo et al 2014 to validate the efficiency of the bma gpf snow data assimilation method the sites included the arctic sodankylä site sda 179 m located in finland the col de porte cdp 1330 m site located in the rhone alpes france the refugio poqueira site ropa 2510 m located in the sierra nevada mountains spain the weissfluhjoch site wfj 2 540 m located in davos switzerland the swamp angel study plot sasp 3370 m site located in colorado united states the snoqualmie site snq 921 m located in the washington cascades united states and the aty site and mohe site mohe 438 5 m from typical snow covered regions in china we employed the dataset from these sites to investigate the sensitivity of snow simulation to parameterizations and to examine the simulation performance of the typical scheme combinations within noah mp model the results demonstrated that the eligible observation dataset could be used to carry out snow simulation experiments you et al 2020a you et al 2020b for details on the study sites see you et al 2020a perhaps surprisingly the bma experiment was conducted at just one site whereas the performance of bma gpf was examined across multiple snow climates although it was sufficient to illustrate the limitation of the bma methodology to merge the simulated snow depth at one site the bma gpf was expected to be examined in distinct snow climates in layman s terms the former verified the feasibility whereas the latter examined whether performance was better or worse 3 2 experimental design 3 2 1 generation of the forcing data ensemble in land surface models input datasets have a significant influence on the accuracy of the model s output including their spatial and temporal resolutions for snow simulations precipitation and air temperature are the most important input elements because of their roles in determining the quantity of rainfall and snowfall to produce the forcing data ensemble the air temperature and precipitation were perturbed following the method of lei et al 2014 in this study the precipitation was assumed to have an error with a log normal distribution and was expressed as follows 16 p t i exp μ ln p φ p i σ ln p 2 17 σ ln p ln α p p t 2 p t 2 1 18 μ ln p ln p t 2 p t 2 α p p t 2 where p t and p t i are the observed and perturbed precipitation at time t respectively the log transformation of p t i is a gaussian distribution with a mean μ ln p and a standard deviation σ ln p α p is the variance scaling factor of the precipitation which was set to 0 5 in this study and φ p i is a normally distributed random number the number of particles was set to 100 according to the sensitivity experiment by magnusson et al 2017 the ensemble of the air temperature was obtained as follows 19 t t i t t γ 1 2 w i w i u 0 1 where t t and t t i are the observed and perturbed air temperatures at time t respectively γ is the variance scaling factor of the temperature with a value of 2 0 and w i is the random noise with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 3 2 2 evaluation metrics we selected three metrics to evaluate the accuracy of deterministic forecast of the single scheme combination and bma gpf method we selected an additional three metrics to evaluate the goodness of fit of the snow depth prediction uncertainty interval 3 2 2 1 metrics for the forecast accuracy evaluation we focused on the four scheme combinations in the bma experiment and selected the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean deviation mbe to evaluate the accuracy of snow depth simulations the r 2 value reflected the degree of agreement between the simulated and observed snow depths the mbe reflected the degree of systematic deviation of the simulated snow depth and the rmse reflected the size of the error between the simulated and observed snow depths 1 coefficient of determination r 2 20 r 2 1 0 t 1 n d o t d s t 2 t 1 n d o t d o 2 where d o t and d s t are the observed and simulated snow depths at time t respectively and d o is the average value of observed snow depth in the training period the value of r 2 ranges from negative infinity to 1 0 and a larger value indicates a higher simulation accuracy this value is widely used as an accuracy evaluation metric 2 root mean squared error rmse 21 rmse 1 n t 1 n d o t d s t 2 because the deterministic coefficient may have a negative value the rmse can be used as a metric to

evaluation we selected the containing ratio c r average bandwidth b w and average deviation amplitude d a to evaluate the superiority of the uncertainty interval of forecast 1 containing ration c r c r is one of most commonly used metrics for evaluating the uncertainty interval of a forecast specifically in this study it refers to the ratio of the observed snow depth data included in the prediction interval a larger containing ratio indicates a higher coverage rate of the prediction interval 2 average bandwidth b w 23 b w 1 n t 1 n q u t q l t where q u t and q l t are the upper and

the d a can reflect the degree by which the center line of the forecast interval deviates from the snow depth observations as follows 24 d a 1 n t 1 n 1 2 q u t q l t d obs t where d obs t is the observed snow depth at time t a smaller d a indicates a better symmetry of the forecast interval 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the bma experiment to examine the feasibility of using bma to reduce the uncertainty of the snow depth multiparameterization ensemble simulation and to determine the applicability of bma to snow depth probability forecasting we selected the observation datasets for the aty site during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 snow periods for the experiment we used the observed snow depth during the 2013 2014 snow period to train the simulated snow depth according to the four scheme combinations and we used the observed snow depth during the 2014 2015 snow period to examine the training results which were the training and test periods of the bma because the snow cover changed significantly within a certain period we divided the training period into snow accumulation stable and ablation phases according to the variations in the snow depth and we used the observed snow depths during these three phases to train the simulation results to make the training results more accurate fig 3 compares the observed and simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations during the training period as shown in fig 3 the simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations had small differences during the accumulation and stable periods and had a large difference during the ablation period the difference was manifested in the snow melting rate and the time required for the snow to completely melt the simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations during accumulation period were quite close to the observations and had small simulation errors however the simulated snow depths of these four scheme combinations during the stable period were underestimated and had a large simulation error nevertheless the variation trends of the simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations were nearly consistent with the snow depth observations in these two stages as shown in fig 3 the snow melting rates of the four scheme combinations were significantly lower than those of the snow depth observations the slope of the curve is the snow melting rate which is why the simulated snow depths were all overestimated during the ablation stage the bma methodology assumes that the model forecasts are unbiased that is e y y f i 0 for each model i parrish et al 2012 fang and li 2016 although numerous bias correction methods are available we incorporated a simple linear regression method to correct for the bias of the forecasting results in the snow accumulation stable and ablation periods that is y a i e y f i b i where the snow depth observations y in the training period are the dependent variables and the forecasts of the scheme combinations y f i are the explanatory variables we determined the unique coefficients a i and b i for the different scheme combinations using a least squares approximation in the three snow stages we then applied these coefficients to the future forecasts unlike the air temperature and runoff the variation in the snow depth was highly dependent on the precipitation and large temporal dispersion snow depth at the site scale had many zero values and the distribution of the non zero snow depth values was highly skewed therefore we could not be directly describe snow depth using the normal probability density function in this special case we used the box cox normalized transformation method to transform the observed and simulated snow depths during the training period to a normal distribution then we used the data after the normal transformation for the training the box cox transformation formula is as follows 25 z t y t λ 1 λ λ 0 log y t λ 0 where y t is the data before transformation z t is the data after transformation and λ is the box cox normalized transformation coefficient in this study we determined the optimal value of λ using the kolmogorov smirnov test method fig 4 shows the normal probability of the data before and after the normal transformation as shown in fig 4 the simulated and observed snow depths had highly nonnormal distributions before the normal transformation the simulated and observed data however were obviously close to a normal distribution after the transformation but a fraction of the data still deviated from the normal distribution after that we applied the snow depth data during the training period in the bma methodology after the normal transformation and obtained the weights of the four scheme combinations in the different snow stages within the training period as shown in fig 5 the weights of each scheme combination in the different snow stages were all less than 0 4 and we observed certain differences in the weights of the scheme combinations furthermore the weight of each scheme combination reflected the relative contribution of the forecast to the bma optimal forecast fig 5 also shows that the training weights of the four combinations were basically the same in the snow accumulation and stable periods but their weights were significantly different in the snow ablation period when we simultaneously selected the first parameterization scheme of the physical processes sfc and temp the corresponding scheme combination later written as sfc 1 temp 1 had a larger bma weight 0 38 the weight of the scheme combination sfc 1 temp 2 was 0 18 which was very close to the training weight 0 19 of the scheme combination sfc 2 temp 2 based on the weights of each scheme combination in the different snow periods fig 5 the weight difference of each scheme combination was manifested mainly in the snow ablation stage this result indicated that the performance difference of each scheme combination was concentrated primarily in the snow ablation stage and that the highly sensitive parameterization scheme had a greater impact in the snow ablation stage than in the snow accumulation and stable stages the statistical results of the prediction value and the 95 confidence interval of the bma and the four scheme combinations in the snow period are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 the r 2 of the bma snow depth forecast was significantly higher than that of the other four scheme combinations during the training period and the rmse was significantly smaller than that of the four scheme combinations but the mbe was slightly larger than some of the scheme combinations in terms of the prediction interval the c r of the bma snow depth uncertainty prediction interval to the snow depth observation data was 94 68 this result indicated that the 95 confidence interval of the bma covered the majority of the snow depth observation data within the training period which was greater than the maximum value 75 of the four scheme combinations we found that the forecast interval of the bma within the training period was better than those of all of the scheme combinations according to the b w and d a metrics of the 95 confidence interval according to the evaluation indexes listed in table 2 and compared with the single scheme combination the snow depth deterministic forecast result of the bma was closer to the observations moreover the forecast interval of the bma during the training period was more accurate because the forecast interval of the bma could cover more snow depth observation data than any scheme combination the statistical results within the test period are presented in table 2 compared with any scheme combination neither the statistical metrics of the deterministic forecast nor the 95 confidence interval of the bma had any advantage in terms of the snow depth deterministic forecast the r 2 of the bma snow depth forecast was 84 68 the rmse was 4 55 and the mbe was 2 12 although some indicators of the bma were slightly better than those of the single scheme combination the indicators of the bma deterministic forecast were equivalent to those of the scheme combination sfc 1 temp 1 overall therefore unlike in the training period the deterministic forecast of the bma did not have an obvious advantage over the single scheme combination in the examination period in terms of the forecast interval within the test period the coverage rate of the bma forecast interval to the snow depth observation data was 70 which was even less than the coverage rates of the four scheme combinations moreover the average bandwidth and average deviation of the bma forecast interval also did not offer any advantages over the four scheme combinations we compared the snow depth deterministic prediction results of the four scheme combinations during the training and test periods with the bma shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the snow depth deterministic prediction of the bma was better than that of all of the single scheme combination during all of the snow stages and the deterministic prediction of the bma was closer to the observations than that of the single scheme combination unexpectedly the deterministic forecast of the bma in the test period deviated even more from the snow depth observations than the forecast of the four scheme combinations thus the deterministic forecast result of the bma in the test period was not as good as expected for instance the snow depth deterministic forecast of the bma was severely overestimated in january and the error was greater than the simulation errors of the four scheme combinations moreover compared with the four scheme combinations the snow depth deterministic forecast of the bma during the snow accumulation period was not significantly improved and it exhibited serious overestimation during the stable period compared with the simulation results of each scheme combination during the snow ablation period despite some improvements the deterministic prediction of the bma still deviated significantly from the observations this deviation indicated that the bma methodology may not necessarily be able to obtain a high precision deterministic forecast using the posterior information during the test period we compared the uncertainty forecast interval of the bma in the training and test periods with the observed snow depth shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the forecast interval of the bma in the training period could cover almost all of the snow depth observation data and the coverage ratio was 94 68 however the long term snow depth observation data in the test period were not covered by the uncertainty forecast interval of the bma the coverage rate of the snow depth observation data in the test period was 70 which was even lower than the coverage rates of the forecast intervals of the four scheme combinations this result indicated that the bma methodology could not obtain a reliable snow depth forecast interval in the test period thus the bma methodology could obtain a high accuracy snow depth deterministic forecast and a reliable uncertainty forecast interval by training the snow depth observation data in the training period it was unlikely however to obtain a high accuracy snow depth deterministic forecast and a reliable uncertainty forecast interval in the test period using the weights and variances obtained from the training period this result was different from the previous application of the bma methodology and we identified two main reasons for this unexpected result 1 unlike the surface elements such as runoff and air temperature the variation in the snow depth was highly dependent on snowfall and snowfall was highly discrete in time therefore the correction results obtained using the observed snow data for a specific time period also were time sensitive and the correction coefficients may not have been suitable for snow forecasts at future moments 2 from the point of view of the probability distribution the snow depth had to be normalized to meet the assumption that the posterior probability obeyed a gaussian distribution in the bma methodology however both this assumption and the normal transformation introduced errors in the forecast results according to these research results the bma methodology could be used as an effective postprocessing method for merging the simulated snow depths of the different scheme combinations and a reliable posterior estimation could be obtained when the observation data were sufficient the application of the bma methodology to long term snow forecasts in the future however had significant limitations because it had a high degree of dependence on the correction coefficient and the variation in the snow cover was strongly time dependent 4 2 case study of the bma gpf framework a successful snow data assimilation method should be validated across snow climates therefore we employed eight sites including the aty site from different snow climates to implement a snow data assimilation experiment using the bma gpf data assimilation framework this snow simulation was supposed to be sensitive or highly sensitive to the parameterizations of sfc and temp across snow climates therefore we selected the scheme combinations configured by sfc and temp to examine the performance of bma gpf as shown in fig 8 the snow simulations of these four scheme combinations had large differences in most sites like aty mohe and ropa but some scheme combinations had identical snow simulation results in some sites for example the snow simulations of scheme combination sfc 1 temp 2 and sfc 2 temp 2 were exactly the same in sda and cdp simultaneously they showed a slight difference in sasp and snq the snow simulations in the sites from typical snow covered regions in china however had significant differences especially during the snow ablation phase hence it was evident that the parameterizations of temp had highly sensitivity in all sites but the sensitivity of the sfc parameterizations was different in distinct snow climates nevertheless the scheme combinations configured by the sfc and temp parameterizations were typical combinations and should have been the optimal ensemble candidates for examining the performance of the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework after selecting scheme combinations we applied the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework in the snow depth forecast for the eight sites from distinct snow climates according to mathematical theory the bma and data assimilation approaches both sought the optimal posterior estimation of the state variable often however only an approximate value of the optimal posterior estimation could be obtained because of various errors in this study we expected the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework to obtain the optimal posterior estimation of snow depth which had a small error normally the intensive observation data in the assimilation scheme largely restricted the autonomous simulation ability of the model in this case the assimilation results of the different models were basically the same and were very close to the observations but they did not reflect the differences between the models therefore in this study we purposefully set the assimilation step of the gpf assimilation scheme as five days at all sites which resulted in the snow depth assimilation results of these four scheme combinations having a certain difference we estimated the posterior probability density function at each assimilation moment and used this estimation to calculate the weight and variance of each scheme combination in the bma methodology we investigated the impact of meteorological perturbations on simulations the 100 ensemble snow depth forced by distinct meteorological conditions for each scheme combination is shown in fig 9 a direct consequence of the perturbation of the forcing data was depicted in the ensemble spread which contained possible estimations of the ensemble simulations although we applied the identical meteorological perturbation approach to different scheme combinations the ensemble spreads were not exactly same which mainly was reflected in the upper and lower boundaries as shown in fig 9 during the snow accumulation period the spread of snow depth ensembles increased whenever a snowfall event occurred because the perturbations in the precipitation rates allowed for the different snowfall rates to be input for each scheme combination conversely the spread of snow depth ensembles during the snow ablation period was relatively stable because the near surface air temperature was the dominant factor affecting the snow melting rate unexpectedly we found these situations at all sites except for ropa at this site we observed a significant relationship with the climatology the variation in snow depth ensemble spread exhibited extreme irregularity and the high sublimation rate may have been the main reason for this snow instability a detailed analysis of climatology at this site is available in you et al 2020a we compared the snow depth assimilation results of the four scheme combinations with the snow depth observation given in fig 10 compared with the snow depth simulation results of each scheme combination the simulation accuracy was largely improved by the data assimilation at all sites as shown in fig 10 the snow depth data assimilation results for the different scheme combination were very close to the observation data and invariably had high precision at all sites at first the snow depth data assimilation results at the ropa site were not promising because differences in the snow depth simulations by the four scheme combinations were quite large and variations in snow depth exhibited extreme irregularity the snow depth data assimilation results for the different scheme combinations however were extremely close to the observations this result certainly could be attributed to the gpf data assimilation algorithm nevertheless we found that even though the same observation data were assimilated into the different scheme combinations and the assimilation conditions were exactly the same the assimilation results were slightly different at all sites these differences are highlighted in fig 10 we observed a larger difference at sites like sda aty and wfj and a smaller difference at ropa and mohe note that the original intention of the data assimilation was to comprehensively use the model prior and observation posterior information to obtain the optimal estimation of the state variable while fully considering the model error and the observation error we obtained different optimal state estimations using different scheme combinations because the simulation performance of each scheme combination within the noah mp model was not exactly the same therefore the question is which of these combinations obtains the optimal posterior estimation of snow depth we expected that the data assimilation approach would obtain the optimal posterior estimation of state but the model prior which was used to deduce optimal posterior estimation was always influenced by the limitations of the model structure therefore to obtain an optimal posterior estimation that was closer to the true state we used the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework to merge the data assimilation results according to the multiple scheme combinations fig 11 shows the scatterplots for snow depth from the bma gpf snow depth deterministic prediction at eight sites which are presented with the daily temporal scale as the figure shows snow depth from bma gpf indicated good agreement with the measurements at all sites the over or underestimations of the simulations by the four scheme combinations compared with fig 8 were evidently modified after assimilation and model merging and the snow depth from bma gpf prediction concentrated along the 1 1 line at all sites the rmses also are shown in fig 11 overall the bma gpf snow depth deterministic predictions all had high accuracy at the eight sites for instance the rmse values at aty and mohe were 0 01 and 0 02 m respectively which indicated that the bma gpf could obtain a reliable snow depth deterministic forecast at the two sites we observed a similar situation at sda and ropa although the rmse value was relatively large at snq and wfj this did not mean that the bma gpf deterministic prediction had lower accuracy at these sites the large rmse was mainly due to a deep snow cover at the two sites the maximum snow depth reached 3 m and inevitably resulted in a larger rmse than at other sites we compared the snow depth deterministic prediction and 95 confidence interval of bma gpf with the observations on temporal series as shown in fig 12 according to fig 12 the snow depth forecast of the bma gpf had a large uncertainty interval in the snow accumulation and stable periods and a small uncertainty forecast interval in the ablation period at all sites at most sites other than a few snow depth observations in the snow ablation period the snow depth uncertainty forecast interval basically covered all of the observation data certainly the 95 confidence intervals of bma gpf at the eight sites had a significant difference because the model simulation variances were different at these sites to illustrate the superiority of the uncertainty interval of bma gpf prediction we calculated the c r b w and d a values of the 95 confidence interval of the bma gpf during the entire snow period at different sites the results are presented in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the c r of the bma gpf forecast interval to the observed snow depth at the eight sites was above 95 and all eight sights had similar values in addition the d a of the bma gpf forecast interval ranged from 0 02 to 0 1 m at different sites snow thickness may have been the main factor that influenced the value of d a and the sites that had a deep snow cover like at wfj and snq usually obtained larger d a obviously the b w of the bma gpf forecast interval was different at the eight sites the largest value was 0 43 at wfj the next largest value was 0 34 at snq and the minimum value was 0 05 at aty we compared the statistical results of bma with the bma gpf and found that a substantial improvement had been made by the bma gpf at all of the sites for example at the aty site the containing ration of bma was 70 and the bma gpf was 96 the average bandwidth of bma was 8 02 cm and the bma gpf was 5 0 cm and the average deviation amplitude of bma was 4 07 cm and the bma gpf was 2 0 cm these results indicated that when we employed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework in different snow climates we obtained the optimal posterior estimation of the model state these experimental results showed that the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework combined the advantages of the bma methodology and the gpf algorithm to achieve the comprehensive integration of multiple scheme combinations and snow depth observations the results of applying bma gpf snow data assimilation framework across snow climates demonstrated that the accuracy of the bma gpf snow depth prediction results was excellent overall and that this framework could be used in different snow climates not only did the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework improve the forecast accuracy to a certain extent but it also produced a reliable uncertainty forecast interval multiple posterior estimations produced by scheme combinations could be integrated by this framework to infer the optimal posterior estimation of the state variable we always expected the optimal estimation obtained by the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework to be closer to the true value in addition from the mathematical perspective this framework removed the assumption that the posterior probability distribution was gaussian in the bma methodology and the application of the bma in the snow depth prediction did not require a normal conversion moreover the bma methodology in this framework no longer depended on the empirical correction coefficient 5 conclusions in this study we reduced the uncertainty of the simulated snow depth obtained using the noah mp model we used the bma methodology to merge the snow depth simulation results of multiple combinations and evaluated the fusion result on this basis we developed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework by coupling the bma and the gpf algorithm and examined the performance of the bma gpf across snow climates the main findings of this study are as follows 1 the bma methodology was an effective postprocessing method for merging the simulated snow depth using multiple scheme combinations however the correction coefficient obtained in the training period was not suitable for the test period because snowfall was not continuous and was highly discrete in time the bma relied too heavily on the correction coefficients which made it unsuitable for snow forecasting 2 the expectation maximization algorithm used in the bma methodology assumed that the posterior probability would obey a normal distribution for the sake of calculation simplicity the snow depth did not obey a normal distribution however and thus had to be normalized before being used for the calculations which introduced errors in the forecast results 3 the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework coupled with the bma methodology and the gpf algorithm used particles to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the state variables it did not assume that the posterior probability would obey a normal distribution which further improved the fusion accuracy the experiments conducted in this study were based on forcing data and snow observations from the sites across different snow climates additional studies are needed to examine the performance of the bma gpf at the regional scale the results of this study provide a reference for applying the bma methodology to snow forecasting and

2468,noah with multiparameterization noah mp is a new generation land surface model that is enhanced by noah and has multiparameterization as a major feature although various schemes have improved the applicability of this model the ability to reduce the uncertainties of the simulation results remains a challenge to improve the accuracy of snow depth prediction based on the multiparameterization schemes within the noah mp model we proposed a novel snow data assimilation framework configured using bayesian model averaging bma and genetic particle filter gpf within this framework we employed a kernel density smoother to create a probability density function of the model ensembles that are created using the gpf we selected representative parameterization scheme combinations within the noah mp model to conduct the simulation experiments we examined the feasibility of bma applied in snow depth prediction on this basis we investigated the performance of the bma gpf at eight seasonally snow covered study sites with different snow climates the results showed that bma can be used to obtain a deterministic snow depth prediction with a determination coefficient of 93 51 and a containing ration of prediction interval of 94 68 these results were significantly higher than the four scheme combinations within the training period however the bias of deterministic prediction was well below expectations the containing ration of uncertainty prediction interval was just 70 and was even lower than the four scheme combinations within the test period the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework helped to obtain snow depth prediction with a containing ration that ranged from 95 to 98 at eight sites and could be used in different snow climates further comparative results indicated that the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework no longer depended on the correction coefficients of the model prediction and the assumption that the posterior probability of the state variable obeys the gaussian distribution was not required finally we concluded that the bma gpf is a suitable candidate approach to snow depth multimodel ensemble simulation keywords bma methodology particle

being widely distributed and with its high sensitivity to climate evolution serves as a tool in global climate change research zhang et al 2014 takala et al 2011 snowmelt is an important water resource and more than one sixth of the earth s population relies on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply barnett et al 2005 griessinger et al 2016 oaida et al 2019 moreover its unique characteristics such as the snow surface albedo regulate the energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere thirel et al 2013 you et al 2020a snow can insulate the underlying soil and affect the temperature and energy balance of the soil because of its low thermal conductivity zhang 2005 piazzi et al 2019 furthermore snowmelt has a significant impact on water cycle processes and often contributes to flooding consequently the ability to make appropriate descriptions and correct simulations of snow processes has become extremely important and such research holds great significance in improving the prediction level of the regional climate and enhancing the ability to prevent disasters with the rapid development of computational power and numerical models snow processes can be simulated using a number of land surface and hydrological models that have emerged in recent years the degree of accuracy of snow simulations from different models is inconsistent however because these models have been developed with a highly variable degree of complexity according to their target applications piazzi et al 2019 despite progressive improvements the uncertainty in the model parameterization remains a root cause of these flaws which cannot be ignored fei et al 2021 to identify the simulation performance of models with different levels of snow processes several intercomparison projects to assess the impact of the model structure on the simulations have been conducted etchevers et al 2004 boone et al 2004 essery et al 2013 kim et al 2021 for example the snow model inter comparison project snowmip was implemented in 1999 and a comparative experiment involving 26 snow models was conducted on four meteorological observation sites in france canada the united states and switzerland etchevers et al 2002 the simulation performances of the snow models in forests was evaluated in the snowmip2 project in this project the simulation performances of 33 snow models including the snow module within the land surface model was investigated under the conditions of forest cover essery et al 2009 the impact of the model s complexity on the snow cover simulation was explored and the simulation performance of five snow models with different complexities was compared at different geographical locations including forest cover using the measurements from the cold land processes field experiment clpx feng et al 2008 a range of studies have focused on validating the modeling seasonal snowpack evolution using third party models in complex terrain or at a regional scale chen et al 2014 broxton et al 2016 dawson et al 2018 saxe et al 2021 these independent studies have not identified an overall best model for all situations and the model complexity and parameterizations of the physical processes were the main reasons for the uncertainty of the simulation under the condition of perfect forcing rutter et al 2009 unlike the substantial progress made with regard to the uncertainties in the forcing and parameters the uncertainties caused by the model s complexity seem unavoidable considering that studies on the uncertainty in the model s structure have been relatively limited you et al 2020a multimodel ensembles generally outperform the individual members of an ensemble because they can take advantage of the simulation capabilities of the distinct models and reduce the uncertainties of the simulation results hagedorn et al 2005 duan et al 2007 barfus and bernhofer 2014 yan et al 2016 additionally combining multimodel ensemble simulations or forecasts using appropriate statistical methods is an effective approach to describing simulation uncertainties and representing the possible range of prognostic variables chen et al 2015 sanderson and knutti 2012 fang and li 2016 bayesian model averaging bma is a statistical postprocessing scheme that is used to assign multimodel ensemble simulations with unequal weights to create predictive probability density functions compared with the traditional equal weighted method bma provides not only prediction expectation but also a reliable description of the predictive uncertainty that accounts for both between model and within model variances raftery et al 2005 recently bma has been widely used to improve the prediction accuracy of hydrological models duan et al 2007 weather forecasting liu and xie 2014 wu et al 2012 evapotranspiration estimations zhu et al 2016 and paleoclimate reconstruction fang and li 2016 other multimodel ensemble methods such as the direct averaging method and multiple regression have been compared with bma and it has been found that a better estimation can be obtained using bma sloughter et al 2007 ellison 2004 the objective of the data assimilation methodology is to obtain the most likely estimation of the snowpack state by combining different sources of information while considering prior errors such as errors in the model observations and parameters magnusson et al 2017 piazzi et al 2019 snow data assimilation can effectively improve the accuracy of snow depth simulations because it can merge these observations into a snow model framework in real time a series of data assimilation methods with different degrees of complexity have been proposed and employed for snow data assimilation the primary level of complex methods includes direct insertion rodell and houser 2004 malik et al 2012 the cressman scheme drusch et al 2004 dee et al 2011 the optimal interpolation method liston and hiemstra 2008 and the nudging method boni et al 2010 the higher level of complex methods includes the kalman filter and its variants such as the ensemble kalman filter evensen 2003 the extended kalman filter moradkhani 2008 sun et al 2004 and the ensemble transform kalman filter seo et al 2021 similar to the kalman filter and its variants the particle filter pf is another bayesian recursive estimation technique for state and parameter updates which approximates the posterior probability distributions of the model s state using a finite set of particles arulampalam et al 2002 the pf offers absolute advantages over the kalman filter variants because the pf can be used for nonlinear systems whereas the kalman updates are appropriate only for linear models van leeuwen 2009 smyth et al 2019a smyth et al 2019b in addition the pf not only has been proven to be more computationally efficient than the ensemble kalman filter but also has been argued to be able to handle models with a varying number of layers margulis et al 2015 charrois et al 2016 despite the success of the pf in snow data assimilation particle degeneracy and impoverishment are potential limitations that remain to be solved piazzi et al 2018 smyth et al 2019 smyth et al 2020 cluzet et al 2021 to alleviate the particle degeneracy problem a genetic algorithm has been employed in the resampling process that is the genetic particle filter gpf sawada et al 2015 currently the gpf algorithm is considered to be an effective method and has received significant attention for instance the gpf algorithm has been applied to land surface temperature downscaling mechri et al 2014 assimilation of the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr 2 observed brightness temperature in the land surface model sawada et al 2015 and nonlinear state estimations uosaki et al 2004 these studies have demonstrated that the gpf algorithm can overcome the degeneracy limitation and that it has a higher computational efficiency than the pf therefore in this study we employed the gpf to improve the modeled snow depth of the representative scheme combinations within the noah mp model yang et al 2011 niu et al 2011 both data assimilation and bma are optimal posterior estimation methods that can be used to reduce the uncertainties of the simulated snow depth in single and multiple models in this study the main goal was to improve the accuracy of the snow depth simulated by multiple scheme combinations within the noah mp model to this end we employed gpf to improve the accuracy of the modeled snow depth from the perspective of a single scheme combination and used bma to merge the snow depth simulated by multiple scheme combinations with the expectation that we would obtain a reliable forecast on this basis we developed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework which is appropriate for multiple scheme combinations and investigated its performance in different snow climates this paper is organized as follows section 2

representative scheme combinations within the noah mp model the noah mp model was augmented for different physical processes using recently improved physics in the land surface models lsms from noah ek et al 2003 chen et al 2007 and a varying number of parameterization schemes were incorporated into different physical processes all of the parameterization schemes are presented in table 1 yang et al 2011 niu et al 2011 in our previous study we determined that the simulated snow depth and snow water equivalent swc were sensitive to the parameterization schemes of surface layer drag coefficient sfc lower boundary condition of the soil temperature tbot partitioning of precipitation into rainfall and snowfall pcp and the first snow layer or soil temperature time scheme temp you et al 2020a you et al 2020b furthermore the sfc and temp were highly sensitive in most snow climates and selecting different parameterization schemes in physical process sfc and temp resulted in large differences in the simulation results therefore we created a total of four scheme combinations through sfc and temp parameterizations and set the parameterization options of nine other physical processes as the defaults sfc 1 temp 1 sfc 1 temp 2 sfc 2 temp 1 and sfc 2 temp 2 you et al 2020b these four scheme combinations had significant different ablation mechanisms because the parameterizations for highly sensitive physical processes were different which were equivalent to the four types of snow models to reduce the uncertainty of simulated snow depth and improve the simulation accuracy we employed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework for these four scheme combinations and investigated the performance across snow climates 2 2 genetic particle filter the pf is a widely used sequential data assimilation approach and is appropriate for nonlinear models as well as for various probability distributions magnusson et al 2017 the essence of pf is to replicate a large number of random realizations i e particles of the system state to represent the posterior distribution p x t y equation 1 parrish et al 2012 the particles are propagated forward in time as the model is integrated with uncertain forcing data when an observation occurs it is assimilated into the forward model i e the noah mp model and the weights associated with the particles are updated based on the likelihood of each particle s simulated proximity to the real observation then the posterior distribution is approximated by summing the discrete measurements as follows 1 p x t y i 1 n w t i δ x t x t i where n is the number of particles w t i is the posterior normalized weight of the i th particle and δ is the dirac delta function assuming there are n realizations x k i w k i i 1 n the initial estimate of the state is x 0 x 0 1 x 0 2 x 0 3 x 0 n and the weight of each particle is set as w t 1 n 1 n the state prediction can be obtained through the forward model as follows 2 x t i f x t 1 i u k w t w t n 0 q t in addition the observation simulation can be obtained using the observation operator as follows 3 y t i h x t i v t v t n 0 r t when there are observation data z t the observed data at the corresponding time are assimilated into the system and the weights associated with the particles are updated thus we have the following 4 w t i w t 1 i p z t x t i p x t i x t 1 i q x t i x t 1 i z t in this study x t i is the snow depth value simulated by the noah mp model z t is the observed snow depth data p z t x t i is the likelihood function which is calculated using the snow depth simulated by the observation operator and observation data and q x t i x t 1 i z t is the importance sampling function the model transition probability function can also be called the prior probability density function p x t i x t 1 i and generally is chosen as an important sampling function to simplify the calculation magnusson et al 2017 li et al 2019 which is given as follows 5 q x t i x t 1 i z t p x t i x t 1 i for the experiments conducted in this study a gaussian error distribution was considered to perturb the observation values the likelihood function was defined to represent the errors 6 p z t x t i n z t x t i σ where n is the normal probability distribution of the residuals between the observed z t and simulated x t snow depth m then the weight of the particles can be updated as follows 7 w t i w t 1 i p z t x t i finally the weights of the updated snow depth can be normalized as follows 8 w t i w t i i 1 n w t i the assimilated value of snow depth is the weighted average of all of the snow depth values at time t and is given by the following 9 x t i 1 n w t i x t i for the pf algorithm particle degeneration can pose a significant challenge because the weights of most particles will become very small and only a few particles will have weights after several particle iterations extensive calculations are required to update the particle weights that are almost zero to overcome this degeneration problem in the pf algorithm the particles were resampled using the resampling methods if the effective sample size 10 n eff 1 i 1 n w t i 2 fell below a specified number of particles although the degeneracy problem can be eliminated through resampling methods resampling can lead to sample impoverishment or to a lack of particle diversity especially when the processing noise is low leisenring and moradkhani 2011 traditional resampling methods such as the multinominal resampling and systematic resampling methods are simple to implement and can solve the particle degeneration problem effectively but these methods suffer from particle impoverishment because of the implementation of resampling at every time step arulampalam et al 2002 leisenring and moradkhani 2011 in our case we employed the gpf as the data assimilation scheme the gpf not only maintained the diversity of particles in the resampling process but also has been proven to have strong robustness for details on the gpf implementation see kwok et al 2005 and mechri et al 2014 2 3 static bayesian model averaging bma was proposed by raftery et al 2005 as a statistical probabilistic scheme for multimodel combination and it was first implemented in the field of hydrology by duan et al 2007 essentially bma prediction is the average of individual predictions and better performing models will receive higher weights this approach seeks to find the static parameters weights and model variances from a training period with a set of observations d consider a quantity y to be forecasted such as the snow depth in this study assuming y f y f 1 y f 2 y f i are independent model predictions obtained from i different models i 4 in this study m m 1 m 2 m k p y t y f i d is the posterior distribution of y given the model prediction y f i and the observational dataset d according to the law of total probability the posterior distribution of the bma prediction of y conditioned on the model s forecast y f i and the training period observations d can be expressed as follows 11 p y t m 1 m 2 m k d i 1 k p y f i d p y t y f i d where p y f i d is the posterior probability of the forecast y f i being the best one given the observational data d in general it is denoted as w i p y f i d and we should obtain i 1 k w i 1 in most applications to determine the weights and model variances for a fixed training period the conditional posterior distribution of y based only on model y f i p y t y f i d was supposed to have a gaussian distribution centered at the linear function of the original forecast a i y f i b i where a i and b i are the bias correction coefficients that are derived by a simple linear regression of y t on y f i for each of the individual ensemble members from the training data with standard deviation σ i which is denoted as g y t y f i σ i 2 then equation 1 can be rewritten to describe the likelihood that a particular observation is predicted 12 p y t m 1 m 2 m i d i 1 k w i g y t y f i σ i 2 for numerical stability and algebraic simplicity the log of 12 is considered 13 l o g p y t m 1 m 2 m i d l o g i 1 k w i g y t y f i σ i 2 by summing this over the training period let θ w i σ i 2 i 1 2 k an objective function can be maximized and written as follows 14 ℓ θ m a x t 1 t l o g i 1 k w i g y t y f i σ i 2 we then need to find the optimal weights w i and variance σ i 2 for each model to maximize equation 14 however it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution for θ in this study we employed the expectation maximization em algorithm raftery et al 2005 to search the optimal value of w i and σ i 2 2 4 bma gpf snow data assimilation framework it is possible to relax the assumption that the posterior distribution is a normal distribution using the pf for which the forecast is a distribution that can act directly as the posterior distribution of y given the past model predictions and observations parrish et al 2012 as explained in the previous section in the description of a static bma method the posterior probability of the quantity y is usually assumed be a gaussian distribution in the em solving algorithm p y t m i y g y t y t f i σ i 2 snow depth however does not obey a gaussian distribution therefore the simulated and observed snow depths need to be normalized before applying the bma method to estimate the weights in the model moreover bma deeply relies on the model bias correction coefficients which results in significant limitations when applied in long sequence snow depth prediction in this framework we employed the kernel density smoother wilks 2006 to configure the posterior probability density function in the particle ensemble of the gpf algorithm and then we used the posterior probability density function to calculate the bma weights this improvement made it unnecessary to assume that the posterior probability obeys a gaussian distribution in the bma method the posterior probability density function calculated using the particle samples likely would be closer to the real state an additional advantage of using the pf is that the multimodality or the skewness of state can be determined in the state estimation stage moreover the result transformed by the observation operator is also multimodality or skewness assuming that the resampled particles of state are x t at time t the posterior probability distribution of state can be approximately obtained as follows 15 x t x t 1 x t 2 x t 3 x t n p x t y t i 1 n w t i δ x t x t i in this study we obtained the prediction ensemble of a state variable by evolving the noah mp model and transformed the prediction ensemble into the observation space using an observation operator then it was used to calculate the posterior probability density function of the state variable p y t m i y t 1 here we used the particle ensemble to construct the posterior probability density function using the kernel density smoother fig 1 shows the flowchart for calculating the particle posterior probability distribution because we did not use satellite observation data in this data assimilation experiment the observation operator is the identity matrix similar to a histogram we divided the particle ensemble into intervals and calculated the probability for the center of each interval using the kernel density smoother unlike a histogram these intervals could overlap and act more like a sliding window moving across the ensemble members thus creating a more continuous curve parrish et al 2012 in addition the probability at the center of the interval was based on a weighted average of a kernel rather than just a tally of the ensemble members in our study we configured the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework by combining the advantages of bma and gpf and thus integrated multiple parameterization scheme combinations within the noah mp model with snow observation data fig 2 shows the framework of the bma gpf method we selected four representative parameterization scheme combinations within the noah mp model as the model operators the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework included the following six steps 1 snow depth initialization the forcing data were perturbed and input into the model and the initial snow depth ensemble of the four scheme combinations was obtained 2 snow depth prediction the snow depth prediction ensemble at the current moment was simulated using the four scheme combinations 3 observation forecasting the ensemble of the current observation forecast was obtained using the observation operator 4 snow depth analyzation the snow depth analysis ensemble of the four scheme combinations was obtained from the assimilation observation data using the gpf 5 posterior probability density function calculation the kernel density smoother method was used to calculate the posterior probability density function of the particles at the current moment in the observation forecasting ensemble 6 average of the simulated snow depth of multiple scheme combinations based on the observation data the posterior probability density function estimated using the kernel density smoother was used to obtain the optimal posterior estimation of snow depth in the bma method 3 experimental setup 3 1 study sites we selected the altay meteorological observation station aty 735 3 m located in northern xinjiang in china to validate the feasibility of the bma method used in snow depth prediction high quality meteorological forcing data for the model such as the near surface air temperature pressure relative humidity and snow depth were obtained at this site we selected eight seasonally snow covered study sites including the aty site in distinct snow climates trujillo et al 2014 to validate the efficiency of the bma gpf snow data assimilation method the sites included the arctic sodankylä site sda 179 m located in finland the col de porte cdp 1330 m site located in the rhone alpes france the refugio poqueira site ropa 2510 m located in the sierra nevada mountains spain the weissfluhjoch site wfj 2 540 m located in davos switzerland the swamp angel study plot sasp 3370 m site located in colorado united states the snoqualmie site snq 921 m located in the washington cascades united states and the aty site and mohe site mohe 438 5 m from typical snow covered regions in china we employed the dataset from these sites to investigate the sensitivity of snow simulation to parameterizations and to examine the simulation performance of the typical scheme combinations within noah mp model the results demonstrated that the eligible observation dataset could be used to carry out snow simulation experiments you et al 2020a you et al 2020b for details on the study sites see you et al 2020a perhaps surprisingly the bma experiment was conducted at just one site whereas the performance of bma gpf was examined across multiple snow climates although it was sufficient to illustrate the limitation of the bma methodology to merge the simulated snow depth at one site the bma gpf was expected to be examined in distinct snow climates in layman s terms the former verified the feasibility whereas the latter examined whether performance was better or worse 3 2 experimental design 3 2 1 generation of the forcing data ensemble in land surface models input datasets have a significant influence on the accuracy of the model s output including their spatial and temporal resolutions for snow simulations precipitation and air temperature are the most important input elements because of their roles in determining the quantity of rainfall and snowfall to produce the forcing data ensemble the air temperature and precipitation were perturbed following the method of lei et al 2014 in this study the precipitation was assumed to have an error with a log normal distribution and was expressed as follows 16 p t i exp μ ln p φ p i σ ln p 2 17 σ ln p ln α p p t 2 p t 2 1 18 μ ln p ln p t 2 p t 2 α p p t 2 where p t and p t i are the observed and perturbed precipitation at time t respectively the log transformation of p t i is a gaussian distribution with a mean μ ln p and a standard deviation σ ln p α p is the variance scaling factor of the precipitation which was set to 0 5 in this study and φ p i is a normally distributed random number the number of particles was set to 100 according to the sensitivity experiment by magnusson et al 2017 the ensemble of the air temperature was obtained as follows 19 t t i t t γ 1 2 w i w i u 0 1 where t t and t t i are the observed and perturbed air temperatures at time t respectively γ is the variance scaling factor of the temperature with a value of 2 0 and w i is the random noise with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 3 2 2 evaluation metrics we selected three metrics to evaluate the accuracy of deterministic forecast of the single scheme combination and bma gpf method we selected an additional three metrics to evaluate the goodness of fit of the snow depth prediction uncertainty interval 3 2 2 1 metrics for the forecast accuracy evaluation we focused on the four scheme combinations in the bma experiment and selected the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean deviation mbe to evaluate the accuracy of snow depth simulations the r 2 value reflected the degree of agreement between the simulated and observed snow depths the mbe reflected the degree of systematic deviation of the simulated snow depth and the rmse reflected the size of the error between the simulated and observed snow depths 1 coefficient of determination r 2 20 r 2 1 0 t 1 n d o t d s t 2 t 1 n d o t d o 2 where d o t and d s t are the observed and simulated snow depths at time t respectively and d o is the average value of observed snow depth in the training period the value of r 2 ranges from negative infinity to 1 0 and a larger value indicates a higher simulation accuracy this value is widely used as an accuracy evaluation metric 2 root mean squared error rmse 21 rmse 1 n t 1 n d o t d s t 2 because the deterministic coefficient may have a negative value the rmse can be used as a metric to characterize the difference between the simulated and observed snow depths and a smaller value indicates a higher simulation accuracy 3 mean deviation mbe 22 mbe 1 n t 1 n d o t d s t the mbe reflects the average error level between the simulated and observed snow depths a smaller value indicates a higher snow depth simulation accuracy 3 2 2 2 metrics for the prediction uncertainty interval evaluation we selected the containing ratio c r average bandwidth b w and average deviation amplitude d a to evaluate the superiority of the uncertainty interval of forecast 1 containing ration c r c r is one of most commonly used metrics for evaluating the uncertainty interval of a forecast specifically in this study it refers to the ratio of the observed snow depth data included in the prediction interval a larger containing ratio indicates a higher coverage rate of the prediction interval 2 average bandwidth b w 23 b w 1 n t 1 n q u t q l t where q u t and q l t are the upper and lower boundaries of the forecast interval at time t respectively for a specified confidence level the narrower the b w the higher the accuracy of the forecast result 3 average deviation amplitude d a the d a can reflect the degree by which the center line of the forecast interval deviates from the snow depth observations as follows 24 d a 1 n t 1 n 1 2 q u t q l t d obs t where d obs t is the observed snow depth at time t a smaller d a indicates a better symmetry of the forecast interval 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the bma experiment to examine the feasibility of using bma to reduce the uncertainty of the snow depth multiparameterization ensemble simulation and to determine the applicability of bma to snow depth probability forecasting we selected the observation datasets for the aty site during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 snow periods for the experiment we used the observed snow depth during the 2013 2014 snow period to train the simulated snow depth according to the four scheme combinations and we used the observed snow depth during the 2014 2015 snow period to examine the training results which were the training and test periods of the bma because the snow cover changed significantly within a certain period we divided the training period into snow accumulation stable and ablation phases according to the variations in the snow depth and we used the observed snow depths during these three phases to train the simulation results to make the training results more accurate fig 3 compares the observed and simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations during the training period as shown in fig 3 the simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations had small differences during the accumulation and stable periods and had a large difference during the ablation period the difference was manifested in the snow melting rate and the time required for the snow to completely melt the simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations during accumulation period were quite close to the observations and had small simulation errors however the simulated snow depths of these four scheme combinations during the stable period were underestimated and had a large simulation error nevertheless the variation trends of the simulated snow depths of the four scheme combinations were nearly consistent with the snow depth observations in these two stages as shown in fig 3 the snow melting rates of the four scheme combinations were significantly lower than those of the snow depth observations the slope of the curve is the snow melting rate which is why the simulated snow depths were all overestimated during the ablation stage the bma methodology assumes that the model forecasts are unbiased that is e y y f i 0 for each model i parrish et al 2012 fang and li 2016 although numerous bias correction methods are available we incorporated a simple linear regression method to correct for the bias of the forecasting results in the snow accumulation stable and ablation periods that is y a i e y f i b i where the snow depth observations y in the training period are the dependent variables and the forecasts of the scheme combinations y f i are the explanatory variables we determined the unique coefficients a i and b i for the different scheme combinations using a least squares approximation in the three snow stages we then applied these coefficients to the future forecasts unlike the air temperature and runoff the variation in the snow depth was highly dependent on the precipitation and large temporal dispersion snow depth at the site scale had many zero values and the distribution of the non zero snow depth values was highly skewed therefore we could not be directly describe snow depth using the normal probability density function in this special case we used the box cox normalized transformation method to transform the observed and simulated snow depths during the training period to a normal distribution then we used the data after the normal transformation for the training the box cox transformation formula is as follows 25 z t y t λ 1 λ λ 0 log y t λ 0 where y t is the data before transformation z t is the data after transformation and λ is the box cox normalized transformation coefficient in this study we determined the optimal value of λ using the kolmogorov smirnov test method fig 4 shows the normal probability of the data before and after the normal transformation as shown in fig 4 the simulated and observed snow depths had highly nonnormal distributions before the normal transformation the simulated and observed data however were obviously close to a normal distribution after the transformation but a fraction of the data still deviated from the normal distribution after that we applied the snow depth data during the training period in the bma methodology after the normal transformation and obtained the weights of the four scheme combinations in the different snow stages within the training period as shown in fig 5 the weights of each scheme combination in the different snow stages were all less than 0 4 and we observed certain differences in the weights of the scheme combinations furthermore the weight of each scheme combination reflected the relative contribution of the forecast to the bma optimal forecast fig 5 also shows that the training weights of the four combinations were basically the same in the snow accumulation and stable periods but their weights were significantly different in the snow ablation period when we simultaneously selected the first parameterization scheme of the physical processes sfc and temp the corresponding scheme combination later written as sfc 1 temp 1 had a larger bma weight 0 38 the weight of the scheme combination sfc 1 temp 2 was 0 18 which was very close to the training weight 0 19 of the scheme combination sfc 2 temp 2 based on the weights of each scheme combination in the different snow periods fig 5 the weight difference of each scheme combination was manifested mainly in the snow ablation stage this result indicated that the performance difference of each scheme combination was concentrated primarily in the snow ablation stage and that the highly sensitive parameterization scheme had a greater impact in the snow ablation stage than in the snow accumulation and stable stages the statistical results of the prediction value and the 95 confidence interval of the bma and the four scheme combinations in the snow period are listed in table 2 as shown in table 2 the r 2 of the bma snow depth forecast was significantly higher than that of the other four scheme combinations during the training period and the rmse was significantly smaller than that of the four scheme combinations but the mbe was slightly larger than some of the scheme combinations in terms of the prediction interval the c r of the bma snow depth uncertainty prediction interval to the snow depth observation data was 94 68 this result indicated that the 95 confidence interval of the bma covered the majority of the snow depth observation data within the training period which was greater than the maximum value 75 of the four scheme combinations we found that the forecast interval of the bma within the training period was better than those of all of the scheme combinations according to the b w and d a metrics of the 95 confidence interval according to the evaluation indexes listed in table 2 and compared with the single scheme combination the snow depth deterministic forecast result of the bma was closer to the observations moreover the forecast interval of the bma during the training period was more accurate because the forecast interval of the bma could cover more snow depth observation data than any scheme combination the statistical results within the test period are presented in table 2 compared with any scheme combination neither the statistical metrics of the deterministic forecast nor the 95 confidence interval of the bma had any advantage in terms of the snow depth deterministic forecast the r 2 of the bma snow depth forecast was 84 68 the rmse was 4 55 and the mbe was 2 12 although some indicators of the bma were slightly better than those of the single scheme combination the indicators of the bma deterministic forecast were equivalent to those of the scheme combination sfc 1 temp 1 overall therefore unlike in the training period the deterministic forecast of the bma did not have an obvious advantage over the single scheme combination in the examination period in terms of the forecast interval within the test period the coverage rate of the bma forecast interval to the snow depth observation data was 70 which was even less than the coverage rates of the four scheme combinations moreover the average bandwidth and average deviation of the bma forecast interval also did not offer any advantages over the four scheme combinations we compared the snow depth deterministic prediction results of the four scheme combinations during the training and test periods with the bma shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the snow depth deterministic prediction of the bma was better than that of all of the single scheme combination during all of the snow stages and the deterministic prediction of the bma was closer to the observations than that of the single scheme combination unexpectedly the deterministic forecast of the bma in the test period deviated even more from the snow depth observations than the forecast of the four scheme combinations thus the deterministic forecast result of the bma in the test period was not as good as expected for instance the snow depth deterministic forecast of the bma was severely overestimated in january and the error was greater than the simulation errors of the four scheme combinations moreover compared with the four scheme combinations the snow depth deterministic forecast of the bma during the snow accumulation period was not significantly improved and it exhibited serious overestimation during the stable period compared with the simulation results of each scheme combination during the snow ablation period despite some improvements the deterministic prediction of the bma still deviated significantly from the observations this deviation indicated that the bma methodology may not necessarily be able to obtain a high precision deterministic forecast using the posterior information during the test period we compared the uncertainty forecast interval of the bma in the training and test periods with the observed snow depth shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the forecast interval of the bma in the training period could cover almost all of the snow depth observation data and the coverage ratio was 94 68 however the long term snow depth observation data in the test period were not covered by the uncertainty forecast interval of the bma the coverage rate of the snow depth observation data in the test period was 70 which was even lower than the coverage rates of the forecast intervals of the four scheme combinations this result indicated that the bma methodology could not obtain a reliable snow depth forecast interval in the test period thus the bma methodology could obtain a high accuracy snow depth deterministic forecast and a reliable uncertainty forecast interval by training the snow depth observation data in the training period it was unlikely however to obtain a high accuracy snow depth deterministic forecast and a reliable uncertainty forecast interval in the test period using the weights and variances obtained from the training period this result was different from the previous application of the bma methodology and we identified two main reasons for this unexpected result 1 unlike the surface elements such as runoff and air temperature the variation in the snow depth was highly dependent on snowfall and snowfall was highly discrete in time therefore the correction results obtained using the observed snow data for a specific time period also were time sensitive and the correction coefficients may not have been suitable for snow forecasts at future moments 2 from the point of view of the probability distribution the snow depth had to be normalized to meet the assumption that the posterior probability obeyed a gaussian distribution in the bma methodology however both this assumption and the normal transformation introduced errors in the forecast results according to these research results the bma methodology could be used as an effective postprocessing method for merging the simulated snow depths of the different scheme combinations and a reliable posterior estimation could be obtained when the observation data were sufficient the application of the bma methodology to long term snow forecasts in the future however had significant limitations because it had a high degree of dependence on the correction coefficient and the variation in the snow cover was strongly time dependent 4 2 case study of the bma gpf framework a successful snow data assimilation method should be validated across snow climates therefore we employed eight sites including the aty site from different snow climates to implement a snow data assimilation experiment using the bma gpf data assimilation framework this snow simulation was supposed to be sensitive or highly sensitive to the parameterizations of sfc and temp across snow climates therefore we selected the scheme combinations configured by sfc and temp to examine the performance of bma gpf as shown in fig 8 the snow simulations of these four scheme combinations had large differences in most sites like aty mohe and ropa but some scheme combinations had identical snow simulation results in some sites for example the snow simulations of scheme combination sfc 1 temp 2 and sfc 2 temp 2 were exactly the same in sda and cdp simultaneously they showed a slight difference in sasp and snq the snow simulations in the sites from typical snow covered regions in china however had significant differences especially during the snow ablation phase hence it was evident that the parameterizations of temp had highly sensitivity in all sites but the sensitivity of the sfc parameterizations was different in distinct snow climates nevertheless the scheme combinations configured by the sfc and temp parameterizations were typical combinations and should have been the optimal ensemble candidates for examining the performance of the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework after selecting scheme combinations we applied the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework in the snow depth forecast for the eight sites from distinct snow climates according to mathematical theory the bma and data assimilation approaches both sought the optimal posterior estimation of the state variable often however only an approximate value of the optimal posterior estimation could be obtained because of various errors in this study we expected the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework to obtain the optimal posterior estimation of snow depth which had a small error normally the intensive observation data in the assimilation scheme largely restricted the autonomous simulation ability of the model in this case the assimilation results of the different models were basically the same and were very close to the observations but they did not reflect the differences between the models therefore in this study we purposefully set the assimilation step of the gpf assimilation scheme as five days at all sites which resulted in the snow depth assimilation results of these four scheme combinations having a certain difference we estimated the posterior probability density function at each assimilation moment and used this estimation to calculate the weight and variance of each scheme combination in the bma methodology we investigated the impact of meteorological perturbations on simulations the 100 ensemble snow depth forced by distinct meteorological conditions for each scheme combination is shown in fig 9 a direct consequence of the perturbation of the forcing data was depicted in the ensemble spread which contained possible estimations of the ensemble simulations although we applied the identical meteorological perturbation approach to different scheme combinations the ensemble spreads were not exactly same which mainly was reflected in the upper and lower boundaries as shown in fig 9 during the snow accumulation period the spread of snow depth ensembles increased whenever a snowfall event occurred because the perturbations in the precipitation rates allowed for the different snowfall rates to be input for each scheme combination conversely the spread of snow depth ensembles during the snow ablation period was relatively stable because the near surface air temperature was the dominant factor affecting the snow melting rate unexpectedly we found these situations at all sites except for ropa at this site we observed a significant relationship with the climatology the variation in snow depth ensemble spread exhibited extreme irregularity and the high sublimation rate may have been the main reason for this snow instability a detailed analysis of climatology at this site is available in you et al 2020a we compared the snow depth assimilation results of the four scheme combinations with the snow depth observation given in fig 10 compared with the snow depth simulation results of each scheme combination the simulation accuracy was largely improved by the data assimilation at all sites as shown in fig 10 the snow depth data assimilation results for the different scheme combination were very close to the observation data and invariably had high precision at all sites at first the snow depth data assimilation results at the ropa site were not promising because differences in the snow depth simulations by the four scheme combinations were quite large and variations in snow depth exhibited extreme irregularity the snow depth data assimilation results for the different scheme combinations however were extremely close to the observations this result certainly could be attributed to the gpf data assimilation algorithm nevertheless we found that even though the same observation data were assimilated into the different scheme combinations and the assimilation conditions were exactly the same the assimilation results were slightly different at all sites these differences are highlighted in fig 10 we observed a larger difference at sites like sda aty and wfj and a smaller difference at ropa and mohe note that the original intention of the data assimilation was to comprehensively use the model prior and observation posterior information to obtain the optimal estimation of the state variable while fully considering the model error and the observation error we obtained different optimal state estimations using different scheme combinations because the simulation performance of each scheme combination within the noah mp model was not exactly the same therefore the question is which of these combinations obtains the optimal posterior estimation of snow depth we expected that the data assimilation approach would obtain the optimal posterior estimation of state but the model prior which was used to deduce optimal posterior estimation was always influenced by the limitations of the model structure therefore to obtain an optimal posterior estimation that was closer to the true state we used the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework to merge the data assimilation results according to the multiple scheme combinations fig 11 shows the scatterplots for snow depth from the bma gpf snow depth deterministic prediction at eight sites which are presented with the daily temporal scale as the figure shows snow depth from bma gpf indicated good agreement with the measurements at all sites the over or underestimations of the simulations by the four scheme combinations compared with fig 8 were evidently modified after assimilation and model merging and the snow depth from bma gpf prediction concentrated along the 1 1 line at all sites the rmses also are shown in fig 11 overall the bma gpf snow depth deterministic predictions all had high accuracy at the eight sites for instance the rmse values at aty and mohe were 0 01 and 0 02 m respectively which indicated that the bma gpf could obtain a reliable snow depth deterministic forecast at the two sites we observed a similar situation at sda and ropa although the rmse value was relatively large at snq and wfj this did not mean that the bma gpf deterministic prediction had lower accuracy at these sites the large rmse was mainly due to a deep snow cover at the two sites the maximum snow depth reached 3 m and inevitably resulted in a larger rmse than at other sites we compared the snow depth deterministic prediction and 95 confidence interval of bma gpf with the observations on temporal series as shown in fig 12 according to fig 12 the snow depth forecast of the bma gpf had a large uncertainty interval in the snow accumulation and stable periods and a small uncertainty forecast interval in the ablation period at all sites at most sites other than a few snow depth observations in the snow ablation period the snow depth uncertainty forecast interval basically covered all of the observation data certainly the 95 confidence intervals of bma gpf at the eight sites had a significant difference because the model simulation variances were different at these sites to illustrate the superiority of the uncertainty interval of bma gpf prediction we calculated the c r b w and d a values of the 95 confidence interval of the bma gpf during the entire snow period at different sites the results are presented in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the c r of the bma gpf forecast interval to the observed snow depth at the eight sites was above 95 and all eight sights had similar values in addition the d a of the bma gpf forecast interval ranged from 0 02 to 0 1 m at different sites snow thickness may have been the main factor that influenced the value of d a and the sites that had a deep snow cover like at wfj and snq usually obtained larger d a obviously the b w of the bma gpf forecast interval was different at the eight sites the largest value was 0 43 at wfj the next largest value was 0 34 at snq and the minimum value was 0 05 at aty we compared the statistical results of bma with the bma gpf and found that a substantial improvement had been made by the bma gpf at all of the sites for example at the aty site the containing ration of bma was 70 and the bma gpf was 96 the average bandwidth of bma was 8 02 cm and the bma gpf was 5 0 cm and the average deviation amplitude of bma was 4 07 cm and the bma gpf was 2 0 cm these results indicated that when we employed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework in different snow climates we obtained the optimal posterior estimation of the model state these experimental results showed that the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework combined the advantages of the bma methodology and the gpf algorithm to achieve the comprehensive integration of multiple scheme combinations and snow depth observations the results of applying bma gpf snow data assimilation framework across snow climates demonstrated that the accuracy of the bma gpf snow depth prediction results was excellent overall and that this framework could be used in different snow climates not only did the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework improve the forecast accuracy to a certain extent but it also produced a reliable uncertainty forecast interval multiple posterior estimations produced by scheme combinations could be integrated by this framework to infer the optimal posterior estimation of the state variable we always expected the optimal estimation obtained by the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework to be closer to the true value in addition from the mathematical perspective this framework removed the assumption that the posterior probability distribution was gaussian in the bma methodology and the application of the bma in the snow depth prediction did not require a normal conversion moreover the bma methodology in this framework no longer depended on the empirical correction coefficient 5 conclusions in this study we reduced the uncertainty of the simulated snow depth obtained using the noah mp model we used the bma methodology to merge the snow depth simulation results of multiple combinations and evaluated the fusion result on this basis we developed the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework by coupling the bma and the gpf algorithm and examined the performance of the bma gpf across snow climates the main findings of this study are as follows 1 the bma methodology was an effective postprocessing method for merging the simulated snow depth using multiple scheme combinations however the correction coefficient obtained in the training period was not suitable for the test period because snowfall was not continuous and was highly discrete in time the bma relied too heavily on the correction coefficients which made it unsuitable for snow forecasting 2 the expectation maximization algorithm used in the bma methodology assumed that the posterior probability would obey a normal distribution for the sake of calculation simplicity the snow depth did not obey a normal distribution however and thus had to be normalized before being used for the calculations which introduced errors in the forecast results 3 the bma gpf snow data assimilation framework coupled with the bma methodology and the gpf algorithm used particles to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the state variables it did not assume that the posterior probability would obey a normal distribution which further improved the fusion accuracy the experiments conducted in this study were based on forcing data and snow observations from the sites across different snow climates additional studies are needed to examine the performance of the bma gpf at the regional scale the results of this study provide a reference for applying the bma methodology to snow forecasting and

2469,the response of vegetation to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide e co 2 has opposing effects on terrestrial water fluxes especially evapotranspiration in particular co 2 fertilization may enhance plant growth therefore increasing canopy transpiration while a partial stomatal closure decreases leaf transpiration in this study the effects of e co 2 on water fluxes at a managed montane grassland were monitored using two high precision weighable lysimeters exposed to ambient and elevated 300 ppm relative to ambient conditions co 2 concentrations during the growing season e co 2 led to a general decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in seepage it was shown that e co 2 influences evapotranspiration primarily through the change in stomatal resistance as no effect of e co 2 on the leaf area index was confirmed a co 2 dependent penman monteith equation and actual evapotranspiration data from the lysimeters made it possible to estimate the effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance e co 2 was found to increase stomatal resistance by 50 relative to ambient conditions a hydrus 1d model allowed a temporal extension of the experimental findings to the period of 1990 2021 and revealed high variability in the relative change in annual seepage under e co 2 the modeling exercise demonstrated that the effect of e co 2 can be easily implemented in the penman monteith equation and if neglected leads to overestimation of transpiration and underestimation of seepage especially in the first post drought seepage events our findings show that e co 2 positively affects the water balance in montane grasslands thus e co 2 might be an important factor in mitigating the effects of warming and droughts in the future we propose that the vegetation response to e co 2 in particular the effect on stomatal resistance should be taken into account when assessing the effects of climate change on grassland water fluxes this may also have large implications when studying the impact of climate change at a watershed scale msc 00 01 99 00 keywords evapotranspiration seepage co2 concentration stomatal resistance lysimeter hydrus 1d montane grassland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ongoing increase in atmospheric co 2 concentration in the atmosphere raises questions about the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co 2 concentrations e co 2 and its impacts on surface and groundwater resources caretta et al 2022 terrestrial vegetation influences the water cycle mainly by changing evapotranspiration which includes soil evaporation and plant transpiration and depends on climate and vegetation characteristics lemordant et al 2018 previous experiments revealed that e co 2 affects both the productivity and water use efficiency of plants leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 on the one hand e co 2 may stimulate biomass production through co 2 fertilization and thus increase transpiration ogle et al 2021 on the other hand partial closure of leaf stomatal openings can decrease leaf transpiration ainsworth and rogers 2007 the net effect of e co 2 on the water balance is still debated mainly due to i climate and vegetation specific feedback and ii lack of experimental data fatichi et al 2016 forzieri et al 2020 ukkola et al 2016 yang et al 2021 photosynthetic plants meet their co 2 requirements more quickly at e co 2 allowing them to partially close their stomata and reduce water loss from the inside of the leaf stomatal resistance to water loss can be measured at leaf scale or derived from transpiration measurements using the penman monteith equation raupach and finnigan 1988 montero et al 2001 the effect of co 2 fertilization increased plant productivity can be reflected as a change in the biomass or leaf area index lai under e co 2 relative to ambient conditions a common method to study the response of vegetation to e co 2 involves the use of free air carbon dioxide enrichment face systems miglietta et al 2001 winkler and herbst 2004 kimball 2016 in this approach a fumigation ring enriches the air above the vegetation plot with co 2 miglietta et al 2001 and winkler and herbst 2004 showed that a face system can be successfully applied to study the effects of e co 2 outdoors ainsworth and rogers 2007 conducted a meta analysis of the response of stomatal resistance r l to increased co 2 concentration among various functional groups using results from multiple face experiments across the reviewed literature the highest and most consistent response of stomatal resistance to e co 2 was observed in c 3 grass increased co 2 concentration is also associated with an increase in total plant biomass yet several studies found no clear signal of a co 2 fertilization effect in c 3 grasses ainsworth and long 2005 volk et al 2000 obermeier et al 2017 körner 2006 in austria grassland ecosystems are a key element of mountain landscapes covering approximately 16 of the land surface and about 50 of the total agricultural lands bmlrt 2020 as montane grasslands are mainly composed of c 3 grass species they are expected to play an important role in mitigating the effects of climate change on the water balance despite their importance only a limited number of studies experimentally addressed the effects of e co 2 on water fluxes of montane grasslands the results of inauen et al 2013 suggest that e co 2 reduces evapotranspiration in montane grasslands thus increasing soil water savings however the increased soil water savings did not affect seepage to the groundwater forstner et al 2021 found similar effects on evapotranspiration but observed that seepage increased with e co 2 volk et al 2000 observed a comparable response in soil moisture savings in various grassland species and an increase in stomatal resistance under e co 2 understanding of the effect of e co 2 on water fluxes in montane grassland under different climate conditions still remains limited hydrological models that can capture the vegetation response to e co 2 are commonly used to understand how the effects of e co 2 propagate through soils into aquifers and streams in most studies yang et al 2018 kellner et al 2017 kruijt et al 2008 butcher et al 2014 fowler et al 2019 the effect of e co 2 is included using a modified penman monteith pm equation which considers the change in stomatal resistance due to e co 2 monteith 1965 li et al 2019 most studies lack data to validate the modeled water fluxes in particular the seepage flux at a point scale lysimeters can be used to measure soil water fluxes while they are potentially subject to artefacts resulting from the small surface often in the order of 1 m 2 seneviratne et al 2012 showed that lysimeters can be representative of the entire catchment behavior physically based models such as the widely used hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 have been applied to study vegetation effects on soil water balances šípek et al 2020 and soil water fluxes in lysimeters schelle et al 2012 groh et al 2018 here we report on the observed and modeled effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes using data from two high precision weighable lysimeters at a montane c 3 grassland in austria one lysimeter is treated with the face system to achieve an increase of 300 ppm with respect to the ambient conditions under which the other reference lysimeter is operated we investigated the effects of e co 2 using lysimeter and leaf area index data together with a modified penman monteith equation coupled to a physically based hydrological model to i identify effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes ii quantify the sensitivity of stomatal resistance to e co 2 and iii assess the impact of e co 2 on modeled soil water fluxes to the best of our knowledge the combination of lysimeters a face system and a soil water balance model has not yet been applied to assess the impact of e co 2 on the soil water fluxes 2 data and methods

the experiment is designed to analyze effects of warming and elevated atmospheric co 2 concentrations e co 2 on the productivity and biogeochemistry of a managed c 3 grassland typical for many european mountain regions piepho et al 2017 the site is located in the eastern part of the austrian alps near the confluence of rivers enns and donnersbach at an altitude of 707 m a s l see fig 1 the average annual temperature and precipitation for the period 1991 2020 are 8 5 c and 1009 mm respectively according to the köppen climate classification the site lies in the subpolar oceanic climate zone which is the typical climate zone for the montane belt of the alps rubel et al 2017 plant communities consist mainly of c 3 grasses arrenatherum elatius and festuca pratensis and leguminous species lotus corniculatus and trifolium pratense which can be considered representative of permanent grasslands in alpine regions schaumberger 2011 the soil type is classified as a cambisol world

data from 2018 to 2020 are used focusing on the growing season when the co 2 enrichment took place from early april to mid october the thermal approach of ernst and loeper 1976 was employed to determine the start and end of the growing season see appendix two weighable monolithic lysimeters see fig 2 were used to quantify the components of the soil water balance equation comprising precipitation p actual evapotranspiration e t a seepage s at the bottom of the lysimeter and the change in soil water storage δ sw 1 δ s w p e t a s the two high precision lysimeters meter group fank and unold 2007 have a surface area of 1 m 2 a depth of 140 cm and have been in operation since june 2014 the tension controlled bottom boundary system is adjusted based on matric potential measured at 140 cm depth inside the cylindrical lysimeter and a reference matric potential at the same depth just outside the lysimeter using this approach we can assume that the soil water fluxes in the lysimeter are transferable to the surrounding field groh et al 2016 each of the lysimeters is equipped with tensiometers and time domain reflectometry probes at depths of 10 30 50 and 140 cm the precision of the weighing scales is 100 g for the lysimeters and 10 g for the water seepage reservoir in which the water from the lysimeter is collected and in periods of upward flow pumped back into the lysimeter the weight measurements are recorded every minute external factors animals management etc can contribute to the change in the weight of the lysimeter so the raw lysimeter data are subject to extensive manual and automated plausibility checks forstner et al 2021 additional smoothing and the separation of precipitation and evapotranspiration from changes in lysimeter mass was performed using the adaptive window and adaptive threshold filter awat peters et al 2017 daily soil water fluxes were obtained by resampling 10 min water balance data to daily sums to achieve a controlled increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide of 300 ppm compared to ambient conditions one of the lysimeters is treated with the face free air carbon dioxide enrichment system miglietta et al 2001 the co 2 concentrations are recorded at plant canopy height 0 15 0 9 m at the center of the fumigation ring on a 1 min resolution the co 2 fumigation is operated only during the day when global radiation exceeds 50 w m 2 and is interrupted when the wind velocity at the site exceeds 1 5 m s 1 to eliminate possible blower effects from the fumigation system all plots under ambient conditions are equipped with fumigation rings through which nonenriched ambient air flows the co 2 concentration at the e co 2 lysimeter was within 20 of the preset target concentration of 300 ppm to ambient conditions for 80 of the operational time during 2018 2020 and 93 of the operational time within 30 of the target concentration the co 2 concentration of the fumigated plot was measured directly in the center of the plot whereas the ambient co 2 concentration was taken as the average concentration of eight ambient plots throughout the field daily average co 2 concentrations used in eq 4 see fig 6 were obtained by aggregating 1 min co 2 concentration data during the day the meteorological data used in the study includes daily values of solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed see fig 3 measurements of leaf area index lai and crop height h c r o p were collected throughout the growing season with at least 10 measurements per year per plot see fig 6 crop height was measured using an ultra sonic measurement with five sensors while lai was obtained using a field spectrometer handyspec klingler et al 2020 and the accupar lp 80 ceptometer lai and h c r o p measurement data were linearly interpolated to obtain a gap free time series of the crop growth parameters for this purpose h c r o p 15 cm and l a i 0 2 were assigned to the day after mowing when no measurement existed vremec et al 2021 the lysimeter plots were mowed three times per year followed by mineral fertilization herndl et al 2011 2 3 methods an adapted penman monteith pm equation was used in combination with the hydrus 1d unsaturated zone model to simulate the effects of vegetation response to e co 2 on soil water fluxes yang et al 2018 leterme et al 2012 the adapted penman monteith equation uses a co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model to capture the effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance and leaf area index the relationship between stomatal resistance and co 2 concentration is inversely estimated by comparing the calculated evapotranspiration based on the pm equation and the observed evapotranspiration from the lysimeters raupach and finnigan 1988 to assess the impact of e co 2 on soil water fluxes under different climate conditions a hydrus 1d simulation was performed for a 30 year period using historical meteorological data at the site and atmospheric co 2 concentrations from the representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 the representative concentration pathways describe four different pathways of greenhouse gas atmospheric concentrations in the 21st century as adopted by the ipcc caretta et al 2022 the overall workflow see fig 2 of the model based data analysis was as follows 1 estimate the effect of e co 2 on lysimeter water fluxes and leaf area index 2 establish an empirical relationship between co 2 concentrations and stomatal resistance 3 estimate the effects of e co 2 on modeled soil water fluxes 2 3 1 the single layer stomatal resistance model monteith 1965 was the first to apply resistance terms surface r s and aerodynamic r a resistance to the estimation of potential evapotranspiration by introducing the penman monteith equation henceforth referred to as the pm equation the pm equation allows the estimation of evapotranspiration on vegetation specific surfaces 2 p e t c 1 λ δ r n g ρ a c p e s e a r a δ γ 1 r s r a where p e t c is the potential crop evapotranspiration kg m 2 d 1 equivalent to mm d 1 λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa k 1 r n mj m 2 d 1 is the net radiation g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 ρ a is the air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of dry air mj kg 1 k 1 e s is the saturation and e a is the actual vapor pressure of the air kpa γ is the psychrometric constant kpa k 1 r s is the bulk surface resistance d m 1 and r a is the bulk aerodynamic resistance the value for r a is calculated using crop height equation 4 in allen et al 1998 it should be noted that the above equation includes the resistance terms r a and r s in units of d m 1 to avoid unit conversion issues in the remainder of this article we will use the more commonly used s m 1 units the standard form of the pm equation includes the bulk surface resistance r s which represents the combined resistance to vapor flow from both the soil and the vegetation canopy single layer model the resistance of the vegetation canopy to vapor flow can be regarded as the integrated sum of stomatal resistance of all leaves in the canopy e g in eq 2 the amount of one sided green leaf area per unit ground area is commonly quantified using the leaf area index lai in our study r s is computed as a function of the bulk stomatal resistance r l s m 1 for a single lai layer lai 1 and the leaf area index measured at the lysimeter with an assumption that only the upper half of the canopy is active in heat and vapor transport allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 3 r s r l 0 5 l a i since we have measured lai for both lysimeters we are able to obtain the bulk stomatal resistance r l by inverse modeling of the observed evapotranspiration flux using the pm equation as described below 2 3 2 co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model several authors proposed the usage of co 2 dependent stomatal resistance models to account for changing co 2 concentrations in the computation of the evapotranspiration flux such models mainly consist of simple linear models that describe the relationship between the atmospheric co 2 concentration and stomatal resistance li et al 2019 and yang et al 2018 proposed a simple r l model that accounts for changes in co 2 4 r l co 2 r r l 300 1 s r l co 2 co 2 300 where s r l co 2 ppm 1 is the relative sensitivity of r l to δ co 2 and r r l 300 s m 1 the reference stomatal resistance when atmospheric co 2 is 300 ppm the relative sensitivity of r l to δ co 2 represents the change in r l per ppm increase in co 2 2 3 3 parameter estimation and statistical analyses parameters r l r r l 300 and s r l co 2 in eqs 3 and 4 were estimated using the non linear least squares from scipy virtanen et al 2020 which uses the trust region reflective algorithm to minimize the sum of the squared residuals minimizing the difference between observed and measured evapotranspiration to minimize the effects of plant water stress and soil evaporation on estimated stomatal resistance only data observed on days when the following criteria applied were used for parameter estimation 1 l a i 1 and surface resistance is dominated by vegetation jensen and allen 2016 2 no water stress has occurred see appendix in the preliminary phase of this study it was found that the residuals were strongly correlated in time violating the statistical assumptions when using least squares optimization thus hampering uncertainty analysis to overcome this issue an auto regressive model of order one ar 1 was applied to reduce autocorrelation in the residuals the residuals between p e t c and e t a were diagnosed for autocorrelation using the durbin watson dw test durbin and watson 1950 the goodness of fit was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean bias error mbe and the kling gupta efficiency kge provided in the spotpy python package houska et al 2015 a t test indicated by a p value was conducted using s c i p y and was used to detect significant differences between two samples the linear regression mean median standard deviation and standard error were computed using the n u m p y python package 2 3 4 hydrus 1d unsaturated zone modeling the effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes were incorporated by coupling the co 2 dependent pm equation eq 4 with the hydrus 1d model hydrus 1d uses potential evapotranspiration as input and divides it into potential soil evaporation e p and potential transpiration t p using beer s law and generated time series of lai simunek et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 5 e p p e t c e 0 6 l a i t p p e t c 1 e 0 6 l a i actual transpiration is calculated from potential transpiration based on the availability of water in the root zone after van genuchten 1980 two sets of soil hydraulic properties obtained with an inverse modeling approach schelle et al 2012 using the dream algorithm vrugt 2016 for bayesian inference were used for the simulation the hydrus 1d model of each lysimeter was calibrated against the daily seepage rate at the bottom of the lysimeter matric potential and soil water content at a depth of 10 30 and 140 cm while using observed lysimeter evapotranspiration and precipitation as input the effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes were incorporated into the hydrus 1d model by changing the input potential transpiration calculated from p e t c and beer s law a daily time step was used for all modeling scenarios the suitability of the model for use in climate change scenarios was tested using the signal to noise ratio snr proposed by bormann 2005 snr values larger than 1 are called high snr values and demonstrate a sufficient suitability of a model for scenario analysis while negative values suggest that the model is not suitable for this purpose details on the snr procedure and the calibration of the hydrus 1d model can be found in the appendix the effect of e co 2 on modeled water flows under variable climate conditions was assessed by performing hydrus 1d simulations for the period 1991 2021 under different co 2 concentrations the simulation was carried out using both sets of soil hydraulic properties historical meteorological data at the site for the period 1990 2021 and atmospheric co 2 concentrations from the representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios 2 4 reproducibility data analysis parameter estimation and hydrological modeling performed for this study were implemented in jupyter notebooks to allow full reproducibility of the analysis the python package pyet was used to estimate p e t c vremec and collenteur 2021 phydrus a python implementation of the hydrus 1d model was used for hydrological modeling collenteur et al 2020 while scipy and spotpy houska et al 2015 were used for model calibration all the materials are provided on zenodo vremec et al 2022 the input data is not publicly available and can be obtained upon request from markus herndl 3 results 3 1 observed effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes lai and stomatal resistance the impact of e co 2 on soil water fluxes was first analyzed using cumulative lysimeter water fluxes for the 2018 2020 growing seasons see fig 4 the annual distribution of precipitation varied between growing seasons leading to a drier growing season in 2018 and 2019 and a wetter one in 2020 in the dry years of 2018 and 2019 there was approximately 34 less precipitation in the growing season compared to 2020 this led to considerably higher cumulative seepage at the bottom of the lysimeters in 2020 140 mm over the growing period compared to the drier years when the seepage rates were below 15 mm in 2018 the cumulative precipitation from the two lysimeters differed by less than 0 4 2 mm between the two lysimeters in 2019 2 10 mm more precipitation was estimated with the ambient lysimeter and 3 18 mm less in 2020 compared to the e co 2 lysimeter the difference in cumulative evapotranspiration between the two lysimeters was highest in 2018 when the e co 2 lysimeter exhibited 7 3 lower e t a than the ambient e t a at the e co 2 lysimeter was 5 0 and 3 0 lower than the ambient in 2019 and 2020 respectively in 2020 the e co 2 lysimeter showed 22 31 mm higher seepage rates compared to the ambient lysimeter while the deviations in the drier years did not stand out δ 10 mm to check for systematic differences between the lysimeters e t a fluxes of both lysimeters were compared for days when no co 2 enrichment took place δ co 2 42 ppm standard error of the co 2 sensors see fig 5 and days when the co 2 difference between the lysimeters was greater than 240 ppm tar 80 a student s t test was performed to test whether there was a significant difference between the e t a of the lysimeters for both periods no significant difference in daily e t a was found p 0 95 on days when the face system was not operating and the co 2 concentrations on both lysimeters were nearly the same see fig 5 b when the co 2 concentration of the e co 2 lysimeter was at least 240 ppm higher than ambient conditions a significant difference in mean daily e t a p 0 038 was observed the e co 2 lysimeter showed a 6 8 reduction in daily mean e t a compared to the ambient see fig 5 a while only a 2 2 reduction was observed on days when co 2 fumigation was not operational see fig 5 b the calculated mean bias error mbe further confirms the systematic difference in mean e t a on days when co 2 fumigation was applied compared to days when fumigation did not take place the seasonal effects of e co 2 were analyzed using daily time series of the canopy co 2 concentration the residual between actual evapotranspiration of the ambient and e co 2 lysimeter the leaf area index and the matric potential at 30 cm depth see fig 6 the mean co 2 concentration for the observation period 2018 2020 was 418 20 ppm and 696 31 ppm for the ambient and e co 2 lysimeter respectively see fig 6 a unlike most of the observation period a higher e t a in the e co 2 lysimeter is observed during the drier periods immediately after the second harvest in 2018 and after the first harvest in 2019 see δ e t a in fig 6 b the development of the leaf area index throughout the growing season is shown in fig 6 c an increase in lai due to e co 2 could not be confirmed in both the lai measured with the accupar device p 0 482 and the field spectrometer p 0 85 however higher lai values were observed in the e co 2 lysimeter in the drier period after 1st harvest in 2019 see fig 6 c matric potential at the depth of 30 cm showed a faster drop in the ambient lysimeter throughout the measurement period the mean matric potential in the ambient lysimeter was lower than that of the enriched one the deviations were more pronounced in the drier periods of 2018 and 2019 see fig 6 d based on previous experiments ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 stomatal resistance is expected to increase with e co 2 by calibrating the stomatal resistance term in the pm equation eq 3 on days when no water stress was observed e t a p e t c and l a i 1 we were able to estimate the stomatal resistance for the conditions in each of the lysimeters optimal stomatal resistance values at each of the lysimeters and the estimated p e t c is shown in fig 7 a stomatal resistance of 78 4 s m 1 and 117 6 s m 1 was estimated for ambient and e co 2 conditions respectively this corresponds to a 50 16 increase in stomatal resistance under a 300 ppm increase in co 2 concentration the calibrated p e t c models were able to simulate daily e t a for each of the two lysimeters well n s e 0 88 3 2 relationship between co 2 and stomatal resistance to establish a quantitative relationship between stomatal resistance and the co 2 concentration the penman monteith equation in combination with the co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model eq 4 was calibrated against the evapotranspiration of both lysimeters here we used the actual canopy co 2 concentration to estimate p e t c a reference stomatal resistance of 64 6 s m 1 and a relative sensitivity s r l co 2 of 0 002 6e 04 ppm 1 were obtained from calibration using one set of parameters for the calculation of p e t c at both lysimeters did not decrease the overall performance of the p e t c model n s e 0 88 for both lysimeters the resulting stomatal resistance sensitivity to co 2 is shown as the blue line in fig 8 a and is very similar to the sensitivity obtained by li et al 2019 the shaded area in the figure represents the 95 confidence interval while the symbols represent the calibrated stomatal resistance values for each lysimeter per year indicating the year to year variation in estimated stomatal resistance 3 3 effect of e co 2 on modeled water fluxes 3 3 1 model performance of the hydrus 1d hydrological model the validity of the hydrus 1d model for studying the effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes is tested by comparing simulated water fluxes with observed lysimeter values and calculating the signal to noise ratio snr after bormann 2005 the goodness of fit metrics computed for each lysimeter and the snr s are shown in table 1 good performance was observed between the modeled and observed seepage rates and actual transpiration kge 0 85 which indicates that the models are able to simulate the soil water fluxes in both lysimeters the uncertainty in the modeled soil water fluxes arising from the soil hydraulic properties is provided as the relative standard deviation for cumulative seepage and actual transpiration in table 1 the uncertainty in modeled soil water fluxes is smaller than the effects of e co 2 which is confirmed by snr values higher than 1 3 3 2 response of seepage to changes in potential evapotranspiration from 1991 to 2020 to improve our understanding of the effects of e co 2 at the study site an additional simulation was performed using available meteorological data from a thirty year period 1991 2020 and projected co 2 concentrations for the year of 2100 from different rcp scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 here we focus on comparing the changes in annual soil water fluxes between the simulation with ambient co 2 concentration 420 ppm and that with the projected co 2 concentration of the moderate high rcp6 0 emission scenario 670 ppm for the year 2100 see fig 9 in the modeled period e co 2 caused a decrease of the annual potential transpiration on average by 5 5 0 3 while actual transpiration decreased by 5 2 0 9 only a small increase of 0 8 0 5 was observed for the soil water content at 30 cm depth whereas an increase of 7 5 3 9 was observed for seepage 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of stomatal resistance to e co 2 the vegetation response to rising atmospheric co 2 concentration can affect the terrestrial water balance mainly by increasing stomatal resistance and biomass growth fatichi et al 2016 ukkola et al 2016 yang et al 2021 at the grassland site subject to this study we show that e co 2 affects soil water fluxes mainly by reducing plant transpiration which can be attributed to increased stomatal resistance numerous field and laboratory experiments ainsworth and rogers 2007 leakey et al 2009 have shown that e co 2 increases stomatal resistance at the leaf level leading to a reduction in transpiration consistent with the literature e g ainsworth and rogers 2007 volk et al 2000 poorter et al 2022 lauber and körner 1997 this study found an increase 50 16 in stomatal resistance under a 300 ppm increase in co 2 concentration as stomatal resistance is also incorporated in the penman monteith equation we followed the approach by li et al 2019 and yang et al 2018 and calibrated a co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model for the conditions at our grassland site this allowed the inclusion of the e co 2 stomatal effect in the penman monteith equation and consequently in hydrological modeling to our surprise the linear relationship between co 2 concentration and stomatal resistance described by eq 4 was almost identical to the results of li et al 2019 and is shown in fig 8 this suggests a similar response in stomatal resistance to e co 2 between different species of c 3 plants allowing the applicability of the results to a broader group of vegetation types 4 2 sensitivity of observed and modeled soil water fluxes to e co 2 the observed soil water fluxes in the lysimeters show that e co 2 results in a general decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in seepage in the observed period 2018 2020 indicating that e co 2 has a greater impact on stomatal resistance reduces e t than on plant growth increases e t the results of this study show that e co 2 has no significant effect on the leaf area index plant growth observed in the two lysimeters subject to this study forstner et al 2021 and maxwell et al 2021 also analyzed the effect of e co 2 with a larger sample size at the same site and also found no effect of e co 2 on plant productivity this finding is consistent with several global studies donohue et al 2013 fatichi et al 2016 yang et al 2021 which found little or no impact of e co 2 on lai in humid climates where water was not a limiting factor for plant growth if water becomes a limiting growth factor in european alpine regions wieser et al 2008 in the future a positive effect of e co 2 on plant productivity in montane grasslands might be expected prior studies have noted the importance of the e co 2 effect on stomatal resistance and consequently evapotranspiration either with laboratory and open field experiments lauber and körner 1997 inauen et al 2013 leakey et al 2009 morgan et al 2011 kimball 2016 or using modeling approaches yang et al 2018 lemordant et al 2018 this study confirms that e co 2 is associated with a decrease in evapotranspiration more specifically a decrease in plant transpiration the observed decrease in daily mean evapotranspiration of 10 is similar to the findings of inauen et al 2013 and kimball 2016 who reported a mean decrease in evapotranspiration of 5 at 160 ppm and 10 at 200 ppm respectively these results provide a further support for the hypothesis that e co 2 reduces evapotranspiration in montane grasslands while several studies have focused on the effects of e co 2 on evapotranspiration only a few studies have considered the effects of e co 2 on seepage to the groundwater inauen et al 2013 studied the effects of e co 2 on the water fluxes of montane grassland using simple bucket lysimeters but found no discernible effects on seepage here we also observed only small effects on annual seepage rates in the drier years 2018 2019 however more remarkable differences were observed in the wet year of 2020 and post drought seepage events similar results were also obtained from the hydrus 1d modeling exercise for the period between 1990 2021 and indicated a decrease in annual actual transpiration of 5 2 and a 7 5 increase in seepage under the moderately high co 2 concentrations of the rcp6 0 emission scenario 670 ppm similar to our plot level modeling study the modeling results of lemaitre basset et al 2022 also showed an increase in runoff over france when the physiological effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance was included for our site and montane grassland in general the impact of water stress is not expected to be significant volk et al 2000 but during the relatively dry year of 2019 we have observed water stress effects see appendix during this period we observed water saving effects in the e co 2 lysimeter due to improved water use efficiency forstner et al 2021 water savings seem to have prolonged water use into the dry season see fig 6 in this period we further observed higher lai and evapotranspiration in the e co 2 lysimeter which differed from the rest of the observation period this finding is consistent with that of volk et al 2000 who also suggests that the effect of e co 2 on lai should be divided into a direct effect from co 2 fertilization and an indirect effect from soil water savings as warming might increase the intensity and frequency of drought events in alpine regions douville et al 2021 e co 2 will be an important factor to consider our study neglected the effects of e co 2 on water fluxes through radiative forcing as our lysimeter experiment only captured the physiological effects of e co 2 however future climate scenarios also project a warmer climate due to an increase in radiative forcing caused by rising concentrations of the greenhouse gas caretta et al 2022 as warming generally results in higher evapotranspiration both the physiological effect of e co 2 and the radiative forcing effect need to be taken into account when conducting climate change impact studies vicente serrano et al 2020 how e co 2 affects grassland water fluxes in a warmer and drier climate should be further investigated on the one hand the e co 2 stomatal effect could help mitigate the effects of drought and allow plants to grow in drier conditions as illustrated by our observations in the 2019 drought on the other hand increased plant growth would lead to higher et and hence higher water consumption during dry periods cui et al 2021 4 2 1 consequences of neglecting the co 2 stomatal effect several authors kruijt et al 2008 swann et al 2016 butcher et al 2014 lemordant et al 2018 lemaitre basset et al 2022 suggested to include the vegetation response to e co 2 in the assessment of the impact of climate change on the terrestrial water cycle neglecting the e co 2 stomatal effect may lead to an underestimation of seepage and river runoff yang et al 2018 and an overestimation of evapotranspiration milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2020 nonetheless many studies still neglect the effect of e co 2 on the soil water balance fluxes using the hydrus 1d model and data from the e co 2 lysimeter it was shown that neglecting the effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance leads to an overestimation of the cumulative potential transpiration in the growing season by 5 3 2018 5 8 2019 and 6 5 2020 and actual transpiration by 2 4 2018 3 7 2019 and 6 5 2020 cumulative seepage from the start of the growing season to the end of the year was underestimated by 4 6 2018 4 2 2019 and 6 8 2020 more notable differences in seepage rates were observed after dry periods as shown in fig 10 hence we urge researchers to use hydrological models that simulate the response of plant transpiration to e co 2 5 conclusion in this study we used a combination of a mini face system and two high precision weighable lysimeters to assess the effects of elevated atmospheric co 2 concentrations e co 2 on evapotranspiration and seepage in a permanent montane grassland further modeling using a co 2 dependent penman monteith equation and the hydrus 1d model allowed estimation of the e co 2 effect over a longer time period and at co 2 concentrations of the rcp emission scenarios an increase of 300 ppm resulted in a 10 decrease in daily evapotranspiration and was associated with a partial stomatal closure due to e co 2 50 increase in stomatal resistance no effect of e co 2 on the leaf area index was confirmed at the site the decrease in evapotranspiration led to an increase in soil water content during the growing season resulting in an increase in seepage ranging from a few millimeters to 31 mm 20 in the relatively wet year 2020 a modeling exercise using projected co 2 concentrations for 2100 from rcp emission scenarios revealed high variability in the relative change in annual seepage ranging between 3 and 24 interestingly the increase in soil water content allowed prolonged water consumption by plants into the dry period mitigating the effects of drought our study demonstrates how the effect of e co 2 on the water use efficiency of plants can be represented in the penman monteith equation using the sensitivity of stomatal resistance to e co 2 if neglected in the model this effect can lead to overestimation of transpiration and underestimation of seepage especially in the case of post drought seepage events we highlight that the vegetation response to e co 2 especially the physiological effect of stomatal closure is an important factor for predicting soil water fluxes under climate change more experimental evidence is needed to further improve our understanding of ecohydrological processes under climate change especially the effect on root growth and vertical distribution of root water uptake under limiting water conditions the results of this study were based on plot scale experiments however the findings may have large implications for studying

2469,the response of vegetation to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide e co 2 has opposing effects on terrestrial water fluxes especially evapotranspiration in particular co 2 fertilization may enhance plant growth therefore increasing canopy transpiration while a partial stomatal closure decreases leaf transpiration in this study the effects of e co 2 on water fluxes at a managed montane grassland were monitored using two high precision weighable lysimeters exposed to ambient and elevated 300 ppm relative to ambient conditions co 2 concentrations during the growing season e co 2 led to a general decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in seepage it was shown that e co 2 influences evapotranspiration primarily through the change in stomatal resistance as no effect of e co 2 on the leaf area index was confirmed a co 2 dependent penman monteith equation and actual evapotranspiration data from the lysimeters made it possible to estimate the effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance e co 2 was found to increase stomatal resistance by 50 relative to ambient conditions a hydrus 1d model allowed a temporal extension of the experimental findings to the period of 1990 2021 and revealed high variability in the relative change in annual seepage under e co 2 the modeling exercise demonstrated that the effect of e co 2 can be easily implemented in the penman monteith equation and if neglected leads to overestimation of transpiration and underestimation of seepage especially in the first post drought seepage events our findings show that e co 2 positively affects the water balance in montane grasslands thus e co 2 might be an important factor in mitigating the effects of warming and droughts in the future we propose that the vegetation response to e co 2 in particular the effect on stomatal resistance should be taken into account when assessing the effects of climate change on grassland water fluxes this may also have large implications when studying the impact of climate change at a watershed scale msc 00 01 99 00 keywords evapotranspiration seepage co2 concentration stomatal resistance lysimeter hydrus 1d montane grassland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the ongoing increase in atmospheric co 2 concentration in the atmosphere raises questions about the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co 2 concentrations e co 2 and its impacts on surface and groundwater resources caretta et al 2022 terrestrial vegetation influences the water cycle mainly by changing evapotranspiration which includes soil evaporation and plant transpiration and depends on climate and vegetation characteristics lemordant et al 2018 previous experiments revealed that e co 2 affects both the productivity and water use efficiency of plants leakey et al 2009 kimball 2016 on the one hand e co 2 may stimulate biomass production through co 2 fertilization and thus increase transpiration ogle et al 2021 on the other hand partial closure of leaf stomatal openings can decrease leaf transpiration ainsworth and rogers 2007 the net effect of e co 2 on the water balance is still debated mainly due to i climate and vegetation specific feedback and ii lack of experimental data fatichi et al 2016 forzieri et al 2020 ukkola et al 2016 yang et al 2021 photosynthetic plants meet their co 2 requirements more quickly at e co 2 allowing them to partially close their stomata and reduce water loss from the inside of the leaf stomatal resistance to water loss can be measured at leaf scale or derived from transpiration measurements using the penman monteith equation raupach and finnigan 1988 montero et al 2001 the effect of co 2 fertilization increased plant productivity can be reflected as a change in the biomass or leaf area index lai under e co 2 relative to ambient conditions a common method to study the response of vegetation to e co 2 involves the use of free air carbon dioxide enrichment face systems miglietta et al 2001 winkler and herbst 2004 kimball 2016 in this approach a fumigation ring enriches the air above the vegetation plot with co 2 miglietta et al 2001 and winkler and herbst 2004 showed that a face system can be successfully applied to study the effects of e co 2 outdoors ainsworth and rogers 2007 conducted a meta analysis of the response of stomatal resistance r l to increased co 2 concentration among various functional groups using results from multiple face experiments across the reviewed literature the highest and most consistent response of stomatal resistance to e co 2 was observed in c 3 grass increased co 2 concentration is also associated with an increase in total plant biomass yet several studies found no clear signal of a co 2 fertilization effect in c 3 grasses ainsworth and long 2005 volk et al 2000 obermeier et al 2017 körner 2006 in austria grassland ecosystems are a key element of mountain landscapes covering approximately 16 of the land surface and about 50 of the total agricultural lands bmlrt 2020 as montane grasslands are mainly composed of c 3 grass species they are expected to play an important role in mitigating the effects of climate change on the water balance despite their importance only a limited number of studies experimentally addressed the effects of e co 2 on water fluxes of montane grasslands the results of inauen et al 2013 suggest that e co 2 reduces evapotranspiration in montane grasslands thus increasing soil water savings however the increased soil water savings did not affect seepage to the groundwater forstner et al 2021 found similar effects on evapotranspiration but observed that seepage increased with e co 2 volk et al 2000 observed a comparable response in soil moisture savings in various grassland species and an increase in stomatal resistance under e co 2 understanding of the effect of e co 2 on water fluxes in montane grassland under different climate conditions still remains limited hydrological models that can capture the vegetation response to e co 2 are commonly used to understand how the effects of e co 2 propagate through soils into aquifers and streams in most studies yang et al 2018 kellner et al 2017 kruijt et al 2008 butcher et al 2014 fowler et al 2019 the effect of e co 2 is included using a modified penman monteith pm equation which considers the change in stomatal resistance due to e co 2 monteith 1965 li et al 2019 most studies lack data to validate the modeled water fluxes in particular the seepage flux at a point scale lysimeters can be used to measure soil water fluxes while they are potentially subject to artefacts resulting from the small surface often in the order of 1 m 2 seneviratne et al 2012 showed that lysimeters can be representative of the entire catchment behavior physically based models such as the widely used hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2016 have been applied to study vegetation effects on soil water balances šípek et al 2020 and soil water fluxes in lysimeters schelle et al 2012 groh et al 2018 here we report on the observed and modeled effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes using data from two high precision weighable lysimeters at a montane c 3 grassland in austria one lysimeter is treated with the face system to achieve an increase of 300 ppm with respect to the ambient conditions under which the other reference lysimeter is operated we investigated the effects of e co 2 using lysimeter and leaf area index data together with a modified penman monteith equation coupled to a physically based hydrological model to i identify effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes ii quantify the sensitivity of stomatal resistance to e co 2 and iii assess the impact of e co 2 on modeled soil water fluxes to the best of our knowledge the combination of lysimeters a face system and a soil water balance model has not yet been applied to assess the impact of e co 2 on the soil water fluxes 2 data and methods 2 1 study site the analyzed lysimeter set up is part of the lysi t face climate change experiment hosted and operated by the agricultural research station arec raumberg gumpenstein herndl et al 2011 the experiment is designed to analyze effects of warming and elevated atmospheric co 2 concentrations e co 2 on the productivity and biogeochemistry of a managed c 3 grassland typical for many european mountain regions piepho et al 2017 the site is located in the eastern part of the austrian alps near the confluence of rivers enns and donnersbach at an altitude of 707 m a s l see fig 1 the average annual temperature and precipitation for the period 1991 2020 are 8 5 c and 1009 mm respectively according to the köppen climate classification the site lies in the subpolar oceanic climate zone which is the typical climate zone for the montane belt of the alps rubel et al 2017 plant communities consist mainly of c 3 grasses arrenatherum elatius and festuca pratensis and leguminous species lotus corniculatus and trifolium pratense which can be considered representative of permanent grasslands in alpine regions schaumberger 2011 the soil type is classified as a cambisol world reference base classification primarily consisting of loamy sand with a median bulk density of 1 4 g cm 1 and a median saturated hydraulic conductivity of 114 50 5 234 1 cm d 1 2 2 data measurement data from 2018 to 2020 are used focusing on the growing season when the co 2 enrichment took place from early april to mid october the thermal approach of ernst and loeper 1976 was employed to determine the start and end of the growing season see appendix two weighable monolithic lysimeters see fig 2 were used to quantify the components of the soil water balance equation comprising precipitation p actual evapotranspiration e t a seepage s at the bottom of the lysimeter and the change in soil water storage δ sw 1 δ s w p e t a s the two high precision lysimeters meter group fank and unold 2007 have a surface area of 1 m 2 a depth of 140 cm and have been in operation since june 2014 the tension controlled bottom boundary system is adjusted based on matric potential measured at 140 cm depth inside the cylindrical lysimeter and a reference matric potential at the same depth just outside the lysimeter using this approach we can assume that the soil water fluxes in the lysimeter are transferable to the surrounding field groh et al 2016 each of the lysimeters is equipped with tensiometers and time domain reflectometry probes at depths of 10 30 50 and 140 cm the precision of the weighing scales is 100 g for the lysimeters and 10 g for the water seepage reservoir in which the water from the lysimeter is collected and in periods of upward flow pumped back into the lysimeter the weight measurements are recorded every minute external factors animals management etc can contribute to the change in the weight of the lysimeter so the raw lysimeter data are subject to extensive manual and automated plausibility checks forstner et al 2021 additional smoothing and the separation of precipitation and evapotranspiration from changes in lysimeter mass was performed using the adaptive window and adaptive threshold filter awat peters et al 2017 daily soil water fluxes were obtained by resampling 10 min water balance data to daily sums to achieve a controlled increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide of 300 ppm compared to ambient conditions one of the lysimeters is treated with the face free air carbon dioxide enrichment system miglietta et al 2001 the co 2 concentrations are recorded at plant canopy height 0 15 0 9 m at the center of the fumigation ring on a 1 min resolution the co 2 fumigation is operated only during the day when global radiation exceeds 50 w m 2 and is interrupted when the wind velocity at the site exceeds 1 5 m s 1 to eliminate possible blower effects from the fumigation system all plots under ambient conditions are equipped with fumigation rings through which nonenriched ambient air flows the co 2 concentration at the e co 2 lysimeter was within 20 of the preset target concentration of 300 ppm to ambient conditions for 80 of the operational time during 2018 2020 and 93 of the operational time within 30 of the target concentration the co 2 concentration of the fumigated plot was measured directly in the center of the plot whereas the ambient co 2 concentration was taken as the average concentration of eight ambient plots throughout the field daily average co 2 concentrations used in eq 4 see fig 6 were obtained by aggregating 1 min co 2 concentration data during the day the meteorological data used in the study includes daily values of solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed see fig 3 measurements of leaf area index lai and crop height h c r o p were collected throughout the growing season with at least 10 measurements per year per plot see fig 6 crop height was measured using an ultra sonic measurement with five sensors while lai was obtained using a field spectrometer handyspec klingler et al 2020 and the accupar lp 80 ceptometer lai and h c r o p measurement data were linearly interpolated to obtain a gap free time series of the crop growth parameters for this purpose h c r o p 15 cm and l a i 0 2 were assigned to the day after mowing when no measurement existed vremec et al 2021 the lysimeter plots were mowed three times per year followed by mineral fertilization herndl et al 2011 2 3 methods an adapted penman monteith pm equation was used in combination with the hydrus 1d unsaturated zone model to simulate the effects of vegetation response to e co 2 on soil water fluxes yang et al 2018 leterme et al 2012 the adapted penman monteith equation uses a co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model to capture the effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance and leaf area index the relationship between stomatal resistance and co 2 concentration is inversely estimated by comparing the calculated evapotranspiration based on the pm equation and the observed evapotranspiration from the lysimeters raupach and finnigan 1988 to assess the impact of e co 2 on soil water fluxes under different climate conditions a hydrus 1d simulation was performed for a 30 year period using historical meteorological data at the site and atmospheric co 2 concentrations from the representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 the representative concentration pathways describe four different pathways of greenhouse gas atmospheric concentrations in the 21st century as adopted by the ipcc caretta et al 2022 the overall workflow see fig 2 of the model based data analysis was as follows 1 estimate the effect of e co 2 on lysimeter water fluxes and leaf area index 2 establish an empirical relationship between co 2 concentrations and stomatal resistance 3 estimate the effects of e co 2 on modeled soil water fluxes 2 3 1 the single layer stomatal resistance model monteith 1965 was the first to apply resistance terms surface r s and aerodynamic r a resistance to the estimation of potential evapotranspiration by introducing the penman monteith equation henceforth referred to as the pm equation the pm equation allows the estimation of evapotranspiration on vegetation specific surfaces 2 p e t c 1 λ δ r n g ρ a c p e s e a r a δ γ 1 r s r a where p e t c is the potential crop evapotranspiration kg m 2 d 1 equivalent to mm d 1 λ is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor

a is the actual vapor pressure of the air kpa γ is the psychrometric constant kpa k 1 r s is the bulk surface resistance d m 1 and r a is the bulk aerodynamic resistance the value for r a is calculated using crop height equation 4 in allen et al 1998 it should be noted that the above equation includes the resistance terms r a and r s in units of d m 1 to avoid unit conversion issues in the remainder of this article we will use the more commonly used s m 1 units the standard form of the pm equation includes the bulk surface resistance r s which represents the combined resistance to vapor flow from both the soil and the vegetation canopy single layer model the resistance of the vegetation canopy to vapor flow can be regarded as the integrated sum of stomatal resistance of all leaves in the canopy e g in eq 2 the amount of one sided green leaf area per unit ground area is commonly quantified using the leaf area index lai in our study r s is computed as a function of the bulk stomatal resistance r l s m 1 for a single lai layer lai 1 and the leaf area index measured at the lysimeter with an assumption that only the upper half of the canopy is active in heat and vapor transport allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 3 r s r l 0 5 l a i since we have measured lai for both lysimeters we are able to obtain the bulk stomatal resistance r l by inverse modeling of the observed evapotranspiration flux using the pm equation as described below 2 3 2 co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model several authors proposed the usage of co 2 dependent stomatal resistance models to account for changing co 2 concentrations in the computation of the evapotranspiration flux such models mainly consist of simple linear models that describe the relationship between the atmospheric co 2 concentration and stomatal resistance li et al 2019 and yang et al 2018 proposed a simple r l model that accounts for changes in co 2 4 r l co 2 r r l 300 1 s r l co 2 co 2 300 where s r l co 2 ppm 1 is the relative sensitivity of r l to δ co 2 and r r l 300 s m 1 the reference stomatal resistance when atmospheric co 2 is 300 ppm the relative sensitivity of r l to δ co 2 represents the change in r l per ppm increase in co 2 2 3 3 parameter estimation and statistical analyses parameters r l r r l 300 and s r l co 2 in eqs 3 and 4 were estimated using the non linear least squares from scipy virtanen et al 2020 which uses the trust region reflective algorithm to minimize the sum of the squared residuals minimizing the difference between observed and measured evapotranspiration to minimize the effects of plant water stress and soil evaporation on estimated stomatal resistance only data observed on days when the following criteria applied were used for parameter estimation 1 l a i 1 and surface resistance is dominated by vegetation jensen and allen 2016 2 no water stress has occurred see appendix in the preliminary phase of this study it was found that the residuals were strongly correlated in time violating the statistical assumptions when using least squares optimization thus hampering uncertainty analysis to overcome this issue an auto regressive model of order one ar 1 was applied to reduce autocorrelation in the residuals the residuals between p e t c and e t a were diagnosed for autocorrelation using the durbin watson dw test durbin and watson 1950 the goodness of fit was evaluated using the root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean bias error mbe and the kling gupta efficiency kge provided in the spotpy python package houska et al 2015 a t test indicated by a p value was conducted using s c i p y and was used to detect significant differences between two samples the linear regression mean median standard deviation and standard error were computed using the n u m p y python package 2 3 4 hydrus 1d unsaturated zone modeling the effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes were incorporated by coupling the co 2 dependent pm equation eq 4 with the hydrus 1d model hydrus 1d uses potential evapotranspiration as input and divides it into potential soil evaporation e p and potential transpiration t p using beer s law and generated time series of lai simunek et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 5 e p p e t c e 0 6 l a i t p p e t c 1 e 0 6 l a i actual transpiration is calculated from potential transpiration based on the availability of water in the root zone after van genuchten 1980 two sets of soil hydraulic properties obtained with an inverse modeling approach schelle et al 2012 using the dream algorithm vrugt 2016 for bayesian inference were used for the simulation the hydrus 1d model of each lysimeter was calibrated against the daily seepage rate at the bottom of the lysimeter matric potential and soil water content at a depth of 10 30 and 140 cm while using observed lysimeter evapotranspiration and precipitation as input the effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes were incorporated into the hydrus 1d model by changing the input potential transpiration calculated from p e t c and beer s law a daily time step was used for all modeling scenarios the suitability of the model for use in climate change scenarios was tested using the signal to noise ratio snr proposed by bormann 2005 snr values larger than 1 are called high snr values and demonstrate a sufficient suitability of a model for scenario analysis while negative values suggest that the model is not suitable for this purpose details on the snr procedure and the calibration of the hydrus 1d model can be found in the appendix the effect of e co 2 on modeled water flows under variable climate conditions was assessed by performing hydrus 1d simulations for the period 1991 2021 under different co 2 concentrations the simulation was carried out using both sets of soil hydraulic properties historical meteorological data at the site for the period 1990 2021 and atmospheric co 2 concentrations from

fluxes was first analyzed using cumulative lysimeter water fluxes for the 2018 2020 growing seasons see fig 4 the annual distribution of precipitation varied between growing seasons leading to a drier growing season in 2018 and 2019 and a wetter one in 2020 in the dry years of 2018 and 2019 there was approximately 34 less precipitation in the growing season compared to 2020 this led to considerably higher cumulative seepage at the bottom of the lysimeters in 2020 140 mm over the growing period compared to the drier years when the seepage rates were below 15 mm in 2018 the cumulative precipitation from the two lysimeters differed by less than 0 4 2 mm between the two lysimeters in 2019 2 10 mm more precipitation was estimated with the ambient lysimeter and 3 18 mm less in 2020 compared to the e co 2 lysimeter the difference in cumulative evapotranspiration between the two lysimeters was highest in 2018 when the e co 2 lysimeter exhibited 7 3 lower e t a than the ambient e t a at the e co 2 lysimeter was 5 0 and 3 0 lower than the ambient in 2019 and 2020 respectively in 2020 the e co 2 lysimeter showed 22 31 mm higher seepage rates compared to the ambient lysimeter while the deviations in the drier years did not stand out δ 10 mm to check for systematic differences between the lysimeters e t a fluxes of both lysimeters were compared for days when no co 2 enrichment took place δ co 2 42 ppm standard error of the co 2 sensors see fig 5 and days when the co 2 difference between the lysimeters was greater than 240 ppm tar 80 a student s t test was performed to test whether there was a significant difference between the e t a of the lysimeters for both periods no significant difference in daily e t a was found p 0 95 on days when the face system was not operating and the co 2 concentrations on both lysimeters were nearly the same see fig 5 b when the co 2 concentration of the e co 2 lysimeter was at least 240 ppm higher than ambient conditions a significant difference in mean daily e t a p 0 038 was observed the e co 2 lysimeter showed a 6 8 reduction in daily mean e t a compared to the ambient see fig 5 a while only a 2 2 reduction was observed on days when co 2 fumigation was not operational see fig 5 b the calculated mean bias error mbe further confirms the systematic difference in mean e t a on days when co 2 fumigation was applied compared to days when fumigation did not take place the seasonal effects of e co 2 were analyzed using daily time series of the canopy co 2 concentration the residual between actual evapotranspiration of the ambient and e co 2 lysimeter the leaf area index and the matric potential at 30 cm depth see fig 6 the mean co 2 concentration for the observation period 2018 2020 was 418 20 ppm and 696 31 ppm for the ambient and e co 2 lysimeter respectively see fig 6 a unlike most of the observation period a higher e t a in the e co 2 lysimeter is observed during the drier periods immediately after the second harvest in 2018 and after the first harvest in 2019 see δ e t a in fig 6 b the development of the leaf area index throughout the growing season is shown in fig 6 c an increase in lai due to e co 2 could not be confirmed in both the lai measured with the accupar device p 0 482 and the field spectrometer p 0 85 however higher lai values were observed in the e co 2 lysimeter in the drier period after 1st harvest in 2019 see fig 6 c matric potential at the depth of 30 cm showed a faster drop in the ambient lysimeter throughout the measurement period the mean matric potential in the ambient lysimeter was lower than that of the enriched one the deviations were more pronounced in the drier periods of 2018 and 2019 see fig 6 d based on previous experiments ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 stomatal resistance is expected to increase with e co 2 by calibrating the stomatal resistance term in the pm equation eq 3 on days when no water stress was observed e t a p e t c and l a i 1 we were able to estimate the stomatal resistance for the conditions in each of the lysimeters optimal stomatal resistance values at each of the lysimeters and the estimated p e t c is shown in fig 7 a stomatal resistance of 78 4 s m 1 and 117 6 s m 1 was estimated for ambient and e co 2 conditions respectively this corresponds to a 50 16 increase in stomatal resistance under a 300 ppm increase in co 2 concentration the calibrated p e t c models were able to simulate daily e t a for each of the two lysimeters well n s e 0 88 3 2 relationship between co 2 and stomatal resistance to establish a quantitative relationship between stomatal resistance and the co 2 concentration the penman monteith equation in combination with the co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model eq 4 was calibrated against the evapotranspiration of both lysimeters here we used the actual canopy co 2 concentration to estimate p e t c a reference stomatal resistance of 64 6 s m 1 and a relative sensitivity s r l co 2 of 0 002 6e 04 ppm 1 were obtained from calibration using one set of parameters for the calculation of p e t c at both lysimeters did not decrease the overall performance of the p e t c model n s e 0 88 for both lysimeters the resulting stomatal resistance sensitivity to co 2 is shown as the blue line in fig 8 a and is very similar to the sensitivity obtained by li et al 2019 the shaded area in the figure represents the 95 confidence interval while the symbols represent the calibrated stomatal resistance values for each lysimeter per year indicating the year to year variation in estimated stomatal resistance 3 3 effect of e co 2 on modeled water fluxes 3 3 1 model performance of the hydrus 1d hydrological model the validity of the hydrus 1d model for studying the effects of e co 2 on soil water fluxes is tested by comparing simulated water fluxes with observed lysimeter values and calculating the signal to noise ratio snr after bormann 2005 the goodness of fit metrics computed for each lysimeter and the snr s are shown in table 1 good performance was observed between the modeled and observed seepage rates and actual transpiration kge 0 85 which indicates that the models are able to simulate the soil water fluxes in both lysimeters the uncertainty in the modeled soil water fluxes arising from the soil hydraulic properties is provided as the relative standard deviation for cumulative seepage and actual transpiration in table 1 the uncertainty in modeled soil water fluxes is smaller than the effects of e co 2 which is confirmed by snr values higher than 1 3 3 2 response of seepage to changes in potential evapotranspiration from 1991 to 2020 to improve our understanding of the effects of e co 2 at the study site an additional simulation was performed using available meteorological data from a thirty year period 1991 2020 and projected co 2 concentrations for the year of 2100 from different rcp scenarios van vuuren et al 2011 here we focus on comparing the changes in annual soil water fluxes between the simulation with ambient co 2 concentration 420 ppm and that with the projected co 2 concentration of the moderate high rcp6 0 emission scenario 670 ppm for the year 2100 see fig 9 in the modeled period e co 2 caused a decrease of the annual potential transpiration on average by 5 5 0 3 while actual transpiration decreased by 5 2 0 9 only a small increase of 0 8 0 5 was observed for the soil water content at 30 cm depth whereas an increase of 7 5 3 9 was observed for seepage 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity of stomatal resistance to e co 2 the vegetation response to rising atmospheric co 2 concentration can affect the terrestrial water balance mainly by increasing stomatal resistance and biomass growth fatichi et al 2016 ukkola et al 2016 yang et al 2021 at the grassland site subject to this study we show that e co 2 affects soil water fluxes mainly by reducing plant transpiration which can be attributed to increased stomatal resistance numerous field and laboratory experiments ainsworth and rogers 2007 leakey et al 2009 have shown that e co 2 increases stomatal resistance at the leaf level leading to a reduction in transpiration consistent with the literature e g ainsworth and rogers 2007 volk et al 2000 poorter et al 2022 lauber and körner 1997 this study found an increase 50 16 in stomatal resistance under a 300 ppm increase in co 2 concentration as stomatal resistance is also incorporated in the penman monteith equation we followed the approach by li et al 2019 and yang et al 2018 and calibrated a co 2 dependent stomatal resistance model for the conditions at our grassland site this allowed the inclusion of the e co 2 stomatal effect in the penman monteith equation and consequently in hydrological modeling to our surprise the linear relationship between co 2 concentration and stomatal resistance described by eq 4 was almost identical to the results of li et al 2019 and is shown in fig 8 this suggests a similar response in stomatal resistance to e co 2 between different species of c 3 plants allowing the applicability of the results to a broader group of vegetation types 4 2 sensitivity of observed and modeled soil water fluxes to e co 2 the observed soil water fluxes in the lysimeters show that e co 2 results in a general decrease in evapotranspiration and an increase in seepage in the observed period 2018 2020 indicating that e co 2 has a greater impact on stomatal resistance reduces e t than on plant growth increases e t the results of this study show that e co 2 has no significant effect on the leaf area index plant growth observed in the two lysimeters subject to this study forstner et al 2021 and maxwell et al 2021 also analyzed the effect of e co 2 with a larger sample size at the same site and also found no effect of e co 2 on plant productivity this finding is consistent with several global studies donohue et al 2013 fatichi et al 2016 yang et al 2021 which found little or no impact of e co 2 on lai in humid climates where water was not a limiting factor for plant growth if water becomes a limiting growth factor in european alpine regions wieser et al 2008 in the future a positive effect of e co 2 on plant productivity in montane grasslands might be expected prior studies have noted the importance of the e co 2 effect on stomatal resistance and consequently evapotranspiration either with laboratory and open field experiments lauber and körner 1997 inauen et al 2013 leakey et al 2009 morgan et al 2011 kimball 2016 or using modeling approaches yang et al 2018 lemordant et al 2018 this study confirms that e co 2 is associated with a decrease in evapotranspiration more specifically a decrease in plant transpiration the observed decrease in daily mean evapotranspiration of 10 is similar to the findings of inauen et al 2013 and kimball 2016 who reported a mean decrease in evapotranspiration of 5 at 160 ppm and 10 at 200 ppm respectively these results provide a further support for the hypothesis that e co 2 reduces evapotranspiration in montane grasslands while several studies have focused on the effects of e co 2 on evapotranspiration only a few studies have considered the effects of e co 2 on seepage to the groundwater inauen et al 2013 studied the effects of e co 2 on the water fluxes of montane grassland using simple bucket lysimeters but found no discernible effects on seepage here we also observed only small effects on annual seepage rates in the drier years 2018 2019 however more remarkable differences were observed in the wet year of 2020 and post drought seepage events similar results were also obtained from the hydrus 1d modeling exercise for the period between 1990 2021 and indicated a decrease in annual actual transpiration of 5 2 and a 7 5 increase in seepage under the moderately high co 2 concentrations of the rcp6 0 emission scenario 670 ppm similar to our plot level modeling study the modeling results of lemaitre basset et al 2022 also showed an increase in runoff over france when the physiological effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance was included for our site and montane grassland in general the impact of water stress is not expected to be significant volk et al 2000 but during the relatively dry year of 2019 we have observed water stress effects see appendix during this period we observed water saving effects in the e co 2 lysimeter due to improved water use efficiency forstner et al 2021 water savings seem to have prolonged water use into the dry season see fig 6 in this period we further observed higher lai and evapotranspiration in the e co 2 lysimeter which differed from the rest of the observation period this finding is consistent with that of volk et al 2000 who also suggests that the effect of e co 2 on lai should be divided into a direct effect from co 2 fertilization and an indirect effect from soil water savings as warming might increase the intensity and frequency of drought events in alpine regions douville et al 2021 e co 2 will be an important factor to consider our study neglected the effects of e co 2 on water fluxes through radiative forcing as our lysimeter experiment only captured the physiological effects of e co 2 however future climate scenarios also project a warmer climate due to an increase in radiative forcing caused by rising concentrations of the greenhouse gas caretta et al 2022 as warming generally results in higher evapotranspiration both the physiological effect of e co 2 and the radiative forcing effect need to be taken into account when conducting climate change impact studies vicente serrano et al 2020 how e co 2 affects grassland water fluxes in a warmer and drier climate should be further investigated on the one hand the e co 2 stomatal effect could help mitigate the effects of drought and allow plants to grow in drier conditions as illustrated by our observations in the 2019 drought on the other hand increased plant growth would lead to higher et and hence higher water consumption during dry periods cui et al 2021 4 2 1 consequences of neglecting the co 2 stomatal effect several authors kruijt et al 2008 swann et al 2016 butcher et al 2014 lemordant et al 2018 lemaitre basset et al 2022 suggested to include the vegetation response to e co 2 in the assessment of the impact of climate change on the terrestrial water cycle neglecting the e co 2 stomatal effect may lead to an underestimation of seepage and river runoff yang et al 2018 and an overestimation of evapotranspiration milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2020 nonetheless many studies still neglect the effect of e co 2 on the soil water balance fluxes using the hydrus 1d model and data from the e co 2 lysimeter it was shown that neglecting the effect of e co 2 on stomatal resistance leads to an overestimation of the cumulative potential transpiration in the growing season by 5 3 2018 5 8 2019 and 6 5 2020 and actual transpiration by 2 4 2018 3 7 2019 and 6 5 2020 cumulative seepage from the start of the growing season to the end of the year was underestimated by 4 6 2018 4 2 2019 and 6 8 2020 more notable differences in seepage rates were observed after dry periods as shown in fig 10 hence we urge researchers to use hydrological models that simulate the response of plant transpiration to e co 2 5 conclusion in this study we used a combination of a mini face system and two high precision weighable lysimeters to assess the effects of elevated atmospheric co 2 concentrations e co 2 on evapotranspiration and seepage in a permanent montane grassland further modeling using a co 2 dependent penman monteith equation and the hydrus 1d model allowed estimation of the e co 2 effect over a longer time period and at co 2 concentrations of the rcp emission scenarios an increase of 300 ppm resulted in a 10 decrease in daily evapotranspiration and was associated with a partial stomatal closure due to e co 2 50 increase in stomatal resistance no effect of e co 2 on the leaf area index was confirmed at the site the decrease in evapotranspiration led to an increase in soil water content during the growing season resulting in an increase in seepage ranging from a few millimeters to 31 mm 20 in the relatively wet year 2020 a modeling exercise using projected co 2 concentrations for 2100 from rcp emission scenarios revealed high variability in the relative change in annual seepage ranging between 3 and 24 interestingly the increase in soil water content allowed prolonged water consumption by plants into the dry period mitigating the effects of drought our study demonstrates how the effect of e co 2 on the water use efficiency of plants can be represented in the penman monteith equation using the sensitivity of stomatal resistance to e co 2 if neglected in the model this effect can lead to overestimation of transpiration and underestimation of seepage especially in the case of post drought seepage events we highlight that the vegetation response to e co 2 especially the physiological effect of stomatal closure is an important factor for predicting soil water fluxes under climate change more experimental evidence is needed to further improve our understanding of ecohydrological processes under climate change especially the effect on root growth and vertical distribution of root water uptake under limiting water conditions the results of this study were based on plot scale experiments however the findings may have large implications for studying the hydrological impacts of climate change at the catchment scale credit authorship contribution statement matevž vremec conceptualization methodology software writing original draft visualization
