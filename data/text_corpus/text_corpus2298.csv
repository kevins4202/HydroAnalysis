11490,faced with the consequences of climate change such as increased drought and salinization of soils the species chenopodium quinoa may be a good alternative crop because of its high tolerance to these conditions and its high nutritional value the objective of this work was to analyze the response of the quinoa plant in drought and salinity conditions under conditions of drought and severe saline stress 500 mm nacl highly similar reductions in growth and relative water content were observed however the strategies implemented by the plants in either stress condition and their relative importance were different under salt conditions responses related to osmotic adjustment were more prominent than under drought conditions where more dehydration was detected in addition despite a similar reduction in stomatal conductance in drought and saline conditions a greater non stomatal effect was observed in drought conditions which was demonstrated by the fact that the intercellular co2 concentration was increased moreover the antioxidant metabolism also responded differently to the two stresses photoassimilate allocation was also different between treatments the root shoot ratio remained constant independent of salt concentration whereas under drought conditions this ratio increased a similar trend between treatments was detected for water use efficiency which was maintained under salt stress and increased under drought conditions indicating that under reduced water conditions quinoa can use lower amounts of water per unit of biomass production these results suggest that c quinoa could be irrigated with brackish or even higher salinity water without severely affecting the growth during its early growth stage thereby making c quinoa a promising alternative crop for arid and semi arid regions keywords chenopodium quinoa drought growth photosynthesis salt stress water relations 1 introduction climate change is projected to cause a change in the amount of rainfall increasing in some areas and significantly decreasing in others additionally it is expected to increase extreme events of drought and flooding due to the changes in the distribution of rainfall patterns ipcc 2014 and these extreme events are more harmful to ecosystems than changes in the annual mean precipitation smith et al 2005 furthermore a rise in temperature is estimated therefore higher rates of water evaporation will occur expanding even more the drought areas these phenomena together with agricultural practices are also causing an increase in the salinization of crop soils ipcc 2014 worldwide more than 11 of irrigated land are estimated to be salt affected a figure that has been rising each year fao 2011a water availability is the most important factor in the development of plants boyer 1982 chaves et al 2003 therefore under drought and salt affected soils plants suffer water scarcity and in recent years decreases in crop productivity have been observed in addition to the negative impact of climate change causing decreases in productivity the world population is expected to increase by 52 by the end of the century un 2015 which will require an increase in agricultural production to cope with growing food demand tilman et al 2011 since 1991 the total agricultural area has remained constant o mara 2012 so the productivity of crops must increase to meet the growing demand the increase of drought and salt affected soil area together with the increase in world population force the research community to find varieties or species that are more tolerant to water limitation or salinity to maintain or increase agricultural production recently efforts have been made in order to improve water use efficiency wue of crops to reduce the water needed for agricultural practices araus 2004 morison et al 2008 medrano et al 2015 quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd is a halophyte that has been historically cultivated in various regions of south america due to its high adaptability to extreme environments bazile et al 2016 various authors have observed that quinoa is a highly salt tolerant crop jacobsen et al 2003 adolf et al 2013 razzaghi et al 2015 determined that the ec50 for quinoa is 25 ds m 1 and thus confirmed the classification of quinoa as a highly salt tolerant crop additionally quinoa possesses extraordinary nutritional characteristics such as high content of protein and essential amino acids miranda et al 2012 all these characteristics led fao to consider quinoa to be one of the crops that might contribute to global food security during the 21st century fao 2011b however despite the importance of this crop the studies done till know have analyzed the impact of drought and or salt stress on the physiological processes separately for example in water relations jensen et al 2000 cocozza et al 2013 in photosynthesis and related parameters gonzález et al 2011 geissler et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2015 talebnejad and sepaskhah 2016 in antioxidant metabolism panuccio et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 and in growth gonzález et al 2009 ruiz carrasco et al 2011 adolf et al 2012 ruiz et al 2016 but never before have been measured all the aforementioned parameters together in just one study besides the studies done comparing the response of quinoa plants to drought and to salt stress are scarce bosque sanchez et al 2003 pulvento et al 2012 cocozza et al 2013 riccardi et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 ince kaya and yazar 2016 thus the objectives of this study were to determine the different physiological mechanisms that are activated in response to drought and salt stress provoked growth reductions as well as to compare the response of quinoa to drought and salt stress highlighting the similarities and differences in the mechanisms that quinoa plants use to cope with the stresses through analysis of various physiological processes as a whole 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental design a bolivian cultivar of chenopodium quinoa willd cv real blanca was used in this study its origin is near the salar de uyuni and belongs to altiplano of the andes ecotype characterized by growing in areas between 3500 and 3900 m above sea level with an annual rainfall of 400 800 mm seeds of this cultivar were sown in a 3 1 mixture of perlite vermiculite in 3 l pots with one seed per pot plants were grown from sowing until the end of the experiment in a conviron pgr15 controlled environment growth chamber conviron manitoba canada under a daily 14 h light regimen an average day night temperature of 24 20 c and a relative day night humidity of 70 80 during the light period the photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was 400 μmol m 2 s 1 light was provided by a combination of incandescent bulbs and warm white fluorescent lamps to minimize the effects of intrachamber environmental gradients plants were randomly repositioned within the chamber each week plants were watered with hoagland s solution arnon and hoagland 1940 three times per week maintaining at field capacity until the beginning of the stress treatment when the plants were 28 days old stress treatment was imposed for 14 days plants were divided into six groups five groups were watered every 2 days with 250 ml of hoagland s solution supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations 0 mm control 60 mm 120 mm 240 mm and 500 mm as salinity treatments and the sixth group was maintained without watering for 14 days as drought treatment 2 2 measurements of plant water parameters the leaf relative water content rwc was measured by gravimetric methods pérez lópez et al 2009a the leaf osmotic potential ψo was measured through the freezing point of the cellular sap by an osmometer osmomat 030 gonotec germany the leaf osmotic potential at full turgor ψo 100 was measured following the same procedure as for ψo to obtain full turgor leaves were cut from the plants incubated for 24 h in deionized water and stored in the dark at 4 c to avoid the loss of dry mass by respiration or the synthesis of new dry mass by photosynthesis dehydration was calculated as the difference between ψo 100 and the ψo for each treatment the osmotic adjustment was calculated as the difference between ψo 100 of the control plants and ψo 100 of the stressed plants the proline concentration was measured following the procedure of bates et al 1973 aliquots of leaf tissue 20 mg lyophilized were homogenized with 2 ml sulfosalicylic acid at 3 the homogenates were centrifuged at 16 100g for 5 min and the supernatant was kept on ice to 0 75 ml of the above supernatant 0 75 ml of ninhydrin acid was added consisting of 1 25 g of ninhydrin dissolved in 20 ml of 6 m phosphoric acid and 30 ml of glacial acetic acid subsequently to the mixture of the supernatant and ninhydrin acid 0 75 ml of glacial acetic acid was added samples were incubated for 1 h at 100 c once the tubes had cooled 1 5 ml of toluene was added and the mixture was shaken vigorously for 20 s the fluid separated into two phases and the upper phase was recovered then the absorbance was determined at 517 nm the cumulative plant water transpiration was calculated by gravimetric method each pot was weighed every 2 days at the same time before and after watering de luis et al 1999 2 3 gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll a fluorescence leaf gas exchange parameters were determined using a li 6400 open gas exchange system li cor inc lincoln ne usa leaf gas exchange rates were measured as described by pérez lópez et al 2013 measurements were done 3 h after dawn with a cuvette temperature held at 24 c and at a relative humidity of 60 the photosynthetic photon flux density was 400 μmol m 2 s 1 provided by red blue led light source model li 6400 02b li cor inc the co2 concentration of the cuvette ca was the same as in growth conditions li cor software was used to calculate stomatal conductance gs and the intercellular co2 concentration ci from net photosynthetic rate a and instantaneous transpiration rate e according to the method of von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 the intrinsic water use efficiency a gs was calculated by dividing a by gs the actual photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii φpsii fm fs fm was determined by measuring steady state fluorescence fs and maximum fluorescence during a light saturating pulse of 8000 μmol m 2 s 1 fm following the procedures of genty et al 1989 the electron transport rate etr indicates the proportion of light used in photochemical processes of the total of energy that reaches the leaf per unit of time and surface ppfd and it was calculated according to the following formula etr φpsiixppfdx0 85 0 5 the absorption coefficient of the leaves was taken as 0 85 and the fraction of the excitation energy distributed to psii was taken as 0 5 genty et al 1989 chlorophylls and carotenoids were extracted in dimethylsulfoxide dmso as described by barnes et al 1992 the absorbance was measured at 665 649 and 480 nm to quantify the pigment concentration using the formulas proposed by wellburn 1994 2 4 antioxidant enzyme activities all operations were carried out at 0 4 c aliquots of leaf tissue 0 15 g fresh weight were ground in a cold mortar using extraction buffer 3 ml for catalase cat activity the extraction buffer consisted of 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 8 0 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta 0 2 triton x 100 v v 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride pmsf and 2 mm dithiotreitol dtt the homogenates were squeezed through two layers of muslin and centrifuged at 16 100g for 25 min cat activity was measured spectrophotometrically according to the method of pérez lópez et al 2009b by monitoring the disappearance of h2o2 at 240 nm for 6 min at 25 c the reaction mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 and 20 mm h2o2 and 5 μl of the supernatant was added to start the reaction until quantification h2o2 was kept in the dark for ascorbate peroxidase apx activity the extraction buffer consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 8 containing 2 polyvinylpolypyrrolidone pvpp w v 0 1 mm edta 0 1 mm pmsf 0 2 triton x 100 v v 5 mm cysteine and 2 mm ascorbate ascorbate was added to the medium to avoid inactivation of apx during the extraction and assay the homogenates were squeezed through two layers of muslin and centrifuged at 16 100g for 25 min apx activity was assayed by measuring the oxidation of ascorbate at 290 nm according to the method of pérez lópez et al 2010 the reaction mixture contained 50 mm 4 2 hydroxyethyl 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid hepes ph 6 6 and 0 8 mm ascorbate the oxidation rate of ascorbate measured as the decline in absorbance at 290 nm was estimated between 1 and 60 s after starting the reaction with the addition of 0 8 mm h2o2 10 μl and 10 μl of the supernatant corrections were made for the non enzymatic oxidation of ascorbate by h2o2 and for the oxidation of ascorbate in the absence of h2o2 the protein content was measured according to the method of bradford 1976 using bovine serum albumin as a standard 2 5 growth parameters at the end of the experiment day 42 the plants were harvested separated into leaves stems and roots and weighed to determine fresh weight fw after that the samples were dried at 80 c for 48 h and their dry weight dw was determined whole plant water use efficiency wue was calculated as the estimated dry weight accumulation per plant divided by the cumulative transpiration per plant pérez lópez et al 2014 2 6 statistical analysis results are reported as the mean standard error se of four independent replicates the se was directly calculated from crude data data analyses were performed using the spss 19 0 software package chicago il one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the main effects of the stress means were compared using duncan s multiple range test p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant prior to analyses we tested whether the assumptions of an anova homogeneity of variances and normally distributed residuals were achieved the homogeneity of variances for all the studied parameters was evaluated by levene s test and the distribution of the residuals was assessed by kolmogorov smirnov test when necessary transformation was applied before statistical analysis was performed principal component analysis pca was performed using r r core team 2016 all treatments and variables were included in the analysis 3 results 3 1 leaf water status intermediate saline concentrations 120 and 240 mm resulted in 9 lower leaf relative water content rwc whereas the highest salt concentration 500 mm and drought reduced rwc by 17 fig 1 a compared to control values well watered with 0 mm nacl the leaf osmotic potential ψo was more negative with higher saline concentrations in the irrigation water fig 1b high salinity 500 mm and drought caused a statistically similar reduction in this parameter with values close to 2 mpa the decrease in ψo was due both to dehydration passive mechanism and osmotic adjustment active mechanism however the contribution of each mechanism to the decrease in ψo was different depending on the treatment table 1 plants subjected to drought treatment showed more dehydration reaching values of 0 70 mpa than plants exposed to saline treatment where only in the 500 mm treatment dehydration was detected in contrast in the plants subjected to saline treatment a greater capacity for osmotic adjustment was observed up to 0 97 mpa in the 500 mm treatment together with the increase in the osmotic adjustment capacity the proline concentration increased table 1 in fact there was a close correlation between proline concentration and osmotic adjustment among the treatments r2 0 86 p 0 01 the highest level of proline 10 8 nmol g 1 dw was observed in the most severe saline treatment 500 mm proline levels were 40 lower in plants subjected to 240 mm nacl as well as in plants subjected to drought compared to control values treatments of 60 and 120 mm nacl did not affect the concentration of this amino acid compared to the control conditions 3 2 gas exchange and related parameters as long as saline treatment became more severe the net photosynthetic rate a tended to decrease although the observed differences were not statistically significant at concentrations lower than 240 mm nacl fig 2 a nevertheless at the highest salt concentration 500 mm a was 65 lower than in controls on the other hand drought treatment resulted in 77 lower values for a the stomatal conductance gs decreased along the salinity gradient with the largest reduction of 83 seen with 500 mm nacl fig 2b the effect of drought treatment had the same magnitude as the highest saline concentration the salt treatments affected the intercellular co2 concentration ci it tended to decrease with more severe stress fig 2c on the other hand drought treatment resulted in a 25 increase in ci the carboxylation capacity expressed as a ci was 38 lower with 500 mm nacl and the reduction was even greater under drought conditions which resulted in a decline of 79 fig 2d because gs decreased proportionally more than a did the intrinsic water use efficiency a gs increased in all saline conditions with the highest value being at 500 mm where an increase of 100 was detected fig 2e the effect of drought on a gs was similar to the 240 mm saline treatment with an increase of 60 instantaneous transpiration rate e followed a similar pattern to gs it decreased with the salinity gradient with a maximum decrease of 77 at 500 mm fig 2f compared to control values the effect of the drought treatment was similar to the 500 mm saline treatment showing a decrease of 83 with respect to control values the electron transport rate etr did not change with salt concentration however the drought treatment reduced etr by 58 compared to control values fig 3 a the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a was not altered in any saline treatment additionally drought treatment caused a slight increase in chl a concentration although it was not statistically significant fig 3b as with chl a the concentration of chlorophyll b chl b was not altered by any saline treatment although at the highest salt concentration chl b was slightly higher although this increase was not statistically significant fig 3c drought caused a significant increase in chl b up to 60 compared to control values the increases in chl b under drought treatment caused a decrease in the chl a b ratio which was 22 compared to control values the effect of saline treatments and drought on carotenoid concentration was similar to chl b following the same pattern fig 3d that is an increase with drought treatment 19 was detected the ascorbate peroxidase apx activity was only altered at the highest salt concentration 58 higher than control values fig 4 a at the same time drought resulted in increased apx activity 43 similar to the values detected with the 500 mm salt treatment the salt treatments resulted in higher catalase cat activity which was 81 higher with 500 mm nacl than control fig 4b drought treatment resulted in similar values as the control and 60 mm nacl the lowest salt treatment measured in this experiment 3 3 biomass production cumulative transpiration and water use efficiency total biomass roots stems and leaves decreased with salt concentrations above 120 mm the effects of drought and the highest salt concentration 500 mm on biomass were similar showing a 44 48 reduction of the total dry weight compared to the control values analyzing organ by organ only the highest salinity concentrations 240 and 500 mm caused a negative effect on leaf biomass fig 5 a on the other hand the effect of drought was statistically comparable to the values obtained with concentrations of 500 mm reducing leaf biomass by 50 stem biomass was negatively affected both by high saline concentrations and drought showing declines of 43 500 mm nacl and 53 drought compared to control values in addition it was observed that plants subjected to a 240 mm saline stress had 28 less biomass compared to the previous lower concentrations finally the various concentrations of salinity had a similar effect on the root dry weight biomass as was detected for shoot biomass so the root shoot ratio remained constant in drought conditions the reduction in root biomass was 26 compared to control values thus the decrease in shoot biomass was greater than the decrease in root biomass so the root shoot biomass ratio increased comparing to control values the cumulative plant water transpiration decreased gradually with increases in salinity gradient reaching a final reduction of 42 at 500 mm fig 5b compared to control values the effect of the drought treatment was more severe resulting in a decrease of 63 compared to control finally when we calculated the water use efficiency wue of the plants we saw no differences in this parameter with various saline concentrations except for 120 mm nacl where an increase of 15 occurred fig 5c in contrast drought treatment increased wue by 55 compared to control values 3 4 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca analysis was performed to display the maximum amount of variation in a data profile within a few principal components and to understand relations between variables the plots depict standardized scores along the first two components the first two components explain 85 of the data variability fig 6 the pc1 62 of data variability separated treatment according to their severity one group consisted of control 60 and 120 mm nacl treatments and the other group of drought and 500 mm nacl treatments the variables most correlated positively with pc1 were some stress tolerance mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment proline concentration and apx activity on the other hand water relations photosynthetic processes and biomass production correlated negatively with pc1 the pc2 23 of data variability divided high salinity treatments and drought and it contained in one side stress tolerance mechanisms such as cat activity osmotic adjustment and a gs ratio and in the other side ci 4 discussion 4 1 leaf water status water availability is an important factor that can compromise leaf water status in the present study drought and salt stress reduced quinoa leaf rwc fig 1a jensen et al 2000 for drought and cocozza et al 2013 for different drought and salt stress treatments also found decreases in rwc in fact cocozza et al 2013 detected a close relationship between rwc and ψo we also detected decreases in ψo besides ψo decreased to similar values under 500 mm nacl and drought conditions fig 1b however the mechanisms that explain the reduction in ψo were different the response being dependent on the treatment under saline conditions the reduction in ψo was gradual and dependent on dehydration passive mechanism and osmotic adjustment active mechanism shabala et al 2012 and cocozza et al 2013 also measured osmotic adjustment capacity in quinoa however the relative contribution of both processes has never been measured before in quinoa with more severe saline treatment the importance of osmotic adjustment compared to dehydration increased a similar combination of these mechanisms acting together has been detected in other species such as barley pérez lópez et al 2009a when we analyzed the response of ψo in quinoa to drought we observed that even if the plant could undergo osmotic adjustment dehydration was more important than osmotic adjustment for the same value of leaf rwc dehydration usually implies loss of turgor so for the same rwc salt treated plants tolerate water stress better than drought treated plants as mentioned above although it occurred in different proportions under both stresses quinoa plants underwent osmotic adjustment it has been shown that 85 of osmotic adjustment in quinoa leaves is achieved by means of the accumulation of inorganic ions hariadi et al 2011 however the use of compatible solutes is necessary for osmotic adjustment in the cytosol adolf et al 2013 different components such as proline glycinebetaine polyamines and others have been ascribed to function as compatible solutes under drought and saline conditions flowers and colmer 2008 shabala et al 2012 we detected a strong correlation between osmotic adjustment and proline independently of the treatment also confirmed by pca analysis fig 6 so in this paper we focused on the relevance of proline in quinoa an increase in proline has been proposed as an adaptive response to stress singh et al 2000 lin et al 2002 however in this respect there is still much debate as some authors have associated it with a mechanism of tolerance to salinity and others in contrast to a negative consequence of salinity madan et al 1995 and silveira et al 2001 found that salinity tolerant cultivars had higher proline content than sensitive ones whereas lutts et al 1999 and lacerda et al 2003 reported higher concentrations of proline in sensitive cultivars in our case the proline levels were positively correlated with osmotic adjustment r2 0 86 p 0 01 these results would point to proline as a marker for tolerance because the treatments with a higher content of this amino acid were associated with higher osmotic adjustment capacity reinforcing this idea ruiz carrasco et al 2011 found higher proline concentration in quinoa accessions that were most salt tolerant than in the ones that were less salt tolerant 4 2 gas exchange and related parameters the availability of co2 is another important factor that can compromise biomass production as it is seen in fig 2b the gs tended to decrease with more severe saline treatment and we detected similar values for gs at 500 mm nacl and drought treatments the reductions in gs have been ascribed to limited water uptake and decreases in leaf water content adolf et al 2012 2013 amjad et al 2015 the fact that the values for gs fig 2b and rwc fig 1a were similar in 500 mm nacl and drought conditions support this idea together with decreases in gs we detected decreases in a fig 2a as also other authors did jacobsen et al 2009 gonzález et al 2011 geissler et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2015 talebnejad and sepaskhah 2016 several authors have described that when the water stress is mild the reduction in photosynthetic rate is due to stomatal limitations lawlor and tezara 2009 chaves et al 2009 at concentrations lower than 240 mm nacl the reduced gs limited the uptake and diffusion of co2 to the carboxylation site as reflected by the decline in ci fig 2c and ci ca ratio the maintenance of the carboxylation capacity expressed as a ci fig 2d supports the idea that until 240 mm nacl a is mostly limited by stomatal conductance however with 500 mm nacl and drought treatments the a ci decreased significantly indicating that limitations other than stomatal could also have occurred in these treatments razzaghi et al 2015 also found that under drought photosynthesis was affected via gs and photosynthetic limitations additionally the decreases were more marked in drought conditions than in 500 mm nacl conditions the lower a ci in drought conditions was mainly caused by an increase in ci fig 2c indicating high non stomatal limitations these limitations could depend on reductions in chlorophyll concentration and or inadequate functioning of the photosystems photochemical limitations and or reductions in the activity or synthesis of calvin cycle enzymes biochemical limitations lawlor and tezara 2009 chaves et al 2009 to examine possible photochemical limitations we studied etr fig 3a and the concentration of chlorophylls and carotenoids fig 3b d the etr only decreased under drought treatment which could explain the lower a ci values under drought conditions compared to 500 mm nacl conditions regarding pigments geissler et al 2015 stated that a reduction in chlorophyll concentration can cause a reduction in photosynthesis and thus explain part of the non stomatal limitations however based on the results of pigment analysis which tended to increase under 500 mm nacl and drought fig 3b d we assume that the decrease in photosynthesis was not caused by a lower pigment concentration generally drought and high saline treatments cause reductions in photosynthetic pigments gonzález et al 2011 amjad et al 2015 ruiz et al 2016 usually because their synthesis is inhibited or because the chlorophyllase activity is high majumdar et al 1991 loggini et al 1999 however we found the opposite trend when the saline or drought stress was severe these contradictory results could indicate that in our cultivar the increases in chlorophyll concentration detected under severe stress conditions could be due to a concentrating effect of chlorophylls because the biomass reduction was proportionally greater than the increase in chlorophyll degradation the increase in chlorophylls due to concentration effect under stress was also argued by hajiboland et al 2011 in tea plants continuing with the causes of the decrease in biomass production we need to consider the oxidative stress caused by saline and drought treatments whenever a decrease in net photosynthetic rate occurs an imbalance between photochemical and biochemical phases of the photosynthesis happens this occurs because the electron transport rate and consequent atp and nadph production exceeds its demand in the calvin cycle if the energy absorption does not decrease e g through a lower concentration of pigments which was not observed under 500 mm nacl and drought conditions in fact we detected a higher etr a ratio which corresponds to a higher risk of reactive oxygen species ros production these ros can cause oxidative stress if they are not properly removed ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat enzymes are important for scavenging these ros such as h2o2 we detected increases in apx activity with 500 mm nacl and drought treatments fig 4a it seems that with concentrations of 240 mm nacl or lower oxidative stress did not occur as a did not decrease but once the threshold value of 240 mm nacl was passed the effects of oxidative burst came into play as evidenced by the decrease in a increases in apx activity to reduce oxidative stress have also been detected in quinoa plants subjected to drought 600 mm mannitol and saline 200 400 mm nacl treatments panuccio et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 in the pca analysis apx clustered together with osmotic adjustment and proline fig 6 indicating that is functioning as a tolerance mechanism as osmotic adjustment did catalase is another enzyme that it is important for scavenging h2o2 produced in the peroxisome due to the activity of photorespiration with more severe saline treatment the cat activity increased progressively fig 4b indicating that rubisco carboxylation activity was reduced while the oxygenation activity was increased several authors have also observed increases in cat due to saline and drought treatments panuccio et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 regarding drought treatment because a was reduced we also expected to detect increases in cat activity however we detected similar values as control conditions this result implies that under drought conditions the lower etr decreased the quantity of electrons directed to photorespiration and co2 assimilation reactions considered as a whole since under drought conditions the proportion of energy used in photorespiration is presumably higher than in the control plants the absolute value of photorespiration could be similar to the one detected than in control plants even if etr is lower our results regarding cat activity maintenance seem to support this hypothesis 4 3 biomass production cumulative transpiration and water use efficiency quinoa is a highly salt tolerant plant razzaghi et al 2015 determined the ec50 for quinoa to be 25 ds m 1 although differences between cultivars have been detected ruiz carrasco et al 2011 adolf et al 2012 shabala et al 2012 ruiz et al 2016 for our cultivar real blanca when saline stress was moderate 60 120 mm nacl rwc and a values were similar to the control treatment and therefore biomass production was maintained however at 240 mm nacl and higher concentrations reductions in rwc and a started to occur which ultimately caused biomass reductions fig 5a in fact a greater decrease in rwc and a was related to a greater biomass reduction this is corroborated by the analysis of pca fig 6 where it seems that a rwc and total biomass were clustered together indicating correlation between these variables the decrease of biomass with saline conditions was proportional among organs so the root shoot ratio was kept constant independent of the salt concentration ruiz carrasco et al 2011 carried out an experiment with 4c quinoa genotypes and detected increases decreases and maintenance of the root shoot ratio indicating that the response of root shoot ratio is dependent on the genotype our results would demonstrate that under saline conditions in real blanca cv all the organs are important for surviving and tolerating salt stress so there is a need to allocate carbohydrates on one hand to the roots to continue the uptake of water and on the other hand to the shoots to maintain photosynthetic capacity and to accumulate salt into salt bladders as occurred in the high salinity treatments under drought conditions decreases in rwc and a were detected and we observed biomass reduction conversely to what happened under salinity this decrease was not uniform among the organs the root contribution increased compared to control conditions thus increasing the root shoot ratio this would indicate following the functional equilibrium theory brouwer 1962 that the root is the organ responsible for the uptake of the limiting nutrient in this case water and that real blanca cv allocates more photoassimilates to roots in order to try to increase water uptake moreover the decrease in biomass both under saline and drought conditions may be a positive characteristic because it reduces transpiration from the leaf surface and thus avoids excessive loss of water sun et al 2014 or excessive uptake of na and cl melgar et al 2008 we observed a reduction in the cumulative transpiration fig 5b this reduction was higher than the reduction in biomass in drought conditions fig 5a thus we detected an increase in wue fig 5c in this condition indicating that under reduced water conditions quinoa can use lower amounts of water per unit of biomass production under salt stress the wue had similar values compared to controls independently of nacl stress severity this result indicates that quinoa did not reduce water use but still maintained biomass production up to 120 mm nacl in the majority of the studies done in quinoa the salt or drought stress was imposed in flowering stage jensen et al 2000 bosque sanchez et al 2003 razzaghi et al 2012a b fischer et al 2013 riccardi et al 2014 geissler et al 2015 bascuñán godoy et al 2016 however in this study the stress was applied at vegetative stage and we still detected high ability to tolerate salt and drought stress this has important economic implications because it means that quinoa is also salt tolerant during the early stages of development which would permit farmers to water quinoa in the early stages of development with brackish water or even with high salinity water ince kaya and yazar 2016 in conclusion the highest salinity and drought treatments provoked similar growth responses but the mechanisms activated were different corroborated by pca analysis where drought and 500 mm nacl clustered in opposite sides of the pc2 under salinity the osmotic adjustment capacity was higher and the photosynthetic non stomatal limitations lower than under drought conditions the antioxidant metabolism also responded differently to the two stresses moreover under saline conditions the root shoot ratio was maintained whereas under drought conditions this ratio increased therefore photoassimilate allocation patterns differed between treatments besides in the lowest salt concentrations 60 120 mm nacl biomass production did not decrease which would permit farmers to water quinoa in the early stages of development with brackish water or even water with higher salinity under drought conditions the water use efficiency increased indicating that quinoa can be grown in water limited areas these findings emphasize the usefulness of real blanca as a promising cultivar that could be grown in water limited areas or on saline soils which are expected to increase with future environmental conditions acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the following grants university

saline stress 500 mm nacl highly similar reductions in growth and relative water content were observed however the strategies implemented by the plants in either stress condition and their relative importance were different under salt conditions responses related to osmotic adjustment were more prominent than under drought conditions where more dehydration was detected in addition despite a similar reduction in stomatal conductance in drought and saline conditions a greater non stomatal effect was observed in drought conditions which was demonstrated by the fact that the intercellular co2 concentration was increased moreover the antioxidant metabolism also responded differently to the two stresses photoassimilate allocation was also different between treatments the root shoot ratio remained constant independent of salt concentration whereas under drought conditions this ratio increased a similar trend between treatments was detected for water use efficiency which was maintained under salt stress and increased under drought conditions indicating that under reduced water conditions quinoa can use lower amounts of water per unit of biomass production these results suggest that c quinoa could be irrigated with brackish or even higher salinity water without severely affecting the growth during its early growth stage thereby making c quinoa a promising alternative crop for arid and semi arid regions keywords chenopodium quinoa drought growth photosynthesis salt stress water relations 1 introduction climate change is projected to cause a change in the amount of rainfall increasing in some areas and significantly decreasing in others additionally it is expected to increase extreme events of drought and flooding due to the changes in the distribution of rainfall patterns ipcc 2014 and these extreme events are more harmful to ecosystems than changes in the annual mean precipitation smith et al 2005 furthermore a rise in temperature is estimated therefore higher rates of water evaporation will occur expanding even more the drought areas these phenomena together with agricultural practices are also causing an increase in the salinization of crop soils ipcc 2014 worldwide more than 11 of irrigated land are estimated to be salt affected a figure that has been rising each year fao 2011a water availability is the most important factor in the development of plants boyer 1982 chaves et al 2003 therefore under drought and salt affected soils plants suffer water scarcity and in recent years decreases in crop productivity have been observed in addition to the negative impact of climate change causing decreases in productivity the world population is expected to increase by 52 by the end of the century un 2015 which will require an increase in agricultural production to cope with growing food demand tilman et al 2011 since 1991 the total agricultural area has remained constant o mara 2012 so the productivity of crops must increase to meet the growing demand the increase of drought and salt affected soil area together with the increase in world population force the research community to find varieties or species that are more tolerant to water limitation or salinity to maintain or increase agricultural production recently efforts have been made in order to improve water use efficiency wue of crops to reduce the water needed for agricultural practices araus 2004 morison et al 2008 medrano et al 2015 quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd is a halophyte that has been historically cultivated in various regions of south america due to its high adaptability to extreme environments bazile et al 2016 various authors have observed that quinoa is a highly salt tolerant crop jacobsen et al 2003 adolf et al 2013 razzaghi et al 2015 determined that the ec50 for quinoa is 25 ds m 1 and thus confirmed the classification of quinoa as a highly salt tolerant crop additionally quinoa possesses extraordinary nutritional characteristics such as high content of protein and essential amino acids miranda et al 2012 all these characteristics led fao to consider quinoa to be one of the crops that might contribute to global food security during the 21st century fao 2011b however despite the importance of this crop the studies done till know have analyzed the impact of drought and or salt stress on the physiological processes separately for example in water relations jensen et al 2000 cocozza et al 2013 in photosynthesis and related parameters gonzález et al 2011 geissler et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2015 talebnejad and sepaskhah 2016 in antioxidant metabolism panuccio et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 and in growth gonzález et al 2009 ruiz carrasco et al 2011 adolf et al 2012 ruiz et al 2016 but never before have been measured all the aforementioned parameters together in just one study besides the studies done comparing the response of quinoa plants to drought and to salt stress are scarce bosque sanchez et al 2003 pulvento et al 2012 cocozza et al 2013 riccardi et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 ince kaya and yazar 2016 thus the objectives of this study were to determine the different physiological mechanisms that are activated in response to drought and salt stress provoked growth reductions as well as to compare the response of quinoa to drought and salt stress highlighting the similarities and differences in the mechanisms that quinoa plants use to cope with the stresses through analysis of various physiological processes as a whole 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental design a bolivian cultivar of chenopodium quinoa willd cv real blanca was used in this study its origin is near the salar de uyuni and belongs to altiplano of the andes ecotype

combination of incandescent bulbs and warm white fluorescent lamps to minimize the effects of intrachamber environmental gradients plants were randomly repositioned within the chamber each week plants were watered with hoagland s solution arnon and hoagland 1940 three times per week maintaining at field capacity until the beginning of the stress treatment when the plants were 28 days old stress treatment was imposed for 14 days plants were divided into six groups five groups were watered every 2 days with 250 ml of hoagland s solution supplemented with a range of nacl concentrations 0 mm control 60 mm 120 mm 240 mm and 500 mm as salinity treatments and the sixth group was maintained without watering for 14 days as drought treatment 2 2 measurements of plant water parameters the leaf relative water content rwc was measured by gravimetric methods pérez lópez et al 2009a the leaf osmotic potential ψo was measured through the freezing point of the cellular sap by an osmometer osmomat

deionized water and stored in the dark at 4 c to avoid the loss of dry mass by respiration or the synthesis of new dry mass by photosynthesis dehydration was calculated as the difference between ψo

gs was calculated by dividing a by gs the actual photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii φpsii fm fs fm was determined by measuring steady state fluorescence fs and maximum fluorescence during a light saturating pulse of 8000 μmol m 2 s 1 fm following the procedures of genty et al 1989 the electron transport rate etr indicates the proportion of light used in photochemical processes of the total of energy that reaches the leaf per unit of time and surface ppfd and it was calculated according to the following formula etr φpsiixppfdx0 85 0 5 the absorption coefficient of the leaves was taken as 0 85 and the fraction of the excitation energy distributed to psii was taken as 0 5 genty et al 1989 chlorophylls and carotenoids were extracted in dimethylsulfoxide dmso as described by barnes et al 1992 the absorbance was measured at 665 649 and 480 nm to quantify the pigment concentration using the formulas proposed by wellburn 1994 2 4 antioxidant enzyme activities all operations were carried out at 0 4 c aliquots of leaf tissue 0 15 g fresh weight were ground in a cold mortar using extraction buffer 3 ml for catalase cat activity the extraction buffer consisted of 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 8 0 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta 0 2 triton x 100 v v 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride pmsf and 2 mm dithiotreitol dtt the homogenates were squeezed through two layers of muslin and centrifuged at 16 100g for 25 min cat activity was measured spectrophotometrically according to the method of pérez lópez et al 2009b by monitoring the disappearance of h2o2 at 240 nm for 6 min at 25 c the reaction mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 and 20 mm h2o2 and 5 μl of the supernatant was added to start the reaction until quantification h2o2 was kept in the dark for

centrifuged at 16 100g for 25 min apx activity was assayed by measuring the oxidation of ascorbate at 290 nm according to the method of pérez lópez et al 2010 the reaction mixture contained 50 mm 4 2 hydroxyethyl 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid hepes ph 6 6 and 0 8 mm ascorbate the oxidation rate of ascorbate measured as the decline in absorbance at 290 nm was estimated between 1 and 60 s after starting the reaction with the addition of 0 8 mm h2o2 10 μl and 10 μl of the supernatant corrections were made for the non enzymatic oxidation of ascorbate by h2o2 and for the oxidation of ascorbate in the absence of h2o2 the protein content was measured according to the method of bradford 1976 using bovine serum albumin as a standard 2 5 growth parameters at the end of the experiment day 42 the plants were harvested separated into leaves stems and roots and weighed to determine fresh weight fw after that the samples were dried at 80 c for 48 h and their dry weight dw was determined whole plant water use efficiency wue was calculated as the estimated dry weight accumulation per plant divided by the cumulative transpiration per plant pérez lópez et al 2014 2 6 statistical analysis results are reported as the mean standard error se of four independent replicates the se was directly calculated from crude data data analyses were performed using the spss 19 0 software package chicago il one way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate the main effects of the stress means were compared using duncan s multiple range test p values 0 05 were considered statistically significant prior to analyses we tested whether the assumptions of an anova homogeneity of variances and normally distributed residuals were achieved the homogeneity of variances for all the studied parameters was evaluated by levene s test and the distribution of the residuals was assessed by kolmogorov smirnov test when necessary transformation was applied before statistical analysis was performed principal component analysis pca was performed using r r core team 2016 all treatments and variables were included in the analysis 3 results 3 1 leaf water status intermediate saline concentrations 120 and 240 mm resulted in 9 lower leaf relative water content rwc whereas the highest salt concentration 500 mm and drought reduced rwc by 17 fig 1 a compared to control values well watered with 0 mm nacl the leaf osmotic potential ψo was more negative with higher saline concentrations in the irrigation water fig 1b high salinity 500 mm and drought caused a statistically similar reduction in this parameter with values close to 2 mpa the decrease in ψo was due both to dehydration passive mechanism and osmotic adjustment active mechanism however the contribution of each mechanism to the decrease in ψo was different depending on the treatment table 1 plants subjected to drought treatment showed more dehydration reaching values of 0 70 mpa than plants exposed to saline treatment where only in the 500 mm treatment dehydration was detected in contrast in the plants subjected to saline treatment a greater capacity for osmotic adjustment was observed up to 0 97 mpa in the 500 mm treatment together with the increase in the osmotic adjustment capacity the proline concentration increased table 1 in fact there was a close correlation between proline concentration and osmotic adjustment among the treatments r2 0 86 p 0 01 the highest level of proline 10 8 nmol g 1 dw was observed in the most severe saline treatment 500 mm proline levels were 40 lower in plants subjected to 240 mm nacl as well as in plants subjected to drought compared to control values treatments of 60 and 120 mm nacl did not affect the concentration of this amino acid compared to the control conditions 3 2 gas exchange and related parameters as long as saline treatment became more severe the net photosynthetic rate a tended to decrease although the observed differences were not statistically significant at concentrations lower than 240 mm nacl fig 2 a nevertheless at the highest salt concentration 500 mm a was 65 lower than in controls on the other hand drought treatment resulted in 77 lower values for a the stomatal conductance gs decreased along the salinity gradient with the largest reduction of 83 seen with 500 mm nacl fig 2b the effect of drought treatment had the same magnitude as the highest saline concentration the salt treatments affected the intercellular co2 concentration ci it tended to decrease with more severe stress fig 2c on the other hand drought treatment resulted in a 25 increase in ci the carboxylation capacity expressed as a ci was 38 lower with 500 mm nacl and the reduction was even greater under drought conditions which resulted in a decline of 79 fig 2d because gs decreased proportionally more than a did the intrinsic water use efficiency a gs increased in all saline conditions with the highest value being at 500 mm where an increase of 100 was detected fig 2e the effect of drought on a gs was similar to the 240 mm saline treatment with an increase of 60 instantaneous transpiration rate e followed a similar pattern to gs it decreased with the salinity gradient with a maximum decrease of 77 at 500 mm fig 2f compared to control values the effect of the drought treatment was similar to the 500 mm saline treatment showing a decrease of 83 with respect to control values the electron transport rate etr did not change with salt concentration however the drought treatment reduced etr by 58 compared to control values fig 3 a the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a was not altered in any saline treatment additionally drought treatment caused a slight increase in chl a concentration although it was not statistically significant fig 3b as with chl a the concentration of chlorophyll b chl b was not altered by any saline treatment although at the highest salt concentration chl b was slightly higher although this increase was not statistically significant fig 3c drought caused a significant increase in chl b up to 60 compared to control values the increases in chl b under drought treatment caused a decrease in the chl a b ratio which was 22 compared to control values the effect of saline treatments and drought on carotenoid concentration was similar to chl b following the same pattern fig 3d that is an increase with drought treatment 19 was detected the ascorbate peroxidase apx activity was only altered at the highest salt concentration 58 higher than control values fig 4 a at the same time drought resulted in increased apx activity 43 similar to the values detected with the 500 mm salt treatment the salt treatments resulted in higher catalase cat activity which was 81 higher with 500 mm nacl than control fig 4b drought treatment resulted in similar values as the control and 60 mm nacl the lowest salt treatment measured in this experiment 3 3 biomass production cumulative transpiration and water use efficiency total biomass roots stems and leaves decreased with salt concentrations above 120 mm the effects of drought and the highest salt concentration 500 mm on biomass were similar showing a 44 48 reduction of the total dry weight compared to the control values analyzing organ by organ only the highest salinity concentrations 240 and 500 mm caused a negative effect on leaf biomass fig 5 a on the other hand the effect of drought was statistically comparable to the values obtained with concentrations of 500 mm reducing leaf biomass by 50 stem biomass was negatively affected both by high saline concentrations and drought showing declines of 43 500 mm nacl and 53 drought compared to control values in addition it was observed that plants subjected to a 240 mm saline stress had 28 less biomass compared to the previous lower concentrations finally the various concentrations of salinity had a similar effect on the root dry weight biomass as was detected for shoot biomass so the root shoot ratio remained constant in drought conditions the reduction in root biomass was 26 compared to control values thus the decrease in shoot biomass was greater than the decrease in root biomass so the root shoot biomass ratio increased comparing to control values the cumulative plant water transpiration decreased gradually with increases in salinity gradient reaching a final reduction of 42 at 500 mm fig 5b compared to control values the effect of the drought treatment was more severe resulting in a decrease of 63 compared to control finally when we calculated the water use efficiency wue of the plants we saw no differences in this parameter with various saline concentrations except for 120 mm nacl where an increase of 15 occurred fig 5c in contrast drought treatment increased wue by 55 compared to control values 3 4 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca analysis was performed to display the maximum amount of variation in a data profile within a few principal components and to understand relations between variables the plots depict standardized scores along the first two components the first two components explain 85 of the data variability fig 6 the pc1 62 of data variability separated treatment according to their severity one group consisted of control 60 and 120 mm nacl treatments and the other group of drought and 500 mm nacl treatments the variables most correlated positively with pc1 were some stress tolerance mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment proline concentration and apx activity on the other hand water relations photosynthetic processes and biomass production correlated negatively with pc1 the pc2 23 of data variability divided high salinity treatments and drought and it contained in one side stress tolerance mechanisms such as cat activity osmotic adjustment and a gs ratio and in the other side ci 4 discussion 4 1 leaf water status water availability is an important factor that can compromise leaf water status in the present study drought and salt stress reduced quinoa leaf rwc fig 1a jensen et al 2000 for drought and cocozza et al 2013 for different drought and salt stress treatments also found decreases in rwc in fact cocozza et al 2013 detected a close relationship between rwc and ψo we also detected decreases in ψo besides ψo decreased to similar values under 500 mm nacl and drought conditions fig 1b however the mechanisms that explain the reduction in ψo were different the response being dependent on the treatment under saline conditions the reduction in ψo was gradual and dependent on dehydration passive mechanism and osmotic adjustment active mechanism shabala et al 2012 and cocozza et al 2013 also measured osmotic adjustment capacity in quinoa however the relative contribution of both processes has never been measured before in quinoa with more severe saline treatment the importance of osmotic adjustment compared to dehydration increased a similar combination of these mechanisms acting together has been detected in other species such as barley pérez lópez et al 2009a when we analyzed the response of ψo in quinoa to drought we observed that even if the plant could undergo osmotic adjustment dehydration was more important than osmotic adjustment for the same value of leaf rwc dehydration usually implies loss of turgor so for the same rwc salt treated plants tolerate water stress better than drought treated plants as mentioned above although it occurred in different proportions under both stresses quinoa plants underwent osmotic adjustment it has been shown that 85 of osmotic adjustment in quinoa leaves is achieved by means of the accumulation of inorganic ions hariadi et al 2011 however the use of compatible solutes is necessary for osmotic adjustment in the cytosol adolf et al 2013 different components such as proline glycinebetaine polyamines and others have been ascribed to function as compatible solutes under drought and saline conditions flowers and colmer 2008 shabala et al 2012 we detected a strong correlation between osmotic adjustment and proline independently of the treatment also confirmed by pca analysis fig 6 so in this paper we focused on the relevance of proline in quinoa an increase in proline has been proposed as an adaptive response to stress singh et al 2000 lin et al 2002 however in this respect there is still much debate as some authors have associated it with a mechanism of tolerance to salinity and others in contrast to a negative consequence of salinity madan et al 1995 and silveira et al 2001 found that salinity tolerant cultivars had higher proline content than sensitive ones whereas lutts et al 1999 and lacerda et al 2003 reported higher concentrations of proline in sensitive cultivars in our case the proline levels were positively correlated with osmotic adjustment r2 0 86 p 0 01 these results would point to proline as a marker for tolerance because the treatments with a higher content of this amino acid were associated with higher osmotic adjustment capacity reinforcing this idea ruiz carrasco et al 2011 found higher proline concentration in quinoa accessions that were most salt tolerant than in the ones that were less salt tolerant 4 2 gas exchange and related parameters the availability of co2 is another important factor that can compromise biomass production as it is seen in fig 2b the gs tended to decrease with more severe saline treatment and we detected similar values for gs at 500 mm nacl and drought treatments the reductions in gs have been ascribed to limited water uptake and decreases in leaf water content adolf et al 2012 2013 amjad et al 2015 the fact that the values for gs fig 2b and rwc fig 1a were similar in 500 mm nacl and drought conditions support this idea together with decreases in gs we detected decreases in a fig 2a as also other authors did jacobsen et al 2009 gonzález et al 2011 geissler et al 2015 razzaghi et al 2015 talebnejad and sepaskhah 2016 several authors have described that when the water stress is mild the reduction in photosynthetic rate is due to stomatal limitations lawlor and tezara 2009 chaves et al 2009 at concentrations lower than 240 mm nacl the reduced gs limited the uptake and diffusion of co2 to the carboxylation site as reflected by the decline in ci fig 2c and ci ca ratio the maintenance of the carboxylation capacity expressed as a ci fig 2d supports the idea that until 240 mm nacl a is mostly limited by stomatal conductance however with 500 mm nacl and drought treatments the a ci decreased significantly indicating that limitations other than stomatal could also have occurred in these treatments razzaghi et al 2015 also found that under drought photosynthesis was affected via gs and photosynthetic limitations additionally the decreases were more marked in drought conditions than in 500 mm nacl conditions the lower a ci in drought conditions was mainly caused by an increase in ci fig 2c indicating high non stomatal limitations these limitations could depend on reductions in chlorophyll concentration and or inadequate functioning of the photosystems photochemical limitations and or reductions in the activity or synthesis of calvin cycle enzymes biochemical limitations lawlor and tezara 2009 chaves et al 2009 to examine possible photochemical limitations we studied etr fig 3a and the concentration of chlorophylls and carotenoids fig 3b d the etr only decreased under drought treatment which could explain the lower a ci values under drought conditions compared to 500 mm nacl conditions regarding pigments geissler et al 2015 stated that a reduction in chlorophyll concentration can cause a reduction in photosynthesis and thus explain part of the non stomatal limitations however based on the results of pigment analysis which tended to increase under 500 mm nacl and drought fig 3b d we assume that the decrease in photosynthesis was not caused by a lower pigment concentration generally drought and high saline treatments cause reductions in photosynthetic pigments gonzález et al 2011 amjad et al 2015 ruiz et al 2016 usually because their synthesis is inhibited or because the chlorophyllase activity is high majumdar et al 1991 loggini et al 1999 however we found the opposite trend when the saline or drought stress was severe these contradictory results could indicate that in our cultivar the increases in chlorophyll concentration detected under severe stress conditions could be due to a concentrating effect of chlorophylls because the biomass reduction was proportionally greater than the increase in chlorophyll degradation the increase in chlorophylls due to concentration effect under stress was also argued by hajiboland et al 2011 in tea plants continuing with the causes of the decrease in biomass production we need to consider the oxidative stress caused by saline and drought treatments whenever a decrease in net photosynthetic rate occurs an imbalance between photochemical and biochemical phases of the photosynthesis happens this occurs because the electron transport rate and consequent atp and nadph production exceeds its demand in the calvin cycle if the energy absorption does not decrease e g through a lower concentration of pigments which was not observed under 500 mm nacl and drought conditions in fact we detected a higher etr a ratio which corresponds to a higher risk of reactive oxygen species ros production these ros can cause oxidative stress if they are not properly removed ascorbate peroxidase apx and catalase cat enzymes are important for scavenging these ros such as h2o2 we detected increases in apx activity with 500 mm nacl and drought treatments fig 4a it seems that with concentrations of 240 mm nacl or lower oxidative stress did not occur as a did not decrease but once the threshold value of 240 mm nacl was passed the effects of oxidative burst came into play as evidenced by the decrease in a increases in apx activity to reduce oxidative stress have also been detected in quinoa plants subjected to drought 600 mm mannitol and saline 200 400 mm nacl treatments panuccio et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 in the pca analysis apx clustered together with osmotic adjustment and proline fig 6 indicating that is functioning as a tolerance mechanism as osmotic adjustment did catalase is another enzyme that it is important for scavenging h2o2 produced in the peroxisome due to the activity of photorespiration with more severe saline treatment the cat activity increased progressively fig 4b indicating that rubisco carboxylation activity was reduced while the oxygenation activity was increased several authors have also observed increases in cat due to saline and drought treatments panuccio et al 2014 amjad et al 2015 regarding drought treatment because a was reduced we also expected to detect increases in cat activity however we detected similar values as control conditions this result implies that under drought conditions the lower etr decreased the quantity of electrons directed to photorespiration and co2 assimilation reactions considered as a whole since under drought conditions the proportion of energy used in photorespiration is presumably higher than in the control plants the absolute value of photorespiration could be similar to the one detected than in control plants even if etr is lower our results regarding cat activity maintenance seem to support this hypothesis 4 3 biomass production cumulative transpiration and water use efficiency quinoa is a highly salt tolerant plant razzaghi et al 2015 determined the ec50 for quinoa to be 25 ds m 1 although differences between cultivars have been detected ruiz carrasco et al 2011 adolf et al 2012 shabala et al 2012 ruiz et al 2016 for our cultivar real blanca when saline stress was moderate 60 120 mm nacl rwc and a values were similar to the control treatment and therefore biomass production was maintained however at 240 mm nacl and higher concentrations reductions in rwc and a started to occur which ultimately caused biomass reductions fig 5a in fact a greater decrease in rwc and a was related to a greater biomass reduction this is corroborated by the analysis of pca fig 6 where it seems that a rwc and total biomass were clustered together indicating correlation between these variables the decrease of biomass with saline conditions was proportional among organs so the root shoot ratio was kept constant independent of the salt concentration ruiz carrasco et al 2011 carried out an experiment with 4c quinoa genotypes and detected increases decreases and maintenance of the root shoot ratio indicating that the response of root shoot ratio is dependent on the genotype our results would demonstrate that under saline conditions in real blanca cv all the organs are important for surviving and tolerating salt stress so there is a need to allocate carbohydrates on one hand to the roots to continue the uptake of water and on the other hand to the shoots to maintain photosynthetic capacity and to accumulate salt into salt bladders as occurred in the high salinity treatments under drought conditions decreases in rwc and a were detected and we observed biomass reduction conversely to what happened under salinity this decrease was not uniform among the organs the root contribution increased compared to control conditions thus increasing the root shoot ratio this would indicate following the functional equilibrium theory brouwer 1962 that the root is the organ responsible for the uptake of the limiting nutrient in this case water and that real blanca cv allocates more photoassimilates to roots in order to try to increase water uptake moreover the decrease in biomass both under saline and drought conditions may be a positive characteristic because it reduces transpiration from the leaf surface and thus avoids excessive loss of water sun et al 2014 or excessive uptake of na and cl melgar et al 2008 we observed a reduction in the cumulative transpiration fig 5b this reduction was higher than the reduction in biomass in drought conditions fig 5a thus we detected an increase in wue fig 5c in this condition indicating that under reduced water conditions quinoa can use lower amounts of water per unit of biomass production under salt stress the wue had similar values compared to controls independently of nacl stress severity this result indicates that quinoa did not reduce water use but still maintained biomass production up to 120 mm nacl in the majority of the studies done in quinoa the salt or drought stress was imposed in flowering stage jensen et al 2000 bosque sanchez et al 2003 razzaghi et al 2012a b fischer et al 2013 riccardi et al 2014 geissler et al 2015 bascuñán godoy et al 2016 however in this study the stress was applied at vegetative stage and we still detected high ability to tolerate salt and drought stress this has important economic implications because it means that quinoa is also salt tolerant during the early stages of development which would permit farmers to water quinoa in the early stages of development with brackish water or even with high salinity water ince kaya and yazar 2016 in conclusion the highest salinity and drought treatments provoked similar growth responses but the mechanisms activated were different corroborated by pca analysis where drought and 500 mm nacl clustered in opposite sides of the pc2 under salinity the osmotic adjustment capacity was higher and the photosynthetic non stomatal limitations lower than under drought conditions the antioxidant metabolism also responded differently to the two stresses moreover under saline conditions the root shoot ratio was maintained whereas under drought conditions this ratio increased therefore photoassimilate allocation patterns differed between treatments besides in the lowest salt concentrations 60 120 mm nacl biomass production did not decrease which would permit farmers to water quinoa in the early stages of development with brackish water or even water with higher salinity under drought conditions the water use efficiency increased indicating that quinoa can be grown in water limited areas these findings emphasize the usefulness of real blanca as a promising cultivar that could be grown in water limited areas or on saline soils which are expected to increase with future environmental conditions acknowledgements this research was financially supported by the following grants university

resistance cwsi t1 and the other theoretical model used seasonal average aerodynamic resistance cwsi t2 considering the uncertainty of crop coefficient and sap flow measurement cwsi t2 and cwsi e models gave reasonable overall estimates of water stress the average root mean square deviation at each growth stage from each model ranged from 0 16 to 0 33 cwsi t2 and the cwsi e provided relatively accurate prediction of crop stress both between growth stages and irrigation events however cwsi t1 did not accurately predict water stress between growth stages or between irrigation events by including climate factors crop water stress estimated by cwsi t2 showed less variation and uncertainty than cwsi e the uncertainty of both cwsi t2 and cwsi e decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd and cwsi e show larger crop water stress prediction uncertainty the intercept of non water stress baseline was the main source of the uncertainty for cwsi e and cwsi t2 considering both uncertainty and stability we recommend cwsi t2 model i e seasonal average aerodynamic resistance for maize water stress assessment keywords empirical cwsi theoretical cwsi aerodynamic resistance water stress deficit irrigation 1 introduction agriculture is a major water user in semi arid regions and utilizing agricultural water efficiently is critical to sustain and maximize the benefits of limited irrigation water water resources for agriculture have been reduced due to drought associated with climate change non sustainable use of groundwater and increased competition from municipal environmental and industrial water needs combined with the increasing global population there is a need to achieve maximum production per unit of applied irrigation water regulated deficit irrigation defined as a regime that purposely reduce applied irrigation water in specific crop growing stages chalmers et al 1981 may be a way to achieve higher water productivity i e crop produced per unit water consumed however a comprehensive knowledge of crop response and crop water use under water stress is needed to achieve the best balance between irrigation water use and crop yield geerts and raes 2009 therefore the development of tools that enable accurate estimation of crop water stress or crop water use is critical for deficit irrigation management the crop water stress index cwsi has been recognized as an indicator of plant water status based on canopy temperature ambient air temperature and relative humidity two methods for calculating cwsi have been widely used and evaluated an empirical method cwsi e developed by idso et al 1981 and a theoretical method cwsi t1 developed by jackson et al 1981 the empirical method establishes a relationship between canopy to air temperature difference and vapor pressure deficit vpd the theoretical method uses surface energy balance equation whilst accounting for variation in climate and calculates the divergence between the upper and lower boundaries of canopy to air temperature difference cwsi calculated from both methods have shown good relationships with other crop water stress indicators such as soil water content dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2012 taghvaeian et al 2014a wang et al 2005 and leaf water potential ballester et al 2013 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 cwsi from both methods have also been used for irrigation scheduling colaizzi et al 2012 emekli et al 2007 nielsen 1990 o shaughnessy et al 2010 yazar et al 1999 however there remain limitations of both methods that require careful consideration the empirical method has been criticized for two reasons 1 sensitivity of the empirical non water stress baseline to the changes of climate variables such as radiation and wind speed gonzalez dugo et al 2014 jackson et al 1988 payero and irmak 2006 for example the empirical baseline may change yearly for the same crop in the same field horst et al 1989 has reported significant differences p 0 01 between the cwsi baseline equations in 1986 and 1987 for common bermuda grass buffalo grass and tall fescue a similar result has been reported for mandarin and orange gonzalez dugo et al 2014 2 cwsi calculated by the empirical method showed large fluctuations especially under low vpd condition or with significant variation in climate stockle and dugas 1992 compared to the empirical method the advantage of cwsi t1 is its stability under various climate conditions jackson et al 1988 yuan et al 2004 the shortcoming of cwsi t1 is that it may not give significantly different values for well watered and stressed crops which may attribute to the incorrect estimation of aerodynamic resistance ra agam et al 2013 stockle and dugas 1992 jackson et al 1988 suggested that a seasonal average aerodynamic resistance should be applied cwsi t2 there are several successful applications of theoretical approach by calculating a seasonal average aerodynamic resistance clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 therefore it is important to know the accuracy and consistency of these three models for cwsi calculation before any application as mentioned previously many studies have proven good relationships between cwsi and measured water stress indicators however few had used sap flow measurement to assess the accuracy and consistency of cwsi models sap flow methodology which provides a measurement of whole plant transpiration has been widely used to determine crop coefficient and evaluate simulated crop water transpiration and crop water stress by various models cammalleri et al 2013 chabot et al 2002 jara and stockle 1999 zhao et al 2015 the transpiration measurement by sap flow would have 5 to 10 of actual transpiration error which have been obtained by comparing with other measurements green et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 the performance of cwsi models can be evaluated by comparing model outputs with water stress determined from sap flow measurement the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the performance of cwsi among one empirical model and two theoretical models with sap flow measurement 2 evaluate the uncertainty among the three cwsi models 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 study site and management field data were collected from maize during the 2015 growing season at usda ars limited irrigation research farm lirf in greeley colorado usa 40 26 57 n 104 38 12 w elevation 1427 m the alluvial soils of the study field were predominantly sandy and fine sandy loam of olney and otero series the maize zea mays l was planted on jun 1 2015 with planting density around 85 000 plants ha 1 and the dates when maize reached the late vegetative stage v8 beginning of reproductive stage r1 beginning of maturation stage r3 and harvest were jul 9 aug 2 aug 24 and nov 2 2015 respectively final plant populations varied from 77 000 to 82 000 plants ha 1 deficit irrigation was regulated by withholding during the late vegetative growth stage v8 to r1 and or the maturation growth stage r3 to r6 but applying water during the sensitive reproductive r1 to r3 and early vegetative stages planting to v8 a total of 12 irrigation treatments were arranged in a randomized block design consisting of four blocks with each treatment replicated once in each block each treatment plot had 12 rows at 0 76 m spacing 9 m wide by 43 m long all measurements were taken from the middle four rows to reduce border effects treatments are named for the target percent of maximum non stressed crop et evapotranspiration during late vegetative and maturation growth stages respectively e g a 40 80 treatment would target 40 of maximum et during the vegetative stage and 80 of maximum et during the maturation stages sap flow measurements were taken in 100 100 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 treatments so only these four treatments were included in this study and the actual irrigation amounts that were achieved for the four treatments are shown in table 1

solar radiation was determined following the procedure in allen et al 1998 and jensen and allen 2016 the crop phenology developments as well as basic climate factors in each stage were shown in table 2 2 1 2 canopy ground cover yield and temperature measurements a canon eos 50d dslr camera canon inc tokyo japan 2 2 mention of trade names or commercial products in this publication is solely for the purpose of providing specific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the u s department of agriculture was used to measure canopy ground cover the camera was attached to a boom that was mounted on a high clearance tractor so that the camera was elevated about 7 m above the ground nadir view rgb images were taken near solar noon twice a week from each treatment plot the camera field of view encompassed 4 rows 4 m all images were processed in python 3 5 python software foundation wilmington de usa to separate green plant canopy from background soil surface residue and senesced leaves the canopy ground cover for each treatment during the crop growing season is shown in fig 1 grain yield was measured by hand harvesting the ears from the center sampling area of the center four rows of each plot the sampling area was about 69 m2 grain was threshed with a stationary thresher wintersteiger classic st wintersteiger ag ried austria weighed and subsampled for moisture content determination grain moisture content at harvest was measured with a dickey john gac500 xt moisture tester dickey john corp aubern ill usa infrared thermal radiometers irt model si 121 apogee instruments inc logan utah usa were used to monitor continuous canopy temperature of maize the view angle of irt was 36 field of view with 0 2 c accuracy over the temperature range of 10 to 65 c the irts were attached to telescoping posts and angled 23 below horizon and 45 from north looking northeast to ensure the field of view included primarily crop canopy the viewing area of the irts was about 13 35 m2 the irts were kept at a height of 0 8 m above the top of canopy throughout the growing season adjusted twice per week during vegetative growth an irt sensor was installed for each plot on jul 13 2015 and a total of four irts for each treatment irt measurements in 100 100 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 treatments from jul 25 to sept 05 2015 were used to determine crop water stress during this period crop coverage measured from nadir view in all treatments were larger than 0 35 fig 1 and the crop coverage in the field view of irts was larger than 0 8 all irt measurements were recorded by data loggers model cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan utah usa every 5 s and averaged on hourly intervals measured values were corrected for the effect of sensor body temperature using calibration equations provided by the manufacturer 2 1 3 sap flow measurement whole plant transpiration was measured on two plants per plot in 100 100 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 treatments with stem heat balance sap flow exo sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa sakuratani 1981 thus a total of eight sensors was installed for each treatment accuracy of these sensors was verified in 2015 in a greenhouse study with maize in 15l pots placed on logging scales van bavel m young j and comas l 2017 application report www dynamax com data were collected from jul 28 to sept 20 2015 sapip data loggers dynamax inc houston tx usa were placed approximately 12 m from the end of the plot and sensors were installed on plants randomly chosen in the same row within 3 m from the loggers dynamax inc houston tx usa the bottom 2 3 leaves and leaf sheaths were removed at least a day prior to installing gages sensors were then installed on stem internodes that were covered with plastic wrap to prevent moisture from stems from entering the sensors a thin film of silicon was applied to facilitate thermal exchange between the stems and sensors sensors were wrapped from the inside to the exterior with stretchable and wicking velcro waterproof fabric sealed with electrical tape at the top insulating foam and insulated foil bubble wrap secured with zip ties and sealed with electrical tape at the top the voltage was set to 4 2 4 3 v dc and resulted in power ranging from 0 20 to 0 27 w depending on the size of sensor the temperature applied ranged from 0 5 to 4 c above ambient and there was no stem damage from heat data were monitored for abnormalities during measurements and stems inspected carefully for aberrations upon removal of the sensors the average value of the thermopile radial heat loss factor ksh is established when there is low to zero flow and is required to solve the energy balance of the system average ksh was computed during 3 30 5 30 h mst mountain standard time and set to the daily ksh at 5 30 h since the formula for calculating ksh depends on zero sap flow heat flux there may be a small error in sap flow calculations if there is transpiration during the period used for ksh computation we estimate that maximum transpiration loss during this period may be 4 g hr based on the greenhouse study of fully watered maize grown in 15l pots that were placed on logging scales and sealed from the top of the pot to the plant stem with plastic garbage data not shown if total weight loss from the pots during this period was from transpiration rather than evaporation total error from the ksh was about 1 6 and not substantial for this application sensor outputs were collected every 1 min and recorded as 15 min means from the end of july through september sap flow was determined as the mass of water transpired by the plant per unit time g h 1 plant 1 and expressed per ground area by dividing by the planting density 2 2 crop water stress index cwsi cwsi is defined in eq 1 by the upper tc ta u and lower boundary tc ta l of temperature difference between air and canopy where tc ta u and tc ta l representing a non transpiring and full transpiring conditions respectively idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 1 c w s i t c t a c t c t a l t c t a u t c t a l where tc ta c is the difference between canopy temperature tc c and air temperature ta c for the current condition when the crop is fully watered cwsi value is close to 0 whereas for the crop under severe water stress condition cwsi value is close to 1 the difference between the following cwsi models is the procedure to determine the upper tc ta u and lower tc ta l boundaries 2 2 1 empirical model cwsi e according to idso et al 1981 the lower and upper boundary of tc ta for various crops under various climatic conditions could be defined as 2 t c t a l a b v p d 3 t c t a u a b v p g where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere assuming leaf temperature air temperature intercept a and slope b are the linear regression parameters of tc ta l on vpd vpg is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature ta and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus a in eq 2 ta a 2 2 2 theoretical model 1 cwsi t1 the theoretical development of cwsi is based on surface energy balance equation which includes the following assumptions 1 aerodynamic resistance ra adequately represents the resistance to turbulent transport of heat water vapor and momentum jackson et al 1981 jackson et al 1988 then the temperature difference between canopy and air could be defined as 4 t c t a r a ρ c p γ 1 r c r a δ γ 1 r c r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c r a where cp is the heat capacity of air j kg 1 c tc is the temperature of canopy ta is the air temperature е is the air saturated vapor pressure at tc pa e is the air vapor pressure pa γ is the psychrometric constant pa c 1 ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 rc is the canopy resistance s m 1 δ is the change slope of saturation vapor pressure with temperature pa c 1 rn is the net radiation j m 2 s 1 g is heat flux consumed by soil j m 2 s 1 and was assumed around 10 of rn then the upper boundary of tc ta is calculated when rc 5 t c t a u r a ρ c p r n g and the lower boundary of tc ta is calculated when rc rcp 6 t c t a l r a ρ c p γ 1 r c p r a δ γ 1 r c p r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c p r a where rcp is the canopy resistance under full transpiration condition according to jackson et al 1981 jackson et al 1988 rcp was defined as 0 for non water stress condition and ra is calculated by 7 r a 4 72 l n z d z 0 2 1 0 54 u where z is the reference height m d is the displacement height m d 0 63 h h is the height of crop zo is the roughness length m zo 0 13 h and u is the wind speed at height z m s 1 2 2 3 theoretical model 2 cwsi t2 several studies have found that the theoretical approach performed well when given a mean ra and rcp during the study period clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 jackson et al 1988 suggested that seasonal average r a and rcp were reasonable thus we calculated the upper and lower boundary of tc ta using seasonal average r a and rcp instead of using eq 7 for ra and 0 for rcp in cwsi t1 approach they were estimated by o toole and real 1986 8 r a ρ c p a r n b δ 1 b 9 r c p r a δ 1 b γ 1 where r n is the seasonal average net radiation δ is the seasonal average slope of saturated vapor pressure temperature relationship pa c 1 which is determined by seasonal average temperature a and b are parameters from eq 2 the r a and r c p were calculated based on non water stress condition the r c p was only used in non water stress condition in eq 6 since ra was not influenced by crop water stress the r a determined was used in both eqs 5 6 2 3 water stress calculation 2 3 1 cwsi calculated by three models irt measurements and vpd from 100 100 treatment in eleven sunny days after an irrigation event were used to establish a non water stress baseline for maize in 2015 the canopy temperature air temperature and vpd at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst from each selected day were used to estimate the non water stress baseline for eq 2 idso et al 1981 taghvaeian et al 2014b after determining the linear coefficients in eq 2 hourly cwsi e was calculated based on eqs 1 3 at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst daily cwsi e was obtained as an averaged cwsi e value over these four hours the net radiation and air temperature at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst from each selected day were used to calculate the seasonal average net radiation and temperature taken together with the slope and intercept of the non water stress baseline eq 2 the seasonal average aerodynamic resistance and potential canopy resistance was calculated by eqs 8 9 a more detailed calculation procedure for other climate parameters such as γ δ and cp in cwsi t1 and cwsi t2 could be found in allen et al 1998 hourly cwsi at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst was calculated by three models from jul 13 to sept 20 2015 daily cwsi was then calculated by averaging the cwsi values over these four hours for each day 2 3 2 water stress from sap flow measurement sap flow at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst in each day from jul 28 to sept 05 2015 was used to calculate a stress index ks sap assuming the crop transpiration in 100 100 could represent the full transpiration condition the measured crop water stress for deficit irrigation treatment was defined as 10 k s s a p 1 s a p i s a p 1 where sap1 is the hourly sap flow measurement in 100 100 treatment in mm h 1 and sapi is the hourly measured transpiration in deficit treatment in mm h 1 2 4 model comparison the range of both ks sap and cwsi are analogous such that cwsi 0 indicates a well watered crop just as in a well watered crop sapi sap1 thus ks sap 0 eq 10 likewise if transpiration is completely stopped e g sapi 0 then ks sap 1 and cwsi would also be maximized at 1 the differences between crop water stress estimated by the three models and sap flow measurements were evaluated by two statistical indicators namely the mean bias difference mbd and the root mean square deviation rmsd nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1982 12 m b d 1 n i n k s s a p c w s i 13 r m s d 1 n i n k s s a p c w s i 2 where ks sap represents the water stress from sap flow measurement cwsi is the crop water stress index and n is the number of observations all the calculations and statistical analysis have been done in r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria and version 3 3 1 3 results 3 1 parameters of non water stress baseline for cwsi non water stress baseline for maize in greeley co in 2015 is shown in fig 2 several baseline parameters obtained by previous studies for maize are listed in table 3 the baseline in this study was similar to those obtained by previous studies in greeley co however there are still some differences in the regression coefficients especially for the intercept a even when compared with the result obtained in the same field dejonge et al 2015 in general the slope b ranged from 2 0 to 1 8 while the intercept a ranged from 2 3 to 3 4 for maize in greely co this variation may have been caused by other factors such as wind speed crop growth stages and irt view angles etc other studies have also reported changes in baseline parameters between years or between seasons for example gonzalez dugo et al 2014 reported that the intercept varied from 3 3 to 3 9 during a three year experiment on citrus when applying an empirical approach for irrigation management the baseline was assumed unchanged for the same crop at a specific site however due to the observed variations in baseline parameters for maize in the same study area among years it is necessary to investigate the uncertainty of cwsi caused by the variations of baseline parameters the seasonal average r a andd r c p were 13 23 s m 1 and 42 42 s m 1 respectively jackson et al 1981 stated that it was reasonable to use a constant r a around 6 10 s m 1 o toole and real 1986 used the same method and obtained 14 9 s m 1 and 56 3 s m 1 for r a and r c p respectively tolk 1992 reported r c p for corn was ranging from 30 110 s m 1 during the growing season thus the seasonal average r a and r c p obtained for cwsi t2 in this study were reasonable 3 2 daily comparison of the calculated cwsi with sap flow measurement fig 3 shows the daily cwsi values determined by three models and sap flow measurements for four irrigation treatments in the case of 100 100 the well watered crop the values of cwsi e and cwsi t2 were relatively stable with a range of 0 0 2 while cwsi t1 showed an increasing trend and was larger than 0 2 after aug 20 2015 in the case of deficit irrigation treatments 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 cwsi e and cwsi t2 showed crop water stress in the vegetative stage then gradually decreased when full irrigation was resumed in the reproductive stage and then increased again when stress was applied in the maturation stage cwsi t1 underestimated the water stress in the vegetative stage but showed water stress in both reproductive and maturation stage cwsi e and cwsi t2 gave more reasonable water stress estimation compared with cwsi t1 the error bar in fig 3 was the standard deviation of eight replicates of sap flow measurements in each treatment the large standard deviation may be caused due to the following reasons 1 sap flow measurement itself has 5 10 uncertainties green et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 2 although the majority of soil texture in the experiment field is sandy and fine sandy loam certain plots also include other soil textures such as nunn clay loam and otero sandy loam trout and bausch 2017 the difference in soil texture would lead to different response of crop to available soil water however the sap measurement is still able to show the variation of crop water stress during the growing season and among different irrigation treatments examining stress indication over the entire measurement period cwsi t2 and cwsi e gave better performance than cwsi t1 table 4 cwsi t2 and cwsi e showed a close agreement with water stress measurement from sap flow in 40 40 and 40 80 and slightly overestimated crop water stress in 65 65 negative mbd in table 4 and fig 3 cwsi t1 overestimated crop water stress in the reproductive and maturation stages and extremely underestimated crop water stress in the vegetative stage for 40 40 overall crop water stress estimated by cwsi t2 and cwsi e showed a reasonable agreement with sap flow measurement while cwsi t1 failed to give reasonable estimation in the vegetative stage 3 3 growth stage comparison of three cwsi models crop water stress index by each model was also compared against water stress determined by sap flow measurements across the season in different growth stages table 5 in the vegetative stage the values of cwsi t1 were significantly underestimated as compared with the other methods especially for 40 40 and 40 80 both with 40 of et cwsi t2 and cwsi e reflected the increased water stress between treatments due to deficit irrigation in this period when crops went into the reproductive stage full irrigation was resumed and ks sap values ranged 0 0 19 the values of cwsi t2 and cwsi e in this period decreased compared to the values in the vegetative stage and closed to the ks sap values however the values of cwsi t1 showed a slight increase and were larger than 0 2 when crops reached the maturation stage the deficit irrigation was resumed in the 65 65 and 40 40 while the 100 100 and 40 80 received full and nearly full irrigation respectively thus cwsis from all three models and sap flow were increased in 65 65 and 40 40 and the values of cwsi e and cwsi t2 did not change in 100 100 and 80 80 due to similar water conditions in the reproductive stage the values of cwsi t1 in 100 100 increased which is against the observed seasonal crop water stress trend from sap flow measurement and irrigation management the values of cwsi e and cwsi t2 in 40 80 in the maturation stage were lower than those in the vegetative stage which is consistent with the observed crop water stress trend from sap flow measurement and irrigation management again the value of cwsi t1 in 40 80 in the maturation stage was even higher than the value in the vegetative period and the value of cwsi t1 shown an increasing trend from vegetative to maturation stage in all treatments which indicated that cwsi t1 did not respond to stress throughout the growing season thus only cwsi e and cwsi t2 well described crop water stress difference between treatments and growth stages 3 4 relationship between the averaged crop water stress indexes and yield all cwsis show significantly negative trends with the yield fig 4 all cwsis well reflected the decreasing of yield caused by increasing of crop water stress however the yield decreasing trend slope of each yield cwsi linear relationship is quite different the slopes of cwsi e and cwsi t2 are similar and close to the slope of ks sap while the slope of cwsi t1 is the highest and differs from ks sap the high slope of cwsi t1 is mainly due to the overestimation of crop water stress in the maturation period for 100 100 and 40 80 table 5 and fig 4 thus cwsi e and cwsi t2 could better describe the decreasing of yield caused by water stress than cwsi t1 3 5 uncertainty of cwsi e and cwsi t2 cwsi difference of cwsi e model caused by the different parameters of the non stressed baseline is shown in fig 5 a and b the intercept and slope parameters a and b are within the ranges reported in the literature table 3 fig 2 compared to intercept a the uncertainty range of slope b was small for maize in greeley co so the impact of slope b on cwsi was also quite small furthermore intercept a appeared to have a greater effect on cwsi than did slope b per magnitude change i e δa 0 2 vs δb 0 2 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 also reported similar slope coefficients but large differences in intercept coefficients across years over a three year experiment thus it is important to define intercept a carefully for cwsi e model similarly cwsi difference from cwsi t2 decreased with increasing vpd and intercept a also had more influence on cwsi than slope b did fig 5c d moreover cwsi difference from cwsi t2 model was smaller than cwsi e when given same parameter changes 4 discussion 4 1 cwsi t1 vs cwsi t2 from daily and seasonal analysis of cwsi t1 we found that cwsi t1 showed the water stress difference between treatments and was also relative stable due to the inclusion of additional climate factors in its calculation figs 3 4 and table 4 this result is well supported by previous research ben gal et al 2009 horst et al 1989 yuan et al 2004 however the comparison to sap flow data revealed that cwsi t1 underestimated crop water stress for deficit irrigated maize during the vegetative period table 4 agam et al 2013 also reported that the underestimation of crop water stress for full irrigated olive trees by cwsi t1 crop water stress estimated by cwsi t1 showed an increasing trend for all treatments table 4 and failed to adequately respond to irrigation events and describe water stress difference between growth stages fig 3 tables 4 and 5 previous research suggests that the uncertainty of the aerodynamic resistance may influence the result of cwsi t1 but the mechanism is still unknown agam et al 2013 barbosa da silva and ramana rao 2005 stockle and dugas 1992 we observed that with increasing crop height the aerodynamic resistance decreased fig 6 a the consequence of this decrease in aerodynamic resistance resulted in a smaller upper limit of tc ta eq 5 the difference between the upper and lower limits of cwsi t1 also decreased so the estimated crop water stress exhibited an increasing trend eq 1 from fig 6b we also noticed the large difference between the upper and lower limits of cwsi t1 in the vegetative period which is why crop water stress for 40 40 and 40 80 were underestimated during this period correct estimation of aerodynamic resistance is critical to provide a reasonable assessment of crop water stress using the cwsi t1 method which would require accurate measurements crop height wind speed air temperature etc tolk et al 1995 cwsi t2 method can be a good alternative to cwsi t1 because it was better aligned with water stress estimates from sap flow and well described water stress between treatments and growth stages at the same time cwsi t2 and cwsi e could better describe the yield reduction due to crop water stress in a practical view the use of a seasonal constant for the aerodynamic resistance parameter is acceptable for theoretical approaches clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 4 2 cwsi e vs cwsi t2 although the results indicated that the cwsi e model was closely aligned with ks sap the limitation of the cwsi e method is quite significant in the uncertainty study section 3 5 we assumed the parameters for cwsi e and cwsi t2 were not changed except for a b and vpd it supposed to be an efficient way to examine the sensitivity of model parameters and uncertainty of the model cwsi e was more sensitive to the change of baseline parameter than cwsi t2 was the reason for this may be that cwsi t2 model incorporates more climate factors the large uncertainty caused by changing parameter a and b in low vpd region fig 5 may indicate that both cwsi t2 and cwsi e should not be applied under low vpd condition as reported by stockle and dugas 1992 in addition to the uncertainty in cwsi caused by small changes in the non stressed baseline coefficients fig 5 changing climate factors such as rn δ ra rc and cp are also associated with significant variation in cwsi e stockle and dugas 1992 theoretically the influence of these climate factors on cwsi e could be determined by comparing it with the output from cwsi t2 model although these two models share the same non water stress baseline cwsi t2 took these climate variables into account the difference between cwsi e and cwsi t2 was quite small for 100 100 which experienced minimal water stress nevertheless cwsi e showed some fluctuations under deficit irrigation and large differences between cwsi e and cwsi t2 were found in some days e g aug 23 cwsi e also yielded cwsi values larger than 1 on july 28 for 40 80 although the uncertainties remain by using seasonal estimates of ra and rcp determined from non water stress baseline incorporating climate factors in the calculation of the upper and lower boundary limits i e cwsi t2 are likely to improve the stability of water stress estimation clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 cwsi t2 was also more closely aligned with ks sap than cwsi e in all four treatments and thus we recommend cwsi t2 over cwsi e model 5 conclusions considering the uncertainty of crop stress determined from sap flow measurement cwsi e and cwsi t2 models gave reasonable water stress estimates however crop water stress from cwsi t1 exhibited a constant increasing trend through growing season and did not adequately predict changes in crop water status resulting from neither irrigation events nor growth stage differences we therefore suggest that cwsi t1 may not be a reliable method for determining stress in maize although cwsi t1 could reflect the crop water status between treatments assuming a seasonal average aerodynamic resistance the cwsi t2 model performed better than the empirical method both cwsi t2 and cwsi e could well predict crop water stress between irrigation events as well as across growth stages by including the climate factors crop water stress estimated from cwsi t2 exhibited better alignment with sap flow than did cwsi e the uncertainty of both cwsi t2 and cwsi e decreased with the increasing of vpd and the intercept of non water stress baseline was the main source of error the uncertainty from cwsi t2 was less than that from cwsi e we recommend cwsi t2 model for assessing crop water stress although it requires more

11491,both empirical and theoretical models have been widely used to calculate a crop water stress index cwsi a metric often used to describe crop water status the purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy limitation and uncertainty of an empirical cwsi e and two theoretical models compared with sap flow measurement in maize one theoretical model used a calculated aerodynamic resistance cwsi t1 and the other theoretical model used seasonal average aerodynamic resistance cwsi t2 considering the uncertainty of crop coefficient and sap flow measurement cwsi t2 and cwsi e models gave reasonable overall estimates of water stress the average root mean square deviation at each growth stage from each model ranged from 0 16 to 0 33 cwsi t2 and the cwsi e provided relatively accurate prediction of crop stress both between growth stages and irrigation events however cwsi t1 did not accurately predict water stress between growth stages or between irrigation events by including climate factors crop water stress estimated by cwsi t2 showed less variation and uncertainty than cwsi e the uncertainty of both cwsi t2 and cwsi e decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd and cwsi e show larger crop water stress prediction uncertainty the intercept of non water stress baseline was the main source of the uncertainty for cwsi e and cwsi t2 considering both uncertainty and stability we recommend cwsi t2 model i e seasonal average aerodynamic resistance for maize water stress assessment keywords empirical cwsi theoretical cwsi aerodynamic resistance water stress deficit irrigation 1 introduction agriculture is a major water user in semi arid regions and utilizing agricultural water efficiently is critical to sustain and maximize the benefits of limited irrigation water water resources for agriculture have been reduced due to drought associated with climate change non sustainable use of groundwater and increased competition from municipal environmental and industrial water needs combined with the increasing global population there is a need to achieve maximum production per unit of applied irrigation water regulated deficit irrigation defined as a regime that purposely reduce applied irrigation water in specific crop growing stages chalmers et al 1981 may be a way to achieve higher water productivity i e crop produced per unit water consumed however a comprehensive knowledge of crop response and crop water use under water stress is needed to achieve the best balance between irrigation water use and crop yield geerts and raes 2009 therefore the development of tools that enable accurate estimation of crop water stress or crop water use is critical for deficit irrigation management the crop water stress index cwsi has been recognized as an indicator of plant water status based on canopy temperature ambient air temperature and relative humidity two methods for calculating cwsi have been widely used and evaluated an empirical method cwsi e developed by idso et al 1981 and a theoretical method cwsi t1 developed by jackson et al 1981 the empirical method establishes a relationship between canopy to air temperature difference and vapor pressure deficit vpd the theoretical method uses surface energy balance equation whilst accounting for variation in climate and calculates the divergence between the upper and lower boundaries of canopy to air temperature difference cwsi calculated from both methods have shown good relationships with other crop water stress indicators such as soil water content dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2012 taghvaeian et al 2014a wang et al 2005 and leaf water potential ballester et al 2013 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 cwsi from both methods have also been used for irrigation scheduling colaizzi et al 2012 emekli et al 2007 nielsen 1990 o shaughnessy et al 2010 yazar et al 1999 however there remain limitations of both methods that require careful consideration the empirical method has been criticized for two reasons 1 sensitivity of the empirical non water stress baseline to the changes of climate variables such as radiation and wind speed gonzalez dugo et al 2014 jackson et al 1988 payero and irmak 2006 for example the empirical baseline may change yearly for the same crop in the same field horst et al 1989 has reported significant differences p 0 01 between the cwsi baseline equations in 1986 and 1987 for common bermuda grass buffalo grass and tall fescue a similar result has been reported for mandarin and orange gonzalez dugo et al 2014 2 cwsi calculated by the empirical method showed large fluctuations especially under low vpd condition or with significant variation in climate stockle and dugas 1992 compared to the empirical method the advantage of cwsi t1 is its stability under various climate conditions jackson et al 1988 yuan et al 2004 the shortcoming of cwsi t1 is that it may not give significantly different values for well watered and stressed crops which may attribute to the incorrect estimation of aerodynamic resistance ra agam et al 2013 stockle and dugas 1992 jackson et al 1988 suggested that a seasonal average aerodynamic resistance should be applied cwsi t2 there are several successful applications of theoretical approach by calculating a seasonal average aerodynamic resistance clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 therefore it is important to know the accuracy and consistency of these three models for cwsi calculation before any application as mentioned previously many studies have proven good relationships between cwsi and measured water stress indicators however few had used sap flow measurement to assess the accuracy and consistency of cwsi models sap flow methodology which provides a measurement of whole plant transpiration has been widely used to determine crop coefficient and evaluate simulated crop water transpiration and crop water stress by various models cammalleri et al 2013 chabot et al 2002 jara and stockle 1999 zhao et al 2015 the transpiration measurement by sap flow would have 5 to 10 of actual transpiration error which have been obtained by comparing with other measurements green et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 the performance of cwsi models can be evaluated by comparing model outputs with water stress determined from sap flow measurement the objectives of this study were to 1 compare the performance of cwsi among one empirical model and two theoretical models with sap flow measurement 2 evaluate the uncertainty among the three cwsi models 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 study site and management field data were collected from maize during the 2015 growing season at usda ars limited irrigation research farm lirf in greeley colorado usa 40 26 57 n 104 38 12 w elevation 1427 m the alluvial soils of the study field were predominantly sandy and fine sandy loam of olney and otero series the maize zea mays l was planted on jun 1 2015 with planting density around 85 000 plants ha 1 and the dates when maize reached the late vegetative stage v8 beginning of reproductive stage r1 beginning of maturation stage r3 and harvest were jul 9 aug 2 aug 24 and nov 2 2015 respectively final plant populations varied from 77 000 to 82 000 plants ha 1 deficit irrigation was regulated by withholding during the late vegetative growth stage v8 to r1 and or the maturation growth stage r3 to r6 but applying water during the sensitive reproductive r1 to r3 and early vegetative stages planting to v8 a total of 12 irrigation treatments were arranged in a randomized block design consisting of four blocks with each treatment replicated once in each block each treatment plot had 12 rows at 0 76 m spacing 9 m wide by 43 m long all measurements were taken from the middle four rows to reduce border effects treatments are named for the target percent of maximum non stressed crop et evapotranspiration during late vegetative and maturation growth stages respectively e g a 40 80 treatment would target 40 of maximum et during the vegetative stage and 80 of maximum et during the maturation stages sap flow measurements were taken in 100 100 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 treatments so only these four treatments were included in this study and the actual irrigation amounts that were achieved for the four treatments are shown in table 1

purpose of providing specific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the u s department of agriculture was used to measure canopy ground cover the camera was attached to a boom that was mounted on a high clearance tractor so that the camera was elevated about 7 m above the ground nadir view rgb images were taken near solar noon twice a week from each treatment plot the camera field of view encompassed 4 rows 4 m all images were processed in python 3 5 python software foundation wilmington de usa to separate green plant canopy from background soil surface residue and senesced leaves the canopy ground cover for each treatment during the crop growing season is shown in fig 1 grain yield was measured by hand harvesting the ears from the center sampling area of the center four rows of each plot the sampling area was about 69 m2 grain was threshed with a stationary thresher wintersteiger classic st wintersteiger ag ried austria weighed and subsampled for moisture content determination grain moisture content at harvest was measured with a dickey john gac500 xt moisture tester dickey john corp aubern ill usa infrared thermal radiometers irt model si 121 apogee instruments inc logan utah usa were used to monitor continuous canopy temperature of maize the view angle of irt was 36 field of view with 0 2 c accuracy over the temperature range of 10 to 65 c the irts were attached to telescoping posts and angled 23 below horizon and 45 from north looking northeast to ensure the field of view included primarily crop canopy the viewing area of the irts was about 13 35 m2 the irts were kept at a height of 0 8 m above the top of canopy throughout the growing season adjusted twice per week during vegetative growth an irt sensor was installed for each plot on jul 13 2015 and a total of four irts for each treatment irt measurements in 100 100 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 treatments from jul 25 to sept 05 2015 were used to determine crop water stress during this period crop coverage measured from nadir view in all treatments were larger than 0 35 fig 1 and the crop coverage in the field view of irts was larger than 0 8 all irt measurements were recorded by data loggers model cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan utah usa every 5 s and averaged on hourly intervals measured values were corrected for the effect of sensor body temperature using calibration equations provided by the manufacturer 2 1 3 sap flow measurement whole plant transpiration was measured on two plants per plot in 100 100 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 treatments with stem heat balance sap flow exo sensors dynamax inc houston tx usa sakuratani 1981 thus a total of eight sensors was installed for each treatment accuracy of these sensors was verified in 2015 in a greenhouse study with maize in 15l pots placed on logging scales van bavel m young j and comas l 2017 application report www dynamax com data were collected from jul 28 to sept 20 2015 sapip data loggers dynamax inc houston tx usa were placed approximately 12 m from the end of the plot and sensors were installed on plants randomly chosen in the same row within 3 m from the loggers dynamax inc houston tx usa the bottom 2 3 leaves and leaf sheaths were removed at least a day prior to installing gages sensors were then installed on stem internodes that were covered with plastic wrap to prevent moisture from stems from entering the sensors a thin film of silicon was applied to facilitate thermal exchange between the stems and sensors sensors were wrapped from the inside to the exterior with stretchable and wicking velcro waterproof fabric sealed with electrical tape at the top insulating foam and insulated foil bubble wrap secured with zip ties and sealed with electrical tape at the top the voltage was set to 4 2 4 3 v dc and resulted in power ranging from 0 20 to 0 27 w depending on the size of sensor the temperature applied ranged from 0 5 to 4 c above ambient and there was no stem damage from heat data were monitored for abnormalities during measurements and stems inspected carefully for aberrations upon removal of the sensors the average value of the thermopile radial heat loss factor ksh is established when there is low to zero flow and is required to solve the energy balance of the system average ksh was computed during 3 30 5 30 h mst mountain standard time and set to the daily ksh at 5 30 h since the formula for calculating ksh depends on zero sap flow heat flux there may be a small error in sap flow calculations if there is transpiration during the period used for ksh computation we estimate that maximum transpiration loss during this period may be 4 g hr based on the greenhouse study of fully watered maize grown in 15l pots that were placed on logging scales and sealed from the top of the pot to the plant stem with plastic garbage data not shown if total weight loss from the pots during this period was from transpiration rather than evaporation total error from the ksh was about 1 6 and not substantial for this application sensor outputs were collected every 1 min and recorded as 15 min means from the end of july through september sap flow was determined as the mass of water transpired by the plant per unit time g h 1 plant 1 and expressed per ground area by dividing by the planting density 2 2 crop water stress index cwsi cwsi is defined in eq 1 by the upper tc ta u and lower boundary tc ta l of temperature difference between air and canopy where tc ta u and tc ta l representing a non transpiring and full transpiring conditions respectively idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 1 c w s i t c t a c t c t a l t c t a u t c t a l where tc ta c is the difference between canopy temperature tc c and air temperature ta c for the current condition when the crop is fully watered cwsi value is close to 0 whereas for the crop under severe water stress condition cwsi value is close to 1 the difference between the following cwsi models is the procedure to determine the upper tc ta u and lower tc ta l boundaries 2 2 1 empirical model cwsi e according to idso et al 1981 the lower and upper boundary of tc ta for various crops under various climatic conditions could be defined as 2 t c t a l a b v p d 3 t c t a u a b v p g where vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere assuming leaf temperature air temperature intercept a and slope b are the linear regression parameters of tc ta l on vpd vpg is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature ta and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus a in eq 2 ta a 2 2 2 theoretical model 1 cwsi t1 the theoretical development of cwsi is based on surface energy balance equation which includes the following assumptions 1 aerodynamic resistance ra adequately represents the resistance to turbulent transport of heat water vapor and momentum jackson et al 1981 jackson et al 1988 then the temperature difference between canopy and air could be defined as 4 t c t a r a ρ c p γ 1 r c r a δ γ 1 r c r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c r a where cp is the heat capacity of air j kg 1 c tc is the temperature of canopy ta is the air temperature е is the air saturated vapor pressure at tc pa e is the air vapor pressure pa γ is the psychrometric constant pa c 1 ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m 1 rc is the canopy resistance s m 1 δ is the change slope of saturation vapor pressure with temperature pa c 1 rn is the net radiation j m 2 s 1 g is heat flux consumed by soil j m 2 s 1 and was assumed around 10 of rn then the upper boundary of tc ta is calculated when rc 5 t c t a u r a ρ c p r n g and the lower boundary of tc ta is calculated when rc rcp 6 t c t a l r a ρ c p γ 1 r c p r a δ γ 1 r c p r a r n g e e δ γ 1 r c p r a where rcp is the canopy resistance under full transpiration condition according to jackson et al 1981 jackson et al 1988 rcp was defined as 0 for non water stress condition and ra is calculated by 7 r a 4 72 l n z d z 0 2 1 0 54 u where z is the reference height m d is the displacement height m d 0 63 h h is the height of crop zo is the roughness length m zo 0 13 h and u is the wind speed at height z m s 1 2 2 3 theoretical model 2 cwsi t2 several studies have found that the theoretical approach performed well when given a mean ra and rcp during the study period clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 jackson et al 1988 suggested that seasonal average r a and rcp were reasonable thus we calculated the upper and lower boundary of tc ta using seasonal average r a and rcp instead of using eq 7 for ra and 0 for rcp in cwsi t1 approach they were estimated by o toole and real 1986 8 r a ρ c p a r n b δ 1 b 9 r c p r a δ 1 b γ 1 where r n is the seasonal average net radiation δ is the seasonal average slope of saturated vapor pressure temperature relationship pa c 1 which is determined by seasonal average temperature a and b are parameters from eq 2 the r a and r c p were calculated based on non water stress condition the r c p was only used in non water stress condition in eq 6 since ra was not influenced by crop water stress the r a determined was used in both eqs 5 6 2 3 water stress calculation 2 3 1 cwsi calculated by three models irt measurements and vpd from 100 100 treatment in eleven sunny days after an irrigation event were used to establish a non water stress baseline for maize in 2015 the canopy temperature air temperature and vpd at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst from each selected day were used to estimate the non water stress baseline for eq 2 idso et al 1981 taghvaeian et al 2014b after determining the linear coefficients in eq 2 hourly cwsi e was calculated based on eqs 1 3 at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst daily cwsi e was obtained as an averaged cwsi e value over these four hours the net radiation and air temperature at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst from each selected day were used to calculate the seasonal average net radiation and temperature taken together with the slope and intercept of the non water stress baseline eq 2 the seasonal average aerodynamic resistance and potential canopy resistance was calculated by eqs 8 9 a more detailed calculation procedure for other climate parameters such as γ δ and cp in cwsi t1 and cwsi t2 could be found in allen et al 1998 hourly cwsi at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst was calculated by three models from jul 13 to sept 20 2015 daily cwsi was then calculated by averaging the cwsi values over these four hours for each day 2 3 2 water stress from sap flow measurement sap flow at 11 00 12 00 13 00 and 14 00 h mst in each day from jul 28 to sept 05 2015 was used to calculate a stress index ks sap assuming the crop transpiration in 100 100 could represent the full transpiration condition the measured crop water stress for deficit irrigation treatment was defined as 10 k s s a p 1 s a p i s a p 1 where sap1 is the hourly sap flow measurement in 100 100 treatment in mm h 1 and sapi is the hourly measured transpiration in deficit treatment in mm h 1 2 4 model comparison the range of both ks sap and cwsi are analogous such that cwsi 0 indicates a well watered crop just as in a well watered crop sapi sap1 thus ks sap 0 eq 10 likewise if transpiration is completely stopped e g sapi 0 then ks sap 1 and cwsi would also be maximized at 1 the differences between crop water stress estimated by the three models and sap flow measurements were evaluated by two statistical indicators namely the mean bias difference mbd and the root mean square deviation rmsd nash and sutcliffe 1970 willmott 1982 12 m b d 1 n i n k s s a p c w s i 13 r m s d 1 n i n k s s a p c w s i 2 where ks sap represents the water stress from sap flow measurement cwsi is the crop water stress index and n is the number of observations all the calculations and statistical analysis have been done in r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria and version 3 3 1 3 results 3 1 parameters of non water stress baseline for cwsi non water stress baseline for maize in greeley co in 2015 is shown in fig 2 several baseline parameters obtained by previous studies for maize are listed in table 3 the baseline in this study was similar to those obtained by previous studies in greeley co however there are still some differences in the regression coefficients especially for the intercept a even when compared with the result obtained in the same field dejonge et al 2015 in general the slope b ranged from 2 0 to 1 8 while the intercept a ranged from 2 3 to 3 4 for maize in greely co this variation may have been caused by other factors such as wind speed crop growth stages and irt view angles etc other studies have also reported changes in baseline parameters between years or between seasons for example gonzalez dugo et al 2014 reported that the intercept varied from 3 3 to 3 9 during a three year experiment on citrus when applying an empirical approach for irrigation management the baseline was assumed unchanged for the same crop at a specific site however due to the observed variations in baseline parameters for maize in the same study area among years it is necessary to investigate the uncertainty of cwsi caused by the variations of baseline parameters the seasonal average r a andd r c p were 13 23 s m 1 and 42 42 s m 1 respectively jackson et al 1981 stated that it was reasonable to use a constant r a around 6 10 s m 1 o toole and real 1986 used the same method and obtained 14 9 s m 1 and 56 3 s m 1 for r a and r c p respectively tolk 1992 reported r c p for corn was ranging from 30 110 s m 1 during the growing season thus the seasonal average r a and r c p obtained for cwsi t2 in this study were reasonable 3 2 daily comparison of the calculated cwsi with sap flow measurement fig 3 shows the daily cwsi values determined by three models and sap flow measurements for four irrigation treatments in the case of 100 100 the well watered crop the values of cwsi e and cwsi t2 were relatively stable with a range of 0 0 2 while cwsi t1 showed an increasing trend and was larger than 0 2 after aug 20 2015 in the case of deficit irrigation treatments 65 65 40 40 and 40 80 cwsi e and cwsi t2 showed crop water stress in the vegetative stage then gradually decreased when full irrigation was resumed in the reproductive stage and then increased again when stress was applied in the maturation stage cwsi t1 underestimated the water stress in the vegetative stage but showed water stress in both reproductive and maturation stage cwsi e and cwsi t2 gave more reasonable water stress estimation compared with cwsi t1 the error bar in fig 3 was the standard deviation of eight replicates of sap flow measurements in each treatment the large standard deviation may be caused due to the following reasons 1 sap flow measurement itself has 5 10 uncertainties green et al 2003 zhang et al 2011 2 although the majority of soil texture in the experiment field is sandy and fine sandy loam certain plots also include other soil textures such as nunn clay loam and otero sandy loam trout and bausch 2017 the difference in soil texture would lead to different response of crop to available soil water however the sap measurement is still able to show the variation of crop water stress during the growing season and among different irrigation treatments examining stress indication over the entire measurement period cwsi t2 and cwsi e gave better performance than cwsi t1 table 4 cwsi t2 and cwsi e showed a close agreement with water stress measurement from sap flow in 40 40 and 40 80 and slightly overestimated crop water stress in 65 65 negative mbd in table 4 and fig 3 cwsi t1 overestimated crop water stress in the reproductive and maturation stages and extremely underestimated crop water stress in the vegetative stage for 40 40 overall crop water stress estimated by cwsi t2 and cwsi e showed a reasonable agreement with sap flow measurement while cwsi t1 failed to give reasonable estimation in the vegetative stage 3 3 growth stage comparison of three cwsi models crop water stress index by each model was also compared against water stress determined by sap flow measurements across the season in different growth stages table 5 in the vegetative stage the values of cwsi t1 were significantly underestimated as compared with the other methods especially for 40 40 and 40 80 both with 40 of et cwsi t2 and cwsi e reflected the increased water stress between treatments due to deficit irrigation in this period when crops went into the reproductive stage full irrigation was resumed and ks sap values ranged 0 0 19 the values of cwsi t2 and cwsi e in this period decreased compared to the values in the vegetative stage and closed to the ks sap values however the values of cwsi t1 showed a slight increase and were larger than 0 2 when crops reached the maturation stage the deficit irrigation was resumed in the 65 65 and 40 40 while the 100 100 and 40 80 received full and nearly full irrigation respectively thus cwsis from all three models and sap flow were increased in 65 65 and 40 40 and the values of cwsi e and cwsi t2 did not change in 100 100 and 80 80 due to similar water conditions in the reproductive stage the values of cwsi t1 in 100 100 increased which is against the observed seasonal crop water stress trend from sap flow measurement and irrigation management the values of cwsi e and cwsi t2 in 40 80 in the maturation stage were lower than those in the vegetative stage which is consistent with the observed crop water stress trend from sap flow measurement and irrigation management again the value of cwsi t1 in 40 80 in the maturation stage was even higher than the value in the vegetative period and the value of cwsi t1 shown an increasing trend from vegetative to maturation stage in all treatments which indicated that cwsi t1 did not respond to stress throughout the growing season thus only cwsi e and cwsi t2 well described crop water stress difference between treatments and growth stages 3 4 relationship between the averaged crop water stress indexes and yield all cwsis show significantly negative trends with the yield fig 4 all cwsis well reflected the decreasing of yield caused by increasing of crop water stress however the yield decreasing trend slope of each yield cwsi linear relationship is quite different the slopes of cwsi e and cwsi t2 are similar and close to the slope of ks sap while the slope of cwsi t1 is the highest and differs from ks sap the high slope of cwsi t1 is mainly due to the overestimation of crop water stress in the maturation period for 100 100 and 40 80 table 5 and fig 4 thus cwsi e and cwsi t2 could better describe the decreasing of yield caused by water stress than cwsi t1 3 5 uncertainty of cwsi e and cwsi t2 cwsi difference of cwsi e model caused by the different parameters of the non stressed baseline is shown in fig 5 a and b the intercept and slope parameters a and b are within the ranges reported in the literature table 3 fig 2 compared to intercept a the uncertainty range of slope b was small for maize in greeley co so the impact of slope b on cwsi was also quite small furthermore intercept a appeared to have a greater effect on cwsi than did slope b per magnitude change i e δa 0 2 vs δb 0 2 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 also reported similar slope coefficients but large differences in intercept coefficients across years over a three year experiment thus it is important to define intercept a carefully for cwsi e model similarly cwsi difference from cwsi t2 decreased with increasing vpd and intercept a also had more influence on cwsi than slope b did fig 5c d moreover cwsi difference from cwsi t2 model was smaller than cwsi e when given same parameter changes 4 discussion 4 1 cwsi t1 vs cwsi t2 from daily and seasonal analysis of cwsi t1 we found that cwsi t1 showed the water stress difference between treatments and was also relative stable due to the inclusion of additional climate factors in its calculation figs 3 4 and table 4 this result is well supported by previous research ben gal et al 2009 horst et al 1989 yuan et al 2004 however the comparison to sap flow data revealed that cwsi t1 underestimated crop water stress for deficit irrigated maize during the vegetative period table 4 agam et al 2013 also reported that the underestimation of crop water stress for full irrigated olive trees by cwsi t1 crop water stress estimated by cwsi t1 showed an increasing trend for all treatments table 4 and failed to adequately respond to irrigation events and describe water stress difference between growth stages fig 3 tables 4 and 5 previous research suggests that the uncertainty of the aerodynamic resistance may influence the result of cwsi t1 but the mechanism is still unknown agam et al 2013 barbosa da silva and ramana rao 2005 stockle and dugas 1992 we observed that with increasing crop height the aerodynamic resistance decreased fig 6 a the consequence of this decrease in aerodynamic resistance resulted in a smaller upper limit of tc ta eq 5 the difference between the upper and lower limits of cwsi t1 also decreased so the estimated crop water stress exhibited an increasing trend eq 1 from fig 6b we also noticed the large difference between the upper and lower limits of cwsi t1 in the vegetative period which is why crop water stress for 40 40 and 40 80 were underestimated during this period correct estimation of aerodynamic resistance is critical to provide a reasonable assessment of crop water stress using the cwsi t1 method which would require accurate measurements crop height wind speed air temperature etc tolk et al 1995 cwsi t2 method can be a good alternative to cwsi t1 because it was better aligned with water stress estimates from sap flow and well described water stress between treatments and growth stages at the same time cwsi t2 and cwsi e could better describe the yield reduction due to crop water stress in a practical view the use of a seasonal constant for the aerodynamic resistance parameter is acceptable for theoretical approaches clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 4 2 cwsi e vs cwsi t2 although the results indicated that the cwsi e model was closely aligned with ks sap the limitation of the cwsi e method is quite significant in the uncertainty study section 3 5 we assumed the parameters for cwsi e and cwsi t2 were not changed except for a b and vpd it supposed to be an efficient way to examine the sensitivity of model parameters and uncertainty of the model cwsi e was more sensitive to the change of baseline parameter than cwsi t2 was the reason for this may be that cwsi t2 model incorporates more climate factors the large uncertainty caused by changing parameter a and b in low vpd region fig 5 may indicate that both cwsi t2 and cwsi e should not be applied under low vpd condition as reported by stockle and dugas 1992 in addition to the uncertainty in cwsi caused by small changes in the non stressed baseline coefficients fig 5 changing climate factors such as rn δ ra rc and cp are also associated with significant variation in cwsi e stockle and dugas 1992 theoretically the influence of these climate factors on cwsi e could be determined by comparing it with the output from cwsi t2 model although these two models share the same non water stress baseline cwsi t2 took these climate variables into account the difference between cwsi e and cwsi t2 was quite small for 100 100 which experienced minimal water stress nevertheless cwsi e showed some fluctuations under deficit irrigation and large differences between cwsi e and cwsi t2 were found in some days e g aug 23 cwsi e also yielded cwsi values larger than 1 on july 28 for 40 80 although the uncertainties remain by using seasonal estimates of ra and rcp determined from non water stress baseline incorporating climate factors in the calculation of the upper and lower boundary limits i e cwsi t2 are likely to improve the stability of water stress estimation clawson et al 1989 jalali farahani et al 1993 cwsi t2 was also more closely aligned with ks sap than cwsi e in all four treatments and thus we recommend cwsi t2 over cwsi e model 5 conclusions considering the uncertainty of crop stress determined from sap flow measurement cwsi e and cwsi t2 models gave reasonable water stress estimates however crop water stress from cwsi t1 exhibited a constant increasing trend through growing season and did not adequately predict changes in crop water status resulting from neither irrigation events nor growth stage differences we therefore suggest that cwsi t1 may not be a reliable method for determining stress in maize although cwsi t1 could reflect the crop water status between treatments assuming a seasonal average aerodynamic resistance the cwsi t2 model performed better than the empirical method both cwsi t2 and cwsi e could well predict crop water stress between irrigation events as well as across growth stages by including the climate factors crop water stress estimated from cwsi t2 exhibited better alignment with sap flow than did cwsi e the uncertainty of both cwsi t2 and cwsi e decreased with the increasing of vpd and the intercept of non water stress baseline was the main source of error the uncertainty from cwsi t2 was less than that from cwsi e we recommend cwsi t2 model for assessing crop water stress although it requires more

11492,the implementation of rotational tillage with straw mulching during a fallow period seems to be an effective management strategy to help store water for spring sown crop a site specific field study was conducted according to rainfall conditions to determine the effect of rotational tillage on soil water regime water use efficiency and grain yield in semi arid region on the loess plateau of china six tillage practices were tested nt st rotation no tillage was applied in the first year and rotated with sub soiling in the second year st ct rotation sub soiling was applied in the first year and rotated with conventional tillage in the second year ct nt rotation conventional tillage was applied in the first year and rotated with no tillage in the second year nt no tillage was applied every year st sub soiling was applied every year ct conventional tillage was applied every year the results showed that the rotational tillage increase average sws soil water at sowing by 5 2 mm in dry years 0 8 mm in normal years and 13 2 mm in humid years when compared to ct soil water depletion was consistent with rainfall totals and the lowest depletion value recorded in the nt st and followed by nt treatment the grain yield was positively related with rainfall and average grain yields for three rainfall conditions were ranked as nt st ct nt st ct st nt ct while the soil water use efficiency wue was ranked in the order of nt st ct nt st st ct nt ct grain yields of rotational tillage nt st st ct and ct nt are higher than the yield of nt by 6 5 12 0 higher than the yield of st by 1 7 7 0 and 7 6 13 2 higher than ct respectively hence rotational tillage could improve soil water storage thus significantly increasing crop grain yield and water use efficiency the method could have important applications in semi arid areas keywords soil water storage rotational tillage water depletion crop production water use efficiency 1 introduction rain fed cropland covers approximately 80 of the total cultivated land in semi arid areas which are also an important cereal production area in china chen et al 2015 hou et al 2012a 2012b maize zea mays l is most typically cultivated in this region but grain yield remains stagnant due to water stress and seasonal agricultural drought owing to low and erratic rainfall high runoff water losses and high evaporation sharma and abrol et al 2011 relative studies have indicated that plastic film mulching had positive advantages in increasing water moisture while it also resulted in environmental problems chen et al 2015 tillage practices seem an effective approach to sustainable development but excessive soil tillage i e moldboard plowing applied with conventional tillage strongly influences soil properties and result in lower water and nutrient availability kumar et al 2013 leading to unstable and declining crop yield hou et al 2012a 2012b chan and heenan 2005 conservation tillage such as no till and reduced tillage and sub soiling with straw mulching promise as an approach to managing and improving crop production and water use efficiency no till nt practice with straw mulching in the surface could minimize the disruption of the soil structure and reduce soil erosion and runoff thereby increasing soil water capacity and water use efficiency sharma and abrol et al 2011 sub soiling can eliminate soil compaction of the subsoil layer by increasing soil structure and improving infiltration and water storage thereby increasing the drought resilience and crop yield ma and yu et al 2015 however other studies demonstrated the negative impacts of long term annual tillage practice for example long term nt adoption may increase soil bulk density decrease seed germination and emergence and thereby increase weed overgrown and crop yield reduction tian et al 2016 sub soiling has little effect on plant growth and no effect on grain yield over three cropping seasons ma et al 2015 nevertheless relative studies reported that the adoption of soil rotational tillage at an appropriate time is to be a promising approach for overcoming some of the disadvantages caused by continuous single tillage hou et al 2012a 2012b lópez fando et al 2007 he et al 2006 found that nt coupled with sub soiling practice can increase crop yields and wue in semi arid areas of northern china he et al 2007 and qin et al 2008 showed that the sub soiling efficacy could persist approximately 4 years and the combination of a 2 or 4 year nt and 1 year sub soiling could minimize soil compaction and improve soil physical and chemical changes which caused by annual sub soiling practice therefore tillage practices during fallow period have certain storage effect however current information is limited due to the regularity of water storage grain yield and wue to an interval of varying tillage in the semi arid region as indicated by the literature straw mulching associated with conservation tillage seems promising for maintaining or improving soil water storage and yield however limited information is available on the tepid response of the combination of rotational tillage during fallow period and straw mulching on soil water storage and grain yield especially in different annual rainfall conditions in this study we focused on the effects of tillage practices during fallow on soil water storage and grain yield of the semi arid region at different rainfall conditions the aim is to identify promising approach on water conservation and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experimental was established in 2007 at a tableland 35 19 54 45 n latitude 110 05 58 35 e longitude altitude 877 m site located in heyang county shaanxi province china during 2007 2016 the experimental fields are level and the soil is classified as middle loam based on the fao unesco soil classification fao 1993 all the fields had been plowed for several years at the start of the experiment in 2007 and the soil in 0 20 cm layer had a ph of 8 2 an soc of 9 94 g kg 1 a soil total nitrogen content of 0 74 g kg 1 a soil total phosphorous content of 0 59 g kg 1 and an available potassium content of 110 6 g kg 1 the soil bulk density was 1 43 g cm 3 and soil porosity was 46 76 the study area is characterized by a semi arid and continental monsoon with an average annual temperature of 11 5 c and a potential evaporation of 1832 8 mm average annual sunshine is approximately 2528 3 h the climate data were obtained from the weather station located at the experimental station the rainfall conditions were divided based on the drought index guo et al 2012 and partial information used in this paper are listed in table 1 the drought index di for rainfall was calculated using the following equation to assess variations and status in rainfall among different years di p m σ where p is the annual rainfall m is the average rainfall and σ is the standard error for rainfalls di is used to distinguish among the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 years similarly the dis for fallow rainfall fsr and growing season rainfall gsr were calculated to assess variations and status in seasonal rainfall among different years according to the rainfall totals during growth stages the year 2013 and 2015 were identified as dry planting seasons 2008 2009 and 2014 were identified as normal planting seasons and 2010 2011 2012 and 2016 were identified as wet planting seasons in this study we chose year 2013 to represent a dry year 2014 as a normal year and 2016 as a humid year 2 2 experimental design and treatments a homogeneous area of 2025 m2 was selected in 2007 for the establishment of the experimental plots the experimental area was a randomized block design with three replications each plot was 5 m wide and 22 5 m long in this study six tillage treatments were applied in the fallow period of spring maize field nt no tillage was applied every year st sub soiling was applied every year ct conventional tillage was applied every year nt st rotation no tillage was applied in first year and rotated with sub soiling in second year st ct rotation sub soiling was applied in first year and rotated with conventional tillage in second year ct nt rotation conventional tillage were applied in first year and rotated with no tillage in second year in every season tillage was conducted after the harvest of previous crops according to the designed patterns in the ct treatment the soil was tilled to 20 25 cm depth using a tractor mounted moldboard plow and the crop straws were returned and buried into the arable layer the straws were retained evenly on the plot surface as mulch under nt and st for st treatment the soil was sub soiled to a depth of 30 35 cm by a sub soiling chisel with its adjustable wings being set to intervals of 60 cm distance between their terminal tines soil disturbance was avoided under nt until sowing and st can also be defined as conservation tillage for the field surface suffered little disturbance with this treatment a common spring maize variety zhengdan 958 was sown in middle or late april the local popular sowing time for nt and st maize was drill seeded at a plant density of 5 3 plants m 2 while for ct sowing with the same plant density was conducted using a rotary cultivator seeder the distance within and between rows of maize was 30 cm and 60 cm respectively the one time application of the full amount of fertilizer was conducted by broadcast before sowing with rates of 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 the fertilizer types for n p2o5 and k2o were urea ammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate respectively the harvest of maize was performed in the first fortnight of september after the scheduled tillage the field was kept fallow until the seeding of next maize season in next april for all treatments weeds were controlled by spraying chemical herbicides before crop emergence and at the initial fallow stage as well as by hand one to two times in the growth season based on visual estimates of weed populations 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 grain yield in each plot excluding edge effects three random quadrates covering 9 m2 were selected to measure maize grain yield including yield components kernels per ear and 100 kernel mass grain yield of maize was measured by adjusting grain moisture content to 14 parihar et al 2016 in this study the crop yield refers to the grain yield 2 3 2 soil sampling and analysis soil water contents of all plots were determined by the gravimetric method at each growth stage and at midmonth with monthly intervals in the fallow period unless the topsoil was frozen in winter soil samples were taken in 20 cm increments from 0 to 200 cm layers soil sample were weighed oven dried 105 110 c for 8 h and then reweighed and converted to water content soil water was calculated by summing the soil water storage in different layers

differences were considered statistically significant if p 0 05 the data were mapped using origin 2015 3 results 3 1 distribution of rainfall at different growth stage rainfall totals at maize growth stages from sowing to mature stages during dry years normal years and humid years differed fig 1 the rainfall in dry year was 307 5 mm and rainfall distribution from seedling stage to maturity was 105

humid year was approximately 400 2 mm the distribution at same growth stages was 68 2 80 0 191 0 40 0 and 21 0 mm compared to normal and humid years rainfall in dry year was uneven and above 65 occurred at the seeding and tasseling stages 3 2 soil water contents corresponding to varying rainfall amounts 3 2 1 soil water content at sowing stage in a humid year soil profile water content 0 200

nt st and the lowest soil water were under ct nt st had the higher soil water in 100 200 cm layers while ct had the lower in 60 200 cm layers in comparison to single tillage rotational tillage was superior in improving moisture at sowing stages especially in a dry year in dry year nt st significantly p 0 05 increased soil water by 8 0 than nt and 5 6 than st while st ct increased 4 6 and 2 3 respectively when taking normal year into account the increase was only observed under nt st treatment in 0 60 cm in corresponding to the treatments in humid year nt st increased soil water by 4 7 than nt and 2 4 than st 3 2 2 changes in soil profile water contents across major growth stages soil profile water content in the 0 200 cm layers from sowing to jointing showed a larger decrease both in dry and humid years while the normal year maintained its entire soil water at a balanced level fig 5 in a dry year soil water in 0 200 cm layers decreased and the maximum soil water decrement was observed at ct nt which mainly caused by decrement of 0 60 cm layers the conservation tillage practices such as nt st and nt treatments increased soil water in the 100 cm below layers compared with ct but significant difference p 0 05 were only observed between nt st and ct and by an increment of 8 7 in normal year the rotational tillage i e nt st st ct and ct nt increased entire soil water mainly caused by increment of 60 140 cm layers in the humid year ct nt and nt increased soil water in 100 200 cm layers below by 8 5 and 8 3 at the same growth stages nt st showed higher soil water than nt in 100 200 cm with an increment of 0 8 5 4 in a dry year and nt st and ct nt increased soil water through the same soil layers by 8 2 and 2 7 more than st nt st enhanced soil storage in 60 200 cm by 1

while the normal year maintained entire soil water at a balance level in dry year the nt st st ct and st increased the entire soil water mainly caused by increment in 40 140 cm layers in normal year the rotational tillage i e nt st and ct nt increased entire soil water mainly caused by increment of 160 200 cm layers in a humid year soil water in 0 200 cm layers decreased and the maximum soil water decrement was observed at nt and followed by ct nt in the dry year nt st increased soil water in 0 200 cm soil layers by 6 0 and st ct increased in 120 200 cm soil layers by 3 2 in comparison to nt the two tillage practices increased soil layers during 120 200 cm by 2 4 and 1 4 when compared with st compared with nt nt st increased soil storage during 40 200 cm by 2 8 while nt st st ct and ct nt had remarkable p 0 05 advantage on enhancing soil storage 60 cm below by 22 4 7 8 and 16 22 compared with st in normal year in a humid year ct nt had positive impact on soil storage 60 cm below by an increment of 3 0 when contrasting to nt and increment 6 6 when contrasting to st in a humid year nt st and st ct increased soil water storage by 3 9 and 6 6 at 120 200 cm layers in comparison to st treatment 3 3 soil water depletion swd soil water depletion during the whole growth period differed depending on varying rainfall totals table 2 the dry year had the highest swd with the average value 48 4 1 2 followed by normal year with a value of 45 0 1 6 the humid year observed the lowest with a value of 44 7 0 9 tillage practices strongly influenced swd at the same rainfall totals nt st was observed the lowest swd in the dry year in contrast ct nt revealed the highest swd value in the same year analogously nt st treatment revealed the lowest swd value in normal year the highest swd value occurred in st treatment conversely swd value under st treatment was slightly than others and the ct discovered the most severe swd in humid year application of swd during the whole growth period seeding to maturity stage leads to more maturity in three years while the swd had slight restoration during tasseling due to rainfall in dry and humid years there was positive effect for conservation practices occurred during the fallow period for hoisting moisture content compared to ct in the dry year i e nt st decreased swd by 3 7 9 9 the whole growth period ct nt decreased by 2 2 2 7 seeding to tasseling and st ct decreased by 5 5 during tasseling stage the swd during maturity stage was the lowest due to rainfall as well as reduction of maize absorbing water in the normal year the nt st and nt treatments significantly p 0 05 decreased compared to ct swd by 8 8 and 6 3 while st ct and ct nt decreased by 2 4 and 2 9 in normal year no significant difference additionally all the conservation tillage practices decreased swd by 2 2 5 7 in a humid year when in comparison to ct 3 4 et and wue during the maize growth seasons rainfall conditions variation resulted et varied from 318 to 499 mm while wue varied from 22 6 to 30 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 maximum et across all the treatments were recorded in humid year while the minimum et recorded in dry year table 3 the averaged wue observed the maximum in a dry year whereas the minimum was recorded in a humid year the averaged wue in a dry year increased by 7 5 and 33 4 more than the normal and humid year respectively in a dry year four tillage practices nt st st ct nt and st treatments significantly decreased et by 11 9 10 6 23 8 14 1 and increased wue by 36 4 26 9 30 2 and 8 9 in comparison to ct in normal year nt st and ct nt decreased et by 1 0 10 4 and increased wue for 11 0 27 6 respectively in humid year ct nt and st efficiently decreased et by 3 9 and 6 2 while four treatments nt st st ct ct nt and st increased wue by 5 7 16 8 3 5 maize grain yield maize grain yield was not only related with tillage practices but also to rainfall totals and its distribution among the three years the highest average grain yield 11265 kg ha 1 was observed in the humid year followed by a normal year 9669 kg ha 1 and a dry year 9530 kg ha 1 where rainfall totals during the growth period were 400 2 376 8 and 307 5 mm differences mainly resulted over kernels per ear which increased 13 2 in normal year and 19 0 in humid year table 4 conservation tillage remarkably increased grain yield especially in the dry year compared with ct nt st st ct and ct nt significantly p 0 05 increased grain yield by 21 9 14 7 and 15 7 in dry year in normal year nt st ct nt and st significantly increased grain yield by 10 0 15 7 and 20 9 respectively compared to ct all the treatments increased grain yield in humid years but the significant difference was only recorded in nt st and st ct with an increment of 8 7 and 16 8 3 6 relationship between rainfall sws et yield and wue correlation analysis table 5 revealed that there was a storage positive correlation between rainfall and et r 0 768 p 0 01 and significant correlation between rainfall and yield r 0 504 p 0 05 however a strong negative correlation between et and wue was observed r 0 792 but a markedly positive correlation was identified between et and grain yield r 0 665 suggesting that higher et depending on higher rainfall and higher et value created foundation for yield increment furthermore a remarkable positive correlation was identified between sws and grain yield r 0 514 which implies that tillage practices during the fallow period improved soil water storage capacity which provided basis for maize emergence and yield formation 4 discussion 4 1 tillage practices during fallow period increased soil water storage soil water content during early development stages are critical for maximizing grain yield and soil water storage during fallow period is closely related to tillage adoption in the current season alletto et al 2011 hou et al 2012a 2012b our results showed that conservation tillage practices during the fallow period maintained higher soil water storage in the 0 200 cm layer than conventional tillage with bare soil the combination of tillage practices with management during fallow could effectively improve soil water before sowing hou et al 2009 we also found that rotational tillage treatment could increase soil water storage sowing and increment degree depended on rainfall pattern and tillage practices when in a dry year nt st and ct nt significantly enhanced soil storage in comparison to single tillage nt st and ct nt st and st ct treatments increased soil storage in 0 200 cm layer by 7 5 and 2 7 in a humid year compared with ct no till with straw mulching can promote formation of soil water stable aggregates which resulted soil water holding capacity improvement extenuated wind erosion and mitigated soil degradation qin et al 2008 sub soiling with straw mulching could break hardpan or compacted depth of the soil and improve infiltration and water storage singh et al 2013 kuklik 2011 our work indicates that implementation of tillage practices during the fallow period could deepen the tilled layer and increase the capacity to accumulate rainfall sun et al 2015 while differences between soil storage are mainly due to the presence of residues that limit the penetration of solar radiation and consequent soil heating reducing evaporation from the surface alletto et al 2011 in the present study nt st displayed superiority across the three rainfall conditions which was in accordance with hou et al 2012a 2012b and he et al 2007 who demonstrated that nt coupled with sub soiling can loosen the soil and eliminate soil compaction caused by random wheel traffic wang et al 2012 reported tillage practices during the fallow period were beneficial to increase soil water storage during the whole growth period and soil water content and water availability for maize was generally higher under conservation tillage hou et al 2012a 2012b our work revealed that conservation tillage during fallow period could improve soil storage at 0 200 cm layer but the differences were only observed above 0 100 cm layer in humid and dry years in dry and humid years nt st and ct nt could efficiently increase water storage at jointing stage 100 cm below suggesting that rotational tillage with little soil disturbance had moisture reserved significantly larger than conventional tillage and soil availability persisted with growth period advanced aboudrare et al 2006 in our experiments nt st significantly enhanced soil storage at both stages jointing and filling stages in normal and dry years compared with nt the most likely possible explanation for these results is that the interval with nt and sub soiling with straw mulching decreased tillage times and made soil lumpy and porous which may have resulted in more water in the soil and decreased evaporation amir and sinclair 1996 in contrast after several successive years of no till system the soil appears to increase due to soil bulk density increment and porosity decrement thwarting rainfall infiltration and water storage zink et al 2011 soil water deficit degree was corresponding to rainfall conditions in this study the highest water deficit value was recorded in dry year followed by a normal year and a humid year additionally nt st recorded the lowest deficit value in dry year while ct nt in normal year and st in a humid year 4 2 tillage practices increased wue sharma et al 2011 illustrated that various tillage with mulching significantly increased soil water content 10 3 12 4 and enhanced wue by 17 2 in semi arid region huang et al 2012 the results of the present study revealed that all the conservation tillage decreased mean et by 3 4 6 3 in various rainfall conditions and increased mean wue by 6 2 17 8 meanwhile wue was improved to a great extent under nt st in the dry year followed by nt and st ct in the same year and ct nt in the normal year these results indicated that straw mulching and rotational tillage during this period promotes better usage of rainfall by making full use of water storage fuentes et al 2003 the results also suggested that conservation tillage practices during the fallow period could effectively capture rainfall and improve soil water in the sowing period chen et al 2015 and the efficacy is more pronounced in dry years conversely conventional tillage without straw mulching which is widely used in semi arid region remarkably increased soil water loss via evaporation shao et al 2016 4 3 tillage practices improved maize grain yield conservation tillage is conductive to improving soil water conservation and yield by adjusting soil water status however serious shortage of rainfall during the growth stage greatly limits the increment of crop growth and consequently resulted in yield decline hou et al 2013 in this study the highest yield mean 11265 kg ha 1 was observed in the humid year followed by normal mean 9669 kg ha 1 and dry years mean 9530 kg ha 1 but these differences were mainly attributed to rainfall and its distribution sufficient soil water supply was beneficial to seeding germination and development of maize chen et al 2015 the aim of maximizing the storage of rainfall during the period was to provide a water reverse to supplement the erratic rainfall during the life of the following crop aboudrare et al 2006 in the present study four conservation treatments nt st st ct ct nt and st successively increased grain yield by 13 2 7 6 11 4 and 5 8 when the rainfall was ignored while grain yield under nt was similar to conventional tillage suggesting that rotational tillage and st treatments could improve topsoil structure and aeration and it was favor for soil water conservation and improving soil holding capacity li et al 2012 adversely conventional tillage may have negative effects on water storage and consequences on maize development and yield alletto et al 2011 although no till nt treatment had a superiority in mitigating soil erosion and improving soil water the efficacy will be erased after several successive years tian et al 2016 and reduced crop root proliferation caused by soil bulk density at tilled depth results in grain yield reduction figuerola et al 2012 arvidsson et al 2014 this was contradicted by soane et al 2012 and shao et al 2016 who found that no till with straw mulching increased grain yield by 13 4 24 6 one possible explanation for this was that varying soil properties crop systems and weather factors greatly influenced experiment results comparative analysis of various parameters revealed that limited rainfall during growth stages resulting in decreased kernels per ear i e the number of kernels per ear table 4 in a dry year was 27 6 less than in the humid year and 5 1 less than in the normal year chen et al 2015 reported that soil water during the sowing period may contribute to 43 of grain yield moreover in the present study correlation analysis revealed that both soil storage sowing and rainfall had positive correlations with grain yield table 4 suggesting that rainfall is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting grain yield the study found that tillage practices during the fallow period have positive effects on grain yield in a semi arid region furthermore the conspicuous differences in the correction between

11492,the implementation of rotational tillage with straw mulching during a fallow period seems to be an effective management strategy to help store water for spring sown crop a site specific field study was conducted according to rainfall conditions to determine the effect of rotational tillage on soil water regime water use efficiency and grain yield in semi arid region on the loess plateau of china six tillage practices were tested nt st rotation no tillage was applied in the first year and rotated with sub soiling in the second year st ct rotation sub soiling was applied in the first year and rotated with conventional tillage in the second year ct nt rotation conventional tillage was applied in the first year and rotated with no tillage in the second year nt no tillage was applied every year st sub soiling was applied every year ct conventional tillage was applied every year the results showed that the rotational tillage increase average sws soil water at sowing by 5 2 mm in dry years 0 8 mm in normal years and 13 2 mm in humid years when compared to ct soil water depletion was consistent with rainfall totals and the lowest depletion value recorded in the nt st and followed by nt treatment the grain yield was positively related with rainfall and average grain yields for three rainfall conditions were ranked as nt st ct nt st ct st nt ct while the soil water use efficiency wue was ranked in the order of nt st ct nt st st ct nt ct grain yields of rotational tillage nt st st ct and ct nt are higher than the yield of nt by 6 5 12 0 higher than the yield of st by 1 7 7 0 and 7 6 13 2 higher than ct respectively hence rotational tillage could improve soil water storage thus significantly increasing crop grain yield and water use efficiency the method could have important applications in semi arid areas keywords soil water storage rotational tillage water depletion crop production water use efficiency 1 introduction rain fed cropland covers approximately 80 of the total cultivated land in semi arid areas which are also an important cereal production area in china chen et al 2015 hou et al 2012a 2012b maize zea mays l is most typically cultivated in this region but grain yield remains stagnant due to water stress and seasonal agricultural drought owing to low and erratic rainfall high runoff water losses and high evaporation sharma and abrol et al 2011 relative studies have indicated that plastic film mulching had positive advantages in increasing water moisture while it also resulted in environmental problems chen et al 2015 tillage practices seem an effective approach to sustainable development but excessive soil tillage i e moldboard plowing applied with conventional tillage strongly influences soil properties and result in lower water and nutrient availability kumar et al 2013 leading to unstable and declining crop yield hou et al 2012a 2012b chan and heenan 2005 conservation tillage such as no till and reduced tillage and sub soiling with straw mulching promise as an approach to managing and improving crop production and water use efficiency no till nt practice with straw mulching in the surface could minimize the disruption of the soil structure and reduce soil erosion and runoff thereby increasing soil water capacity and water use efficiency sharma and abrol et al 2011 sub soiling can eliminate soil compaction of the subsoil layer by increasing soil structure and improving infiltration and water storage thereby increasing the drought resilience and crop yield ma and yu et al 2015 however other studies demonstrated the negative impacts of long term annual tillage practice for example long term nt adoption may increase soil bulk density decrease seed germination and emergence and thereby increase weed overgrown and crop yield reduction tian et al 2016 sub soiling has little effect on plant growth and no effect on grain yield over three cropping seasons ma et al 2015 nevertheless relative studies reported that the adoption of soil rotational tillage at an appropriate time is to be a promising approach for overcoming some of the disadvantages caused by continuous single tillage hou et al 2012a 2012b lópez fando et al 2007 he et al 2006 found that nt coupled with sub soiling practice can increase crop yields and wue in semi arid areas of northern china he et al 2007 and qin et al 2008 showed that the sub soiling efficacy could persist approximately 4 years and the combination of a 2 or 4 year nt and 1 year sub soiling could minimize soil compaction and improve soil physical and chemical changes which caused by annual sub soiling practice therefore tillage practices during fallow period have certain storage effect however current information is limited due to the regularity of water storage grain yield and wue to an interval of varying tillage in the semi arid region as indicated by the literature straw mulching associated with conservation tillage seems promising for maintaining or improving soil water storage and yield however limited information is available on the tepid response of the combination of rotational tillage during fallow period and straw mulching on soil water storage and grain yield especially in different annual rainfall conditions in this study we focused on the effects of tillage practices during fallow on soil water storage and grain yield of the semi arid region at different rainfall conditions the aim is to identify promising approach on water conservation and yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experimental was established in 2007 at a tableland 35 19 54 45 n latitude 110 05 58 35 e longitude altitude 877 m site located in heyang county shaanxi province china during 2007 2016 the experimental fields are level and the soil is classified as middle loam based on the fao unesco soil classification fao 1993 all the fields had been plowed for several years at the start of the experiment in 2007 and the soil in 0 20 cm layer had a ph of 8 2 an soc of 9 94 g kg 1 a soil total nitrogen content of 0 74 g kg 1 a soil total phosphorous content of 0 59 g kg 1 and an available potassium content of 110 6 g kg 1 the soil bulk density was 1 43 g cm 3 and soil porosity was 46 76 the study area is characterized by a semi arid and continental monsoon with an average annual temperature of 11 5 c and a potential evaporation of 1832 8 mm average annual sunshine is approximately 2528 3 h the climate data were obtained from the weather station located at the experimental station the rainfall conditions were divided based on the drought index guo et al 2012 and partial information used in this paper are listed in table 1 the drought index di for rainfall was calculated using the following equation to assess variations and status in rainfall among different years di p m σ where p is the annual rainfall m is the average rainfall and σ is the standard error for rainfalls di is used to distinguish among the wet di 0 35 normal 0 35 di 0 35 and dry di 0 35 years similarly the dis for fallow rainfall fsr and growing season rainfall gsr were calculated to assess variations and status in seasonal rainfall among different years according to the rainfall totals during growth stages the year 2013 and 2015 were identified as dry planting seasons 2008 2009 and 2014 were identified as normal planting seasons and 2010 2011 2012 and 2016 were identified as wet planting seasons in this study we chose year 2013 to represent a dry year 2014 as a normal year and 2016 as a humid year 2 2 experimental design and treatments a homogeneous area of 2025 m2 was selected in 2007 for the establishment of the experimental plots the experimental area was a randomized block design with three replications each plot was 5 m wide and 22 5 m long in this study six tillage treatments were applied in the fallow period of spring maize field nt no tillage was applied every year st sub soiling was applied every year ct conventional tillage was applied every year nt st rotation no tillage was applied in first year and rotated with sub soiling in second year st ct rotation sub soiling was applied in first year and rotated with conventional tillage in second year ct nt rotation conventional tillage were applied in first year and rotated with no tillage in second year in every season tillage was conducted after the harvest of previous crops according to the designed patterns in the ct treatment the soil was tilled to 20 25 cm depth using a tractor mounted moldboard plow and the crop straws were returned and buried into the arable layer the straws were retained evenly on the plot surface as mulch under nt and st for st treatment the soil was sub soiled to a depth of 30 35 cm by a sub soiling chisel with its adjustable wings being set to intervals of 60 cm distance between their terminal tines soil disturbance was avoided under nt until sowing and st can also be defined as conservation tillage for the field surface suffered little disturbance with this treatment a common spring maize variety zhengdan 958 was sown in middle or late april the local popular sowing time for nt and st maize was drill seeded at a plant density of 5 3 plants m 2 while for ct sowing with the same plant density was conducted using a rotary cultivator seeder the distance within and between rows of maize was 30 cm and 60 cm respectively the one time application of the full amount of fertilizer was conducted by broadcast before sowing with rates of 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 the fertilizer types for n p2o5 and k2o were urea ammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate respectively the harvest of maize was performed in the first fortnight of september after the scheduled tillage the field was kept fallow until the seeding of next maize season in next april for all treatments weeds were controlled by spraying chemical herbicides before crop emergence and at the initial fallow stage as well as by hand one to two times in the growth season based on visual estimates of weed populations 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 grain yield in each plot excluding edge effects three random quadrates covering 9 m2 were selected to measure maize grain yield including yield components kernels per ear and 100 kernel mass grain yield of maize was measured by adjusting grain moisture content to 14 parihar et al 2016 in this study the crop yield refers to the grain yield 2 3 2 soil sampling and analysis soil water contents of all plots were determined by the gravimetric method at each growth stage and at midmonth with monthly intervals in the fallow period unless the topsoil was frozen in winter soil samples were taken in 20 cm increments from 0 to 200 cm layers soil sample were weighed oven dried 105 110 c for 8 h and then reweighed and converted to water content soil water was calculated by summing the soil water storage in different layers and both of the index parameters were calculated by the follow equations he et al 2009 soil water m1 m2 m2 100 where m1 g is the weight of wet soil and m2 g is the weight of dry soil soil profile

differences were considered statistically significant if p 0 05 the data were mapped using origin 2015 3 results 3 1 distribution of rainfall at different growth stage rainfall totals at maize growth stages from sowing to mature stages during dry years normal years and humid years differed fig 1 the rainfall in dry year was 307 5 mm and rainfall distribution from seedling stage to maturity was 105

humid year was approximately 400 2 mm the distribution at same growth stages was 68 2 80 0 191 0 40 0 and 21 0 mm compared to normal and humid years rainfall in dry year was uneven and above 65 occurred at the seeding and tasseling stages 3 2 soil water contents corresponding to varying rainfall amounts 3 2 1 soil water content at sowing stage in a humid year soil profile water content 0 200

nt st and the lowest soil water were under ct nt st had the higher soil water in 100 200 cm layers while ct had the lower in 60 200 cm layers in comparison to single tillage rotational tillage was superior in improving moisture at sowing stages especially in a dry year in dry year nt st significantly p 0 05 increased soil water by 8 0 than nt and 5 6 than st while st ct increased 4 6 and 2 3 respectively when taking normal year into account the increase was only observed under nt st treatment in 0 60 cm in corresponding to the treatments in humid year nt st increased soil water by 4 7 than nt and 2 4 than st 3 2 2 changes in soil profile water contents across major growth stages soil profile water content in the 0 200 cm layers from sowing to jointing showed a larger decrease both in dry and humid years while the normal year maintained its entire soil water at a balanced level fig 5 in a dry year soil water in 0 200 cm layers decreased and the maximum soil water decrement was observed at ct nt which mainly caused by decrement of 0 60 cm layers the conservation tillage practices such as nt st and nt treatments increased soil water in the 100 cm below layers compared with ct but significant difference p 0 05 were only observed between nt st and ct and by an increment of 8 7 in normal year the rotational tillage i e nt st st ct and ct nt increased entire soil water mainly caused by increment of 60 140 cm layers in the humid year ct nt and nt increased soil water in 100 200 cm layers below by 8 5 and 8 3 at the same growth stages nt st showed higher soil water than nt in 100 200 cm with an increment of 0 8 5 4 in a dry year and nt st and ct nt increased soil water through the same soil layers by 8 2 and 2 7 more than st nt st enhanced soil storage in 60 200 cm by 1

while the normal year maintained entire soil water at a balance level in dry year the nt st st ct and st increased the entire soil water mainly caused by increment in 40 140 cm layers in normal year the rotational tillage i e nt st and ct nt increased entire soil water mainly caused by increment of 160 200 cm layers in a humid year soil water in 0 200 cm layers decreased and the maximum soil water decrement was observed at nt and followed by ct nt in the dry year nt st increased soil water in 0 200 cm soil layers by 6 0 and st ct increased in 120 200 cm soil layers by 3 2 in comparison to nt the two tillage practices increased soil layers during 120 200 cm by 2 4 and 1 4 when compared with st compared with nt nt st increased soil storage during 40 200 cm by 2 8 while nt st st ct and ct

an increment of 3 0 when contrasting to nt and increment 6 6 when contrasting to st in a humid year nt st and st ct increased soil water storage by 3 9 and 6 6 at 120 200 cm layers in comparison to st treatment 3 3 soil water depletion swd soil water depletion during the whole growth period differed depending on varying rainfall totals table 2 the dry year had the highest swd with the average value 48 4 1 2 followed by normal year with a value of 45 0 1 6 the humid year observed the lowest with a value of 44 7 0 9 tillage practices strongly influenced swd at the same rainfall totals nt st was observed the lowest swd in the dry year in contrast ct nt revealed the highest swd value in the same year analogously nt st treatment revealed the lowest swd value in normal year the highest swd value occurred in st treatment conversely swd value under st treatment was slightly than others and the ct discovered the most severe swd in humid year application of swd during the whole growth period seeding to maturity stage leads to more maturity in three years while the swd had slight restoration during tasseling due to rainfall in dry and humid years there was positive effect for conservation practices occurred during the fallow period for hoisting moisture content compared to ct in the dry year i e nt st decreased swd by 3 7 9 9 the whole growth period ct nt decreased by 2 2 2 7 seeding to tasseling and st ct decreased by 5 5 during tasseling stage the swd during maturity stage was the lowest due to rainfall as well as reduction of maize absorbing water in the normal year the nt st

conservation tillage practices decreased swd by 2 2 5 7 in a humid year when in comparison to ct 3 4 et and wue during the maize growth seasons rainfall conditions variation resulted et varied from 318 to 499 mm while wue varied from 22 6 to 30 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 maximum et across all the treatments were recorded in humid year while the minimum et recorded in dry year table 3 the averaged wue observed the maximum in a dry year whereas the minimum was recorded in a humid year the averaged wue in a dry year increased by 7 5 and 33 4 more than the normal and humid year respectively in a dry year four tillage practices nt st st ct nt and st treatments significantly decreased et by 11 9 10 6 23 8 14 1 and increased wue by 36 4 26 9 30 2 and 8 9 in comparison to ct in normal year nt st and ct nt decreased et by 1 0 10 4 and increased wue for 11 0 27 6 respectively in humid year ct nt and st efficiently decreased et by 3 9 and 6 2 while four treatments nt st st ct ct nt and st increased wue by 5 7 16 8 3 5 maize grain yield maize grain yield was not only related with tillage practices but also to rainfall totals and its distribution among the three years the highest average grain yield 11265 kg ha 1 was observed in the humid year followed by a normal year 9669 kg ha 1 and a dry year 9530 kg ha 1 where rainfall totals during the growth period were 400 2 376 8 and 307 5 mm differences mainly resulted over kernels per ear which increased 13 2 in normal year and 19 0 in humid year table 4 conservation tillage remarkably increased grain yield especially in the dry year compared with ct nt st st ct and ct nt significantly p 0 05 increased grain yield by 21 9 14 7 and 15 7 in dry year in normal year nt st ct nt and st significantly increased grain yield by 10 0 15 7 and 20 9 respectively compared to ct all the treatments increased grain yield in humid years but the significant difference was only recorded in nt st and st ct with an increment of 8 7 and 16 8 3 6 relationship between rainfall sws et yield and wue correlation analysis table 5 revealed that there was a storage positive correlation between rainfall and et r 0 768 p 0 01 and significant correlation between rainfall and yield r 0 504 p 0 05 however a strong negative correlation between et and wue was observed r 0 792 but a markedly positive correlation was identified between et and grain yield r 0 665 suggesting that higher et depending on higher rainfall and higher et value created foundation for yield increment furthermore a remarkable positive correlation was identified between sws and grain yield r 0 514 which implies that tillage practices during the fallow period improved soil water storage capacity which provided basis for maize emergence and yield formation 4 discussion 4 1 tillage practices during fallow period increased soil water storage soil water content during early development stages are critical for maximizing grain yield and soil water storage during fallow period is closely related to tillage adoption in the current season alletto et al 2011 hou et al 2012a 2012b our results showed that conservation tillage practices during the fallow period maintained higher soil water storage in the 0 200 cm layer than conventional tillage with bare soil the combination of tillage practices with management during fallow could effectively improve soil water before sowing hou et al 2009 we also found that rotational tillage treatment could increase soil water storage sowing and increment degree depended on rainfall pattern and tillage practices when in a dry year nt st and ct nt significantly enhanced soil storage in comparison to single tillage nt st and ct nt st and st ct treatments increased soil storage in 0 200 cm layer by 7 5 and 2 7 in a humid year compared with ct no till with straw mulching can promote formation of soil water stable aggregates which resulted soil water holding capacity improvement extenuated wind erosion and mitigated soil degradation qin et al 2008 sub soiling with straw mulching could break hardpan or compacted depth of the soil and improve infiltration and water storage singh et al 2013 kuklik 2011 our work indicates that implementation of tillage practices during the fallow period could deepen the tilled layer and increase the capacity to accumulate rainfall sun et al 2015 while differences between soil storage are mainly due to the presence of residues that limit the penetration of solar radiation and consequent soil heating reducing evaporation from the surface alletto et al 2011 in the present study nt st displayed superiority across the three rainfall conditions which was in accordance with hou et al 2012a 2012b and he et al 2007 who demonstrated that nt coupled with sub soiling can loosen the soil and eliminate soil compaction caused by random wheel traffic wang et al 2012 reported tillage practices during the fallow period were beneficial to increase soil water storage during the whole growth period and soil water content and water availability for maize was generally higher under conservation tillage hou et al 2012a 2012b our work revealed that conservation tillage during fallow period could improve soil storage at 0 200 cm layer but the differences were only observed above 0 100 cm layer in humid and dry years in dry and humid years nt st and ct nt could efficiently increase water storage at jointing stage 100 cm below suggesting that rotational tillage with little soil disturbance had moisture reserved significantly larger than conventional tillage and soil availability persisted with growth period advanced aboudrare et al 2006 in our experiments nt st significantly enhanced soil storage at both stages jointing and filling stages in normal and dry years compared with nt the most likely possible explanation for these results is that the interval with nt and sub soiling with straw mulching decreased tillage times and made soil lumpy and porous which may have resulted in more water in the soil and decreased evaporation amir and sinclair 1996 in contrast after several successive years of no till system the soil appears to increase due to soil bulk density increment and porosity decrement thwarting rainfall infiltration and water storage zink et al 2011 soil water deficit degree was corresponding to rainfall conditions in this study the highest water deficit value was recorded in dry year followed by a normal year and a humid year additionally nt st recorded the lowest deficit value in dry year while ct nt in normal year and st in a humid year 4 2 tillage practices increased wue sharma et al 2011 illustrated that various tillage with mulching significantly increased soil water content 10 3 12 4 and enhanced wue by 17 2 in semi arid region huang et al 2012 the results of the present study revealed that all the conservation tillage decreased mean et by 3 4 6 3 in various rainfall conditions and increased mean wue by 6 2 17 8 meanwhile wue was improved to a great extent under nt st in the dry year followed by nt and st ct in the same year and ct nt in the normal year these results indicated that straw mulching and rotational tillage during this period promotes better usage of rainfall by making full use of water storage fuentes et al 2003 the results also suggested that conservation tillage practices during the fallow period could effectively capture rainfall and improve soil water in the sowing period chen et al 2015 and the efficacy is more pronounced in dry years conversely conventional tillage without straw mulching which is widely used in semi arid region remarkably increased soil water loss via evaporation shao et al 2016 4 3 tillage practices improved maize grain yield conservation tillage is conductive to improving soil water conservation and yield by adjusting soil water status however serious shortage of rainfall during the growth stage greatly limits the increment of crop growth and consequently resulted in yield decline hou et al 2013 in this study the highest yield mean 11265 kg ha 1 was observed in the humid year followed by normal mean 9669 kg ha 1 and dry years mean 9530 kg ha 1 but these differences were mainly attributed to rainfall and its distribution sufficient soil water supply was beneficial to seeding germination and development of maize chen et al 2015 the aim of maximizing the storage of rainfall during the period was to provide a water reverse to supplement the erratic rainfall during the life of the following crop aboudrare et al 2006 in the present study four conservation treatments nt st st ct ct nt and st successively increased grain yield by 13 2 7 6 11 4 and 5 8 when the rainfall was ignored while grain yield under nt was similar to conventional tillage suggesting that rotational tillage and st treatments could improve topsoil structure and aeration and it was favor for soil water conservation and improving soil holding capacity li et al 2012 adversely conventional tillage may have negative effects on water storage and consequences on maize development and yield alletto et al 2011 although no till nt treatment had a superiority in mitigating soil erosion and improving soil water the efficacy will be erased after several successive years tian et al 2016 and reduced crop root proliferation caused by soil bulk density at tilled depth results in grain yield reduction figuerola et al 2012 arvidsson et al 2014 this was contradicted by soane et al 2012 and shao et al 2016 who found that no till with straw mulching increased grain yield by 13 4 24 6 one possible explanation for this was that varying soil properties crop systems and weather factors greatly influenced experiment results comparative analysis of various parameters revealed that limited rainfall during growth stages resulting in decreased kernels per ear i e the number of kernels per ear table 4 in a dry year was 27 6 less than in the humid year and 5 1 less than in the normal year chen et al 2015 reported that soil water during the sowing period may contribute to 43 of grain yield moreover in the present study correlation analysis revealed that both soil storage sowing and rainfall had positive correlations with grain yield table 4 suggesting that rainfall is likely to be one of the most important factors affecting grain yield the study found that tillage practices during the fallow period have positive effects on grain yield in a semi arid region furthermore the conspicuous differences in the correction between et wue and yield also imply that conservation tillage should be introduced to enhance wue and grain yield in the semi arid region 5 conclusion the experiment assessed the effects of tillage practices during the fallow period on water use and maize yield at different rainfall conditions conservation tillage with straw mulching was found to increase soil storage at sowing stages and persist over time meanwhile rotational tillage increased grain yield and wue especially in a dry year the order of effectiveness was nt st ct nt st ct st nt ct therefore nt st could be a promising tillage practice

11493,soil moisture and nitrogen nutrient are the main factors affecting rice oryza sativa l production this study investigated the effects of irrigation regime and nitrogen rate on root morphology and physiology grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency in rice a soil grown experiment was conducted with three nitrogen rates namely 0 no nitrogen applied 240 normal amount mn and 360 kg ha 1 high amount and three irrigation regimes namely submerged irrigation 0 kpa alternate wetting and moderate drying 20 kpa and alternate wetting and severe drying 40 kpa over 2 years our results revealed significant interaction between irrigation and nitrogen regimes grain yield was the highest in mn coupled with mild water stress due to improved seed filling rate and grain weight at the same nitrogen level the root length root surface area root dry weight root activity and active absorbing area at main growth stages were higher in alternate wetting and moderate drying than in submerged irrigation furthermore the zeatin zeatin riboside and indole 3 acetic acid contents in root bleeding were increased but the root to shoot ratio was low after panicle initiation mn coupled with moderate drying enhanced rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency this treatment was the optimal water nitrogen interaction management model in this study our correlation analysis showed that grain yield positively correlated with the above morphological and physiological indices at main growth stages but negatively correlated with root to shoot ratio after mid tilling and abscisic acid aba content at maturity a

spiertz 2010 in the past years grain yield of rice has steadily increased worldwide partly owing to the enhancement in nutrient inputs from fertilizer especially nitrogen application fageria 2007 peng

amount of fertilizer applied for rice production in china has reached 60 22 million tons including 23 62 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer this amount has become the largest consumption worldwide national data of china 2015 unreasonable nitrogen input not only decreases nitrogen use efficiency but also increases production costs and result in a series of eco environment damage so ways should be sought to coordinately achieve high grain yield and high nutrient use efficiency rice is the maximum consumer of freshwater in agriculture and rice production is reduced annually due to drought and water shortage bouman and tuong 2001 ye et al 2015 pan et al 2017 with the increase in population rapid development of industry aggravation of environmental pollution and change in global climate the freshwater resources used for irrigation become increasingly scarce which severely threatens freshwater resources and rice production therefore the water use efficiency of rice should be improved and the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources should be alleviated to ensure food security many water efficient technologies such as nonflooded mulching cultivation aerobic rice semidry cultivation intensified rice system combined shallow water depth and wetting and alternate wetting and drying irrigation have been introduced to cope with the shortage in water resources zhao

rice production in china thus it is significant to improve the efficiency of water and fertilizer resources in agricultural production combining water and nitrogen refers to an integration of two factors that mutually affect the growth and development of crops the formation of yield and quality and the nitrogen use efficiency montgomery 1911 studied the effects of different soil fertilizers of

root analyzer system regent instruments inc quebec canada root active absorption area was determined using the methylene blue dyeing method zhang et al 1998 and root oxidation activity was calculated by measuring the oxidation of alpha naphthylamine in accordance with the method described by ramasamy et al 1997 3 2 root to shoot ratio aboveground fresh samples were sampled separated into different parts and then dried in an oven at 75 c to constant weight to calculate the shoot biomass afterward the root to shoot ratio was determined 3 3 root bleeding sap and root hormone content root bleeding sap was collected in accordance with the method described by yang et al 2002 rice plants from five hills of each plot were sampled at mid tillering pi heading and maturity stages each plant was cut at an internode of about 12 cm above the soil surface at 18 00 p m a pre weighed glass tube with absorbent cotton was set on the cutting edge of the stem in the field and covered with plastic sheets each hill was covered with a polyethylene sheet to protect against dust and insects the bleeding sap was collected until the next morning at 6 00 a m the test tube was weighed and the difference between

plants excluding the border ones sampled randomly from each plot the seed filling rate was defined as the ripened grains specific gravity 1 06 as a percentage of total spikelets 3 6 data analysis results were analyzed for variance using sas stat statistical analysis package version 6 12 sas institute cary nc usa data from each sampling data were analyzed separately means were tested by least significant difference at p 0 05 l s d 0 05 given that the results from the 2 years were remarkably similar some of the data are presented as the average for 2 years 4 results 4 1 analysis of variance of yield and main root characteristic statistical analyses showed significant differences in grain yield and main root indicators among the different nitrogen levels irrigation regimes and irrigation and nitrogen interactions in 2015 and 2016 p 0 01 but years year nitrogen levels year irrigation regimes and year nitrogen levels irrigation regimes were not significant table 2 the determined main indexes were not significant between the two years which indicated that grain yield and root characteristics showed good reproducibility in those two years 4 2 yield response and nitrogen agronomic efficiency grain yield and its components under different irrigation and nitrogen combination are presented in table 3 results showed a significant interaction between irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates but no significant interaction existed in two years grain yield reached 1074 1 g m 2 and was highest among all treatments in 2016 under the same nitrogen condition grain yield increased with alternate wetting and moderate drying and decreased significantly under alternate wetting and severe drying with an average reduction of 31 3 2016 when compared with 0n mn improved rice yield by 63 6 0 kpa 63 1 20 kpa 56 1 40 kpa hn increased rice yield by 59 5 0 kpa 58 6 20 kpa 20 9 40 kpa result indicated that nitrogen fertilizer application can enhance rice yield significantly compared with mn hn reduced grain yield but the difference was not significant when the water stress was severe the yield under hn decreased significantly which demonstrated that heavy nitrogen fertilizer application aggravated soil drought and reduced the effect of fertilizer regulation at the same nitrogen rates the number of panicles and spikelet per panicle decreased in addition the filled grains and 1000 grain weight significantly increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying compared with those under submerged irrigation such as the filled grains and 1000 grain weight were significantly enhanced by 4 3 and 0 83 g respectively in 2016 this result indicated that alternate wetting and moderate drying improved grain filling and thus promoted yield formation grain yield decreased significantly under alternate wetting and severe drying because of less panicle numbers spikelets and poor filled grains and grain weight under the same irrigation regimes increasing nitrogen application evidently improved the panicle which had the most contribution rate to rice yield consequently the yield increased significantly compared with that under no nitrogen treatment in this experiment the highest grain yield was obtained under the interaction of mn with alternate wetting and moderate drying this result was attributed to the improved filled grain rate and grain weight the agronomic utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer were 24 2 kg kg 1 25 2 kg kg 1 16 3 kg kg 1 under mn treatment 15 1 kg kg 1 15 7 kg kg 1 4 0 kg kg 1 under hn treatment the results indicated that it increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying treatment under the same nitrogen rates but no significant difference existed with the control submerged irrigation additionally severe water stress significantly reduced the nitrogen use efficiency by 7 5 24 3 2016 the nitrogen use efficiency of hn was significantly lower than that of mn under the same irrigation regimes results showed that nitrogen use efficiency significantly decreased with high nitrogen input 4 3 root length root weight root to shoot ratio root surface area and root active absorbing area under different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates root length presented an up down trend during the process of rice growth peaked at the heading stage and then declined table 4 under the same nitrogen rate management root length significantly increased by 15 5 on average with alternate wetting and moderate drying and decreased significantly with alternate wetting and severe drying the trends were consistent at the different growth stages compared with submerged irrigation treatments nitrogen fertilizer application can enhance root length remarkably but mn and hn treatments exerted no significant effects under the same irrigation regimes results showed that high nitrogen fertilizer exerted no evident increase in the total root length root length was excellent under the interaction of mn with alternate wetting and moderate drying with the growth process root weight peaked at the heading stage and then decreased table 4 under the same nitrogen application condition alternate wetting and moderate drying increased root weight by 4 2 24 3 at the pi stage by contrast alternate wetting and severe drying reduced root weight by 18 7 on average consistent performance were observed at the different growth stages the effect of different nitrogen applications on root weight was different under the same irrigation regimes root weight increased with nitrogen rates such increase was considerably evident before the heading stage root weight initially increased and subsequently decreased significantly with nitrogen rates under severe drying at the heading stage this result indicated that the application of high nitrogen rates under severe water stress inhibited the further improvement of root weight root to shoot ratio reflects the growth and development and the coordination of the underground and overground parts of crops this ratio is also an important indicator of whether crops can adapt to environmental factors such as nutrients and water the root to shoot ratio of rice decreased gradually with the growth process fig 1 under the same nitrogen rates except 0n alternate wetting and severe drying promoted the increase in root to shoot ratio which was remarkably evident before the heading stage under the same irrigation regimes the root to shoot ratio initially decreased and then increased except at mid tillering stage with nitrogen rates the results indicated that water status and nitrogen rates have consequences on root to shoot ratio at the same nitrogen rates the root surface area increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying table 5 and severe soil drying significantly reduced the root surface area consistent performance can be observed at the different stages the surface area of the root system improved evidently with the increase in nitrogen application rate especially in the pi and heading stages under the same irrigation regimes results showed that high nitrogen rates and moderate soil drying were beneficial to root surface area formation the active absorbing area of the roots reached the peak value at the heading stage and then decreased table 5 under the same nitrogen rates alternate wetting and moderate drying increased the root active absorbing area by 5 9 18 8 at the pi stage such area was reduced significantly by 16 7 33 3 at the heading stage under alternate wetting and severe drying consistent performance can be observed under different growth stages under the same irrigation regimes nitrogen application mn and hn enhanced the root active absorbing area remarkably compared with 0n significant reduction was observed under hn after the mid tillering stage compared with that under mn results showed that high nitrogen fertilizer amount cannot increase the root active absorbing area under the hn treatment which was excellent under the interaction of mn and alternate wetting and moderate drying 4 4 root oxidation activity root bleeding sap z zr iaa and aba content in root under different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates the root oxidation activity decreased gradually with the growth process fig 2 under the same nitrogen levels alternate wetting and moderate drying increased the root activity by 5 8 10 4 at the heading stage and promoted at the other growth stages under the same irrigation condition the root activity was the highest in mn and it decreased in hn the root activity of hn treatments was reduced by 7 4 7 0 8 0 and 11 1 from mid tillering to maturity stage compared with that in mn this result indicated that high nitrogen application cannot improve the root oxidation activity analysis of the effect of interaction of irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates showed that the root oxidation activity was the highest under the interaction of mn and alternate wetting and moderate drying with the growth process the root bleeding sap peaked at the heading stage and subsequently decreased fig 3 under the same nitrogen rates alternate wetting and moderate drying increased the root bleeding sap significantly by 9 0 17 0 at the pi stage the root bleeding sap was significantly reduced under alternate wetting and severe drying with an average reduction of 16 6 consistent performance can be observed under different growth stages root bleeding sap was the maximum under mn treatment in the same irrigation regime and it decreased under hn treatment compared with that in mn the root bleeding sap decreased by 10 7 7 3 and 5 4 from the pi to maturity stage the result indicated that high nitrogen rate application inhibited unexpectedly the amount of root bleeding root bleeding sap was the highest under the interaction of mn and alternate wetting and moderate drying the z zr and iaa contents in the roots reached the peak value at the heading stage and then decreased with the growth process figs 4 and 5 at the same nitrogen rates root z zr and iaa contents increased significantly under alternate wetting and moderate drying severe soil drying reduced the root z zr and iaa contents and consistent performance can be observed at the different stages the effect of different nitrogen rates on root z zr and iaa contents was different under the same irrigation regimes root z zr and iaa contents increased under submerged and moderate soil drying with nitrogen improvement and reduced significantly with the nitrogen rates under severe drying totally this result demonstrated that high nitrogen rate application under severe drying inhibited z zr and iaa contents in the roots the aba content in the roots increased gradually with the growth process fig 6 under the same nitrogen levels alternate wetting and severe drying increased the root aba content remarkably by 181 4 on average no significant difference can be observed between moderate soil drying and submerged treatment which was consistent at the different growth stages in the same irrigation regimes the aba content in the roots decreased significantly with nitrogen improvement from mid tillering to pi stage but no significant difference can be observed between mn and hn treatments after the heading stage notably the aba content in the roots improved remarkably under the interaction of severe soil drying and hn this result showed that heavy nitrogen application under severe soil drying aggravated the soil water potential which reduced the effect of fertilizer regulation 4 5 correlation analysis of root characteristics at different growth stages with yield and nitrogen agronomic efficiency under high yield the morphological and physiological characteristics of rice roots were related to yield table 6 correlation analysis showed a significant or extremely significant positive correlation among root length root weight root surface area active absorption area root oxidation activity and root bleeding sap at the main stage and yield r 0 721 0 949 and a negative correlation with root to shoot ratio from the pi to maturity stage a significant or considerably significant positive correlation was also observed between root z zr and iaa contents and yield while a negative correlation between aba content and yield table 6 existed this result indicated that the hormonal content at the different stages is closely related to grain yield a remarkable negative correlation was observed among root to shoot ratio at the main stage root weight at the pi stage and nitrogen agronomy efficiency table 7 furthermore a significant or extremely significant positive correlation among root active absorbing area from pi to maturity root oxidation activity root bleeding sap from the pi to heading stage and aba content before heading and nitrogen agronomy efficiency r 0 691 0 997 5 discussion before this study little information was available about the root morphology and physiology of rice and the interactions between root characteristics and grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency under different irrigation regime and nitrogen rate our results showed that the root morphology of rice was improved in the main growth period under alternative wetting and moderate drying root physiological activity was strengthened root weight and root length increased and the root oxidation activity root bleeding sap and active absorption area were improved significantly table 4 and 5 figs 2 and 3 these changes were assumed related to soil permeability luo 2010 observed that a cultivar with an improved root penetration ability can capture the maximum soil moisture and thereby preserve a favorable water status under water stress root permeability was improved the oxygen concentration of the rhizosphere was increased and the damage degree of the reducing substance such as fe2 h2s to the cells was decreased under alternative wetting and moderate drying under most conditions increases in root activity and root shoot ratio are closely associated with a high grain yield osaki et al 1997 yang et al 2004 ju et al 2015 root sourced auxin iaa can promote grain filling and assimilate transport to the grain by adjusting the nucleic acid and protein synthesis and by regulating the key enzyme activity of sucrose starch metabolism in grains root sourced cytokinins z zr play an important role in promoting endosperm cell division delaying plant senescence and enhancing leaf photosynthetic performance yang et al 2004 kato et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 chu et al 2014 ju et al 2015 our results showed that the hormone content in the roots increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying which improved the seeding rate and grain filling table 3 figs 4 6 correlation analysis also showed a significant or extremely significant positive correlation among root iaa z zr content and yield table 6 therefore improved root hormone of alternative wetting and moderate drying may benefit grain endosperm cell development promote grain filling and assimilate transport to the grain thereby causing high grain yield in the present study we observed that root growth was closely associated with grain yield table 6 root length root weight root surface area active absorption area and root oxidation ability moreover yield showed significant or considerably significant positive correlation table 6 which indicated yield increase with the improvement of root morphology and physiological activity notably root length root weight reduction root surface area active absorption area and root oxidation ability decreased significantly under alternate wetting and severe drying table 4 and 5 figs 2 and 3 this result indicated that the cell morphology and function of the roots were damaged which affected the maintenance of root function yang et al 2012 furthermore shoots that provide insufficient carbohydrates to roots can accelerate root senescence in the late growth stage and inhibit root ability to absorb nutrients and soil water accurately which is not conducive to yield formation cabangon et al 2004 wang et al 2016 similar observations were reported by other studies yang et al 2007 wang et al 2016 the root length and root hormone content were not significantly different between hn 360 kg hm 2 and mn table 4 figs 4 6 and the root bleeding sap root oxidation activity and root active absorbing area decreased table 5 figs 2 and 3 these results indicated that the root morphology and metabolic capacity were not improved significantly however root to shoot ratio was significantly higher in hn than in mn after the pi stage fig 1 maintaining a large root system requires competition for a large amount of shoot photosynthate passioura 1983 demonstrated that the energy used to produce unit root dry matter is twice as large as that of the shoots therefore a high root to shoot ratio or larger root volume results in ineffective consumption and exerts a negative influence on yield whether large amounts of water and fertilizer resources can significantly improve grain yield and whether high grain yield and high nutrient use efficiency can be coordinately achieved there is no consistent conclusion xue et al 2013 observed that site specific nitrogen management and alternate wetting and moderate drying increase the grain yield by 14 4 and nitrogen agronomic utilization by 64 1 when compared with the local farmers practice such increase is attributed to the increased physiological activities at the grain filling stage of rice nitrogen partial factor productivity is significantly positively correlated with rice yield liu et al 2013 indicating that high yield and high nitrogen efficiency are possible under certain conditions numerous studies about this topic were conducted the quality of rice source in high yield and high efficiency is improved especially post anthesis source and the physiological activity of the grain sink is enhanced prasertsak and fuka 1997 yang et al 2007 xue et al 2013 liu et al 2013 the characteristics of rice root system with high yield and high efficiency are still unknown moreover whether a synergy exists between the improvement in root morphology or optimization of physiological activity is unknown our results showed that the root to shoot ratio of rice decreased significantly at the heading stage under high yield and high efficiency root length and root weight were reduced when compared with those under hn treatment table 4 the difference in aboveground biomass was small data not shown correlation analysis also showed that the root to shoot ratio after the pi stage negatively correlated with grain yield and nitrogen utilization rate table 7 this result illustrated that the high yield and high efficiency of rice can avoid redundant self consumption and improve shoot growth which provide a basis for high yield additionally an increase of the active absorbing area root bleeding sap and root oxidation activity of rice root lead to an increase of yield and efficiency table 5 figs 2 and 3 the nitrogen absorption and assimilation were further enhanced so as to improve the nitrogen use efficiency therefore good root morphology and increased root metabolism contributed to high grain yield and high nitrogen use efficiency through the appropriate regulation of water interaction with nitrogen application in rice in the experiment we observed the interaction between irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates with only japonica rice cultivar many rice cultivars should be tested to investigate the difference in further research under different irrigation regime and nitrogen rates 6 conclusion rice root morphology and physiological activities were significantly different in response to different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rate treatments mn in combination with alternative wetting caused low root to shoot ratio and high active absorbing area root bleeding sap and root oxidation activity which can coordinate the development of underground and aboveground parts promote grain filling and facilitate grain yield grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency positively correlated with the active absorbing area root bleeding sap and root oxidation activity indexes at the main growth stages but negatively correlated with root to shoot ratio after the mid tillering stage and with aba content at the maturity stage mn in combination with alternative wetting and moderate drying holds considerable promise to increase the yield and nitrogen use efficiency in rice acknowledgements we acknowledge the grants from the national natural science foundation of china u1304316 the china scholarship council 201608410262 open

11493,soil moisture and nitrogen nutrient are the main factors affecting rice oryza sativa l production this study investigated the effects of irrigation regime and nitrogen rate on root morphology and physiology grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency in rice a soil grown experiment was conducted with three nitrogen rates namely 0 no nitrogen applied 240 normal amount mn and 360 kg ha 1 high amount and three irrigation regimes namely submerged irrigation 0 kpa alternate wetting and moderate drying 20 kpa and alternate wetting and severe drying 40 kpa over 2 years our results revealed significant interaction between irrigation and nitrogen regimes grain yield was the highest in mn coupled with mild water stress due to improved seed filling rate and grain weight at the same nitrogen level the root length root surface area root dry weight root activity and active absorbing area at main growth stages were higher in alternate wetting and moderate drying than in submerged irrigation furthermore the zeatin zeatin riboside and indole 3 acetic acid contents in root bleeding were increased but the root to shoot ratio was low after panicle initiation mn coupled with moderate drying enhanced rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency this treatment was the optimal water nitrogen interaction management model in this study our correlation analysis showed that grain yield positively correlated with the above morphological and physiological indices at main growth stages but negatively correlated with root to shoot ratio after mid tilling and abscisic acid aba content at maturity a significant negative correlation was also observed between root to shoot ratio and nitrogen efficiency meanwhile a significant or extremely significant positive correlation existed between root active absorbing area root activity root bleeding aba content and nitrogen efficiency these results suggest that adopting the alternate wetting and moderate drying with an appropriate nitrogen rate promotes root morphology and improves root activity thereby increasing grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency in rice abbreviations 0n no nitrogen applied mn normal nitrogen practice hn higher nitrogen

grain production and is the main staple food in asia fageria 2007 peng et al 2009 nitrogen fertilizer application is an important approach to increase grain yield in rice production ju et al 2009 spiertz 2010 in the past years grain yield of rice has steadily increased worldwide partly owing to the enhancement in nutrient inputs from fertilizer especially nitrogen application fageria 2007 peng et al 2009 faostat 2013 nevertheless excess nitrogen fertilizer application is often inefficiently used by the crop the average recovery efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer at present is only 33 at field level peng et al 2009 ju et al 2015 inefficient use of fertilizer nitrogen can harm the environment through surface runoff losses nitrate leaching into groundwater and volatilization into the water bodies or atmosphere vitousek et al 1997 ju et al 2009 spiertz 2010 xu et al 2012 wang et al 2016 furthermore it increases the susceptibility of the crop to lodging and disease fujinuma et al 2009 spiertz 2010 jat et al 2012 wang et al 2016 and constrains opportunities to increase rice yield peng et al 2011 nitrogen utilization in china is more aggravated according to the 2015 data the amount of fertilizer applied for rice production in china has reached 60 22 million tons including 23 62 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer this amount has become the largest consumption worldwide national data of china 2015 unreasonable nitrogen input not only decreases nitrogen use efficiency but also increases production costs and result in a series of eco environment damage so ways should be sought to coordinately achieve high grain yield and high nutrient use efficiency rice is the maximum consumer of freshwater in agriculture and rice production is reduced annually due to drought and water shortage bouman and tuong 2001 ye et al 2015 pan et al 2017 with the increase in population rapid development of industry aggravation of environmental pollution and change in global climate the freshwater resources used for irrigation become increasingly scarce which severely threatens freshwater resources and rice production therefore the water use efficiency of rice should be improved and the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources should be alleviated to ensure food security many water efficient technologies such as nonflooded mulching cultivation aerobic rice semidry cultivation intensified rice system combined shallow water depth and wetting and alternate wetting and drying irrigation have been introduced to cope with the shortage in water resources zhao et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 ye et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015 liang et al 2016 pan et al 2017 alternate wetting and drying irrigation is an effective water saving irrigation technique which has provided ideal economic and ecological benefits tuong et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 dong et al 2012 nalley et al 2015 pan et al 2017 it is widely applied in major rice producing countries in asia such as china philippines vietnam india and bangladesh kukal et al 2005 bouman 2007 rahman and bulbul 2014 wang et al 2016 the inefficient use of freshwater and nitrogen resources is a major problem in rice production in china thus it is significant to improve the efficiency of water and fertilizer resources in agricultural production combining water and nitrogen refers to an integration of two factors that mutually affect the growth and development of crops the formation of yield and quality and the nitrogen use efficiency montgomery 1911 studied the effects of different soil fertilizers of maize on water requirements leamer and painten 1953 found that crop yield is high with high fertilizer application in high soil moisture numerous studies have quantified the effects of water and

paolo and rinaldi 2008 sandhua et al 2012 sun et al 2012 ye et al 2013 wang et al 2016 pan et al 2017 however the root morphology and physiology under different water and nitrogen interaction and their relationship to shoots are not well understood crop roots are the main organs that absorb nutrients and water synthesize various organic acids hormones and amino acids and provide anchorage to

physiological function by transporting tissues ha et al 2012 however evidence on root morphology physiology and hormones content and their relationship to grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency under different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates is considerably scarce the present study 1 investigated the yield performance and nitrogen use efficiency under different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates 2 investigated the root morphological and physiological traits under different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates and 3 analyzed the relationship between root characteristics and grain yield and nitrogen utilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials a pool experiment was conducted at a farm belonging to henan university of science and technology henan province china

root weight root surface area root active absorbing area root bleeding sap root oxidation activity zeatin z zeatin riboside zr indole 3 acetic acid iaa and abscisic acid aba content in roots were determined the hypothesis is that good root morphology and high root activity improve grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency in rice through the regulation of irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates 3 sampling and measurement 3 1 root characteristic the length weight surface area active absorbing area bleeding oxidation activity and hormone content of the roots were determined at main stages of 20

hydropneumatic elutriation device gillison s variety fabrications benzonia mi usa the fresh and dry weights dried at 75 c of the roots were recorded portions of each root sample were used for measurements of the length surface area active absorbing area and oxidation activity of the roots the remaining roots were dried at 75 c to constant weight the roots were arranged floated on shallow water in a glass tray to investigate the root length and surface area 30 cm 30 cm scanned using a scanner epson expression 1680 scanner seiko epson corp tokyo japan and then analyzed using winrhizo root analyzer system regent instruments inc quebec canada root active absorption area was determined using the methylene blue dyeing method zhang et al 1998 and root oxidation activity was calculated by measuring the oxidation of alpha naphthylamine in accordance with the method described by ramasamy et al 1997 3 2 root to shoot ratio aboveground fresh samples were sampled separated into different parts and then dried in an oven at 75 c to constant weight to calculate the shoot biomass afterward the root to shoot ratio was determined 3 3 root bleeding sap and root hormone content root bleeding sap was collected in accordance with the method described by yang et al 2002 rice plants from five hills of each plot were sampled at mid tillering pi heading and maturity stages each plant was cut at an internode of about 12 cm above the soil surface at 18 00 p m a pre weighed glass tube with absorbent cotton was set on the cutting edge of the stem in the field and covered with plastic sheets each hill was covered with a polyethylene sheet to protect against dust and insects the bleeding sap was collected until the next morning at 6 00 a m the test tube was weighed and the difference between the two weights was the root bleeding for each stage the root bleeding sap was expressed as concentration per time unit per plant mg plant 1 h 1 the zr iaa and aba in the roots were extracted and then purified in accordance with the methods described by bollmark et al 1988 and he 1993 aba was quantified by using elisa as described previously yang et al 2001 the percentage recoveries of aba zr and

proven reliable wu et al 1988 zhang et al 1991 yang et al 2001 3 4 nitrogen use efficiencies agronomic nitrogen use efficiency was calculated based on the yield increase due to nitrogen application divided by nitrogen rate ju et al 2015 3 5 harvesting all plants were harvested on 13 15 october grain yield was determined from all plants from a 2 m2 site expect border ones and sampling area in each plot and adjusted to a moisture content of 0 14 g h2o g 1 fresh weight yield components i e the panicles m 2 spikelets per panicle filled grain rate and grain weight were determined from 50 plants excluding the border ones sampled randomly from each plot the seed filling rate was defined as the ripened grains specific gravity 1 06 as a percentage of total spikelets 3 6 data analysis results were analyzed for variance using sas stat statistical analysis package version 6 12 sas institute cary nc usa data from each sampling data were analyzed separately means were tested by least significant difference at p 0 05 l s d 0 05 given that the results from the 2 years were remarkably similar some of the data are presented as the average for 2 years 4 results 4 1 analysis of variance of yield and main root characteristic statistical analyses showed significant differences in grain yield and main root indicators among the different nitrogen levels irrigation regimes and irrigation and nitrogen interactions in 2015 and 2016 p 0 01 but years year nitrogen levels year irrigation regimes and year nitrogen levels irrigation regimes were not significant table 2 the determined main indexes were not significant between the two years which indicated that grain yield and root characteristics showed good reproducibility in those two years 4 2 yield response and nitrogen agronomic efficiency grain yield and its components under different irrigation and nitrogen combination are presented in table 3 results showed a significant interaction between irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates but no significant interaction existed in two years grain yield reached 1074 1 g m 2 and was highest among all treatments in 2016 under the same nitrogen condition grain yield increased with alternate wetting and moderate drying and decreased significantly under alternate wetting and severe drying with an average reduction of 31 3 2016 when compared with 0n mn improved rice yield by 63 6 0 kpa 63 1 20 kpa 56 1 40 kpa hn increased rice yield by 59 5 0 kpa 58 6 20 kpa 20 9 40 kpa result indicated that nitrogen fertilizer application can enhance rice yield significantly compared with mn hn reduced grain yield but the difference was not significant when the water stress was severe the yield under hn decreased significantly which demonstrated that heavy nitrogen fertilizer application aggravated soil drought and reduced the effect of fertilizer regulation at the same nitrogen rates the number of panicles and spikelet per panicle decreased in addition the filled grains and 1000 grain weight significantly increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying compared with those under submerged irrigation such as the filled grains and 1000 grain weight were significantly enhanced by 4 3 and 0 83 g respectively in 2016 this result indicated that alternate wetting and moderate drying improved grain filling and thus promoted yield formation grain yield decreased significantly under alternate wetting and severe drying because of less panicle numbers spikelets and poor filled grains and grain weight under the same irrigation regimes increasing nitrogen application evidently improved the panicle which had the most contribution rate to rice yield consequently the yield increased significantly compared with that under no nitrogen treatment in this experiment the highest grain yield was obtained under the interaction of mn with alternate wetting and moderate drying this result was attributed to the improved filled grain rate and grain weight the agronomic utilization rate of nitrogen fertilizer were 24 2 kg kg 1 25 2 kg kg 1 16 3 kg kg 1 under mn treatment 15 1 kg kg 1 15 7 kg kg 1 4 0 kg kg 1 under hn treatment the results indicated that it increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying treatment under the same nitrogen rates but no significant difference existed with the control submerged irrigation additionally severe water stress significantly reduced the nitrogen use efficiency by 7 5 24 3 2016 the nitrogen use efficiency of hn was significantly lower than that of mn under the same irrigation regimes results showed that nitrogen use efficiency significantly decreased with high nitrogen input 4 3 root length root weight root to shoot ratio root surface area and root active absorbing area under different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates root length presented an up down trend during the process of rice growth peaked at the heading stage and then declined table 4 under the same nitrogen rate management root length significantly increased by 15 5 on average with alternate wetting and moderate drying and decreased significantly with alternate wetting and severe drying the trends were consistent at the different growth stages compared with submerged irrigation treatments nitrogen fertilizer application can enhance root length remarkably but mn and hn treatments exerted no significant effects under the same irrigation regimes results showed that high nitrogen fertilizer exerted no evident increase in the total root length root length was excellent under the interaction of mn with alternate wetting and moderate drying with the growth process root weight peaked at the heading stage and then decreased table 4 under the same nitrogen application condition alternate wetting and moderate drying increased root weight by 4 2 24 3 at the pi stage by contrast alternate wetting and severe drying reduced root weight by 18 7 on average consistent performance were observed at the different growth stages the effect of different nitrogen applications on root weight was different under the same irrigation regimes root weight increased with nitrogen rates such increase was considerably evident before the heading stage root weight initially increased and subsequently decreased significantly with nitrogen rates under severe drying at the heading stage this result indicated that the application of high nitrogen rates under severe water stress inhibited the further improvement of root weight root to shoot ratio reflects the growth and development and the coordination of the underground and overground parts of crops this ratio is also an important indicator of whether crops can adapt to environmental factors such as nutrients and water the root to shoot ratio of rice decreased gradually with the growth process fig 1 under the same nitrogen rates except 0n alternate wetting and severe drying promoted the increase in root to shoot ratio which was remarkably evident before the heading stage under the same irrigation regimes the root to shoot ratio initially decreased and then increased except at mid tillering stage with nitrogen rates the results indicated that water status and nitrogen rates have consequences on root to shoot ratio at the same nitrogen rates the root surface area increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying table 5 and severe soil drying significantly reduced the root surface area consistent performance can be observed at the different stages the surface area of the root system improved evidently with the increase in nitrogen application rate especially in the pi and heading stages under the same irrigation regimes results showed that high nitrogen rates and moderate soil drying were beneficial to root surface area formation the active absorbing area of the roots reached the peak value at the heading stage and then decreased table 5 under the same nitrogen rates alternate wetting and moderate drying increased the root active absorbing area by 5 9 18 8 at the pi stage such area was reduced significantly by 16 7 33 3 at the heading stage under alternate wetting and severe drying consistent performance can be observed under different growth stages under the same irrigation regimes nitrogen application mn and hn enhanced the root active absorbing area remarkably compared with 0n significant reduction was observed under hn after the mid tillering stage compared with that under mn results showed that high nitrogen fertilizer amount cannot increase the root active absorbing area under the hn treatment which was excellent under the interaction of mn and alternate wetting and moderate drying 4 4 root oxidation activity root bleeding sap z zr iaa and aba content in root under different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates the root oxidation activity decreased gradually with the growth process fig 2 under the same nitrogen levels alternate wetting and moderate drying increased the root activity by 5 8 10 4 at the heading stage and promoted at the other growth stages under the same irrigation condition the root activity was the highest in mn and it decreased in hn the root activity of hn treatments was reduced by 7 4 7 0 8 0 and 11 1 from mid tillering to maturity stage compared with that in mn this result indicated that high nitrogen application cannot improve the root oxidation activity analysis of the effect of interaction of irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates showed that the root oxidation activity was the highest under the interaction of mn and alternate wetting and moderate drying with the growth process the root bleeding sap peaked at the heading stage and subsequently decreased fig 3 under the same nitrogen rates alternate wetting and moderate drying increased the root bleeding sap significantly by 9 0 17 0 at the pi stage the root bleeding sap was significantly reduced under alternate wetting and severe drying with an average reduction of 16 6 consistent performance can be observed under different growth stages root bleeding sap was the maximum under mn treatment in the same irrigation regime and it decreased under hn treatment compared with that in mn the root bleeding sap decreased by 10 7 7 3 and 5 4 from the pi to maturity stage the result indicated that high nitrogen rate application inhibited unexpectedly the amount of root bleeding root bleeding sap was the highest under the interaction of mn and alternate wetting and moderate drying the z zr and iaa contents in the roots reached the peak value at the heading stage and then decreased with the growth process figs 4 and 5 at the same nitrogen rates root z zr and iaa contents increased significantly under alternate wetting and moderate drying severe soil drying reduced the root z zr and iaa contents and consistent performance can be observed at the different stages the effect of different nitrogen rates on root z zr and iaa contents was different under the same irrigation regimes root z zr and iaa contents increased under submerged and moderate soil drying with nitrogen improvement and reduced significantly with the nitrogen rates under severe drying totally this result demonstrated that high nitrogen rate application under severe drying inhibited z zr and iaa contents in the roots the aba content in the roots increased gradually with the growth process fig 6 under the same nitrogen levels alternate wetting and severe drying increased the root aba content remarkably by 181 4 on average no significant difference can be observed between moderate soil drying and submerged treatment which was consistent at the different growth stages in the same irrigation regimes the aba content in the roots decreased significantly with nitrogen improvement from mid tillering to pi stage but no significant difference can be observed between mn and hn treatments after the heading stage notably the aba content in the roots improved remarkably under the interaction of severe soil drying and hn this result showed that heavy nitrogen application under severe soil drying aggravated the soil water potential which reduced the effect of fertilizer regulation 4 5 correlation analysis of root characteristics at different growth stages with yield and nitrogen agronomic efficiency under high yield the morphological and physiological characteristics of rice roots were related to yield table 6 correlation analysis showed a significant or extremely significant positive correlation among root length root weight root surface area active absorption area root oxidation activity and root bleeding sap at the main stage and yield r 0 721 0 949 and a negative correlation with root to shoot ratio from the pi to maturity stage a significant or considerably significant positive correlation was also observed between root z zr and iaa contents and yield while a negative correlation between aba content and yield table 6 existed this result indicated that the hormonal content at the different stages is closely related to grain yield a remarkable negative correlation was observed among root to shoot ratio at the main stage root weight at the pi stage and nitrogen agronomy efficiency table 7 furthermore a significant or extremely significant positive correlation among root active absorbing area from pi to maturity root oxidation activity root bleeding sap from the pi to heading stage and aba content before heading and nitrogen agronomy efficiency r 0 691 0 997 5 discussion before this study little information was available about the root morphology and physiology of rice and the interactions between root characteristics and grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency under different irrigation regime and nitrogen rate our results showed that the root morphology of rice was improved in the main growth period under alternative wetting and moderate drying root physiological activity was strengthened root weight and root length increased and the root oxidation activity root bleeding sap and active absorption area were improved significantly table 4 and 5 figs 2 and 3 these changes were assumed related to soil permeability luo 2010 observed that a cultivar with an improved root penetration ability can capture the maximum soil moisture and thereby preserve a favorable water status under water stress root permeability was improved the oxygen concentration of the rhizosphere was increased and the damage degree of the reducing substance such as fe2 h2s to the cells was decreased under alternative wetting and moderate drying under most conditions increases in root activity and root shoot ratio are closely associated with a high grain yield osaki et al 1997 yang et al 2004 ju et al 2015 root sourced auxin iaa can promote grain filling and assimilate transport to the grain by adjusting the nucleic acid and protein synthesis and by regulating the key enzyme activity of sucrose starch metabolism in grains root sourced cytokinins z zr play an important role in promoting endosperm cell division delaying plant senescence and enhancing leaf photosynthetic performance yang et al 2004 kato et al 2007 zhang et al 2012 chu et al 2014 ju et al 2015 our results showed that the hormone content in the roots increased under alternate wetting and moderate drying which improved the seeding rate and grain filling table 3 figs 4 6 correlation analysis also showed a significant or extremely significant positive correlation among root iaa z zr content and yield table 6 therefore improved root hormone of alternative wetting and moderate drying may benefit grain endosperm cell development promote grain filling and assimilate transport to the grain thereby causing high grain yield in the present study we observed that root growth was closely associated with grain yield table 6 root length root weight root surface area active absorption area and root oxidation ability moreover yield showed significant or considerably significant positive correlation table 6 which indicated yield increase with the improvement of root morphology and physiological activity notably root length root weight reduction root surface area active absorption area and root oxidation ability decreased significantly under alternate wetting and severe drying table 4 and 5 figs 2 and 3 this result indicated that the cell morphology and function of the roots were damaged which affected the maintenance of root function yang et al 2012 furthermore shoots that provide insufficient carbohydrates to roots can accelerate root senescence in the late growth stage and inhibit root ability to absorb nutrients and soil water accurately which is not conducive to yield formation cabangon et al 2004 wang et al 2016 similar observations were reported by other studies yang et al 2007 wang et al 2016 the root length and root hormone content were not significantly different between hn 360 kg hm 2 and mn table 4 figs 4 6 and the root bleeding sap root oxidation activity and root active absorbing area decreased table 5 figs 2 and 3 these results indicated that the root morphology and metabolic capacity were not improved significantly however root to shoot ratio was significantly higher in hn than in mn after the pi stage fig 1 maintaining a large root system requires competition for a large amount of shoot photosynthate passioura 1983 demonstrated that the energy used to produce unit root dry matter is twice as large as that of the shoots therefore a high root to shoot ratio or larger root volume results in ineffective consumption and exerts a negative influence on yield whether large amounts of water and fertilizer resources can significantly improve grain yield and whether high grain yield and high nutrient use efficiency can be coordinately achieved there is no consistent conclusion xue et al 2013 observed that site specific nitrogen management and alternate wetting and moderate drying increase the grain yield by 14 4 and nitrogen agronomic utilization by 64 1 when compared with the local farmers practice such increase is attributed to the increased physiological activities at the grain filling stage of rice nitrogen partial factor productivity is significantly positively correlated with rice yield liu et al 2013 indicating that high yield and high nitrogen efficiency are possible under certain conditions numerous studies about this topic were conducted the quality of rice source in high yield and high efficiency is improved especially post anthesis source and the physiological activity of the grain sink is enhanced prasertsak and fuka 1997 yang et al 2007 xue et al 2013 liu et al 2013 the characteristics of rice root system with high yield and high efficiency are still unknown moreover whether a synergy exists between the improvement in root morphology or optimization of physiological activity is unknown our results showed that the root to shoot ratio of rice decreased significantly at the heading stage under high yield and high efficiency root length and root weight were reduced when compared with those under hn treatment table 4 the difference in aboveground biomass was small data not shown correlation analysis also showed that the root to shoot ratio after the pi stage negatively correlated with grain yield and nitrogen utilization rate table 7 this result illustrated that the high yield and high efficiency of rice can avoid redundant self consumption and improve shoot growth which provide a basis for high yield additionally an increase of the active absorbing area root bleeding sap and root oxidation activity of rice root lead to an increase of yield and efficiency table 5 figs 2 and 3 the nitrogen absorption and assimilation were further enhanced so as to improve the nitrogen use efficiency therefore good root morphology and increased root metabolism contributed to high grain yield and high nitrogen use efficiency through the appropriate regulation of water interaction with nitrogen application in rice in the experiment we observed the interaction between irrigation regimes and nitrogen rates with only japonica rice cultivar many rice cultivars should be tested to investigate the difference in further research under different irrigation regime and nitrogen rates 6 conclusion rice root morphology and physiological activities were significantly different in response to different irrigation regimes and nitrogen rate treatments mn in combination with alternative wetting caused low root to shoot ratio and high active absorbing area root bleeding sap and root oxidation activity which can coordinate the development of underground and aboveground parts promote grain filling and facilitate grain yield grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency positively correlated with the active absorbing area root bleeding sap and root oxidation activity indexes at the main growth stages but negatively correlated with root to shoot ratio after the mid tillering stage and with aba content at the maturity stage mn in combination with alternative wetting and moderate drying holds considerable promise to increase the

adana 99 using sprinkler line source system during 2014 and 2015 seasons in the mediterranean region the irrigation strategies were conventional irrigation ci supplemental irrigation si during flowering sif si during grain filling sig si both during flowering and grain filling sifg these strategies were tested under four irrigation levels 100 75 50 25 of crop water requirement and a rain fed treatment was included as control conventional full irrigation ci100 treatment achieved the highest grain yield and maximum net return in both seasons the higher deficit irrigation treatments resulted in negative net return in dry season but positive in wet season sifg100 and sif100 generated a net return of 668 53 and 424 22 ha respectively ci75 produced more yield and net income in comparison with sifg100 that although irrigation amount was less but the yield and net income were 26 and 7 65 greater furthermore ci75 saved 23 3 of water with small grain yield reduction of 4 45 as compared to ci100 therefore ci75 can be recommended to maximize yield and net income under scarce water conditions in this study higher water stress occurring in the dry year helped to improve the grain quality and made it richer than wet year the findings showed positive response between the quality parameters such as protein content wet gluten content and sedimentation volume and water stress sifg75 treatment was the best irrigation strategy for high grain quality parameters with small yield reduction as compared to ci100 it could be recommended to obtain high yield and good quality indicators under mediterranean conditions keywords supplemental irrigation deficit irrigation line source sprinkler net return grain quality triticum aestivum 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important crops providing over 20 of the calories consumed by the world s population braun et al 2010 in the year 2050 the world population is estimated to be 9 billion while the demand for wheat is estimated to reach more than 900 million t dixon et al 2009 according to pala et al 2011 average yield gaps in morocco ranged from 98 to 207 in rainfed areas and from 51 to 89 in irrigated areas similarly yield gaps of 82 125 and 61 201 have been reported in syria and turkey respectively in relation to the study years 2014 and 2015 the wheat harvested area in turkey amounted to 7 7 and 7 9 million ha it produced 15 3 and 18 5 million t and consumed 17 5 and 17 8 million t grain world markets and trade 2015 winter wheat water use evapotranspiration depends on cultivar growth stage canopy and leaf structure climatic conditions irrigation soil and crop management practices the mediterranean region is characterized by a short rainy season november april increasing water deficit and thermal stress during wheat grain filling stage adequate water on or after anthesis period not only allows the plant to increase photosynthesis rate but also gives extra time to translocate the carbohydrate to grains zhang and oweis 1998 which improve grain size and thereby lead to increase grain yield tari 2016 padhi et al 2010 reported that grain yield straw and leaf area index have significant differences among treatments where the full irrigation treatment resulted in greatest values and these features decreased with increasing stress levels rao et al 2012 found the highest value of the total biomass grain yield and harvest index of wheat under full irrigation using line source sprinkler irrigation in comparison to deficit irrigation levels highest average grain yield of wheat was attained from the highest irrigation level full irrigation with a 7 day interval as 8 3 t ha and the lowest yield was obtained from rain fed treatment with 2 9 t ha in arid southeast anatolia region sezen and yazar 2006 rajala et al 2009 stated that drought reduces photosynthesis plant water content and leaf area development mary et al 2001 reported that the water stress has played a key role to reduce the moisture percentage while it increased protein and gluten contents water stress in the post anthesis grain filling period was found to affect quality parameters where an increase in protein content and sedimentation volume consistent with a decrease in grain yield 1000 grains weight bread volume and wet gluten were observed when a terminal water stress happened aslani et al 2013 noorka and silva 2012 found under normal irrigation condition the protein contents of wheat ranged from 11 20 to 13 78 while under water stress condition it ranged from 12 47 to 13 92 kiliç and yağbasanlar 2010 concluded that drought stress increased the chlorophyll content grain protein content and sedimentation tari 2016 found that the water stress applied in the stem elongation stage and irrigation applied in the milk stage increased the protein ratios while the highest protein ratios and gluten contents were obtained under the moisture conditions of full irrigation at milk stage 14 5 during the first year and under the full irrigation at heading and milk stage treatment 14 7 during the second year in konya plain in turkey erekul et al 2012 stated that sedimentation values and wet gluten contents at different supplemental irrigation doses ranged between 27 and 37 ml and 26 5 34 4 grain protein content ranged between 11 7 14 9 protein contents sedimentation values and wet gluten contents without irrigation were significantly higher than the values obtained from the supplemental irrigations on the other hand gooding et al 2003 reported that drought stress before the end of grain filling decreased sedimentation volume relative to drought applied later ozturk and aydin 2004 observed that late water stress increased grain protein sedimentation volume and wet gluten content relative to the fully irrigated treatment in a red grained winter bread variety naseri et al 2010 revealed that water stress increased protein contents by 10 3 13 2 in wheat while seleiman et al 2011 reported that less irrigation and water stress increased protein content by 11 20 13 40 as compared to full irrigation saint pierre et al 2008 expressed that with the application of si the protein content begins to decrease as expected attaining higher yields with increased productivity is only economical when the increased gains in crop yield are not offset by increased costs of other inputs oweis and hachum 2004 eid et al 2014 attained the best results under set sprinkler irrigation system and irrigation frequency three times per week with maximum wheat grain yield 5 8 t ha and net income 1289 3 ha on the other hand hand move sprinkler system and irrigation frequency once per week achieved the lowest yield 3 3 t ha and net income 199 ha in egyptian national research centre optimum water use in deficit irrigation is obtained by an economic analysis using yield and cost functions if land is limiting optimum irrigation strategy would be to apply the amount of water which maximizes net income as described by english and james 1990 many investigators have concluded that deficit irrigation can increase net farm income fardad and golkar 2002 zhang et al 2002 ali et al 2007 found highest net return of wheat under both land and water limiting conditions using 2 irrigation 130 mm amounted 87 1 and 154 3 ha with yield 3 3 t ha however under 4 irrigations 265 mm amounted 70 4 ha with yield 3 8 t ha and the lowest net income was negative 74 5 ha under the conditions of using 18 mm irrigation water since the cost of production was higher than gross return and yield was 1 8 t ha dağdelen et al 2009 stated that the reduction in the net income of the deficit irrigation treatments di 25 and di 50 was significant and seemed to be non profitable with negative values 2672 5 and 877 7 ha in the aegean region of turkey a few studies examined the appropriate conventional and supplemental irrigation dose and analyzed the economic return to determine the most economic irrigation system alternative hence the purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the economic feasibility of agriculture with conventional and supplemental irrigation strategies in the mediterranean region in order to maximize the net benefit from optimal wheat production no maximizing yield and determine the suitable si amount especially under limited water and land resources additionally this work was carried out to evaluate the effect of conventional and supplemental irrigation applied at the critical growth stages on grain yield and bread making properties in order to improve wheat quality and to study the correlation of different quality parameters and grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out in the research field of the irrigation and agricultural structures department at çukurova university 36 59 n lat 35 18 e long and altitude of 35 m asl located in adana turkey during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 wheat growing seasons using a local wheat triticum aestivum l cv adana 99 2 2 soil and water features the soil of the experimental site is classified as the mutlu soil series palexerollic chromoxeret fao 2006 with a clay texture throughout the soil profile and has a ph range 7 62 7 78 electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ece 0 12 0 19 ds m and volumetric soil water contents at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point wp of the root zone 40 41 and 19 24 respectively mean bulk density varies from 1 15 to 1 25 g cm3 the available water holding capacity of the soil is 198 mm in the 120 cm soil profile water is obtained from an open channel irrigation system in the experimental area and the quality is classified as c2s1 by ussl 1954 and ph is 7 8 and the average electrical conductivity is 0 78 ds m 2 3 climate çukurova region is placed in a semi arid climate weather data were collected from an automatic recording meteorological station located at the experimental site precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures air humidity wind speed and solar radiation measured on a daily basis and summarized for each growing season along with climatic data during the long term of period 1960 2015 are reported in table 1 2 4 experimental design and treatments in the experiment line source sprinkler design was employed for studying the effect of supplemental deficit irrigation strategies and irrigation levels on wheat yield and yield components separate sprinkler lines were employed for the main treatments and sprinkler lateral was laid out parallel to plant rows the line source sprinkler system was used to assess crop yield response to different levels of deficit irrigation where the applied irrigation water is uniformly distributed parallel to sprinkler lateral and water application gradually decreased with distance away from the line source sezen and yazar 2006 in this study four irrigation strategies were considered namely ci and si at flowering and grain filling sifg only at flowering stage sif and only at grain filling stage sig four irrigation levels in each irrigation strategy namely one full i100 and three deficit i25 i50 and i75 irrigations and a rain fed rf treatment were considered the experiment was carried out with randomized complete blocks design with four replications using line source sprinkler system for each irrigation strategy the amount of irrigation water applied in conventional full irrigation strategy is based on restoring root zone moisture deficit when 50 of available water is depleted in effective root zone depth of 90 cm to near field capacity for the full irrigation treatment next to the sprinkler lateral i100 the other irrigation treatments automatically received approximately linearly decreasing proportions 0 75 0 50 and 0 25 of the full irrigation amount for si strategies soil water deficit in 90 cm soil depth of the corresponding growth stage was replenished to field capacity for full irrigation level plots next to the sprinkler lateral wheat seeds were sown on november 22 2013 and december 8 2014 with an average row spacing of 18 cm the seeding rate was 250 kg ha fertilizers were added according to soil analysis recommendations where compound fertilizers of n p k 20 20 0 were applied 75 kg n 75 kg p2o5 as pure matter per hectare at planting stage the rest of n 2nd dose 75 kg ha was applied in the form of urea 46 n during jointing stage and the 3rd dose at rate of 75 kg ha of ammonium nitrate 33 ammonium 16 5 and nitrate 16 5 was applied at flowering stage herbicides were sprayed one time on 7th march and on 5th march against the weeds during the first and second cropping seasons wheat was harvested at full maturity on may 22 2014 and june 9 2015 2 5 measurements and observations 2 5 1 soil water content the soil water content was measured by gravimetric method dry oven at 105 c for 24 h at planting and harvesting by using hand auger at 30 cm depth increments down to 90 cm soil profile during the wheat growing season soil water content was monitored approximately two week intervals and prior to water application by a neutron probe hydroprobe model 503 through an aluminum access tube installed to a depth of 120 cm in the middle of each plot 2 5 2 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration of wheat eta for individual plots was determined for total seasonal and between the growing stages by using the soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 as follows et i p δ sw dp ro where i the amount of applied water irrigation mm that is measured in the 4 catch cans parallel to line source located in the center of each plot p the precipitation mm that is measured at the weather station on the site δsw is the change of soil water content mm between any consecutive irrigations in the 90 cm soil profile taken as effective root zone depth dp the drainage from the bottom of the root zone below 90 cm depth ro surface runoff occurring during the study seasons ro from the experimental plots was negligible as there was sufficient surface roughness due to dry sowing for water infiltration also there were low ridges of sowing lines dp was also assumed to be negligible since single rainfall amount and distribution during the growing seasons did not exceed soil water storage capacity in the 90 cm soil depth 2 5 3 grain yield and quality characteristics for determining the grain yield the air dry weight of grains per 4 m2 plot was recorded this observation was used for computing grain yield in kg per ha 1000 grain weight values were also determined on these samples grain protein content was analyzed as nitrogen by the kjeldahl method according to method no 46 10 as described in aacc 2000 the protein content was then calculated by multiplying the nitrogen content by a constant of 5 7 han and yang 2009 wet gluten content was determined by the gluto matic method using gluten washing device perten glutomatic system in addition this content was calculated by dividing total gluten content by the weight of the sample mudawi et al 2016 the sedimentation value was determined by the procedure outlined in method no 56 61 3 as described in aacc 2000 2 6 economical evaluation the economic analysis was performed using partial budgeting technique in order to determine the maximum net income ni which was computed by subtracting all the production costs from gross incomes for all treatments all calculations were done based on a unit area of one hectare sezen et al 2011 wheat production costs and sale prices were obtained from the chamber of farmer association and agricultural provincial directorate in adana production costs include land rental land taxes fertilization seeds soil cultivation plant protection labour cost for agricultural processes irrigation harvesting threshing transportation and marketing costs for the calculation of the total cost of wheat production for one hectare the sum of crop production costs the annual cost of the irrigation system irrigation labour and water cost are taken into account the net income for each treatment was computed by subtracting all production costs from gross incomes 2 7 statistical analysis the experimental data were analyzed statistically by using computer software program sas statistical analysis system version 9 00 ts level 00m0 xp pro platform and comparison between different treatment means were made through duncan s multiple range test at 5 probability level 3 results and discussions 3 1 soil water content variation during the dry season 2014 the soil water content swc appeared to be lower in the beginning of the season at planting until tillering growth stage owing to no rain in relation to the wet season 2015 due to sufficient rainfall the soil water content values were higher during the first growth stages of winter wheat where the swc started increasing after planting to reach its maximum value in the season on 78 dap 369 6 mm 90 cm then decreased gradually to the lowest levels observed during heading flowering and grain filling stages which resulted in the gradual increase of water stress during these periods furthermore the swc increased early in conventional strategy due to irrigation applied on 116 dap at heading stage on the other hand swc decreased in sifg and sif irrigation strategies until flowering stage then swc increased following an irrigation application on 130 dap in flowering stage in relation to the irrigation at grain filling stage strategy the soil water content continued to decrease more than sif and sifg strategies due to relatively late irrigation application on 138 dap in grain filling stage generally the lowest soil water stress during all the growth stages of wheat occurred in conventional strategy relative to the first year data it was noted that the soil water content was below wp at the end of the season for rf ci25 and sifg25 this also occurred with sif strategy under 75 50 and 25 irrigation levels during the grain filling stage however the soil water content fluctuated gradually between fc and wp until the end of the season for the rest of the treatments in both seasons 3 2 crop water use evapotranspiration seasonal eta values in 2013 2014 growing season ranged from 293 mm in rf to 485 mm in ci100 and varied between 474 mm in rf and 645 mm in ci100 in the second year table 2 the seasonal eta of full conventional irrigation treatment was higher than full supplemental irrigation strategies of sifg100 sif100 and sig100 by 4 9 13 3 and 2 9 in the 2013 14 growing season and the corresponding values in the second year were 5 7 16 9 and 9 1 respectively since the precipitation during the 2013 2014 growing season from november to march was relatively scarce the evapotranspiration eta was mainly from applied irrigation water the weather conditions prevailed during 2014 2015 growing season with higher demand for evaporation and resulted in greater seasonal eta than in 2013 2014 overall eta values were higher in the 2014 2015 growing season over different growth stages with maximum eta occurring in the flowering and grain filling stages in general eta increased with increasing irrigation quantity in the treatments 3 3 grain yield mean grain yields were different p 0 05 among the treatments in both experimental years table 2 ci100 produced significantly greater grain yield of 5868 and 8258 kg ha in the first and second year respectively and the lowest grain yield was recorded in the rainfed treatment in both years irrigation levels resulted in significantly different yields as the amount of irrigation water increased grain yield also increased in each irrigation strategy similar results were reported by sezen and yazar 2006 in the mediterranean region mean grain yields in the second year were higher than in the first one due to favorable climatic conditions prevailed in the second growing season the maximum air temperature during the grain milk stage in the first year april 7 16 2014 was 30 7 c which was 8 5 c warmer than second year april 18 29 2015 and resulted in accelerated leaf senescence and shortened grain filling duration that caused to reduce the 1000 grain weight on average by 11 0 and grain yield by 39 the results confirmed the findings of mian et al 2016 who reported that rising of air temperature at grain filling stage resulted in reduced grain yield of wheat increasing mean temperatures during the growing season have been reported to reduce grain yields of irrigated well watered wheat crops under field conditions due to a shortening of the growing season less light interception and less kernels per unit area wheeler et al 1996 lobell and ortiz monasterio 2007 the increased air temperatures during the anthesis stage also in the first year resulted in lower number of grains per spike on average by 19 3 than in the second year thus warmer temperatures in this sensitive stage disrupted pollination process consequently it reduced the ability of wheat plants to produce more grains the results agree with the study of hatfield and prueger 2015 who observed that exposure to high temperatures at pollination reduced grain yield in general the reduction of grain yield in dry season may be attributed to the combined impacts of water and heat stress on yield components such as number of grains per spike and thousand grain weight full supplemental irrigation strategies sifg100 sif100 and sig100 produced lower grain yields by 16 3 29 4 and 20 4 in the first year and by 7 0 17 1 and 10 7 in the second year as compared to ci100 the relative reduction of yield under full supplemental irrigation strategies is because of occurrence of water stress during vegetative flowering and grain filling stages sifg100 and sif100 resulted in reduced irrigation by 10 7 and 45 9 in the first year and about 13 0 and 61 2 in the second one respectively in comparison with ci100 rf treatment control resulted in decreased yields of 49 2 39 8 and 46 4 as compared to full supplemental irrigation treatments sifg100 sif100 and sig100 respectively in the dry season whereas these values decreased to 25 4 16 3 and 22 3 respectively in the wet season due to the relative increase of soil moisture in the field in the beginning of the season regarding irrigation scheduling at different growth stages it was observed that irrigation in grain filling stage increased the grain yield by 12 and 7 compared to irrigation at flowering stage during the first and second seasons respectively these results are in agreement with tari 2016 who concluded that water deficit should be applied during the milk grain stage to minimize yield losses of wheat our results also confirm the findings of rao et al 2012 3 4 grain quality properties 3 4 1 grain weight it was found that sifg100 ci100 sif100 and sig100 treatments resulted 1000 grain weight values of 49 0 51 6 42 0 and 45 2 g respectively in the first year and 50 8 52 8 47 3 and 49 7 g in the second one in general deficit irrigation levels produced significantly lower 1000 grain weight values than full irrigation in each strategy table 2 sifg100 and sif100 increased 1000 grain weight significantly by 41 6 and 21 3 respectively in comparison with rf in the first year however the corresponding increases amounted to 19 8 and 11 5 respectively in the second year the results are in line with the findings of pierre et al 2008 who reported that water stress reduced yield and 1000 grain weight under rain fed compared to supplementary irrigation the response of 1000 grain weight to irrigation strategies differed depending on irrigation levels and at which wheat growth stage it was applied for instance ci75 increased 1000 grain weight by 15 5 and 12 0 in 2014 and 15 and 6 6 in 2015 in comparison with sif75 and sig75 respectively in both growing seasons the deficit irrigation sifg75 strategy resulted in decreased 1000 grain weight by 6 2 and 5 4 compared with ci75 treatment sig100 and sifg100 produced greater 1000 grain weight as compared with sif100 in both experimental years these results confirmed the effect on the 1000 grain weight sensitivity to irrigation at the grain filling stage our findings are in agreement with aown et al 2012 who stated that the1000 grain weight and grain yield were proved to be sensitive to drought at both stages flowering and grain filling however drought stress at grain filling reduced these two parameters to a greater extent of 38 5 and 56 5 over well watered treatment respectively as a result of the present study it was observed that 1000 grain weight decreased with increasing water deficit magnitudes rf treatment resulted in the decrease in thousand grain weight that amounted to 32 9 and 19 6 compared to ci100 in dry and wet season respectively it means that the capability of irrigation to raise the soil water content in the root zone and stimulate the wheat growth and photosynthesis rate reflected in increasing the grain yield production 3 4 2 protein content irrigation strategies had significantly different effects on protein content of wheat grain an inverse relation between protein content and irrigation water was observed and the highest value of protein content 15 9 was found in rain fed treatment which resulted in significant superiority to the other treatments in the first year the similar trend of protein content to water regime was observed in the second year when the rain fed treatment achieved the maximum significant value of protein content with an average 14 5 based on this given data the drier conditions in the first year helped to improve the protein quality as compared with wetter conditions in the second season however the lowest protein content was obtained in ci100 treatment high consumptive use with an average of 11 5 and 11 2 in the first and second year respectively in addition yield obtained in rf treatment in the first year was 57 5 lower than in ci100 treatment but protein percentage was 38 2 higher however the corresponding values were comparatively lower in the second year in which the water stress under rf treatment reduced the grain yield to 30 6 and increased protein content by 29 4 in respect to ci100 these findings are in line with findings of saint pierre et al 2008 naseri et al 2010 seleiman et al 2011 and noorka and silva 2012 with reference to statistical analysis data in table 3 sif100 resulted in significant increase in protein content by 21 7 and 14 7 in comparison to ci100 and sifg100 respectively in the first year and 17 8 and 6 4 in the second one this means that applying irrigation just once early at flowering stage influenced wheat protein content more than irrigating twice at flowering and grain filling stages therefore these results reveal that the environmental factors such as water stress and high temperatures during grain filling period max air temperature in april was 30 7 c in the first year have important effect on grain protein accumulation and bread quality similar results were reported by aslani et al 2013 who stated that water stress in the post anthesis grain filling period was found to affect quality parameters such as increase in protein content and sedimentation volume in the first year the water applied in grain filling stage increased significantly the protein ratio by 4 3 compared to full conventional strategy in this respect supplemental irrigation in grain filling stage decreased the protein content by 14 2 compared with applying supplemental irrigation at flowering stage in the second year application of si in grain filling stage caused significant increase in protein content by about 5 over the conventional strategy while the si at grain filling resulted in a 10 6 reduction in protein content in comparison to that of supplemental irrigation at flowering stage these results were in contrast to the findings of tari 2016 who found irrigation applied in the milk stage increased the protein ratios and the highest protein ratios and gluten contents were obtained under the full irrigation treatment at milk stage in central anatolia conditions 3 4 3 wet gluten content gluten content is a very important trait for the assessment of flour quality the unique properties of endospermic protein are called gluten the wet gluten content was affected by both the magnitude of water deficit and the growing stages rainfed treatment resulted in the significantly highest wet gluten content in both years followed by sif25 sig25 sifg25 and ci25 the lowest and highest wet gluten content were related to applied water quantity the full conventional irrigation treatment achieved the lowest gluten content with decrease of 34 1 and 32 1 in the first and second year in comparison with the rain fed treatment wet gluten content increased with increasing water stress magnitude in the treatments the results are in agreement with the conclusion of erekul et al 2012 who reported the wet gluten contents under rf treatment were found significantly higher than the values obtained from the irrigated treatments the wet gluten content obtained in sig100 was higher than in ci100 treatment by 14 and 11 in the first and second year respectively wet gluten content values of sig100 were lower by 2 5 and 2 2 than supplemental irrigation of sifg100 in 2014 and 2015 furthermore ci100 decreased wet gluten content by 14 5 in comparison with sifg100 in the first year and 11 9 in the second one table 3 these findings suggest that wet gluten content responded well to different water stress in the dry and wet seasons in both growing seasons occurrence of severe water stress in post anthesis stage under sif strategy resulted in the highest gluten content in comparison with other strategies these results are in agreement with mary et al 2001 and ozturk and aydin 2004 who stated that the water stress increased wet gluten content relative to the fully irrigated treatment 3 4 4 sedimentation value the sedimentation values under the different treatments are provided in table 3 the greatest sedimentation volume was found under rf and the lowest value was under ci100 in both experimental years severe water stress treatments under si resulted in higher sedimentation value than lower and moderate stress treatments water stress and hot weather higher than 30 c under mediterranean climatic conditions during the grain filling period caused an increase by 24 4 and 28 1 of sedimentation volume in sif100 over sig100 in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons furthermore in the first year sif increased sedimentation volume to 16 5 and 35 5 in comparison with sifg and ci in the second year the severe water stress in sif with only single irrigation elevated sedimentation content significantly compared to the values obtained in the first year which reached to 21 1 and 38 4 over the irrigation at sifg and ci respectively the sedimentation values in the second year were lower and the sedimentation ranges were relatively larger as compared to first year the results are in line with findings of gooding et al 2003 who reported that drought stress before the end of grain filling decreased sedimentation volume relative to drought applied later the research results revealed that the sifg100 increased sedimentation volume by 6 7 and 16 2 in the first year and by 5 7 and 14 2 in the second year compared to sig100 and ci100 therefore for raising the wheat sedimentation value and improving the bread quality supplemental irrigation sifg100 could be applied under mediterranean region kiliç and yağbasanlar 2010 and erekul et al 2012 reported that the sedimentation values changed depending on si doses and higher deficit irrigation improved grain quality by increasing sedimentation volume unit 3 4 5 the relations between yield and seasonal average available water with grain quality characteristics the relationships between grain yield and grain quality and between grain quality and 0 9 m profile available water were represented in figs 1 and 2 under water stress conditions of dry year the grain quality properties protein content wet gluten and sedimentation value showed high coefficient of determination with grain yield that recorded r2 0 81 0 89 and 0 85 in the first year however the corresponding values in the second year were 0 74 0 81 and 0 84 respectively the results are in agreement with aslani et al 2013 who found that water stress in the post anthesis grain filling period caused an increase in protein content and sedimentation volume consistent with a decrease in grain yield 1000 grains weight bread volume and wet gluten that were observed when a terminal water stress happened in relation to the response of grain yield to grain quality in this study linear relationship of wheat grain yield and quality parameters recorded highly negative and significant correlations similar findings were stated by oury and godlin 2007 who reported the protein contents gluten quality and contents have significantly negative correlations with grain yield and thousand kernel weights under normal and stress conditions it is known that yield reduction that generally occurs under water stress conditions is generally associated with an increase in protein content rharrabti et al 2003 garrido lestache et al 2005 guttieri et al 2005 dupont et al 2006 pompa et al 2009 with reference to effect of seasonal average available water in 0 9 m soil depth as independent variable on grain quality characteristics as dependent variable it was observed that when the available water in root zone decreases the wheat grain properties increase and the yield decreases the winter wheat quality parameters are correlated significantly and negatively with available water in soil and coefficient of determination was r2 0 76 and 0 80 in the first year and r2 0 73 and 0 79 in the second year for protein and wet gluten values respectively the statistical data expressed that grain quality responded well to applied water in the root zone of wheat the results were in agreement with kanani et al 2013 who reported that the effect of drought stress on gluten percentage increased in drought stress compared to normal conditions ozturk and aydin 2004 also confirmed our results and reported water stress increased grain protein sedimentation volume and wet gluten content relative to the fully irrigated treatment in winter bread wheat 3 5 economical analysis the total costs gross income and net income ni of wheat under different irrigation strategies for the experimental years were presented in tables 4 and 5 the wheat production cost were taken from turkish annual statistical book in 2014 and 2015 prices in dollars were determined according to turkish central banks s exchange rates of 2 2 tl in 2013 2014 and 2 4 tl in 2014 2015 in addition the wheat sales price was calculated integrating selling price of seeds and side porducts together which equaled 0 33 kg in the first year and 0 34 kg in the second one the total costs in ha for ci100 were divided as following irrigation labor cost 1 2 water cost 4 1 crop production 64 7 and annual cost of irrigation system 30 in the first year on the other hand in the second year the corresponding percentages were 0 8 2 4 69 4 and 27 3 respectively the total costs of wheat production increased steadily with increasing applied water quantity from 25 to 100 irrigation level under each strategy where the highest value was recorded under ci100 1335 32 and 1571 66 ha in the first and second year respectively and the lowest value in rf 863 6 and 1091 37 ha in 2014 and 2015 respectively this increase in production costs for ci100 compared to rf treatment was due to cost of irrigation labor water cost and annual cost of irrigation system in ci100 all the variable costs are fixed except irrigation cost in order to evaluate the effect of irrigation strategies and irrigation levels on net income in the first year the higher deficit irrigation levels sig25 50 sif25 50 sifg25 and ci25 resulted in negative net income ranged between 21 73 and 387 88 ha the lowest negative net income was found in sig50 as compared to ci100 and net income difference between these two treatments amounted to 622 86 ha sig50 resulted in less irrigation by 48 6 and in yield reduction of 34 in comparison to ci100 however the highest negative net income value occured in sif25 treatment the reduction in net income value in sif25 amounted to 989 ha along with irrigation and yield reduction of 76 4 and 53 9 table 6 similar results are reported by ali et al 2007 who stated that the net return of wheat fluctuated between positive and negative values depending on irrigation quantity and crop production costs in the second year the net income values for the irrigation strategies were all positive that refers to the gross income values being higher than the production costs consequently in general the reduction in net income appreared lower in the second season in comparison with the first season sif25 treatment generated the lowest net income with a reduction of 809 12 ha and with irrigation and yield reduction of 90 3 and 30 4 in comparison with ci100 sig50 treatment caused a reduction in net income 674 83 ha and irrigation and yield reduction of 61 5 and 25 1 rf in the first year generated negative net return but this net return 41 9 ha was greater than those of sif25 50 and sig25 which resulted in net returns of 83 64 387 88 and 244 39 ha respectively similar results were obtained in the second year but the net return values were all positive for the abovementioned treatments the net return of the rf 854 56 ha was higher than all irrigation levels of sif strategy furthermore the rf generated greater net income than ci25 sifg50 25 and sig50 25 treatments the decrease in net income of above mentioned si treatments compared to rf was attributed to the irrigation costs irrigation labor costs water cost and annual cost of irrigation system hence it is recommended that planting wheat under rf is more profitable than applying si during flowering level 50 and 25 and grain filling stage level 25 under dry years and using sprinkler system in wet years applying si during flowering grain filling level 25 and 50 and in both flowering and grain filling stages level 25 and 50 are less profitable than rf conditions the economical analysis of wheat production revealed that in general the yield increased with increasing irrigation water that in turn resulted in higher net incomes ci100 treatment which produced the greatest grain yield 5868 and 8258 kg ha generated the maximum net return 601 12 and 1236 17 ha in the dry and wet years respectively these findings are in agreement with the conclusion of eid et al 2014 who indicated the net income of wheat changed between 199 and 1289 3 ha depending on sprinkler system and irrigation frequency the full conventional irrigation strategy surpassed the other full supplemental irrigation strategies on net income per hectare with increase amounting at 308 48 537 96 and 387 74 ha for sifg100 sif100 and sig100 respectively in the first year the reductions in net income during the second year were lower due to lower differences in yield between full irrigation treatments the net income reductions were 191 76 450 89 and 291 56 ha for sifg100 sif100 and sig100 respectively regarding irrigation volumes the mentioned full supplemental irrigation treatments resulted in irrigation reduction of 294 5 m3 ha 10 7 1266 8 m3 ha 45 9 and 292 4 m3 ha 10 6 respectively in comparison with ci100 in the first year however irrigation reduction in the second one reached 245 30 m3 ha 13 1 1148 40 m3 ha 61 2 and 433 30 m3 ha 23 1 respectively therefore when the water resources are relatively abundant the grower will select the strategy that maximizes net income per unit land thus the treatment c100 is the appropriate strategy under these conditions in spite of the irrigation quantity of deficit conventional irrigation level 75 2161 5 m3 ha being lower than sifg100 strategy 2463 8 m3 ha in the first year the yield and net income of ci75 were 39 5 and 10 1 greater than sifg100 in the second season the results confirmed the first one when the applied water to ci75 treatment 1407 30 m3 ha was lower than sifg100 treatment 1631 1 m3 ha but net income and yield were higher by 12 5 and 5 2 for ci75 in comparison with sifg100 which was due to applying one additional irrigation at heading stage under ci75 in this respect the results confirm that the appropriate irrigation scheduling can reduce the irrigation water supply of crop and produce more yield and net financial income of wheat 3 5 1 the relation between wheat yield and net income the regression equation of net income against grain yield was shown in fig 3 the present results indicated high positive and significant relation between the net income and grain yield that recorded r2 0 71 and 0 55 in the first and second year respectively the slopes of the relations were similar but the intersection values differed considerably between the years 4 conclusions the results of two year study demonstrated that conventional full irrigation ci100 treatment achieved the highest grain yield and maximum net return in both seasons full supplemental irrigation strategies sifg100 sif100 and sig100 produced lower grain yields as compared to ci100 the results confirmed that the wheat was not equally sensitive to water stress at different growth stages the wheat crop under sif strategy suffered a greater yield loss than the other strategies the supplemental irrigation during grain filling or during both flowering and grain filling proved to be more effective to increase the yield in comparison with irrigation under sif strategy the results showed that with some yield reduction under a limited water supply ci75 crop water use could be reduced to a level at which a sustainable grain yield and agricultural water use could be achieved in the mediterranean region an inverse relation between protein content and irrigation water was observed and the highest value of grain quality found in rain fed treatment which resulted in significant superiority to the other treatments applying irrigation just at flowering or grain filling stage improved grain quality protein content wet gluten content and sedimentation volume more than conventional irrigation therefore these findings reveal that the environmental factors such as water stress and high temperatures during grain filling period have important effect on grain quality accumulation and bread quality in this study a positive and significant relationship between the net income and grain yield based on growth stage irrigation scheduling and environmental conditions that can be used as an indicator to optimize wheat net income for farmer under water limited environments the full irrigation treatment sifg100 resulted in higher net income with small water reduction compared to full irrigation treatment sig100 so we concluded that in order to develop optimal irrigation management for supplemental irrigation strategies irrigating at flowering and grain filling development stages would be more economical to achieve higher wheat grain production and net income 
11494,this study evaluated the effect of different supplemental and conventional irrigation strategies on economical parameters yield and grain quality characteristics of wheat triticum aestivum l cv adana 99 using sprinkler line source system during 2014 and 2015 seasons in the mediterranean region the irrigation strategies were conventional irrigation ci supplemental irrigation si during flowering sif si during grain filling sig si both during flowering and grain filling sifg these strategies were tested under four irrigation levels 100 75 50 25 of crop water requirement and a rain fed treatment was included as control conventional full irrigation ci100 treatment achieved the highest grain yield and maximum net return in both seasons the higher deficit irrigation treatments resulted in negative net return in dry season but positive in wet season sifg100 and sif100 generated a net return of 668 53 and 424 22 ha respectively ci75 produced more yield and net income in comparison with sifg100 that although irrigation amount was less but the yield and net income were 26 and 7 65 greater furthermore ci75 saved 23 3 of water with small grain yield reduction of 4 45 as compared to ci100 therefore ci75 can be recommended to maximize yield and net income under scarce water conditions in this study higher water stress occurring in the dry year helped to improve the grain quality and made it richer than wet year the findings showed positive response between the quality parameters such as protein content wet gluten content and sedimentation volume and water stress sifg75 treatment was the best irrigation strategy for high grain quality parameters with small yield reduction as compared to ci100 it could be recommended to obtain high yield and good quality indicators under mediterranean conditions keywords supplemental irrigation deficit irrigation line source sprinkler net return grain quality triticum aestivum 1 introduction wheat triticum aestivum l is one of the most important crops providing over 20 of the calories consumed by the world s population braun et al 2010 in the year 2050 the world population is estimated to be 9 billion while the demand for wheat is estimated to reach more than 900 million t dixon et al 2009 according to pala et al 2011 average yield gaps in morocco ranged from 98 to 207 in rainfed areas and from 51 to 89 in irrigated areas similarly yield gaps of 82 125 and 61 201 have been reported in syria and turkey respectively in relation to the study years 2014 and 2015 the wheat harvested area in turkey amounted to 7 7 and 7 9 million ha it produced 15 3 and 18 5 million t and consumed 17 5 and 17 8 million t grain world markets and trade 2015 winter wheat water use evapotranspiration depends on cultivar growth stage canopy and leaf structure climatic conditions irrigation soil and crop management practices the mediterranean region is characterized by a short rainy season november april increasing water deficit and thermal stress during wheat grain filling stage adequate water on or after anthesis period not only allows the plant to increase photosynthesis rate but also gives extra time to translocate the carbohydrate to grains zhang and oweis 1998 which improve grain size and thereby lead to increase grain yield tari 2016 padhi et al 2010 reported that grain yield straw and leaf area index have significant differences among treatments where the full irrigation treatment resulted in greatest values and these features decreased with increasing stress levels rao et al 2012 found the highest value of the total biomass grain yield and harvest index of wheat under full irrigation using line source sprinkler irrigation in comparison to deficit irrigation levels highest average grain yield of wheat was attained from the highest irrigation level full irrigation with a 7 day interval as 8 3 t ha and the lowest yield was obtained from rain fed treatment with 2 9 t ha in arid southeast anatolia region sezen and yazar 2006 rajala et al 2009 stated that drought reduces photosynthesis plant water content and leaf area development mary et al 2001 reported that the water stress has played a key role to reduce the moisture percentage while it increased protein and gluten contents water stress in the post anthesis grain filling period was found to affect quality parameters where an increase in protein content and sedimentation volume consistent with a decrease in grain yield 1000 grains weight bread volume and wet gluten were observed when a terminal water stress happened aslani et al 2013 noorka and silva 2012 found under normal irrigation condition the protein contents of wheat ranged from 11 20 to 13 78 while under water stress condition it ranged from 12 47 to 13 92 kiliç and yağbasanlar 2010 concluded that drought stress increased the chlorophyll content grain protein content and sedimentation tari 2016 found that the water stress applied in the stem elongation stage and irrigation applied in the milk stage increased the protein ratios while the highest protein ratios and gluten contents were obtained under the moisture conditions of full irrigation at milk stage 14 5 during the first year and under the full irrigation at heading and milk stage treatment 14 7 during the second year in konya plain in turkey erekul et al 2012 stated that sedimentation values and wet gluten contents at different supplemental irrigation doses ranged between 27 and 37 ml and 26 5 34 4 grain protein content ranged between 11 7 14 9 protein contents sedimentation values and wet gluten contents without irrigation were significantly higher than the values obtained from the supplemental irrigations on the other hand gooding et al 2003 reported that drought stress before the end of grain filling decreased sedimentation volume relative to drought applied later ozturk and aydin 2004 observed that late water stress increased grain protein sedimentation volume and wet gluten content relative to the fully irrigated treatment in a red grained winter bread variety naseri et al 2010 revealed that water stress increased protein contents by 10 3 13 2 in wheat while seleiman et al 2011 reported that less irrigation and water stress increased protein content by 11 20 13 40 as compared to full irrigation saint pierre et al 2008 expressed that with the application of si the protein content begins to decrease as expected attaining higher yields with increased productivity is only economical when the increased gains in crop yield are not offset by increased costs of other inputs oweis and hachum 2004 eid et al 2014 attained the best results under set sprinkler irrigation system and irrigation frequency three times per week with maximum wheat grain yield 5 8 t ha and net income 1289 3 ha on the other hand hand move sprinkler system and irrigation frequency once per week achieved the lowest yield 3 3 t ha and net income 199 ha in egyptian national research centre optimum water use in deficit irrigation is obtained by an economic analysis using yield and cost functions if land is limiting optimum irrigation strategy would be to apply the amount of water which maximizes net income as described by english and james 1990 many investigators have concluded that deficit irrigation can increase net farm income fardad and golkar 2002 zhang et al 2002 ali et al 2007 found highest net return of wheat under both land and water limiting conditions using 2 irrigation 130 mm amounted 87 1 and 154 3 ha with yield 3 3 t ha however under 4 irrigations 265 mm amounted 70 4 ha with yield 3 8 t ha and the lowest net income was negative 74 5 ha under the conditions of using 18 mm irrigation water since the cost of production was higher than gross return and yield was 1 8 t ha dağdelen et al 2009 stated that the reduction in the net income of the deficit irrigation treatments di 25 and di 50 was significant and seemed to be non profitable with negative values 2672 5 and 877 7 ha in the aegean region of turkey a few studies examined the appropriate conventional and supplemental irrigation dose and analyzed the economic return to determine the most economic irrigation system alternative hence the purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the economic feasibility of agriculture with conventional and supplemental irrigation strategies in the mediterranean region in order to maximize the net benefit from optimal wheat production no maximizing yield and determine the suitable si amount especially under limited water and land resources additionally this work was carried out to evaluate the effect of conventional and supplemental irrigation applied at the critical growth stages on grain yield and bread making properties in order to improve wheat quality and to study the correlation of different quality parameters and grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out in the research field of the irrigation and agricultural structures department at çukurova university 36 59 n lat 35 18 e long and altitude of 35 m asl located in adana turkey during the 2013 2014 and 2014 2015 wheat growing seasons using a local wheat triticum aestivum l cv adana 99 2 2 soil and water features the soil of the experimental site is classified as the mutlu soil series palexerollic chromoxeret fao 2006 with a clay texture throughout the soil profile and has a ph range 7 62 7 78 electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ece 0 12 0 19 ds m and volumetric soil water contents at field capacity fc and permanent wilting point wp of the root zone 40 41 and 19 24 respectively mean bulk density varies from 1 15 to 1 25 g cm3 the available water holding capacity of the soil is 198 mm in the 120 cm soil profile water is obtained from an open channel irrigation system in the experimental area and the quality is classified as c2s1 by ussl 1954 and ph is 7 8 and the average electrical conductivity is 0 78 ds m 2 3 climate çukurova region is placed in a semi arid climate weather data were collected from an automatic recording meteorological station located at the experimental site precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures air humidity wind speed and solar radiation measured on a daily basis and summarized for each growing season along with climatic data during the long term of period 1960 2015 are reported in table 1 2 4 experimental design and treatments in the experiment line source sprinkler design was employed for studying the effect of supplemental deficit irrigation strategies and irrigation levels on wheat yield and yield components separate sprinkler lines were employed for the main treatments and sprinkler lateral was laid out parallel to plant rows the line source sprinkler system was used to assess crop yield response to different levels of deficit irrigation where the applied irrigation water is uniformly distributed parallel to sprinkler lateral and water application gradually decreased with distance away from the line source sezen and yazar 2006 in this study four irrigation strategies were considered namely ci and si at flowering and grain filling sifg only at flowering stage sif and only at grain filling stage sig four irrigation levels in each irrigation strategy namely one full i100 and three deficit i25 i50 and i75 irrigations and a rain fed rf treatment were considered the experiment was carried out with randomized complete blocks design with four replications using line source sprinkler system for each irrigation strategy the amount of irrigation water applied in conventional full irrigation strategy is based on restoring root zone moisture deficit when 50 of available water is depleted in effective root zone depth of 90 cm to near field capacity for the full irrigation treatment next to the sprinkler lateral i100 the other irrigation treatments automatically received approximately linearly decreasing proportions 0 75 0 50 and 0 25 of the full irrigation amount for si strategies soil water deficit in 90 cm soil depth of the corresponding growth stage was replenished to field capacity for full irrigation level plots next to the sprinkler lateral wheat seeds were sown on november 22 2013 and december 8 2014 with an average row spacing of 18 cm the seeding rate was 250 kg ha fertilizers were added according to soil analysis recommendations where compound fertilizers of n p k 20 20 0 were applied 75 kg n 75 kg p2o5 as pure matter per hectare at planting stage the rest of n 2nd dose 75 kg ha was applied in the form of urea 46 n during jointing stage and the 3rd dose at rate of 75 kg ha of ammonium nitrate 33 ammonium 16 5 and nitrate 16 5 was applied at flowering stage herbicides were sprayed one time on 7th march and on 5th march against the weeds during the first and second cropping seasons wheat was harvested at full maturity on may 22 2014 and june 9 2015 2 5 measurements and observations 2 5 1 soil water content the soil water content was measured by gravimetric method dry oven at 105 c for 24 h at planting and harvesting by using hand auger at 30 cm depth increments down to 90 cm soil profile during the wheat growing season soil water content was monitored approximately two week intervals and prior to water application by a neutron probe hydroprobe model 503 through an aluminum access tube installed to a depth of 120 cm in the middle of each plot 2 5 2 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration of wheat eta for individual plots was determined for total seasonal and between the growing stages by using the soil water balance equation allen et al 1998 as follows et i p δ sw dp ro where i the amount of applied water irrigation mm that is measured in the 4 catch cans parallel to line source located in the center of each plot p the precipitation mm that is measured at the weather station on the site δsw is the change of soil water content mm between any consecutive irrigations in the 90 cm soil profile taken as effective root zone depth dp the drainage from the bottom of the root zone below 90 cm depth ro surface runoff occurring during the study seasons ro from the experimental plots was negligible as there was sufficient surface roughness due to dry sowing for water infiltration also there were low ridges of sowing lines dp was also assumed to be negligible since single rainfall amount and distribution during the growing seasons did not exceed soil water storage capacity in the 90 cm soil depth 2 5 3 grain yield and quality characteristics for determining the grain yield the air dry weight of grains per 4 m2 plot was recorded this observation was used for computing grain yield in kg per ha 1000 grain weight values were also determined on these samples grain protein content was analyzed as nitrogen by the kjeldahl method according to method no 46 10 as described in aacc 2000 the protein content was then calculated by multiplying the nitrogen content by a constant of 5 7 han and yang 2009 wet gluten content was determined by the gluto matic method using gluten washing device perten glutomatic system in addition this content was calculated by dividing total gluten content by the weight of the sample mudawi et al 2016 the sedimentation value was determined by the procedure outlined in method no 56 61 3 as described in aacc 2000 2 6 economical evaluation the economic analysis was performed using partial budgeting technique in order to determine the maximum net income ni which was computed by subtracting all the production costs from gross incomes for all treatments all calculations were done based on a unit area of one hectare sezen et al 2011 wheat production costs and sale prices were obtained from the chamber of farmer association and agricultural provincial directorate in adana production costs include land rental land taxes fertilization seeds soil cultivation plant protection labour cost for agricultural processes irrigation harvesting threshing transportation and marketing costs for the calculation of the total cost of wheat production for one hectare the sum of crop production costs the annual cost of the irrigation system irrigation labour and water cost are taken into account the net income for each treatment was computed by subtracting all production costs from gross incomes 2 7 statistical analysis the experimental data were analyzed statistically by using computer software program sas statistical analysis system version 9 00 ts level 00m0 xp pro platform and comparison between different treatment means were made through duncan s multiple range test at 5 probability level 3 results and discussions 3 1 soil water content variation during the dry season 2014 the soil water content swc appeared to be lower in the beginning of the season at planting until tillering growth stage owing to no rain in relation to the wet season 2015 due to sufficient rainfall the soil water content values were higher during the first growth stages of winter wheat where the swc started increasing after planting to reach its maximum value in the season on 78 dap 369 6 mm 90 cm then decreased gradually to the lowest levels observed during heading flowering and grain filling stages which resulted in the gradual increase of water stress during these periods furthermore the swc increased early in conventional strategy due to irrigation applied on 116 dap at heading stage on the other hand swc decreased in sifg and sif irrigation strategies until flowering stage then swc increased following an irrigation application on 130 dap in flowering stage in relation to the irrigation at grain filling stage strategy the soil water content continued to decrease more than sif and sifg strategies due to relatively late irrigation application on 138 dap in grain filling stage generally the lowest soil water stress during all the growth stages of wheat occurred in conventional strategy relative to the first year data it was noted that the soil water content was below wp at the end of the season for rf ci25 and sifg25 this also occurred with sif strategy under 75 50 and 25 irrigation levels during the grain filling stage however the soil water content fluctuated gradually between fc and wp until the end of the season for the rest of the treatments in both seasons 3 2 crop water use evapotranspiration seasonal eta values in 2013 2014 growing season ranged from 293 mm in rf to 485 mm in ci100 and varied between 474 mm in rf and 645 mm in ci100 in the second year table 2 the seasonal eta of full conventional irrigation treatment was higher than full supplemental irrigation strategies of sifg100 sif100 and sig100 by 4 9 13 3 and 2 9 in the 2013 14 growing season and the corresponding values in the second year were 5 7 16 9 and 9 1 respectively since the precipitation during the 2013 2014 growing season from november to march was relatively scarce the evapotranspiration eta was mainly from applied irrigation water the weather conditions prevailed during 2014 2015 growing season with higher demand for evaporation and resulted in greater seasonal eta than in 2013 2014 overall eta values were higher in the 2014 2015 growing season over different growth stages with maximum eta occurring in the flowering and grain filling stages in general eta increased with increasing irrigation quantity in the treatments 3 3 grain yield mean grain yields were different p 0 05 among the treatments in both experimental years table 2 ci100 produced significantly greater grain yield of 5868 and 8258 kg ha in the first and second year respectively and the lowest grain yield was recorded in the rainfed treatment in both years irrigation levels resulted in significantly different yields as the amount of irrigation water increased grain yield also increased in each irrigation strategy similar results were reported by sezen and yazar 2006 in the mediterranean region mean grain yields in the second year were higher than in the first one due to favorable climatic conditions prevailed in the second growing season the maximum air temperature during the grain milk stage in the first year april 7 16 2014 was 30 7 c which was 8 5 c warmer than second year april 18 29 2015 and resulted in accelerated leaf senescence and shortened grain filling duration that caused to reduce the 1000 grain weight on average by 11 0 and grain yield by 39 the results confirmed the findings of mian et al 2016 who reported that rising of air temperature at grain filling stage resulted in reduced grain yield of wheat increasing mean temperatures during the growing season have been reported to reduce grain yields of irrigated well watered wheat crops under field conditions due to a shortening of the growing season less light interception and less kernels per unit area wheeler et al 1996 lobell and ortiz monasterio 2007 the increased air temperatures during the anthesis stage also in the first year resulted in lower number of grains per spike on average by 19 3 than in the second year thus warmer temperatures in this sensitive stage disrupted pollination process consequently it reduced the ability of wheat plants to produce more grains the results agree with the study of hatfield and prueger 2015 who observed that exposure to high temperatures at pollination reduced grain yield in general the reduction of grain yield in dry season may be attributed to the combined impacts of water and heat stress on yield components such as number of grains per spike and thousand grain weight full supplemental irrigation strategies sifg100 sif100 and sig100 produced lower grain yields by 16 3 29 4 and 20 4 in the first year and by 7 0 17 1 and 10 7 in the second year as compared to ci100 the relative reduction of yield under full supplemental irrigation strategies is because of occurrence of water stress during vegetative flowering and grain filling stages sifg100 and sif100 resulted in reduced irrigation by 10 7 and 45 9 in the first year and about 13 0 and 61 2 in the second one respectively in comparison with ci100 rf treatment control resulted in decreased yields of 49 2 39 8 and 46 4 as compared to full supplemental irrigation treatments sifg100 sif100 and sig100 respectively in the dry season whereas these values decreased to 25 4 16 3 and 22 3 respectively in the wet season due to the relative increase of soil moisture in the field in the beginning of the season regarding irrigation scheduling at different growth stages it was observed that irrigation in grain filling stage increased the grain yield by 12 and 7 compared to irrigation at flowering stage during the first and second seasons respectively these results are in agreement with tari 2016 who concluded that water deficit should be applied during the milk grain stage to minimize yield losses of wheat our results also confirm the findings of rao et al 2012 3 4 grain quality properties 3 4 1 grain weight it was found that sifg100 ci100 sif100 and sig100 treatments resulted 1000 grain weight values of 49 0 51 6 42 0 and 45 2 g respectively in the first year and 50 8 52 8 47 3 and 49 7 g in the second one in general deficit irrigation levels produced significantly lower 1000 grain weight values than full irrigation in each strategy table 2 sifg100 and sif100 increased 1000 grain weight significantly by 41 6 and 21 3 respectively in comparison with rf in the first year however the corresponding increases amounted to 19 8 and 11 5 respectively in the second year the results are in line with the findings of pierre et al 2008 who reported that water stress reduced yield and 1000 grain weight under rain fed compared to supplementary irrigation the response of 1000 grain weight to irrigation strategies differed depending on irrigation levels and at which wheat growth stage it was applied for instance ci75 increased 1000 grain weight by 15 5 and 12 0 in 2014 and 15 and 6 6 in 2015 in comparison with sif75 and sig75 respectively in both growing seasons the deficit irrigation sifg75 strategy resulted in decreased 1000 grain weight by 6 2 and 5 4 compared with ci75 treatment sig100 and sifg100 produced greater 1000 grain weight as compared with sif100 in both experimental years these results confirmed the effect on the 1000 grain weight sensitivity to irrigation at the grain filling stage our findings are in agreement with aown et al 2012 who stated that the1000 grain weight and grain yield were proved to be sensitive to drought at both stages flowering and grain filling however drought stress at grain filling reduced these two parameters to a greater extent of 38 5 and 56 5 over well watered treatment respectively as a result of the present study it was observed that 1000 grain weight decreased with increasing water deficit magnitudes rf treatment resulted in the decrease in thousand grain weight that amounted to 32 9 and 19 6 compared to ci100 in dry and wet season respectively it means that the capability of irrigation to raise the soil water content in the root zone and stimulate the wheat growth and photosynthesis rate reflected in increasing the grain yield production 3 4 2 protein content irrigation strategies had significantly different effects on protein content of wheat grain an inverse relation between protein content and irrigation water was observed and the highest value of protein content 15 9 was found in rain fed treatment which resulted in significant superiority to the other treatments in the first year the similar trend of protein content to water regime was observed in the second year when the rain fed treatment achieved the maximum significant value of protein content with an average 14 5 based on this given data the drier conditions in the first year helped to improve the protein quality as compared with wetter conditions in the second season however the lowest protein content was obtained in ci100 treatment high consumptive use with an average of 11 5 and 11 2 in the first and second year respectively in addition yield obtained in rf treatment in the first year was 57 5 lower than in ci100 treatment but protein percentage was 38 2 higher however the corresponding values were comparatively lower in the second year in which the water stress under rf treatment reduced the grain yield to 30 6 and increased protein content by 29 4 in respect to ci100 these findings are in line with findings of saint pierre et al 2008 naseri et al 2010 seleiman et al 2011 and noorka and silva 2012 with reference to statistical analysis data in table 3 sif100 resulted in significant increase in protein content by 21 7 and 14 7 in comparison to ci100 and sifg100 respectively in the first year and 17 8 and 6 4 in the second one this means that applying irrigation just once early at flowering stage influenced wheat protein content more than irrigating twice at flowering and grain filling stages therefore these results reveal that the environmental factors such as water stress and high temperatures during grain filling period max air temperature in april was 30 7 c in the first year have important effect on grain protein accumulation and bread quality similar results were reported by aslani et al 2013 who stated that water stress in the post anthesis grain filling period was found to affect quality parameters such as increase in protein content and sedimentation volume in the first year the water applied in grain filling stage increased significantly the protein ratio by 4 3 compared to full conventional strategy in this respect supplemental irrigation in grain filling stage decreased the protein content by 14 2 compared with applying supplemental irrigation at flowering stage in the second year application of si in grain filling stage caused significant increase in protein content by about 5 over the conventional strategy while the si at grain filling resulted in a 10 6 reduction in protein content in comparison to that of supplemental irrigation at flowering stage these results were in contrast to the findings of tari 2016 who found irrigation applied in the milk stage increased the protein ratios and the highest protein ratios and gluten contents were obtained under the full irrigation treatment at milk stage in central anatolia conditions 3 4 3 wet gluten content gluten content is a very important trait for the assessment of flour quality the unique properties of endospermic protein are called gluten the wet gluten content was affected by both the magnitude of water deficit and the growing stages rainfed treatment resulted in the significantly highest wet gluten content in both years followed by sif25 sig25 sifg25 and ci25 the lowest and highest wet gluten content were related to applied water quantity the full conventional irrigation treatment achieved the lowest gluten content with decrease of 34 1 and 32 1 in the first and second year in comparison with the rain fed treatment wet gluten content increased with increasing water stress magnitude in the treatments the results are in agreement with the conclusion of erekul et al 2012 who reported the wet gluten contents under rf treatment were found significantly higher than the values obtained from the irrigated treatments the wet gluten content obtained in sig100 was higher than in ci100 treatment by 14 and 11 in the first and second year respectively wet gluten content values of sig100 were lower by 2 5 and 2 2 than supplemental irrigation of sifg100 in 2014 and 2015 furthermore ci100 decreased wet gluten content by 14 5 in comparison with sifg100 in the first year and 11 9 in the second one table 3 these findings suggest that wet gluten content responded well to different water stress in the dry and wet seasons in both growing seasons occurrence of severe water stress in post anthesis stage under sif strategy resulted in the highest gluten content in comparison with other strategies these results are in agreement with mary et al 2001 and ozturk and aydin 2004 who stated that the water stress increased wet gluten content relative to the fully irrigated treatment 3 4 4 sedimentation value the sedimentation values under the different treatments are provided in table 3 the greatest sedimentation volume was found under rf and the lowest value was under ci100 in both experimental years severe water stress treatments under si resulted in higher sedimentation value than lower and moderate stress treatments water stress and hot weather higher than 30 c under mediterranean climatic conditions during the grain filling period caused an increase by 24 4 and 28 1 of sedimentation volume in sif100 over sig100 in 2014 and 2015 growing seasons furthermore in the first year sif increased sedimentation volume to 16 5 and 35 5 in comparison with sifg and ci in the second year the severe water stress in sif with only single irrigation elevated sedimentation content significantly compared to the values obtained in the first year which reached to 21 1 and 38 4 over the irrigation at sifg and ci respectively the sedimentation values in the second year were lower and the sedimentation ranges were relatively larger as compared to first year the results are in line with findings of gooding et al 2003 who reported that drought stress before the end of grain filling decreased sedimentation volume relative to drought applied later the research results revealed that the sifg100 increased sedimentation volume by 6 7 and 16 2 in the first year and by 5 7 and 14 2 in the second year compared to sig100 and ci100 therefore for raising the wheat sedimentation value and improving the bread quality supplemental irrigation sifg100 could be applied under mediterranean region kiliç and yağbasanlar 2010 and erekul et al 2012 reported that the sedimentation values changed depending on si doses and higher deficit irrigation improved grain quality by increasing sedimentation volume unit 3 4 5 the relations between yield and seasonal average available water with grain quality characteristics the relationships between grain yield and grain quality and between grain quality and 0 9 m profile available water were represented in figs 1 and 2 under water stress conditions of dry year the grain quality properties protein content wet gluten and sedimentation value showed high coefficient of determination with grain yield that recorded r2 0 81 0 89 and 0 85 in the first year however the corresponding values in the second year were 0 74 0 81 and 0 84 respectively the results are in agreement with aslani et al 2013 who found that water stress in the post anthesis grain filling period caused an increase in protein content and sedimentation volume consistent with a decrease in grain yield 1000 grains weight bread volume and wet gluten that were observed when a terminal water stress happened in relation to the response of grain yield to grain quality in this study linear relationship of wheat grain yield and quality parameters recorded highly negative and significant correlations similar findings were stated by oury and godlin 2007 who reported the protein contents gluten quality and contents have significantly negative correlations with grain yield and thousand kernel weights under normal and stress conditions it is known that yield reduction that generally occurs under water stress conditions is generally associated with an increase in protein content rharrabti et al 2003 garrido lestache et al 2005 guttieri et al 2005 dupont et al 2006 pompa et al 2009 with reference to effect of seasonal average available water in 0 9 m soil depth as independent variable on grain quality characteristics as dependent variable it was observed that when the available water in root zone decreases the wheat grain properties increase and the yield decreases the winter wheat quality parameters are correlated significantly and negatively with available water in soil and coefficient of determination was r2 0 76 and 0 80 in the first year and r2 0 73 and 0 79 in the second year for protein and wet gluten values respectively the statistical data expressed that grain quality responded well to applied water in the root zone of wheat the results were in agreement with kanani et al 2013 who reported that the effect of drought stress on gluten percentage increased in drought stress compared to normal conditions ozturk and aydin 2004 also confirmed our results and reported water stress increased grain protein sedimentation volume and wet gluten content relative to the fully irrigated treatment in winter bread wheat 3 5 economical analysis the total costs gross income and net income ni of wheat under different irrigation strategies for the experimental years were presented in tables 4 and 5 the wheat production cost were taken from turkish annual statistical book in 2014 and 2015 prices in dollars were determined according to turkish central banks s exchange rates of 2 2 tl in 2013 2014 and 2 4 tl in 2014 2015 in addition the wheat sales price was calculated integrating selling price of seeds and side porducts together which equaled 0 33 kg in the first year and 0 34 kg in the second one the total costs in ha for ci100 were divided as following irrigation labor cost 1 2 water cost 4 1 crop production 64 7 and annual cost of irrigation system 30 in the first year on the other hand in the second year the corresponding percentages were 0 8 2 4 69 4 and 27 3 respectively the total costs of wheat production increased steadily with increasing applied water quantity from 25 to 100 irrigation level under each strategy where the highest value was recorded under ci100 1335 32 and 1571 66 ha in the first and second year respectively and the lowest value in rf 863 6 and 1091 37 ha in 2014 and 2015 respectively this increase in production costs for ci100 compared to rf treatment was due to cost of irrigation labor water cost and annual cost of irrigation system in ci100 all the variable costs are fixed except irrigation cost in order to evaluate the effect of irrigation strategies and irrigation levels on net income in the first year the higher deficit irrigation levels sig25 50 sif25 50 sifg25 and ci25 resulted in negative net income ranged between 21 73 and 387 88 ha the lowest negative net income was found in sig50 as compared to ci100 and net income difference between these two treatments amounted to 622 86 ha sig50 resulted in less irrigation by 48 6 and in yield reduction of 34 in comparison to ci100 however the highest negative net income value occured in sif25 treatment the reduction in net income value in sif25 amounted to 989 ha along with irrigation and yield reduction of 76 4 and 53 9 table 6 similar results are reported by ali et al 2007 who stated that the net return of wheat fluctuated between positive and negative values depending on irrigation quantity and crop production costs in the second year the net income values for the irrigation strategies were all positive that refers to the gross income values being higher than the production costs consequently in general the reduction in net income appreared lower in the second season in comparison with the first season sif25 treatment generated the lowest net income with a reduction of 809 12 ha and with irrigation and yield reduction of 90 3 and 30 4 in comparison with ci100 sig50 treatment caused a reduction in net income 674 83 ha and irrigation and yield reduction of 61 5 and 25 1 rf in the first year generated negative net return but this net return 41 9 ha was greater than those of sif25 50 and sig25 which resulted in net returns of 83 64 387 88 and 244 39 ha respectively similar results were obtained in the second year but the net return values were all positive for the abovementioned treatments the net return of the rf 854 56 ha was higher than all irrigation levels of sif strategy furthermore the rf generated greater net income than ci25 sifg50 25 and sig50 25 treatments the decrease in net income of above mentioned si treatments compared to rf was attributed to the irrigation costs irrigation labor costs water cost and annual cost of irrigation system hence it is recommended that planting wheat under rf is more profitable than applying si during flowering level 50 and 25 and grain filling stage level 25 under dry years and using sprinkler system in wet years applying si during flowering grain filling level 25 and 50 and in both flowering and grain filling stages level 25 and 50 are less profitable than rf conditions the economical analysis of wheat production revealed that in general the yield increased with increasing irrigation water that in turn resulted in higher net incomes ci100 treatment which produced the greatest grain yield 5868 and 8258 kg ha generated the maximum net return 601 12 and 1236 17 ha in the dry and wet years respectively these findings are in agreement with the conclusion of eid et al 2014 who indicated the net income of wheat changed between 199 and 1289 3 ha depending on sprinkler system and irrigation frequency the full conventional irrigation strategy surpassed the other full supplemental irrigation strategies on net income per hectare with increase amounting at 308 48 537 96 and 387 74 ha for sifg100 sif100 and sig100 respectively in the first year the reductions in net income during the second year were lower due to lower differences in yield between full irrigation treatments the net income reductions were 191 76 450 89 and 291 56 ha for sifg100 sif100 and sig100 respectively regarding irrigation volumes the mentioned full supplemental irrigation treatments resulted in irrigation reduction of 294 5 m3 ha 10 7 1266 8 m3 ha 45 9 and 292 4 m3 ha 10 6 respectively in comparison with ci100 in the first year however irrigation reduction in the second one reached 245 30 m3 ha 13 1 1148 40 m3 ha 61 2 and 433 30 m3 ha 23 1 respectively therefore when the water resources are relatively abundant the grower will select the strategy that maximizes net income per unit land thus the treatment c100 is the appropriate strategy under these conditions in spite of the irrigation quantity of deficit conventional irrigation level 75 2161 5 m3 ha being lower than sifg100 strategy 2463 8 m3 ha in the first year the yield and net income of ci75 were 39 5 and 10 1 greater than sifg100 in the second season the results confirmed the first one when the applied water to ci75 treatment 1407 30 m3 ha was lower than sifg100 treatment 1631 1 m3 ha but net income and yield were higher by 12 5 and 5 2 for ci75 in comparison with sifg100 which was due to applying one additional irrigation at heading stage under ci75 in this respect the results confirm that the appropriate irrigation scheduling can reduce the irrigation water supply of crop and produce more yield and net financial income of wheat 3 5 1 the relation between wheat yield and net income the regression equation of net income against grain yield was shown in fig 3 the present results indicated high positive and significant relation between the net income and grain yield that recorded r2 0 71 and 0 55 in the first and second year respectively the slopes of the relations were similar but the intersection values differed considerably between the years 4 conclusions the results of two year study demonstrated that conventional full irrigation ci100 treatment achieved the highest grain yield and maximum net return in both seasons full supplemental irrigation strategies sifg100 sif100 and sig100 produced lower grain yields as compared to ci100 the results confirmed that the wheat was not equally sensitive to water stress at different growth stages the wheat crop under sif strategy suffered a greater yield loss than the other strategies the supplemental irrigation during grain filling or during both flowering and grain filling proved to be more effective to increase the yield in comparison with irrigation under sif strategy the results showed that with some yield reduction under a limited water supply ci75 crop water use could be reduced to a level at which a sustainable grain yield and agricultural water use could be achieved in the mediterranean region an inverse relation between protein content and irrigation water was observed and the highest value of grain quality found in rain fed treatment which resulted in significant superiority to the other treatments applying irrigation just at flowering or grain filling stage improved grain quality protein content wet gluten content and sedimentation volume more than conventional irrigation therefore these findings reveal that the environmental factors such as water stress and high temperatures during grain filling period have important effect on grain quality accumulation and bread quality in this study a positive and significant relationship between the net income and grain yield based on growth stage irrigation scheduling and environmental conditions that can be used as an indicator to optimize wheat net income for farmer under water limited environments the full irrigation treatment sifg100 resulted in higher net income with small water reduction compared to full irrigation treatment sig100 so we concluded that in order to develop optimal irrigation management for supplemental irrigation strategies irrigating at flowering and grain filling development stages would be more economical to achieve higher wheat grain production and net income
