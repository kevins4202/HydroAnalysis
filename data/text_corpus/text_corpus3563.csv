17815,the nitrate concentration in groundwater has been increasing over time due to the intensive use of nitrogen fertilizer current nitrate removal technologies are restricted by the high operational cost or the inevitable secondary contaminations this study proposed a two chamber sulfide driven denitrifying microbial electrochemical system to denitrify nitrate in its cathode chamber instead of conventional organic substrates sulfide is oxidized in the anode chamber to generate electrons for cathodic denitrification long term performance of this novel system was evaluated over 200 days 100 cycles of batch fed operation with the assistance of anodic microorganisms sulfide can be directly oxidized to sulfate thus avoiding passivating the anode catalyzed by the cathodic microorganisms complete denitrification was realized with neither nitrite nor nitrous oxide accumulation benefiting from the electroautotrophic behavior of the functional microorganisms high electron utilization efficiencies were achieved 80 and 85 for the anode sulfide oxidation and the cathode denitrification respectively both observed electrode potentials and microbial analyses revealed that cytochrome c is the crucial electron transfer mediator in the cathodic electron transfer for denitrification based on the analysis of planktonic and biofilm microbial samples anodic and cathodic extracellular electron transfer bioprocesses are proposed both the direct and mediated electron transfers involved as were revealed by immobilized and planktonic functional microorganisms respectively this study demonstrates the feasibility of purifying nitrate contaminated groundwater without sacrificing its water quality in a separate mode of treatment this concept can be extended to a broader field in which the water requires bio polishing without introducing unwanted secondary pollution like the post denitrification of wastewater effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfide oxidation autotrophic denitrification groundwater microbial electrochemical technology 1 introduction presence of nitrate in groundwater has become a severe environmental and health challenge around the world niu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b concentrations around 30 mg n l nitrate are commonly observed in the nitrate contaminated aquifers and even up to 50 mg n l matiatos 2016 wang et al 2016 which far exceeds the suggested upper limit 10 mg n l of the usepa usepa 2010 technologies such as ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis or chemical reduction of nitrate have been developed for dealing with nitrate contaminated groundwater della rocca et al 2007 however these processes are usually castigated due to the high energy consumption or the high operational cost koter et al 2015 maul et al 2014 twomey et al 2010 cost effective methods like biological denitrification based on heterotrophic or autotrophic microorganisms are therefore receiving intensive investigation cecconet et al 2018 nonetheless groundwater is characterized by lacking electron donors the dosage of external electron donors e g organics sulfide or elemental sulfur for completion of denitrification would cause subsequent issues like the organic residual biotoxicity of sulfide or the elevating suspended solid concentration being an important source of drinking water the interference or deterioration of water quality by treatment is unfavorable and unwanted pous et al 2015 see fig 6 to prevent the possible interferences a treatment method separating the electron donor and acceptor based on a two chamber microbial electrochemical system equipped with a bioanode and a biocathode was conducted in this study a cation exchange membrane cem separates the anode and cathode chambers only electrons produced via the anodic oxidation can reach the cathode via an external circuit for the cathodic reaction the denitrification of nitrate contaminated groundwater therefore proceeds independently without mixing the anolyte and the groundwater streams so that the denitrification of groundwater can be achieved without sacrificing water quality however the low reaction rate van doan et al 2013 and accumulation of intermediates like no2 and n2o present the main challenges to efficient nitrogen removal and effective control of greenhouse gases when applying the denitrifying biocathode approach vilar sanz et al 2013 virdis et al 2009 an external power supply is commonly introduced to accelerate the reaction rate and to reduce the production of intermediates kondaveeti et al 2014 kondaveeti and min 2013 pous et al 2018 therefore an electron donor in the anode with a lower electrode potential is necessary when external power is applied to save energy gong et al 2013 organics are commonly used as an anodic substrate however inevitable methanogenesis consumes up to 40 of the organics and the consumption of organics by fermentative bacteria can significantly jeopardize the coulombic efficiency ce of the system less than 30 in most studies pous et al 2013 virdis et al 2009 leading to a considerable loss of electrons also low pka values of volatile fatty acids 4 76 for acetate and 4 88 for propionate could lead to the diffusion of neutral molecules to the cathode chamber by contrast sulfide is an ideal anodic electron donor with a low redox potential of 0 23v vs standard hydrogen electrode she for the hs s0 couple under the normal condition hamelers et al 2010 and high pka value 7 24 for hs h2s dissociation when using sulfide the unwanted methanogenesis and the diffusion of neutral molecules can be avoided moreover the autotrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob generally require more electrons for energizing cell metabolism lower yield coefficient than the organic oxidizing heterotrophs which also leads to a higher ce however the passivation of the anode by the accumulated s0 when sulfide is oxidized abiotically is a big concern dutta et al 2008 but this can be prevented if sulfide can be oxidized directly to sulfate with the assistance of microorganisms sun et al 2009 therefore the proposed sulfide driven two chamber denitrifying microbial electrochemical system sd dmes deserves investigation sulfide could come from industrial and domestic sources such as petroleum refining pulp and paper production and the eluent of biogas or flue gas desulfurization lin et al 2018 given sulfide is not readily available in many cases the sulfate conversion technologies can provide sulfide efficiently from organics converting over 80 of electrons from organics to sulfide hao et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 considering the metabolic and methanogenic organic consumption losses converting organics to sulfide first could overall achieve a higher ce compared with direct organics use as the anodic substrate mccarty et al 2011 in this study the sulfide containing effluent of a sulfate reducing bioreactor from saline sewage treatment in hong kong hao et al 2013 was fed into the anode chamber long term performance of the sd dmes for sulfide and nitrate removal was evaluated to test the feasibility of the separated treatment method biotic and abiotic control tests were conducted to investigate the detail of the reactions and the role of microorganisms in the system microbial communities of both the sulfide oxidizing bioanode and the denitrifying cathode were examined to identify the functional bacteria and to elucidate the underlying electron transfer properties the separated treatment approach demonstrated by sd dmes not only can realize the treatment of groundwater without sacrificing water quality but also can indicate the feasibility of the co treatment of other waters with very distinct characteristics without the interference of the electron donor and electron acceptor streams such a separated approach makes full use of potential electron donors from various sources regardless of their potential adverse effects on the essential process when mixed which leads the way to more flexible and versatile water treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up an h shaped microbial electrochemical reactor consisting of an anode and a cathode placed opposite each other was used in this study the anode and cathode chambers were filled with 6 mm diameter short rod shaped graphite granules which reduced the liquid volume of each chamber from 500 to 200 ml two thinner graphite rods of 5 mm diameter and 160 mm long served as anode and cathode current collectors graphite granules and rods were washed five times with distilled water and then submerged overnight in 1n naoh then 1n hcl before installation a cem cmi7000 membrane international usa was used to separate the anolyte from the catholyte the schematic diagram of the reactor is shown in the graphical abstract a saturated ag agcl electrode was inserted in the cathode chamber serving as the reference electrode and all electrode potentials in this study are reported with reference to a saturated ag agcl electrode 0 197v vs she 2 2 inoculum and operational conditions aerobic and anaerobic digestion sludge taken from a local wastewater treatment plant shatin wwtp hong kong were inoculated in the anode and cathode chambers respectively a fixed potential difference 0 6v between the anode and cathode was supplied by a potentiostat pmc2000 princeton applied research usa to accelerate the microbial electrochemical reactions the anode and cathode chamber was fed from their 1000 ml buffer tanks at 100 ml h by peristaltic pumps that provided internal recirculation of liquids between the buffer tank and the electrode chamber substrates in the buffer tanks were renewed batch wise every 48 h giving a cycle time of 48h the buffer tanks were thoroughly washed to remove any wall growth before each cycle also the whole reactor including the buffer tanks was covered by non transparent plastic bags to prevent the growth of phototrophs the liquid media fed into the sd dmes chambers consisted of 1 g l nahco3 0 38 g l kcl 0 069 g l nah2po4 h2o 0 04 g l cacl2 h2o 0 2 g l mgso4 7h2o one ml of a trace element stock solution

were added to the 1 l of fresh media to simulate the effluent of the sulfidogenic bioreactor hao et al 2013 which was used as the anodic sulfide feed 200 ml of seawater were added to each liter of the anodic feeding 193 5 mg s l sulfide as na2s and 37 4 mg n l nitrate as nano3 were added to the anolyte and catholyte media respectively initial ph levels of the anode and cathode chambers were adjusted to 8 5 to minimize sulfide loss and 6 5 to provide the optimum ph for autotrophic denitrification 2 3 batch tests abiotic reaction vs biotic reaction when the reactor reached steady state after 160 days of operation which was characterized by a stable current generation fig s1 batch tests were performed to investigate the role of microorganisms in the system tests of 1 biotic anode coupled with biotic cathode 2 biotic anode coupled with abiotic cathode and 3 abiotic anode coupled with biotic cathode were performed sulfur compounds sulfide sulfate thiosulfate and polysulfide in the anode chamber and nitrogen compounds nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide in the cathode chamber were measured every 4 h throughout each 48 h batch experiments each scenario was run in triplicate the abiotic electrodes were autoclaved under 120 c for 2 h before batch tests other operating parameters were the same as those under long term operation details of the batch tests are shown in table 1 2 4 chemical analysis all samples were measured immediately after collection sulfate thiosulfate nitrate and nitrite ions were analyzed using an ion chromatograph thermo fisher equipped with an ionpac as19 analytical column and a conductivity detector ammonium nitrogen was determined using a flow injection analyzer fia quikchem fia 8000 series dissolved nitrous oxide was measured with an n2o microsensor unisense demark due to the high solubility of n2o in water 1 5 g l at 15 c weiss and price 1980 its concentration in the headspace was negligible dissolved sulfide was examined with the methylene blue method apha 2005 and ph was measured with a multimeter electrode wtw multi 3420 polysulfide was determined following the method introduced by kleinjan et al 2005a 2 5 microbial analysis planktonic and attached biomass of both the anode and cathode were collected at the end of the 100th cycle 200 days the dna extraction was conducted with an e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega following the manufacturer s instruction the 16s rrna genes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction pcr technique with the v3 v4 region universal primers 341f ccctacacgacgctcttccgatctg

s0 and sulfate are the end products 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the long term performance of sd dmes 3 1 1 current generation current generated through anodic sulfide oxidation and cathodic nitrate reduction gradually increased throughout the operation period and stabilized after 160 days 80 cycles with an average current of 4 71 0 14 ma fig s1 given that the operating conditions of the reactor remained unchanged the elevated current can be attributed solely to the development of microbial communities in both the anode and cathode chambers moreover the current did not decrease significantly throughout the 100 cycles implying that electrode passivation did not occur in the anode chamber 3 1 2 anodic sulfide oxidation the performance of sulfide oxidation over 100 consecutive cycles 200 days is presented in fig 1 based on the evolution of average current reactor operation can be divided into three periods startup transitional and the steady state the sulfide removal rate increased slowly from the startup phase to the transitional phase reaching the maximum rate of 10 mghs s l nac h and finally stabilized at 8 3 0 2 mghs s l nac h in the steady state period fig 1a correspondingly sulfate generation increased fig 1b and reached 2 4 0 1 mgso4 2 s l nac h in the steady state period during the first 10 cycles only around 0 2 mghs s l nac h out of 6 2 mg hs s l nac h were converted to sulfate s0 could be the dominant end product of electrochemical sulfide oxidation in this period pikaar et al 2015 other than s0 intermediates such as thiosulfate could be produced during abiotic sulfide oxidation sun et al 2009 no thiosulfate was detected throughout the test suggesting that the product of sulfide oxidation was mainly s0 during the startup period sulfate is mainly produced from the microbial electrochemical sulfide oxidation sun et al 2009 the sulfate production rate can therefore be regarded as an indicator of the growth of microbes on the anode more sulfate was produced afterword indicating greater enrichment of microorganisms in the anode chamber that catalyzed the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate however the sulfide removal rate was observed to drop from a maximum of 10 mghs s l nac h to 8 3 0 2 mghs s l nac h at the steady state the production of one sulfate molecule requires the transfer of eight electrons which is slower than the two electron transfer reaction for s0 production caliari et al 2017 additionally the ace dropped gradually in the transitional period fig s2a which could be ascribed to the increasing metabolic loss due to the buildup of new biomass under autotrophic conditions in the anode chamber sulfide was the only available electron source for microorganisms to thrive as more bacteria grow so more electrons are required for their anabolism and maintenance therefore the ace dropped from 90 to 80 due to the increased metabolic loss of the microbial electrochemical system madigan et al 2014 mccarty et al 2011 with sulfate as the end product of sulfide in the steady state period the microbial electrochemical sulfide oxidation offers more electrons than the abiotic reaction but results in a decrease in ace nevertheless the ace obtained in this sulfide oxidizing bioanode 80 at the steady state was still much higher than that of organics oxidizing bioanodes less than 30 pous et al 2013 virdis et al 2009 when converting organic to sulfide via sulfate reduction at a conversion ratio of 80 hao et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 an overall 64 electron utilization efficiency can be obtained which further confirmed that sulfide is superior to organics as an anodic electron donor 3 1 3 cathodic nitrate reduction the cathodic nitrate reduction rate throughout the 100 cycles is shown in fig 2 the nitrate removal rate gradually increased from the initial stage to the stable stage reaching an average removal rate of 2 1 0 1 mg n l ncc h the efficiency of microbial electrochemical denitrification is generally lower than that of conventional heterotrophic denitrification van doan et al 2013 however heterotrophs with their high yield coefficient require a minimum c n ratio of 7 gcod gn virdis et al 2008 to complete the denitrification and thus a large amount of additional organics is required in the denitrifying biocathode electrons from the cathode mainly go for denitrification yielding a very high electron utilization efficiency a cce of around 85 was achieved during the last 20 cycles fig s2b given the ace was 80 the overall electron utilization efficiency is 68 which is 2 1 times that of heterotrophic denitrification nitrite was produced at the end of each cycle in the startup and transitional periods with a maximum production rate of 1 9 mg no2 n l ncc h making up 90 of the reduced nitrate the nitrite production rate then decreased with an increasing number of cycles and finally disappeared at the steady state fig 2b nitrite is often produced in the startup period during microbial electrochemical denitrification due to ph fluctuation insufficient electron donor or non correct electrode potentials cecconet et al 2018 srinivasan et al 2016 the ph may not be the determining factor as nitrite accumulation was eliminated at the stable stage during which the cathodic ph increased from initial 6 5 to around 8 5 at the end of the cycle the cathodic electron transfer catalyzed by microorganisms can cause insufficient electron supply to nitrate during the startup stage as the biofilm may not be efficient in transferring electrons at the beginning also the accumulation of nitrite could be ascribed to partial nitrate reduction caused by cathodic microbial communities pous et al 2016 and molognoni et al 2017 reported that the startup of denitrifying biocathodes could be accelerated by the pre cultivation of microorganisms that acclimate quickly to the electrode however these bacteria e g geobacter may only reduce nitrate to nitrite gregory et al 2004 subsequently the produced nitrite could serve as an electron hub for the whole four step denitrification pous et al 2016 therefore a longer acclimation time normally more than 20 days is needed to develop the full denitrification ability kondaveeti and min 2013 zhao et al 2016 especially for the exclusively cathodophilic biofilms jiang and zeng 2019 the gradual decrease in nitrite concentration during the transitional period indicated the development of cathodic microbial communities and nearly no nitrite was produced at the stable phase of the reactor after around 80 cycles operation 3 2 effects of microorganisms on the sd dmes 3 2 1 biotic sulfide oxidation coupled with biotic nitrogen reduction bsbn variations in both sulfur and nitrogen concentrations in a complete bsbn 48h cycle between cycle number 90 and 100 are demonstrated in fig 3 when the reactor was equipped with both a bioanode and a biocathode the setup is typical of a cycle test of the sd dmes at its steady state sulfide and nitrate concentrations decreased over time at average rates of 8 7 0 6 mghs s l nac h and 2 1 0 1 mgno3 n l nac h respectively which are similar to the steady state performance polysulfide increased slightly to around 8 mgpolys s l likely produced from the reaction of s0 and s2 kleinjan et al 2005b the average chain length of polysulfide sx 2 in our measurement was 5 x 5 kleinjan et al 2005a therefore around 4 8 mgs0 s l sulfur was dissolved by sulfide and 58 3 mgpolys s l sulfur remained undissolved implying the generation of s0 at the anode cannot be avoided even with the presence of s0 oxidizing microorganisms at the anode which may due to incomplete covering of biofilm on the electrode surface however the minor difference between the average current in the batch test 4 68 ma and the average current at the steady state 4 71 ma suggests that the generation of s0 did not cause the passivation of the anode which implies that part of the s0 was further oxidized to sulfate by microorganisms on the anode surface also s0 can be produced by planktonic microorganisms which may be another reason that the passivation of the electrode didn t occur with the production of s0 which is discussed in 3 3 1 no nitrite was generated throughout the bsbn cyclic test but the nitrate removal rate dropped after 32h which may be attributed by the fluctuation of ph cecconet et al 2018 srinivasan et al 2016 as no ph buffer was used in this system n2o accumulated to a peak concentration of 1 7 mgn2o n l making up 19 of the reduced nitrate recorded at around 20h into the cycle the accumulated n2o was gradually reduced and disappeared after 30h with a drop in cathode potential from 0 to 0 183v fig s2b high cathode potential could be a reason for the accumulation of n2o which is supported by the literature clauwaert et al 2007 vilar sanz et al 2013 virdis et al 2008 with the depletion of no3 the electron accepting capability of bulk liquid decreased causing the accumulation of electrons within the cathode and lowering the cathode potential to the degree for reducing n2o however the effective cathode potential for n2o reduction i e complete denitrification is generally lower than 0 2v clauwaert et al 2007 desloover et al 2011 which is below the value observed in this study when denitrification occurs extracellular electrons reduce membrane bound electron carriers first and then these carriers transfer electrons to the corresponding denitrifying enzymes for denitrification madigan et al 2014 cytochrome c and quinones are known to be the electron carriers crucial to denitrification in the reactor a cathode potential below 0 269v is theoretically required for electrons to reduce quinones clauwaert et al 2007 which is lower than the cathode potential observed in this study fig s3b moreover a cathode potential lower than 0 1v is theoretically enough for electrons to reduce cytochrome c lin et al 2018 therefore the cathodic microorganisms predominantly used cytochrome c for denitrification in this study the analysis of functional genes of cathodic microorganisms validated this conclusion which is discussed in section 3 3 in addition the response of electrochemically active components of denitrifying biofilm system can be investigated by cyclic voltammetry cv gregoire et al 2014 pous et al 2014 vilar sanz et al 2018 the denitrifying biocathodes generally display a redox activity at a potential of 0 7 to 0 1v vs ag agcl during their cv tests which covers the cathode potential of this study such activity refers to the changes of redox states of electron transfer mediators like cytochrome c or its complexes however the accurate cathode potential at which denitrification occurs is hard to be identified due to the complex nature and various biochemical reactions taking place in mix cultures as well as nonuniform electrode configuration 3 2 2 abiotic sulfide oxidation coupled with biotic nitrogen reduction asbn the abiotic anode and biotic cathode were applied in this scenario to investigate the role of anodic microorganisms as shown in fig 4 the reaction nearly ceased after 12 h of operation accompanied by a sharp drop in the current fig s3a polysulfide reached 22 1 2 5 mgpolys s l fig 3a and little sulfate was generated implying a large production of s0 in the abiotic chamber based on the calculation 17 7 mg s l s0 were bound to polysulfide and the amount of undissolved s0 was about 38 5 mg s l which was less than that on the biotic anode however the oxidation rate of polysulfide to s0 was lower than that of sulfide to s0 which hindered the overall oxidation process and resulted in a current drop lessner et al 1986 no sulfate was produced from this abiotic process confirming that sulfate only generated from biotic oxidation the absence of anodic microorganisms affected the cathodic reaction as well nitrate reduction was hampered by the limited electron supply from the abiotic anode only 7 9 0 6 mgno3 n l nitrate were removed at an average rate of 0 8 0 1 mgno3 n l ncc h fig 4b the cathode potential increased from 0 215v to 0 113v along with a decrease in current indicating a shortage of electrons at the cathode due to the ineffective sulfide oxidation at the anode in the first 12 h of the test when electrons were still available cathodic denitrification proceeded with complete nitrate reduction and neither nitrite nor nitrous oxide were observed accumulation of intermediates like nitrite and nitrous oxide is usually reported in the conventional denitrification process when electron donors are limited guo et al 2018 however products of microbial electrochemical denitrification are determined by the cathode potential the lower the cathode potential the more complete the denitrification pous et al 2015 zhang et al 2014b in the denitrifying biocathode nitrogen compounds are directly reduced by corresponding enzymes and electrons are transported to those enzymes from electron carriers such as cytochrome c furthermore the redox state of these carriers is dependent on the cathode potential rosenbaum et al 2011 the more negative the potential is the more electron carriers are available in reduced form which reflected the true availability of electrons thus when the cathode was polarized at a potential negative enough complete denitrification could be achieved production of undesirable denitrification end products such as no2 and n2o could be reduced in denitrifying biocathodes even though the total amount of available electrons was limited see fig 5 3 2 3 biotic sulfide oxidation coupled with abiotic nitrogen reduction bsan in the test scenario involving a biotic anode and an abiotic cathode the biotic anode was able to supply adequate electrons for cathodic reaction with the aid of microorganisms however the total current dropped sharply within 2 h of starting the test fig s3a due to a decrease in capacitive current beyenal and babauta 2015 nearly no current was generated after the sharp drop and consequently substrates inside both the anode and cathode chambers remained unchanged without the catalyzing bacteria denitrification was not observed nitrate transformation on barren graphite is commonly reported to be inefficient for example in previous tests only 8 of nitrate was reduced even under a current density of 140 ma cm2 fig s3b bouzek et al 2001 dash and chaudhari 2005 which is consistent with our observation 3 3 identification of functional microorganisms 3 3 1 anodic microorganisms as the anode is designed for sulfide oxidation a bacterium must meet two criteria to be a functional bacterium in this chamber the ability to oxidize sulfide biologically and the ability to transfer electrons to the anode given the criteria a series of sulfur oxidizers such as sulfurovum pseudomonas halothiobacillus and desulfuromonas are presented in table 2 as the potential functional microorganisms thriving in both planktonic and biofilm communities the abundance of desulfuromonas and pseudomonas on the anode surface increased from 0 5 to 5 85 and 0 03 2 72 respectively becoming immobilized on the electrode surface by secreting quorum sensing molecules and forming an electroactive biofilm are the traits of these two genera cai et al 2016 electroactive pseudomonas spp have been identified as exoelectrogens in various microbial electrochemical technologies like microbial fuel cells microbial electrolysis cells and microbial electrosynthesis ieropoulos et al 2005 logan and rabaey 2012 capable of exchanging electrons via conductive pili with electrodes reguera et al 2005 bacteria from the genus desulfuromonas are reportedly capable of oxidizing s0 to sulfate with a potential of 0 3v which is lower than the anode potential observed in this study of around 0 4v zhang et al 2014a with the presence of pseudomonas and desulfuromonas in the andic biofilm and an adequate anode potential the anode was able to oxidize sulfide to sulfate and avoid the passivation of the electrode by the accumulation of s0 therefore pseudomonas and desulfuromonas are recognized as the functional bacteria that oxidize sulfur to sulfate and deliver electrons to the anode by forming an electroactive biofilm sulfurovum and halothiobacillus were highly abundant in planktonic biomass 36 64 and 13 27 respectively compared with those in the attached biomass 8 85 and 1 76 respectively planktonic cells can also oxidize sulfide to sulfate but require oxidants as the electron acceptor in this study we initially suspected that the electron acceptor was o2 as it can be generated on the electrode surface under certain anode potential however the anode potential in this work fig s3b was unfavorable for o2 evolution which requires at least 1 0v zhang et al 2017a thus microorganisms could only utilize the anode as the electron acceptor moreover an electron storage mechanism of sob proposed by ter heijne et al 2018 may explain the high abundance of sulfur bacteria in the bulk liquid that is sulfur bacteria can oxidize sulfide to s0 using the membrane bound electron carriers e g quinones and cytochrome c as the mediating electron acceptor when exposed to sulfide and then store the sulfide electrons in the mediator pool once the cell meets the anode the stored electron will be released to complete the redox reaction through this mechanism sulfurovum and halothiobacillus can thrive in the bulk liquid making the attached bacteria not the only consortia for transferring electrons to the anode benefiting from such a mechanism electrode passivation was not induced by the massive s0 production in the bioanode s0 was produced by planktonic cells in the bulk which did not form a precipitate on the anode surface in contrast without microorganisms the anode surface was the only reaction site for sulfide oxidation causing all of the produced s0 to cover the anode surface however the considerably high abundance of levilinea 31 23 in the attached biomass is unexpected the association of levilinea with sulfur compound oxidation and the electroactivity are rarely examined in the literature see fig 6 3 3 2 cathodic microorganisms following the same criteria used in screening for the functional bacteria in the anode chamber functional bacteria in the cathode chamber are responsible for nitrate reduction when accepting electrons from the cathode first they should be denitrifying bacteria and thus denitrifiers in cathodic samples are given in table 3 the second criterion is the electroactivity biofilm forming bacteria can usually transfer electrons by building up a conductive matrix in the biofilm sulfurimonas thiobacillus paracoccus and pseudomonas enriched in the attached biofilm are capable of directly accepting electrons from cathodes decampos rodrigues and rosenbaum 2014 kondaveeti et al 2014 nguyen et al 2016 pous et al 2014 paracoccus and pseudomonas are characterized by conducting the cytochrome c nitrite reductase complex for denitrification ferguson and richardson 2004 which supports the hypothesis that cytochrome c serves as an electron shuttle in the cathodic extracellular electron transfer eet furthermore the abundance of cytochrome c associated genes in the attached biofilm was found to be at least double that in the planktonic biomass while no significant difference was observed in terms of the abundance of quinone associated genes fig s4 and table s1 the cytochrome c concentration is regarded as a marker of direct eet sturm et al 2012 implying that cytochrome c serves as a crucial eet mediator accepting electrons from the cathode and providing electrons for denitrification denitrifiers rheinheimera paracoccus and hoeflea were enriched in the planktonic biomass indicating that the planktonic microorganisms might also responsible for denitrification eet of planktonic microorganisms relies on mediators like h2 flavins quinones and phenazines harnisch and freguia 2012 rosenbaum et al 2011 the lowest potential of the biotic cathode was around 0 2v throughout the test fig s3b which is much higher than h2 evolution potential 0 8v nevin et al 2010 thus h2 was excluded from being the electron transfer mediator other than h2 self excreted mediators such as flavins quinones and phenazines may be produced to support the eet of planktonic cells harnisch and freguia 2012 however the literature has not reported the production of these mediators by rheinheimera paracoccus or hoeflea although these genera are capable of utilizing mediators excreted by other microorganisms in the system rosenbaum et al 2011 phenazine excreting bacteria like pseudomonas have been observed to produce phenazine at close to zero electrode potential in both planktonic and attached biomass bosire and rosenbaum 2017 given the complex cathodic microbial communities 50 of the unclassified species there might be other microorganisms excreting such mediators which are then utilized by rheinheimera paracoccus and hoeflea such synergic effect may exist in the denitrifying biocathode of the microbial electrochemical systems to facilitate denitrification see fig 7 3 4 hypothesized electron transfer of the sd dmes based on the discussion above a complicated electron transfer system is proposed below involving five types of electron transfer fig 8 in the anode chamber we have 1 biotic sulfide oxidation by microorganisms attached to the anode surface 2 biotic sulfide oxidation by planktonic microorganisms and 3 abiotic sulfide oxidation on the electrode surface and in the cathode chamber we have 1 soluble electron shuttles based mediated eet of planktonic microorganisms for denitrification and 2 cytochrome c based direct eet of immobilized microorganisms for denitrification eet is regarded as a universal of electron transfer strategy of microbes identified in various habitats koch and harnisch 2016 which makes it reasonable for several types of electron transfer to coexist in our system possibly by adopting different electron transfer strategies microorganisms can easily adapt to their specific ecological niches 3 5 environmental impact denitrification and sulfide oxidation were biologically mediated separately in this study to prevent the potential problems of directly mixing electron donor and acceptor streams it provides a solution for purifying nitrate contaminated groundwater lacking electron donors while no additional pollution would be introduced to the original groundwater stream however optimization of this process is also required in both the anode and cathode chambers especially the applied external voltage electrode potential ph sulfide nitrate ratio and inoculum source this system also provides a solution for polishing the wastewater effluent lacking organics but containing residual nitrate in which dosing chemicals always results in the exceeding of the discharge standard sulfide can be obtained from the eluent of the biogas desulfurization systems in wastewater treatment plants equipped with anaerobic digestion for methane generation which taps the treatment potential of wastewater treatment plants themselves 4 conclusion in this study an sd dmes is developed for the denitrification of nitrate contaminated groundwater without sacrificing the water quality with sulfide as the anodic electron donor the long term operation demonstrated that with the assistance of microorganisms electroautotrophic denitrification was achieved in the cathode chamber and passivation of the anode can be prevented pseudomonas desulfuromonas sulfurovum and halothiobacillus were recognized as the anodic functional bacteria sulfurimonas thiobacillus pseudomonas paracoccus rheinheimera and hoeflea played a crucial role in the cathode chamber to ensure complete denitrification functional bacteria can survive in biofilms and the bulk liquid in both the anode and cathode chambers suggesting the existence of both direct and mediated electron transfer mechanisms cathodic denitrification occurred at high cathode potentials indicating cytochrome c could be the bridge enabling the cathodic biofilm to accept electrons from the cathode this work has validated the feasibility of handling two different water streams in one reactor but independently without mixing them the concept of separate treatment can be extended to broader application fields moreover a complex electron transfer system is established to achieve this process

17815,the nitrate concentration in groundwater has been increasing over time due to the intensive use of nitrogen fertilizer current nitrate removal technologies are restricted by the high operational cost or the inevitable secondary contaminations this study proposed a two chamber sulfide driven denitrifying microbial electrochemical system to denitrify nitrate in its cathode chamber instead of conventional organic substrates sulfide is oxidized in the anode chamber to generate electrons for cathodic denitrification long term performance of this novel system was evaluated over 200 days 100 cycles of batch fed operation with the assistance of anodic microorganisms sulfide can be directly oxidized to sulfate thus avoiding passivating the anode catalyzed by the cathodic microorganisms complete denitrification was realized with neither nitrite nor nitrous oxide accumulation benefiting from the electroautotrophic behavior of the functional microorganisms high electron utilization efficiencies were achieved 80 and 85 for the anode sulfide oxidation and the cathode denitrification respectively both observed electrode potentials and microbial analyses revealed that cytochrome c is the crucial electron transfer mediator in the cathodic electron transfer for denitrification based on the analysis of planktonic and biofilm microbial samples anodic and cathodic extracellular electron transfer bioprocesses are proposed both the direct and mediated electron transfers involved as were revealed by immobilized and planktonic functional microorganisms respectively this study demonstrates the feasibility of purifying nitrate contaminated groundwater without sacrificing its water quality in a separate mode of treatment this concept can be extended to a broader field in which the water requires bio polishing without introducing unwanted secondary pollution like the post denitrification of wastewater effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfide oxidation autotrophic denitrification groundwater microbial electrochemical technology 1 introduction presence of nitrate in groundwater has become a severe environmental and health challenge around the world niu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017b concentrations around 30 mg n l nitrate are commonly observed in the nitrate contaminated aquifers and even up to 50 mg n l matiatos 2016 wang et al 2016 which far exceeds the suggested upper limit 10 mg n l of the usepa usepa 2010 technologies such as ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis or chemical reduction of nitrate have been developed for dealing with nitrate contaminated groundwater della rocca et al 2007 however these processes are usually castigated due to the high energy consumption or the high operational cost koter et al 2015 maul et al 2014 twomey et al 2010 cost effective methods like biological denitrification based on heterotrophic or autotrophic microorganisms are therefore receiving intensive investigation cecconet et al 2018 nonetheless groundwater is characterized by lacking electron donors the dosage of external electron donors e g organics sulfide or elemental sulfur for completion of denitrification would cause subsequent issues like the organic residual biotoxicity of sulfide or the elevating suspended solid concentration being an important source of drinking water the interference or deterioration of water quality by treatment is unfavorable and unwanted pous et al 2015 see fig 6 to prevent the possible interferences a treatment method separating the electron donor and acceptor based on a two chamber microbial electrochemical system equipped with a bioanode and a biocathode was conducted in this study a cation exchange membrane cem separates the anode and cathode chambers only electrons produced via the anodic oxidation can reach the cathode via an external circuit for the cathodic reaction the denitrification of nitrate contaminated groundwater therefore proceeds independently without mixing the anolyte and the groundwater streams so that the denitrification of groundwater can be achieved without sacrificing water quality however the low reaction rate van doan et al 2013 and accumulation of intermediates like no2 and n2o present the main challenges to efficient nitrogen removal and effective control of greenhouse gases when applying the denitrifying biocathode approach vilar sanz et al 2013 virdis et al 2009 an external power supply is commonly introduced to accelerate the reaction rate and to reduce the production of intermediates kondaveeti et al 2014 kondaveeti and min 2013 pous et al 2018 therefore an electron donor in the anode with a lower electrode potential is necessary when external power is applied to save energy gong et al 2013 organics are commonly used as an anodic substrate however inevitable methanogenesis consumes up to 40 of the organics and the consumption of organics by fermentative bacteria can significantly jeopardize the coulombic efficiency ce of the system less than 30 in most studies pous et al 2013 virdis et al 2009 leading to a considerable loss of electrons also low pka values of volatile fatty acids 4 76 for acetate and 4 88 for propionate could lead to the diffusion of neutral molecules to the cathode chamber by contrast sulfide is an ideal anodic electron donor with a low redox potential of 0 23v vs standard hydrogen electrode she for the hs s0 couple under the normal condition hamelers et al 2010 and high pka value 7 24 for hs h2s dissociation when using sulfide the unwanted methanogenesis and the diffusion of neutral molecules can be avoided moreover the autotrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob generally require more electrons for energizing cell metabolism lower yield coefficient than the organic oxidizing heterotrophs which also leads to a higher ce however the passivation of the anode by the accumulated s0 when sulfide is oxidized abiotically is a big concern dutta et al 2008 but this can be prevented if sulfide can be oxidized directly to sulfate with the assistance of microorganisms sun et al 2009 therefore the proposed sulfide driven two chamber denitrifying microbial electrochemical system sd dmes deserves investigation sulfide could come from industrial and domestic sources such as petroleum refining pulp and paper production and the eluent of biogas or flue gas desulfurization lin et al 2018 given sulfide is not readily available in many cases the sulfate conversion technologies can provide sulfide efficiently from organics converting over 80 of electrons from organics to sulfide hao et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 considering the metabolic and methanogenic organic consumption losses converting organics to sulfide first could overall achieve a higher ce compared with direct organics use as the anodic substrate mccarty et al 2011 in this study the sulfide containing effluent of a sulfate reducing bioreactor from saline sewage treatment in hong kong hao et al 2013 was fed into the anode chamber long term performance of the sd dmes for sulfide and nitrate removal was evaluated to test the feasibility of the separated treatment method biotic and abiotic control tests were conducted to investigate the detail of the reactions and the role of microorganisms in the system microbial communities of both the sulfide oxidizing bioanode and the denitrifying cathode were examined to identify the functional bacteria and to elucidate the underlying electron transfer properties the separated treatment approach demonstrated by sd dmes not only can realize the treatment of groundwater without sacrificing water quality but also can indicate the feasibility of the co treatment of other waters with very distinct characteristics without the interference of the electron donor and electron acceptor streams such a separated approach makes full use of potential electron donors from various sources regardless of their potential adverse effects on the essential process when mixed which leads the way to more flexible and versatile water treatment systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up an h shaped microbial electrochemical reactor consisting of an anode and a cathode placed opposite each other was used in this study the anode and cathode chambers were filled with 6 mm diameter short rod shaped graphite granules which reduced the liquid volume of each chamber from 500 to 200 ml two thinner graphite rods of 5 mm diameter and 160 mm long served as anode and cathode current collectors graphite granules and rods were washed five times with distilled water and then submerged overnight in 1n naoh then 1n hcl before installation a cem cmi7000 membrane international usa was used to separate the anolyte from the catholyte the schematic diagram of the reactor is shown in the graphical abstract a saturated ag agcl electrode was inserted in the cathode chamber serving as the reference electrode and all electrode potentials in this study are reported with reference to a saturated ag agcl electrode 0 197v vs she 2 2 inoculum and operational conditions aerobic and anaerobic digestion sludge taken from a local wastewater treatment plant shatin wwtp hong kong were inoculated in the anode and cathode chambers respectively a fixed potential difference 0 6v between the anode and cathode was supplied by a potentiostat pmc2000 princeton applied research usa to accelerate the microbial electrochemical reactions the anode and cathode chamber was fed from their 1000 ml buffer tanks at 100 ml h by peristaltic pumps that provided internal recirculation of liquids between the buffer tank and the electrode chamber substrates in the buffer tanks were renewed batch wise every 48 h giving a cycle time of 48h the buffer tanks were thoroughly washed to remove any wall growth before each cycle also the whole reactor including the buffer tanks was covered by non transparent plastic bags to prevent the growth of phototrophs the liquid media fed into the sd dmes chambers consisted of 1 g l nahco3 0 38 g l kcl 0 069 g l nah2po4 h2o 0 04 g l cacl2 h2o 0 2 g l mgso4 7h2o one ml of a trace element stock solution

were added to the 1 l of fresh media to simulate the effluent of the sulfidogenic bioreactor hao et al 2013 which was used as the anodic sulfide feed 200 ml of seawater were added to each liter of the anodic feeding 193 5 mg s l sulfide as na2s and 37 4 mg n l nitrate as nano3 were added to the anolyte and catholyte media respectively initial ph levels of the anode and cathode chambers were adjusted to 8 5 to minimize sulfide loss and 6 5 to provide the optimum ph for autotrophic denitrification 2 3 batch tests abiotic reaction vs biotic reaction when the reactor reached steady state after 160 days of operation which was characterized by a stable current generation fig s1 batch tests were performed to investigate the role of microorganisms in the system tests of 1 biotic anode coupled with biotic cathode 2 biotic anode coupled with abiotic cathode and 3 abiotic anode coupled with biotic cathode were performed sulfur compounds sulfide sulfate thiosulfate and polysulfide in the anode chamber and nitrogen compounds nitrate nitrite and nitrous oxide in the cathode chamber were measured every 4 h throughout each 48 h batch experiments each scenario was run in triplicate the abiotic electrodes were autoclaved under 120 c for 2 h before batch tests other operating parameters were the same as those under long term operation details of the batch tests are shown in table 1 2

as19 analytical column and a conductivity detector ammonium nitrogen was determined using a flow injection analyzer fia quikchem fia 8000 series dissolved nitrous oxide was measured with an n2o microsensor unisense demark due to the high solubility of n2o in water 1 5 g l at 15 c weiss and price 1980 its concentration in the headspace was negligible dissolved sulfide was examined with the methylene blue method apha 2005 and ph was measured with a multimeter electrode wtw multi 3420 polysulfide was determined following the method introduced by kleinjan et al 2005a 2 5 microbial analysis planktonic and attached biomass of both the anode and cathode were collected at the end of the 100th cycle 200 days the dna extraction was conducted with an e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega

s0 and sulfate are the end products 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the long term performance of sd dmes 3 1 1 current generation current generated through anodic sulfide oxidation and cathodic nitrate reduction gradually increased throughout the operation period and stabilized after 160 days 80 cycles with an average current of 4 71 0 14 ma fig s1 given that the operating conditions of the reactor remained unchanged the elevated current can be attributed solely to the development of microbial communities in both the anode and cathode chambers moreover the current did not decrease significantly throughout the 100 cycles implying that electrode passivation did not occur in the anode chamber 3 1 2 anodic sulfide oxidation the performance of sulfide oxidation over 100 consecutive cycles 200 days is presented in fig 1 based on the evolution of average current reactor operation can be divided into three periods startup transitional and the steady state the sulfide removal rate increased slowly from the startup phase to the transitional phase reaching the maximum rate of 10 mghs s l nac h and finally stabilized at 8 3 0 2 mghs s l nac h in the steady state period fig 1a correspondingly sulfate generation increased fig 1b and reached 2 4 0 1 mgso4 2 s l nac h in the steady state period during the first 10 cycles only around 0 2 mghs s l nac h out of 6 2 mg hs s l nac h were converted to sulfate s0 could be the dominant end product of electrochemical sulfide oxidation in this period pikaar et al 2015 other than s0 intermediates such as thiosulfate could be produced during abiotic sulfide oxidation sun et al 2009 no thiosulfate was detected throughout the test suggesting that the product of sulfide oxidation was mainly s0 during the startup period sulfate is mainly produced from the microbial electrochemical sulfide oxidation sun et al 2009 the sulfate production rate can therefore be regarded as an indicator of the growth of microbes on the anode more sulfate was produced afterword indicating greater enrichment of microorganisms in the anode chamber that catalyzed the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate however the sulfide removal rate was observed to drop from a maximum of 10 mghs s l nac h to 8 3 0 2 mghs s l nac h at the steady state the production of one sulfate molecule requires the transfer of eight electrons which is slower than the two electron transfer reaction for s0 production caliari et al 2017 additionally the ace dropped gradually in the transitional period fig s2a which could be ascribed to the increasing metabolic loss due to the buildup of new biomass under autotrophic conditions in the anode chamber sulfide was the only available electron source for microorganisms to thrive as more bacteria grow so more electrons are required for their anabolism and maintenance therefore the ace dropped from 90 to 80 due to the increased metabolic loss of the microbial electrochemical system madigan et al 2014 mccarty et al 2011 with sulfate as the end product of sulfide in the steady state period the microbial electrochemical sulfide oxidation offers more electrons than the abiotic reaction but results in a decrease in ace nevertheless the ace obtained in this sulfide oxidizing bioanode 80 at the steady state was still much higher than that of organics oxidizing bioanodes less than 30 pous et al 2013 virdis et al 2009 when converting organic to sulfide via sulfate reduction at a conversion ratio of 80 hao et al 2014 zeng et al 2019 an overall 64 electron utilization efficiency can be obtained which further confirmed that sulfide is superior to organics as an anodic electron donor 3 1 3 cathodic nitrate reduction the cathodic nitrate reduction rate throughout the 100 cycles is shown in fig 2 the nitrate removal rate gradually increased from the initial stage to the stable stage reaching an average removal rate of 2 1 0 1 mg n l ncc h the efficiency of microbial electrochemical denitrification is generally lower than that of conventional heterotrophic denitrification van doan et al 2013 however heterotrophs with their high yield coefficient require a minimum c n ratio of 7 gcod gn virdis et al 2008 to complete the denitrification and thus a large amount of additional organics is required in the denitrifying biocathode electrons from the cathode mainly go for denitrification yielding a very high electron utilization efficiency a cce of around 85 was achieved during the last 20 cycles fig s2b given the ace was 80 the overall electron utilization efficiency is 68 which is 2 1 times that of heterotrophic denitrification nitrite was produced at the end of each cycle in the startup and transitional periods with a maximum production rate of 1 9 mg no2 n l ncc h making up 90 of the reduced nitrate the nitrite production rate then decreased with an increasing number of cycles and finally disappeared at the steady state fig 2b nitrite is often produced in the startup period during microbial electrochemical denitrification due to ph fluctuation insufficient electron donor or non correct electrode potentials cecconet et al 2018 srinivasan et al 2016 the ph may not be the determining factor as nitrite accumulation was eliminated at the stable stage during which the cathodic ph increased from initial 6 5 to around 8 5 at the end of the cycle the cathodic electron transfer catalyzed by microorganisms can cause insufficient electron supply to nitrate during the startup stage as the biofilm may not be efficient in transferring electrons at the beginning also the accumulation of nitrite could be ascribed to partial nitrate reduction caused by cathodic microbial communities pous et al 2016 and molognoni et al 2017 reported that the startup of denitrifying biocathodes could be accelerated by the pre cultivation of microorganisms that acclimate quickly to the electrode however these bacteria e g geobacter may only reduce nitrate to nitrite gregory et al 2004 subsequently the produced nitrite could serve as an electron hub for the whole four step denitrification pous et al 2016 therefore a longer acclimation time normally more than 20 days is needed to develop the full denitrification ability kondaveeti and min 2013 zhao et al 2016 especially for the exclusively cathodophilic biofilms jiang and zeng 2019 the gradual decrease in nitrite concentration during the transitional period indicated the development of cathodic microbial communities and nearly no nitrite was produced at the stable phase of the reactor after around 80 cycles operation 3 2 effects of microorganisms on the sd dmes 3 2 1 biotic sulfide oxidation coupled with biotic nitrogen reduction bsbn variations in both sulfur and nitrogen concentrations in a complete bsbn 48h cycle between cycle number 90 and 100 are demonstrated in fig 3 when the reactor was equipped with both a bioanode and a biocathode the setup is typical of a cycle test of the sd dmes at its steady state sulfide and nitrate concentrations decreased over time at average rates of 8 7 0 6 mghs s l nac h and 2 1 0 1 mgno3 n l nac h respectively which are similar to the steady state performance polysulfide increased slightly to around 8 mgpolys s l likely produced from the reaction of s0 and s2 kleinjan et al 2005b the average chain length of polysulfide sx 2 in our measurement was 5 x 5 kleinjan et al 2005a therefore around 4 8 mgs0 s l sulfur was dissolved by sulfide and 58 3 mgpolys s l sulfur remained undissolved implying the generation of s0 at the anode cannot be avoided even with the presence of s0 oxidizing microorganisms at the anode which may due to incomplete covering of biofilm on the electrode surface however the minor difference between the average current in the batch test 4 68 ma and the average current at the steady state 4 71 ma suggests that the generation of s0 did not cause the passivation of the anode which implies that part of the s0 was further oxidized to sulfate by microorganisms on the anode surface also s0 can be produced by planktonic microorganisms which may be another reason that the passivation of the electrode didn t occur with the production of s0 which is discussed in 3 3 1 no nitrite was generated throughout the bsbn cyclic test but the nitrate removal rate dropped after 32h which may be attributed by the fluctuation of ph cecconet et al 2018 srinivasan et al 2016 as no ph buffer was used in this system n2o accumulated to a peak concentration of 1 7 mgn2o n l making up 19 of the reduced nitrate recorded at around 20h into the cycle the accumulated n2o was gradually reduced and disappeared after 30h with a drop in cathode potential from 0 to 0 183v fig s2b high cathode potential could be a reason for the accumulation of n2o which is supported by the literature clauwaert et al 2007 vilar sanz et al 2013 virdis et al 2008 with the depletion of no3 the electron accepting capability of bulk liquid decreased causing the accumulation of electrons within the cathode and lowering the cathode potential to the degree for reducing n2o however the effective cathode potential for n2o reduction i e complete denitrification is generally lower than 0 2v clauwaert et al 2007 desloover et al 2011 which is below the value observed in this study when denitrification occurs extracellular electrons reduce membrane bound electron carriers first and then these carriers transfer electrons to the corresponding denitrifying enzymes for denitrification madigan et al 2014 cytochrome c and quinones are known to be the electron carriers crucial to denitrification in the reactor a cathode potential below 0 269v is theoretically required for electrons to reduce quinones clauwaert et al 2007 which is lower than the cathode potential observed in this study fig s3b moreover a cathode potential lower than 0 1v is theoretically enough for electrons to reduce cytochrome c lin et al 2018 therefore the cathodic microorganisms predominantly used cytochrome c for denitrification in this study the analysis of functional genes of cathodic microorganisms validated this conclusion which is discussed in section 3 3 in addition the response of electrochemically active components of denitrifying biofilm system can be investigated by cyclic voltammetry cv gregoire et al 2014 pous et al 2014 vilar sanz et al 2018 the denitrifying biocathodes generally display a redox activity at a potential of 0 7 to 0 1v vs ag agcl during their cv tests which covers the cathode potential of this study such activity refers to the changes of redox states of electron transfer mediators like cytochrome c or its complexes however the accurate cathode potential at which denitrification occurs is hard to be identified due to the complex nature and various biochemical reactions taking place in mix cultures as well as nonuniform electrode configuration 3 2 2 abiotic sulfide oxidation coupled with biotic nitrogen reduction asbn the abiotic anode and biotic cathode were applied in this scenario to investigate the role of anodic microorganisms as shown in fig 4 the reaction nearly ceased after 12 h of operation accompanied by a sharp drop in the current fig s3a polysulfide reached 22 1 2 5 mgpolys s l fig 3a and little sulfate was generated implying a large production of s0 in the abiotic chamber based on the calculation 17 7 mg s l s0 were bound to polysulfide and the amount of undissolved s0 was about 38 5 mg s l which was less than that on the biotic anode however the oxidation rate of polysulfide to s0 was lower than that of sulfide to s0 which hindered the overall oxidation process and resulted in a current drop lessner et al 1986 no sulfate was produced from this abiotic process confirming that sulfate only generated from biotic oxidation the absence of anodic microorganisms affected the cathodic reaction as well nitrate reduction was hampered by the limited electron supply from the abiotic anode only 7 9 0 6 mgno3 n l nitrate were removed at an average rate of 0 8 0 1 mgno3 n l ncc h fig 4b the cathode potential increased from 0 215v to 0 113v along with a decrease in current indicating a shortage of electrons at the cathode due to the ineffective sulfide oxidation at the anode in the first 12 h of the test when electrons were still available cathodic denitrification proceeded with complete nitrate reduction and neither nitrite nor nitrous oxide were observed accumulation of intermediates like nitrite and nitrous oxide is usually reported in the conventional denitrification process when electron donors are limited guo et al 2018 however products of microbial electrochemical denitrification are determined by the cathode potential the lower the cathode potential the more complete the denitrification pous et al 2015 zhang et al 2014b in the denitrifying biocathode nitrogen compounds are directly reduced by corresponding enzymes and electrons are transported to those enzymes from electron carriers such as cytochrome c furthermore the redox state of these carriers is dependent on the cathode potential rosenbaum et al 2011 the more negative the potential is the more electron carriers are available in reduced form which reflected the true availability of electrons thus when the cathode was polarized at a potential negative enough complete denitrification could be achieved production of undesirable denitrification end products such as no2 and n2o could be reduced in denitrifying biocathodes even though the total amount of available electrons was limited see fig 5 3 2 3 biotic sulfide oxidation coupled with abiotic nitrogen reduction bsan in the test scenario involving a biotic anode and an abiotic cathode the biotic anode was able to supply adequate electrons for cathodic reaction with the aid of microorganisms however the total current dropped sharply within 2 h of starting the test fig s3a due to a decrease in capacitive current beyenal and babauta 2015 nearly no current was generated after the sharp drop and consequently substrates inside both the anode and cathode chambers remained unchanged without the catalyzing bacteria denitrification was not observed nitrate transformation on barren graphite is commonly reported to be inefficient for example in previous tests only 8 of nitrate was reduced even under a current density of 140 ma cm2 fig s3b bouzek et al 2001 dash and chaudhari 2005 which is consistent with our observation 3 3 identification of functional microorganisms 3 3 1 anodic microorganisms as the anode is designed for sulfide oxidation a bacterium must meet two criteria to be a functional bacterium in this chamber the ability to oxidize sulfide biologically and the ability to transfer electrons to the anode given the criteria a series of sulfur oxidizers such as sulfurovum pseudomonas halothiobacillus and desulfuromonas are presented in table 2 as the potential functional microorganisms thriving in both planktonic and biofilm communities the abundance of desulfuromonas and pseudomonas on the anode surface increased from 0 5 to 5 85 and 0 03 2 72 respectively becoming immobilized on the electrode surface by secreting quorum sensing molecules and forming an electroactive biofilm are the traits of these two genera cai et al 2016 electroactive pseudomonas spp have been identified as exoelectrogens in various microbial electrochemical technologies like microbial fuel cells microbial electrolysis cells and microbial electrosynthesis ieropoulos et al 2005 logan and rabaey 2012 capable of exchanging electrons via conductive pili with electrodes reguera et al 2005 bacteria from the genus desulfuromonas are reportedly capable of oxidizing s0 to sulfate with a potential of 0 3v which is lower than the anode potential observed in this study of around 0 4v zhang et al 2014a with the presence of pseudomonas and desulfuromonas in the andic biofilm and an adequate anode potential the anode was able to oxidize sulfide to sulfate and avoid the passivation of the electrode by the accumulation of s0 therefore pseudomonas and desulfuromonas are recognized as the functional bacteria that oxidize sulfur to sulfate and deliver electrons to the anode by forming an electroactive biofilm sulfurovum and halothiobacillus were highly abundant in planktonic biomass 36 64 and 13 27 respectively compared with those in the attached biomass 8 85 and 1 76 respectively planktonic cells can also oxidize sulfide to sulfate but require oxidants as the electron acceptor in this study we initially suspected that the electron acceptor was o2 as it can be generated on the electrode surface under certain anode potential however the anode potential in this work fig s3b was unfavorable for o2 evolution which requires at least 1 0v zhang et al 2017a thus microorganisms could only utilize the anode as the electron acceptor moreover an electron storage mechanism of sob proposed by ter heijne et al 2018 may explain the high abundance of sulfur bacteria in the bulk liquid that is sulfur bacteria can oxidize sulfide to s0 using the membrane bound electron carriers e g quinones and cytochrome c as the mediating electron acceptor when exposed to sulfide and then store the sulfide electrons in the mediator pool once the cell meets the anode the stored electron will be released to complete the redox reaction through this mechanism sulfurovum and halothiobacillus can thrive in the bulk liquid making the attached bacteria not the only consortia for transferring electrons to the anode benefiting from such a mechanism electrode passivation was not induced by the massive s0 production in the bioanode s0 was produced by planktonic cells in the bulk which did not form a precipitate on the anode surface in contrast without microorganisms the anode surface was the only reaction site for sulfide oxidation causing all of the produced s0 to cover the anode surface however the considerably high abundance of levilinea 31 23 in the attached biomass is unexpected the association of levilinea with sulfur compound oxidation and the electroactivity are rarely examined in the literature see fig 6 3 3 2 cathodic microorganisms following the same criteria used in screening for the functional bacteria in the anode chamber functional bacteria in the cathode chamber are responsible for nitrate reduction when accepting electrons from the cathode first they should be denitrifying bacteria and thus denitrifiers in cathodic samples are given in table 3 the second criterion is the electroactivity biofilm forming bacteria can usually transfer electrons by building up a conductive matrix in the biofilm sulfurimonas thiobacillus paracoccus and pseudomonas enriched in the attached biofilm are capable of directly accepting electrons from cathodes decampos rodrigues and rosenbaum 2014 kondaveeti et al 2014 nguyen et al 2016 pous et al 2014 paracoccus and pseudomonas are characterized by conducting the cytochrome c nitrite reductase complex for denitrification ferguson and richardson 2004 which supports the hypothesis that cytochrome c serves as an electron shuttle in the cathodic extracellular electron transfer eet furthermore the abundance of cytochrome c associated genes in the attached biofilm was found to be at least double that in the planktonic biomass while no significant difference was observed in terms of the abundance of quinone associated genes fig s4 and table s1 the cytochrome c concentration is regarded as a marker of direct eet sturm et al 2012 implying that cytochrome c serves as a crucial eet mediator accepting electrons from the cathode and providing electrons for denitrification denitrifiers rheinheimera paracoccus and hoeflea were enriched in the planktonic biomass indicating that the planktonic microorganisms might also responsible for denitrification eet of planktonic microorganisms relies on mediators like h2 flavins quinones and phenazines harnisch and freguia 2012 rosenbaum et al 2011 the lowest potential of the biotic cathode was around 0 2v throughout the test fig s3b which is much higher than h2 evolution potential 0 8v nevin et al 2010 thus h2 was excluded from being the electron transfer mediator other than h2 self excreted mediators such as flavins quinones and phenazines may be produced to support the eet of planktonic cells harnisch and freguia 2012 however the literature has not reported the production of these mediators by rheinheimera paracoccus or hoeflea although these genera are capable of utilizing mediators excreted by other microorganisms in the system rosenbaum et al 2011 phenazine excreting bacteria like pseudomonas have been observed to produce phenazine at close to zero electrode potential in both planktonic and attached biomass bosire and rosenbaum 2017 given the complex cathodic microbial communities 50 of the unclassified species there might be other microorganisms excreting such mediators which are then utilized by rheinheimera paracoccus and hoeflea such synergic effect may exist in the denitrifying biocathode of the microbial electrochemical systems to facilitate denitrification see fig 7 3 4 hypothesized electron transfer of the sd dmes based on the discussion above a complicated electron transfer system is proposed below involving five types of electron transfer fig 8 in the anode chamber we have 1 biotic sulfide oxidation by microorganisms attached to the anode surface 2 biotic sulfide oxidation by planktonic microorganisms and 3 abiotic sulfide oxidation on the electrode surface and in the cathode chamber we have 1 soluble electron shuttles based mediated eet of planktonic microorganisms for denitrification and 2 cytochrome c based direct eet of immobilized microorganisms for denitrification eet is regarded as a universal of electron transfer strategy of microbes identified in various habitats koch and harnisch 2016 which makes it reasonable for several types of electron transfer to coexist in our system possibly by adopting different electron transfer strategies microorganisms can easily adapt to their specific ecological niches 3 5 environmental impact denitrification and sulfide oxidation were biologically mediated separately in this study to prevent the potential problems of directly mixing electron donor and acceptor streams it provides a solution for purifying nitrate contaminated groundwater lacking electron donors while no additional pollution would be introduced to the original groundwater stream however optimization of this process is also required in both the anode and cathode chambers especially the applied external voltage electrode potential ph sulfide nitrate ratio and inoculum source this system also provides a solution for polishing the wastewater effluent lacking organics but containing residual nitrate in which dosing chemicals always results in the exceeding of the discharge standard sulfide can be obtained from the eluent of the biogas desulfurization systems in wastewater treatment plants equipped with anaerobic digestion for methane generation which taps the treatment potential of wastewater treatment plants themselves 4 conclusion in this study an sd dmes is developed for the denitrification of nitrate contaminated groundwater without sacrificing the water quality with sulfide as the anodic electron donor the long term operation demonstrated that with the assistance of microorganisms electroautotrophic denitrification was achieved in the cathode chamber and passivation of the anode can be prevented pseudomonas desulfuromonas sulfurovum and halothiobacillus were recognized as the anodic functional bacteria sulfurimonas thiobacillus pseudomonas paracoccus rheinheimera and hoeflea played a crucial role in the cathode chamber to ensure complete denitrification functional bacteria can survive in biofilms and the bulk liquid in both the anode and cathode chambers suggesting the existence of both direct and mediated electron transfer mechanisms cathodic denitrification occurred at high cathode potentials indicating cytochrome c could be the bridge enabling the cathodic biofilm to accept electrons from the cathode this work has validated the feasibility of handling two different water streams in one reactor but independently without mixing them the concept of separate treatment can be extended to broader application fields moreover a complex electron transfer system is established to achieve this process

17816,most of the current studies on the toxicology of pristine nanoparticles nps are environmentally irrelevant because their aging process accompanied by the physicochemical transformation is inevitable in the environment considering aging phenomenon will gain a better understanding of the toxicity and fate of nps in the environment here we focused on the physicochemical transformation of anatase nps tio2 a and rutile nps tio2 r after 90 days of aging and investigated the responses of freshwater biofilm formation to the stress changes of naturally aged tio2 nps atio2 nps we found that after aging the tio2 nps underwent sophisticated physicochemical transformations in the original morphology and microstructure owing to organic and crystal salts inclusions such as energy band changes and the formation of ti3 on the nps surfaces these comprehensive transformations increased the stability of nps in the exposed suspension however the physicochemical transformations were crystal forms dependent and aging did not change the crystal structure and crystallinity interestingly compared to pristine nps atio2 nps showed much lower cytotoxicity and had the weaker ability to promote or inhibit the biofilm formation p 0 05 owing to the passivation of photoactivity caused by the comprehensive effect of the inclusions especially for atio2 a regardless of aging or not of crystal forms responses of biofilm formation were exposure concentration dependent namely low concentration promotion 0 1 mg l and high concentration inhibition 10 mg l e g role transition of the pioneers algae or bacteria in initial colonization extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and compositions of development stages with polysaccharide ps rich and protein pro rich stages and biomass and cell activity at different depths of mature biofilms the reactive oxygen species ros induced by tio2 nps showed typical hormesis the changing trends of the autoinducers c di gmp and quorum sensing signals including ahl and ai 2 were highly consistent with the growth stages of biofilms and were stimulated or suppressed by tio2 nps the nps crystal dependently changed the microorganism community structures while the upgma clustering of bacteria was based on the growth stages of the biofilms the toxic mechanisms revealed that photoactivity and nanoscale retention of particles are the main reasons for the differences in the ecological stress capacity of four kinds of tio2 nps aging reduced characteristic differences of two pristine nps and even reversed their relative stresses levels p 0 05 however the toxicity of high concentration atio2 nps 10 mg l remained serious in a water environment this study provides a better understanding for the water environmental risks evaluation and policy control of nanoparticles that is the effect of time aging has to be considered graphical abstract image 1 keywords aging tio2 nanoparticles crystalline phase physicochemical transformation freshwater biofilm formation quorum sensing 1 introduction the usage of anatase and rutile tio2 nps is exploding in industry and commerce owing to their novel physicochemical properties a sharp increase in two phase compositions release into the natural water environment along with industrial and municipal effluents is also anticipated tong et al 2015 these are potential environmental stressors for aquatic organisms hund rinke and simon 2006 iswarya et al 2015 vevers and jha 2008 however most previous studies on the environmental implications and nano ecotoxicology have mainly dealt with as prepared pristine tio2 nps indeed the highly reactive and physiochemically dynamic materials make nps inevitably undergo physicochemical transformations over time e g environmentally transformed nps aged nps including photochemical transformation oxidation and reduction dissolution precipitation adsorption desorption combustion biotransformation abrasion and other biogeochemically driven processes lowry et al 2012 nowack et al 2012 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 these transformation pathways will in turn govern the fate transport and photo reactivity and ultimately influence the persistence bioavailability biouptake and toxicity of tio2 nps in fact the term aging of tio2 nps and experimental aging methods in relevant environmental media have been recognized by researchers wang et al 2015 therefore the nature and extent of these transformations must be understood before significant progress can be made toward understanding the environmental risks posed by tio2 nps to aquatic environments lowry et al 2012 however studies on the transformation aging of tio2 nps are very limited apart from those on the most common environmental behaviors i e adsorption and agglomeration related processes chowdhury et al 2012 lin et al 2012 tong et al 2015 in term of the impacts of water indicators it is reported that the aggregation induced by inorganic ions or nom such as humic acid of photocatalytic tio2 nps reduces the generation of free hydroxyl radicals in aqueous suspensions depending on the aggregate size and structure jassby et al 2012 lin et al 2012 in term of the light impacts as a photoactive nanomaterial the photochemical transformation of tio2 nps is expected to be another an important process in aquatic environments sun et al 2014 wang et al 1997 reported the amphiphilic to hydrophobic conversion on a tio2 single crystal surface owing to the changes in the adsorbed hydroxyl groups during uv irradiation pan et al 2011 proved the pre adsorbed water on tio2 nps surfaces significantly modulate the surface structure and may alter the surface chemistry and consequently cause changes in the stability and photoreactivity under visible light thus an in depth understanding of the effects of the exposure environments especially in complex natural aquatic systems on tio2 nps transformation is essential for assessing their photo reactivity and environmental behavior in addition to the specific water chemistry conditions e g nom ionic strength and sunlight the behavior and transformation of nanomaterials in a water environment are determined by their intrinsic properties lowry et al 2012 neale et al 2013 recently qiang et al 2015 and li et al 2019a reported that different crystal forms of tio2 nps showed different affinity and adhesion to perfluorooctanesulfonate and extracellular polymer biomolecules respectively which eventually affects their toxicities to zebrafish and activated sludge as such there is an urgent need to determine whether the real and complicated water environmental factors including sunlight exposure could cause aging transformation phenomenon of the physicochemical properties of tio2 nps with different crystal forms for example in terms of surface structures and nanoscale effects photoactivity especially will aging have a significant impact on toxicity of nanoparticles to aquatic organisms such as freshwater biofilms in natural environments to the best of our knowledge the effects of sub non lethal exposure with different crystal forms of tio2 nps on the formation process from colonization to maturity of freshwater biofilms have not been well understood thus far as such to determine the ecological effects of environmentally relevant aged and environmental level concentration tio2 nps the responses of freshwater planktonic bacteria algae in terms of biofilm development need to be explored and clarified in view of the discussion above this study employed pristine and aged tio2 nps for comparative environmental stress tests during the growth of freshwater biofilm and focused on the effects of the crystal structure differences between them on the physical chemical and microstructural characteristics of eps in the different formation phases e g attachment desorption growth development and maturity dispersion detached bassler 2002 of freshwater biofilm of special interest are the responses and variations of microbial bacteria and algae community structures and the molecular regulatory mechanism during biofilm formation during exposure finally we explored the toxicity differences in the metabolic levels and cells necrosis distributions of different crystal forms of nps in terms of their initial characteristics and water environment behaviors as most of the toxicological data are generated under non environmentally relevant conditions we can perform risk assessments for aged actual level multiphase nps with higher accuracy and thus ensure natural water

exposure experimental methodologies of the freshwater biofilms are described in the si tests s4 and s5 in the initial stage after the first 2 h of incubation of indoor colonization of the biofilms an appropriate amount of aged tio2 np mother liquor was added to the artificial culture medium table s2 to prepare the required exposure dosages of 0 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 mg l of tio2 nps the continuous aeration dissolved oxygen concentration was kept at around 8 mg l and constant stirring at 120 rpm 25 c fig s7 were used to mimic the lake water disturbance environment gil allue et al 2015 this continuous nps exposure method has been reported previously kulacki et al 2012 the required nanoparticle exposure concentration was reconfigured when the medium was replaced the culture medium containing the nps was replaced at least once every seven days considering the time required for the natural maturation of biofilms and the actual pressure caused by long term exposure the effect of tio2 nps on the formation and behavior of freshwater biofilms was monitored over 90 days under simulated solar irradiation fig s6 2 3 biofilm amount and activity during biofilm formation freshwater biofilm amounts on slide glasses 76 26 mm were indirectly quantified by modified total organic carbon toc analysis dreszer et al 2014 slides fixed in hydrodynamic tanks were randomly collected in different exposure periods first the slides were rinsed with ultrapure water to remove non biological impurities and the biofilm on the slides facing the flow water flow direction was scraped off with a sterile brush next the slides were transferred to a culture dish containing 10 ml of ultrapure water and subjected to ultrasonic treatment for 5 min 20 c 100 w 10 khz then they were washed three times with ultrapure water an aliquot of the biofilm suspension was placed in a toc free glass tube for toc assay shimadzu scientific instruments kyoto japan the details are provided in the report of dreszer et al 2014 in addition the intracellular adenosine triphosphate atp an energy source for all living organisms was measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kit xu et al 2019 to characterize the biofilm activity respiration and metabolism and thus divide the biofilm developmental stages ouyang et al 2017 thuptimdang et al 2015 namely the classical steps in population growth

leica tcs sp8 was used to visualize the microstructure response of the biofilm formation processes to nps exposure by imaging their spatial distribution of eps components wang et al 2018 in different

rinsed with 1 pbs to remove loosely adherent cells and then fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 2 h followed by their fluorescent staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo concanavalin a con a invitrogen life science usa and calcofluor white chowdhury et al sigma st louis mo to visualize pro and α and β d glucopyranose ps respectively chen et al 2006 the specific dyeing process was strictly in accordance with the reported protocol of wang et al 2018 the excitation emission wavelengths namely 488 520 green 561 580 red and 400 435 nm blue were used to observe fitc con

stages were observed using a combination of 5 6 carboxyfluorescein diacetate propidium iodide cfda pi invitrogen and clsm imaging technology li et al 2019b details are provided in test s7 2 5

dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole hydrochloride staining and counting under an epifluorescence microscope porter and feig 1980 were used to analyze the dynamics of the bacterial community structure and bacterial cell numbers respectively during the development and evolution early middle and late period of the exposed biofilm in addition the dynamic analysis of algal cell numbers and structure was carried out respectively using a phyto edf fluorometer heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany according to our previous protocol li et al 2017 2 6 regulation of molecular signals and quorum sensing qs the intracellular measurement of ros was carried out with an oxidation sensitive fluorescent probe 2 7 dichlorofluoresce diacetate dcfh da according to our previous protocol li et al 2019a the contents of ahl and ai 2 in biofilm during the exposure experiment were estimated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kit and the experiments were performed by nanjing senbeijia biological technology co ltd china briefly aliquots of samples collected from 6 well polystyrene microplates were added into the microtiter plate wells and coated by individually purified ahl ai 2 antibody to produce solid phase antibody which was then labeled by horseradish peroxidase hrp then 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb substrate was added to the complex for coloration and the reactions were stopped by the injection of 2 m l h2so4 finally the concentrations of ahl ai 2 were measured with a microplate reader at 450 nm and compared the od450 of the samples to their respective standard curve isolation and quantification of bis 3 5 cyclic diguanosine monophosphate c di gmp in biofilms were based on the previous reports simm et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 2 7 other analytical methods the development of biofilms in different exposed stages and the interaction with tio2 nps were observed using a high power optical microscope e100 nikon and scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis eds for surface elements respectively at the end of continuous exposure the distributions of intracellular and extracellular tio2 nps of the biofilm were determined according to our previous protocol li et al 2019b the total eps extraction and quantitative analysis procedures including polysaccharides ps and proteins pro followed our previous protocol qian et al 2017 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were implemented at least in triplicate and the results are given in terms of the mean standard deviation the statistical significance was compared to the control by student s t test for p 0 05 using spss 18 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 pristine and aged tio2 nps characteristics firstly surface features of pristine and aged tio2 nps were determined as we reported previously li et al 2019a pristine tio2 a and tio2 r showed rough cube and sphere shaped and smooth nanosheet shaped particles respectively fig 1 a after 90 days of simulated natural aging high resolution tem hrtem jem 2100f japan and selected area electron diffraction saed images showed that the surface microstructures of the nps changed drastically with near disappearance of the clear lattice fringes and the appearance of distinct concentric circle outlines respectively probably because of the inclusion blue arrows of nom and the surface deposition of inorganic salt crystals in lake water x ray diffraction xrd model d8 advanced x ray diffractometer germany fig 1b and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir ir affinity 1 shimadzu kyoto japan fig s1 analysis confirmed our conjecture that both titanium metal al fe cu ca etc oxides and halite nacl etc salt crystals as well as nom with co or c h occurred on the surface of aged tio2 nps icp ms and toc analysis showed that the trace metal basis of atio2 a and atio2 r decreased to 96 7 and 97 9 respectively table 1 moreover for the surface chemical structure analysis of aged tio2 nps using raman spectra fig s2 several broad peaks at around 1000 1200 cm 1 attributable to c c c o c o h and c h stretching vibrations occurred leon et al 2017 as prominently as those in the ft ir indicating further the inclusion of nom on the particle surfaces in addition to the physical adsorption effects zhang et al 2016 revealed that uv irradiation induces the growth of tio2 surface hydroxyls which could chelate with both metal ions and nom and hydrogen bond with each other secondly crystal structures and defects of pristine and aged tio2 nps were determined xrd analysis showed that both tio2 a and tio2 r with or without aging are composed of single crystal types with dominant crystal surface indices of 101 and 110 respectively furthermore the crystallinity and grain size and arrangement of nps influencing the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of tio2 nps vance et al 2015 are not affected by aging similarly investigation of the nps surface element chemical state using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 1c indicated that compared to pristine tio2 nps the elements occurring on the surface of aged tio2 nps mainly include n al ca mg si etc suggesting that nom and metal inorganic salts are adsorbed deposited on the nps surface in the high resolution ti 2p spectra the appearance of ti4 in pristine tio2 a was proved by the appearance of a main peak at 458 5 ev assigned to ti 2p3 2 meanwhile a higher binding energy position at 465 9 ev corresponded to ti 2p1 2 after aging the two fitted peaks of ti 2p in atio2 r seemed to move slightly to the right while that in atio2 a obviously appeared in the positions of lower binding energy namely 457 6 ev and 463 2 ev respectively the lower oxidation states of which indicate that ti3 or oxygen defects were formed on the surface of atio2 a moreover the crystalline microstructure of aged tio2 nps was further identified by raman measurements renishaw invia raman spectrometer as shown in fig s2 the anatase phase of pristine tio2 nps is determined by the tetragonal space group of i41 amd and six raman active modes 1a1g 2b1g 3eg are allowed according to the factor group analysis the rutile crystal of pristine tio2 nps is determined by the tetragonal space group of p42 mnm and four raman active modes b1g multi proton process 230 cm 1 eg a1g are allowed yan et al 2013 similarly after aging the raman peaks of atio2 a weakened or widened and occurred as a red shift b1g 1 or a blue shift eg 3 compared to pristine tio2 a suggesting the formation of oxygen defects smith et al 2019 or ti3 or the relaxation surface and reconstruction caused by the enrichment of small particles on the surface while there were no significant changes in the raman fingerprints of atio2 r consistent with the xps patterns all of above these shifts caused by aging transformation might stem from the interaction between the tio2 nps and the specific water chemistry conditions nom salinity sunlight etc they also indicate that compared to the rutile structure the instability of the anatase structure could transform the surface microstructure i e ti3 or oxygen vacancy cluster formation more easily under reducing conditions this might have a differentially effect on their photooxidation activity yan et al 2013 and ultimately effect on the toxic behaviors imposed by the inherent crystal properties e g the distinctive crystallographic facets of different crystal forms of tio2 nps liu et al 2016 thirdly photoactivities of pristine and aged tio2 nps were determined intriguingly diffuse reflectance spectra drs shimadzhu 2600 japan analysis of the band gap energies eg revealed that natural aging could reduce the e g of tio2 r from 3 02 ev tio2 r to 2 85 ev atio2 r and increase the e g of tio2 a from 3 2 ev tio2 a to 3 32 ev atio2 a fig s3 this might mean a change in photoactivity as such acellular ros and oh production as indicated by the methylene blue mb degradation rates and photo oxidation of 3 p hydroxyphenyl fluorescein hpf figs s4a and s4b respectively were used to determine whether natural aging could passivate or sensitize the photoactivity of tio2 nps the results showed that pristine tio2 a and tio2 r exhibited relatively higher kox h 1 of mb mainly because of the sufficient ros oh production meanwhile aging seemed to reduce the essential differences between anatase and rutile nps and passivated their photoactivity i e not statistically significant p 0 05 even at 10 mg l he et al 2016 reported the passivation of photosensitivity might be attributed to the combination of shell photosensitization effects of the nom macromolecules such as humic acids and sheltering phenomenon of deposited salt on core tio2 nps in lake water the changing trend of e g may be closely related to the thickness of the coating layer and there is a threshold coating percentage for altering the photoreactivity and subsequent phototoxicity of tio2 he et al 2016 moreover the presence of inorganic salts more or less decreases the photocatalytic efficiency depending of their nature or effects on tio2 nps structure guillard et al 2005 qin et al 2017 this may suggest the related weak biotoxicity of atio2 nps in terms of photoreactivity in addition the uv vis spectra fig s4c of nps suspensions indicated that aging could cause the blue shift of spectral absorption of the anatase form while the red shift of spectral absorption of the rutile phase was consistent with the drs fig s3a which could seemingly explain the decrease in e g of atio2 r and increase in e g of atio2 a compared with the their corresponding pristine tio2 nps this caused a slight reversal of their photoactivity after aging figs s4a and s4b owing to a smaller e g up to 435 nm corresponding to 2 85 ev making atio2 r sensitive to visible light and a larger e g up to 373 nm corresponding to 3 32 ev making atio2 a insensitive to visible light in addition it seems that it was difficult for the simulated sunlight to excite atio2 a with a band gap of 3 32 ev and 2 85 ev atio2 r did not trigger significant ros production as well which could be the shielding effect of salt deposition on the nps surface guillard et al 2005 qin et al 2017 moreover the aggregation dynamics fig s4d showed that aging could increase the stability of nps because of the electrostatic repulsion of the higher negative potential table 1 of nps caused by nom inclusion zhang et al 2016 3 2 effects of tio2 nps on biofilm colonization and development as shown in fig 2 a the toc analysis was used to determine changes in biomass during the development of freshwater biofilms showing the fundamental nature of the biphasic dose response relationship regardless of the type of tio2 nps exposure to nps at concentrations no more than 0 1 mg l could promote the biofilm formation while showing high dosage inhibitory effects p 0 05 of nps on the biofilm amount at or above 10 mg l it is worth noting that regardless of the crystal form of 1 mg l tio2 nps the pristine antimicrobial roles p 0 05 and aged incentive roles p 0 05 tio2 nps showed contrasting effects this may be due to that 1 mg l pristine nps further promote biofilm development and maturity and preferential fading detachment more than that of aged nps confirmed in later chapters however the mechanism of low concentration nps 1 mg l promoting biofilm development is the comprehensive result of three functions namely hormone effect and stress response of freshwater biofilm as well as nps helping algae accelerate photoelectron conduction kulacki et al 2012 interestingly the highest exposure concentration 1000 mg l nps in this study did not cause the disappearance or depletion of the biofilm mainly because of two main mechanisms 1 enhancing biofilm formation activity the fast construction of a dense physical structure accelerated by rapid expression of the autoinducers acted as a barrier to nps exposure in the interior of the biofilm aggregate and then aggregation stabilized a complex microbial ecosystem that enhances the ability of the community to adapt to prolonged nps exposure tang et al 2018 2 decreasing photooxidation capacity of nps the loss of effective photoactive sites was caused by shadowing quenching and mass transport limitations at high tio2 nps exposure concentrations jassby et al 2012 these findings indicated a typical hormesis effect of tio2 nps on biofilm formation namely a two phase dose response relationship characterized by low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition gambino and cappitelli 2016 to further reveal the biphasic dose effects of four tio2 nps on the biofilm biomass the 90 day development process of biofilms from colonization to maturity during tio2 nps stress was investigated at non lethal and lethal concentrations of 0 0 1 and 10 mg l as shown in fig 2b and c three stages of biofilm development were identified from these atp activity levels in terms of the control group it showed the classical formation mode of the bio aggregates namely the first stage with reversible and irreversible adsorption early lag phase 1 15 day the second stage with peak metabolic activity middle exponential phase 15 45 day and the third stage with the mature period of gradual and stable attenuation late stationary phase 45 90 day interestingly the addition of 0 1 mg l tio2 nps could accelerate the biofilm colonization and development with pristine nps showing higher incentive effects than aged nps regardless of the crystal forms as for pristine nps 1 7 days 7 30 days and 30 90 days corresponded to the early middle and late development stages of biofilm formation respectively whereas for the aged nps 1 10 days 10 45 days and 45 90 days corresponded to the early middle and late stages of biofilm growth respectively conversely at 10 mg l the stress of four tio2 nps exerted elongation effects on the adaptive period of biofilm early colonization and inhibition effects on the peak metabolic activity in the biofilm exponential growth period with pristine nps having more prominent roles than aged nps regardless of the crystal forms for pristine nps 1 30 days 30 60 days and 60 90 days corresponded to the early middle and late stages of biofilm development respectively for aged nps the three growth stages were 1 20 days 20 45 days and 45 90 days respectively hall stoodley et al 2004 reported that biofilm formation is likely to be an ancient adaptation of prokaryotic life and changes in gene expression transform swimmers to stickers within minutes and the formed biofilm affords protection from a wide range of environmental challenges such as antibiotics and antimicrobial agents in addition subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics not only induced bacterial biofilm formation hoffman et al 2005 but also enhanced the aggregation of cyanobacteria tan et al 2018 and promoted biofilm formation of synechococcus elongates tan et al 2016 moreover low dose tio2 nps also promoted the formation of different bacterial biofilms by stimulating substantial production of eps chen et al 2018 mathur et al 2017 however the high concentration of nanoparticles partially lethal could inhibit or prolong the development of biofilms probably because of the adjustment of planktonic cells or a monoculture of one phylogenetic unit to obtain hormesis and the selective growth of persisters tang et al 2018 3 3 dynamic biomass and composition structure during biofilm formation according to the atp data we chose the 7th 30th and 60th day representing the early middle and late stages of biofilm development to study the colonization and evolution of algae and bacteria in biofilms during 0 1 and 10 mg l tio2 nps exposure respectively because algae and bacteria are the main microorganisms in freshwater biofilm as shown in fig s8a at 0 1 mg l nps the stimulated concentration seems to make algae colonization green algae and diatoms dinoflagellates table 2 easier and faster on the slide compared to bacteria seemingly tending to form an algal biofilm especially in the middle stage of biofilm development fig s8a this is supposed to reflect the potential for ti to enhance electron transport in ways that facilitate photosynthesis of certain types of plants kulacki et al 2012 cooksey and wigglesworth cooksey 1995 showed that the diatoms can be the first colonizers of a conditioned surface they are also proved that pristine tio2 a and tio2 r with higher photosensitivity could further promote algal development with higher chlorophyll a concentrations and related algal biomass p 0 05 table 2 in the middle and late stages of biofilm formation cyanobacteria and green algae became the dominant species table 2 probably because of less suitable environmental factors and nutritional conditions and the higher sensitivity of diatoms li et al 2017 however even if algal biomass and bacterial cell counts were not measured using the same methods at 10 mg l nps fig s8b might visually confirm bacteria became the main force of colonization in addition to the diatoms seemingly tending to form a yellow brown bacterial biofilm in the middle and late stages of development this is because high concentration tio2 nps deposited on the algal cell surface or produced a shading effects produced in suspension fig 6b sem confirmed that thus reducing light availability for photosynthesis baek et al 2019 and making bacteria the dominant colonizer liu et al 1993 dürr and thomason 2010 also confirmed the highest algal biomass in eutrophic non light limiting environments and the bacteria are more important in a lack of light environment interestingly in contrast to 0 1 mg l bacteria and diatoms dinoflagellates maintain a high biomass in all the biofilm formation stages table 2 and fig s8b this is in contrast to our previous study under the synergistic effect of tio2 nps and uvc li et al 2017 which might be attributed to the fact that under simulated sunlight of this study the growth dynamics of the diatom dinoflagellates community are weak light adaptive types and the suitable light intensity range is relatively wide zhou et al 2017 indeed the 10 mg l nps delayed the development of the biofilm screened tolerant microorganisms and promoted the selective and enriched growth of persisters under high oxidation pressure table 2 notably at 10 mg l algal biomass and bacterial cell in aged nps groups seem to have significant different results from the control more so than the pristine nps this might be because that the development mature of biofilm in the exposed group is relatively late and no premature degradation so there was more biomass compared to control group while compared to aged nps the toxicity inhibition effects of pristine nps are more significant so there was a relatively less biomass table 2 in terms of the bacterial community structure table s3 lists results similar to those in table 2 compared with the control group the low concentration nps promoted an increase in bacterial richness observed species and chao 1 indexes and diversity shannon and simpson indexes while the high concentration nps inhibited the growth of bacteria and development of bacterial diversity during the three processes of biofilm formation regardless of crystal forms and aging in addition upgma clustering showed that the microbial community structure was clustered based on the microbial development stages fig 3 a this suggests that although the diversity of the biofilms was disturbed the crystalline forms and dosage exposure could not reverse the evolution of the biofilm communities even at 10 mg l notably in the 0 1 and 10 mg l exposure samples the analysis of bacterial phylum level indicated that proteobacteria the abundance of 60 remained unchanged bacteroidetes planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria cyanobacteria gemmatimonadetes and actinobacteria were the dominant phyla throughout the entire process of biofilm development regardless of the crystal forms the difference is that acidobacteria and cyanobacteria developed into the leading phyla at 0 1 mg l nps fig 3c while at 10 mg l nps verrucomicrobia actinobacteria and planctomycetes were selectively enriched fig 3a meanwhile fig 3b and d shows that the biofilm community structures at the genus level were gradually stable and mature in the exponential growth stage the second growth stage the abundant genera of gemmatimonas stenotrophobacter hyphomicrobium methyloversatilis terrimonas acidovorax luteolibacter and tolypothrix pcc 7601 etc during 10 mg l nps exposure fig 3b and sphingopyxis acidovorax candidatus amoebophilus and hyphomicrobium during 0 1 mg l nps exposure fig 3c might play a key role in the early colonization stage of biofilm formation in terms of the crystal structure the venn analysis fig s9 and chlorophyll fluorescence technology table 2 indicated that crystallinity and aging could change the microbial community structures bacteria and algae in different stages of biofilm development at 0 1 and 10 mg l fig 3a shows that the microbial community structure deviated from the control after exposure to four tio2 nps furthermore the bacterial communities of the control and atio2 a and atio2 r all showed clearly clustered spiking while pristine tio2 a and tio2 r showed apparently clustered spiking in the three stages of biofilm evolution during the 10 mg l nps exposure similarly compared to aged tio2 nps the growth stimulation of phytoplankton by low concentration and growth inhibition of phytoplankton by high concentration are more significant p 0 05 for pristine nps with higher photoactivities table 2 and fig s4a notably it seems that the effects of atio2 r on the biofilm growth stimulation and inhibition were more obvious than those of atio2 a which might be due to the smaller band gap of atio2 r in comparison to atio2 a fig s3b and broadening of the visible light absorption range fig s3a and fig s4c making it more active under simulated sunlight irradiation he et al 2016 therefore although aging reduced the photoactivity of pristine nps the photooxidation ability reversal of different crystalline phases caused by aging should be emphasized in the future outdoor long term aquatic ecotoxicology of nps the response patterns of above bacterial community composition at the level of phylum and genus similar to that of activated sludge li et al 2019a after being disturbed by different crystalline tio2 nps stress this might be attributed to community resilience including hormesis and the selective growth of persisters shade et al 2012 in addition adaptation mechanisms involving resistance by individual strains as well as community resilience and functional redundancy within the microbial community are accentuated by microbial diversity and social interactions within freshwater biofilm tang et al 2018 3 4 dynamic response of eps microstructure during biofilm formation the advantages of microbial aggregates in terms of the morphology and microstructure of eps dynamic responses against nps toxicity are determined further by the triple staining clsm technique because eps mainly including pro and ps acts as the scaffold for the 3d architecture of the biofilm during the biofilm formation process xu et al 2019 fig 4 and fig s10 show that in the early stage of biofilm development pro with low colonies tended to occupy the bottom while ps with relatively high density dominated the top of the biofilm with clear distribution in separate layers regardless of the type of tio2 nps and exposure concentrations it is assumed that the hydrophobic pro as the conditioning film on the surface of the carrier underlays the initial attachment of bacteria or algae dürr and thomason 2010 while the abundant expolysaccharides become glued to the nearby planktonic cells and guarantees continuous biofilm development to mature and differentiate vu et al 2009 in the presence of nps stresses of 10 mg l nps could inhibit or delay the production of eps conversely the 0 1 mg l nps promoted eps secretion but both exposure concentrations increased the proportion of pro in eps compared to the control table s4 the altered growth pattern caused by changeable environmental stresses might activate numerous stress response pathways including metabolism thickness density and composition and thus create an different important adaptation and survival strategy tang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 furthermore in the middle and late stages of biofilm development clsm images fig 4 and fig s10 confirmed that pro became dominant in the relatively mature biofilm while both α and β d glucopyranose ps were heterogeneously distributed across the biofilm matrix especially in nps exposed groups table s4 this shows that the ps rich and pro rich stages of the eps phases were inconsistent with the report of xu et al 2019 this might be due to the differences in the cell compositions of the biofilms specifically the extracellular enzyme contents and glycoconjugate structure are closely related to the biomass of bacteria and algae dürr and thomason 2010 or due to the leakage of extensive intracellular proteins resulting from considerable necrotic cells in the biofilms including late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells caused by photooxidation damage of the nps as in our previous research li et al 2019a necrosis data are available in the toxicity mechanism section naturally pristine nps with higher photoactivities could promote the production of pro while for aged nps atio2 r seemed to show a higher pro contribution compared to atio2 a regardless of the exposure concentrations table s4 moreover qian et al 2017 also reported that pro responses were more intense and faster than ps responses in mature freshwater biofilms exposed to tio2 nps this could be attributed to the following three factors i e the substantial extracellular pro were needed to 1 decompose organic macromolecules for microorganism uptake in the late stage of biofilm development especially when under duress chróst 1991 2 maintain the structural stability of the biofilm through a self repairing system and 3 actually be the first to bear the brunt rather than the expolysaccharide components when faced with poisons dignac et al 1998 zhang et al 2007 3 5 regulation of autoinducers and quorum sensing during biofilm formation firstly intracellular ros were determined because oxidative stress could be either detrimental or beneficial depending on the dosage as with other autoinducers exhibiting hormetic behaviors including mechanisms regulating biofilm formation gambino and cappitelli 2016 table 3 shows the development stage dependent production of ros during the exposure period with 0 1 and 10 mg l nps exposure the incentive 111 3 135 1 of control and traumatic 246 5 568 5 of control increase of ros occurred in the early stage of biofilm development respectively this might be an internal reason for the advance and lag of biofilm development under two concentrations of exposure the high oxidative stress is so persistent that it exceeds the point of no return and it can lead to cell death whereas the middle low levels of stress suggest adaptation acting as a stress inducer at a medium concentration and the shift of metabolic pathways acting as a cue at a low concentration bernier and surette 2013 such as for prebiotic chemistry and the origin of life xu et al 2013 interestingly in the middle late of biofilm formation the ros returned to a level slightly higher than that of control the especially at 0 1 mg l regardless of the crystal forms table 3 this suggests that in microbial aggregates the cells were able to not only face oxidative stress but also exploit it using ros as a signal or cue to prepare to adapt to a changing environment through a complex pathway involving various regulators so that cell death is avoided and even biofilm formation is enhanced xu et al 2019 gambino and cappitelli 2016 speculated that the integration of ros into several different signaling pathways including the switch between planktonic and sessile forms could still be fundamental from the eco evolutionary point of view in addition the c di gmp were determined because it has a strong ability of organization coordination to integrate transcription factors with completely opposite functions to jointly drive the expression of antioxidant enzymes and help bacteria quickly adapt to the adverse environment li et al 2018 as shown in table 3 at 0 1 mg l the c di gmp in bacteria has higher content up to nine times in the early middle stage of biofilm development than that of the control it is reported that c di gmp regulates biofilm formation and diffusion through the regulation of eps secretion and various movements of bacteria including swimming swarming and twitching wolska et al 2016 the role of the high concentration of c di gmp in bacteria can be precisely described as follows c di gmp locks bacteria in a sessile state by increasing the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides such as cellulose and thus reducing the motor ability of bacteria while the low level of c di gmp could stimulate bacteria swimming and cluster movement and get rid of eps boehm et al 2010 karaolis et al 2005 kearns 2010 predictability in the late stage of the mature and senescence of the biofilm compared to control a drastic decrease of c di gmp would facilitate the floating and the next colonization of bacteria table 3 with the relative decrease of polysaccharide content table s4 however at 10 mg l the nps severely inhibited the c di gmp levels in the early middle stages of biofilm formation while in the late stage c di gmp had higher levels than that of the control which might be due to the delayed maturation effects of biofilm fig 2b and c on prolonging the c di gmp accumulation moreover quorum sensing qs a mechanism of function in multicellular organisms were determined because it is more resistant to oxidative damage and will also be selected in terms of oxidative stress gambino and cappitelli 2016 table 3 shows that the whole changing tendency of qs molecules was in line with the biofilm development processes where the increase of both ahl and ai 2 concentrations were accompanied by the increase of biofilm density similarly the low concentration of nps clearly contributed to the secretion of ahl and ai 2 and thus to the biofilm development while 10 mg l delayed their secretion and reduced their concentration in the mature stage of biofilm formation table 3 in addition our results also confirmed that the ahl and ai 2 concentrations are proportional to the eps contents during biofilm formation table 3 and table s4 because the phenotypes such as eps generation and physiological behavior of entire microbial communities were mediated through qs moreover qs molecules secreted responses differentially altered by tio2 nps with different concentrations and crystal forms suggested that the social community structure fig 3 and table s3 and physical mass transfer related to eps production fig 4 and table s4 environments of microbial population were influenced or altered li et al 2019b notably it has been reported that ahl mediates not only the information exchange between bacteria but also the interaction between bacteria and algae joint et al 2002 tait et al 2005 in their pioneering study bruckner et al 2011 reported that during marine biofouling biofilm formation bacteria provide convenience for diatoms to attach grow secrete eps and form diatom biofilms in turn the eps secreted by diatoms provides nutrients for bacteria growth however the premise of all this is to ensure the proper concentration of ahl showing a typical hormesis effect namely low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition for the attachment and growth of diatoms yang et al 2016a 2016b and green algae bi et al 2012 therefore in the beginning of biofilm development diatom and green algae were the dominant species with the low dose stimulation of ahl while bacteria and cyanobacteria were the dominant species in the late stage regardless of exposure concentration and crystal types table 2 table 3 and fig s8 in terms of the nps crystal structure at low excitation concentration 0 1 mg l the excitation effects of the nps were consistent with their photooxidation capacities i e the higher the photooxidation capacity the stronger is the auxo action to biofilm formation the incentive effects of the pristine tio2 nps tio2 a tio2 r were greater than those of aged nps atio2 r atio2 a in terms of catalytic roles of the autoinducers ros c di gmp and qs molecules during the period of biofilm growth and development table 3 at high inhibitory concentration 10 mg l notably regardless of aging or not tio2 r showed stronger oxidative stress ros and the higher delay or inhibition of regulatory molecules cumulants effective doses than those of tio2 a table 3 these are consistent with end point biomass fig 1a and eps secretion contents in different growth exposure stages table s4 therefore it is necessary to further explore the potential mechanisms for all of above differential outcomes caused by pristine and aged tio2 nps with two crystal structures 3 6 potential toxic mechanisms of tio2 nps to biofilm formation firstly the distribution of esterase active cells and necrotic cells in different depths of a mature biofilm was observed by clsm in situ to explore the differences of the final stress status and metabolic levels of cells in the mature biofilms after continuous exposure of tio2 nps as shown in fig 5 a the left column is the 3d projection and the right side represents the 2 d image of the brightest layer in each sample through the contrast of green active cell and red necrotic cell we intuitively found that the overall green in the control group indicated high microbial activity fig 5aa and 5aa1 however from 0 1 to 10 mg l nps exposure the proportion of red necrotic cells visually increased sharply suggesting that the overall metabolic activities of microorganisms in mature biofilms were seriously degraded regardless of the crystal structures for the 0 1 mg l nps exposures there were an increase in the dead cells in the biofilm bottom layer along with the promoting the development and maturity of biofilms while live bacteria were mainly concentrated in the outermost biofilm layers fig 5aa 5ae which is consistent with a previous report neu and lawrence 1997 by contrast 10 mg l nps showed that the overall activity of biofilms was inhibited with the necrotic cells considerably beginning to proliferate on the surface of microorganisms fig 5aa1 5ae1 as shown in fig 5ba and 5ba1 the numerical value of fig 5a images also confirmed the abovementioned conclusions that in the same depth of the biofilm the ratio values of active necrotic cells in the control were much greater than those of the tio2 nps exposure groups the greater the exposure concentration the lower is the ratio in addition the total ratios of active necrotic cells decreased from 2 61 to 2 64 in the control groups to 1 45 2 12 in the 0 1 mg lnps exposed groups and to 0 64 1 67 in the 10 mg l nps exposed groups fig 5bb and 5bb1 respectively indicating a decline in the whole metabolic activity of exposed biofilm in terms of crystal forms pristine tio2 nps seemed to be more effective in reducing the activity of cells in different depths of the biofilm fig 5ba and 5ba1 mainly because 0 1 mg l pristine nps promoted senescence of the biofilm after preferential maturation fig 2 while for the 10 mg l pristine nps oxidative damage might be predominant reason compared with aging exposure groups table 3 interestingly compared to pristine tio2 a that generated more necrotic cells on the relative surface of the biofilm through direct contact oxidation death figs s4a and s4b pristine tio2 r led to more cell necrosis in the relative interior of the biofilm regardless of the exposure concentrations this might be the comprehensive result of the water environment behaviors of nps and biofilm responses such as eps secretions and compositions table s4 li et al 2019a comparatively speaking pristine tio2 a have the stronger photooxidation activity figs s4a and s4b while pristine tio2 r have the stronger ability to penetrate contact damage because of the greater particle stability in the culture medium fig s4d and a less protective layer of eps table s4 wang et al 2019 however at 0 1 and 10 mg l the atio2 a and atio2 r exposed groups did not show the above mentioned intersection trend of ratio values of active necrotic cells with slightly higher lethality rates in atio2 r exposed samples fig 5ba and 5ba1 this could be attributed to the aging induced passivation effects on both nps and enhanced visible light activity of tio2 r compared to tio2 a figs s3a and s3b moreover further analysis of fig 5ba and 5ba1 showed that after nps exposure the highest point of the ratio of live dead cells moved to the inner part of the biofilm at different degrees which indicated that the four nps had different effects on the distribution of the cell activity level in the biofilm moreover the surface characteristics of freshwater biofilm were observed by sem fig 6 a compared to the smooth and complete biofilm surface dotted with bacteria and algae in the control group a large number of nps dispersed or agglomerated on the surface of the exposed biofilm fig 6bb and 6bd and caused cell damage fragmentation and disorganization especially in the pristine tio2 nps exposed groups fig 6ab and 6ad which corresponds to their biomass and eps secretion fig 2a and table s4 notably fig 6c shows the crystalline and concentration dependent extracellular and intracellular titanium concentration in biofilm at low 0 1 mg l nps compared to pristine tio2 nps the atio2 nps seemed to be more likely to enter the cell especially in the atio2 r exposed sample p 0 05 which might mainly be due to the lower eps blocking table s4 and the retention of smaller particles size in the medium fig s4d at high 10 mg l nps the higher p 0 05 amount of nps entering the cells in pristine tio2 nps exposed samples might be due to the accumulation of nps on the surface of biofilms and the increase in the of plasma membrane permeability caused by high oxidative damage figs s4a and s4b summarily this study investigated the dynamic response process of biofilm development including biomass and atp levels microbial community structure and diversity eps yield and composition and secretion regulation of autoinducers etc and revealed the differential toxicity mechanisms of nps to cells in different depths of mature biofilms indeed above all these toxicity indexes have to be related to the initial characteristics of nps such as crystallinity and surface structure as well as their water environmental behaviors affected by aging transformation such as particle or structure stability and photooxidation activity 4 conclusions we compared the responses of freshwater biofilm formation from colonization to maturity to anatase and rutile tio2 nps and explored the effects of physicochemical transformation after simulated natural aging on exposure processes the main conclusions are as follows simulated natural aging in freshwater environmental did not change the crystal structure of tio2 nps however it could significantly p 0 05 deactivate the photo activities of tio2 a and tio2 r with energy band increase and decrease respectively and increase their water environmental stability these are mainly due to the comprehensive effects of nps surface inclusions such as nom and inorganic salt the low levels of tio2 nps 1 mg l evidently advanced planktonic cell colonization and biofilm formation and maturation while concentrations higher than or equal to 10 mg l inhibited and delayed biofilm development 10 mg l nps seemed to change the pioneers of biofilm colonization replacing algae with bacteria then nps changed the microorganism community structures because clustering of bacterial community was not only based on growth stages of biofilms but also closely related to the crystal forms regardless of the exposure concentrations the responses of the secretions and compositions pro ps of eps were crystal forms and concentration dependent during biofilm formation in the early stage of biofilm formation pro as the conditioning film with low colonies occupied the bottom while ps played glued roles with relatively high density dominating the top of the biofilm the ps rich and pro rich stages of the eps phases in the entire biofilm formation process were shown to occur regardless of the crystal structure and exposure concentration the ros induced by tio2 nps showed typical hormone effects on biofilm formation the changing trend of the autoinducers including c di gmp and qs ahl and ai 2 signaling molecules were highly consistent with the development stages of the biofilms and disturbed by tio2 nps the c di gmp messenger regulated the entire biofilm formation process while ahl and ai 2 molecules mainly regulated the middle late stages of biofilm development by mediating the exchange of information between cells and activating the inherent response mechanism of the eps components the responses of biofilm formation processes are closely related to the crystal structure of tio2 nps and aging significantly affects their toxic ability compared to atio2 nps pristine tio2 nps could further promote or delay biofilm formation as well as inhibit biofilm amount and cell activity more strongly especially for the stronger photoactive tio2 a aging significantly reduced cells necrosis rates at different depths of the biofilm mainly because of the blocking effect on photoactivity especially for the tio2 a with thick inclusions finally this is the first time that the effects of nps entering the water environment using typical tio2 nps after natural aging on the colonization and development process of freshwater biofilm have been fully understood and compared with the toxicity of the pristine nps it was found that aging could reduce the environmental pressure of nps and even reverse the toxicity of different nps such a study will pave the way for a better understanding of the post

17816,most of the current studies on the toxicology of pristine nanoparticles nps are environmentally irrelevant because their aging process accompanied by the physicochemical transformation is inevitable in the environment considering aging phenomenon will gain a better understanding of the toxicity and fate of nps in the environment here we focused on the physicochemical transformation of anatase nps tio2 a and rutile nps tio2 r after 90 days of aging and investigated the responses of freshwater biofilm formation to the stress changes of naturally aged tio2 nps atio2 nps we found that after aging the tio2 nps underwent sophisticated physicochemical transformations in the original morphology and microstructure owing to organic and crystal salts inclusions such as energy band changes and the formation of ti3 on the nps surfaces these comprehensive transformations increased the stability of nps in the exposed suspension however the physicochemical transformations were crystal forms dependent and aging did not change the crystal structure and crystallinity interestingly compared to pristine nps atio2 nps showed much lower cytotoxicity and had the weaker ability to promote or inhibit the biofilm formation p 0 05 owing to the passivation of photoactivity caused by the comprehensive effect of the inclusions especially for atio2 a regardless of aging or not of crystal forms responses of biofilm formation were exposure concentration dependent namely low concentration promotion 0 1 mg l and high concentration inhibition 10 mg l e g role transition of the pioneers algae or bacteria in initial colonization extracellular polymeric substances eps secretion and compositions of development stages with polysaccharide ps rich and protein pro rich stages and biomass and cell activity at different depths of mature biofilms the reactive oxygen species ros induced by tio2 nps showed typical hormesis the changing trends of the autoinducers c di gmp and quorum sensing signals including ahl and ai 2 were highly consistent with the growth stages of biofilms and were stimulated or suppressed by tio2 nps the nps crystal dependently changed the microorganism community structures while the upgma clustering of bacteria was based on the growth stages of the biofilms the toxic mechanisms revealed that photoactivity and nanoscale retention of particles are the main reasons for the differences in the ecological stress capacity of four kinds of tio2 nps aging reduced characteristic differences of two pristine nps and even reversed their relative stresses levels p 0 05 however the toxicity of high concentration atio2 nps 10 mg l remained serious in a water environment this study provides a better understanding for the water environmental risks evaluation and policy control of nanoparticles that is the effect of time aging has to be considered graphical abstract image 1 keywords aging tio2 nanoparticles crystalline phase physicochemical transformation freshwater biofilm formation quorum sensing 1 introduction the usage of anatase and rutile tio2 nps is exploding in industry and commerce owing to their novel physicochemical properties a sharp increase in two phase compositions release into the natural water environment along with industrial and municipal effluents is also anticipated tong et al 2015 these are potential environmental stressors for aquatic organisms hund rinke and simon 2006 iswarya et al 2015 vevers and jha 2008 however most previous studies on the environmental implications and nano ecotoxicology have mainly dealt with as prepared pristine tio2 nps indeed the highly reactive and physiochemically dynamic materials make nps inevitably undergo physicochemical transformations over time e g environmentally transformed nps aged nps including photochemical transformation oxidation and reduction dissolution precipitation adsorption desorption combustion biotransformation abrasion and other biogeochemically driven processes lowry et al 2012 nowack et al 2012 sun et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 these transformation pathways will in turn govern the fate transport and photo reactivity and ultimately influence the persistence bioavailability biouptake and toxicity of tio2 nps in fact the term aging of tio2 nps and experimental aging methods in relevant environmental media have been recognized by researchers wang et al 2015 therefore the nature and extent of these transformations must be understood before significant progress can be made toward understanding the environmental risks posed by tio2 nps to aquatic environments lowry et al 2012 however studies on the transformation aging of tio2 nps are very limited apart from those on the most common environmental behaviors i e adsorption and agglomeration related processes chowdhury et al 2012 lin et al 2012 tong et al 2015 in term of the impacts of water indicators it is reported that the aggregation induced by inorganic ions or nom such as humic acid of photocatalytic tio2 nps reduces the generation of free hydroxyl radicals in aqueous suspensions depending on the aggregate size and structure jassby et al 2012 lin et al 2012 in term of the light impacts as a photoactive nanomaterial the photochemical transformation of tio2 nps is expected to be another an important process in aquatic environments sun et al 2014 wang et al 1997 reported the amphiphilic to hydrophobic conversion on a tio2 single crystal surface owing to the changes in the adsorbed hydroxyl groups during uv irradiation pan et al 2011 proved the pre adsorbed water on tio2 nps surfaces significantly modulate the surface structure and may alter the surface chemistry and consequently cause changes in the stability and photoreactivity under visible light thus an in depth understanding of the effects of the exposure environments especially in complex natural aquatic systems on tio2 nps transformation is essential for assessing their photo reactivity and environmental behavior in addition to the specific water chemistry conditions e g nom ionic strength and sunlight the behavior and transformation of nanomaterials in a water environment are determined by their intrinsic properties lowry et al 2012 neale et al 2013 recently qiang et al 2015 and li et al 2019a reported that different crystal forms of tio2 nps showed different affinity and adhesion to perfluorooctanesulfonate and extracellular polymer biomolecules respectively which eventually affects their toxicities to zebrafish and activated sludge as such there is an urgent need to determine whether the real and complicated water environmental factors including sunlight exposure could cause aging transformation phenomenon of the physicochemical properties of tio2 nps with different crystal forms for example in terms of surface structures and nanoscale effects photoactivity especially will aging have a significant impact on toxicity of nanoparticles to aquatic organisms such as freshwater biofilms in natural environments to the best of our knowledge the effects of sub non lethal exposure with different crystal forms of tio2 nps on the formation process from colonization to maturity of freshwater biofilms have not been well understood thus far as such to determine the ecological effects of environmentally relevant aged and environmental level concentration tio2 nps the responses of freshwater planktonic bacteria algae in terms of biofilm development need to be explored and clarified in view of the discussion above this study employed pristine and aged tio2 nps for comparative environmental stress tests during the growth of freshwater biofilm and focused on the effects of the crystal structure differences between them on the physical chemical and microstructural characteristics of eps in the different formation phases e g attachment desorption growth development and maturity dispersion detached bassler 2002 of freshwater biofilm of special interest are the responses and variations of microbial bacteria and algae community structures and the molecular regulatory mechanism during biofilm formation during exposure finally we explored the toxicity differences in the metabolic levels and cells necrosis distributions of different crystal forms of nps in terms of their initial characteristics and water environment behaviors as most of the toxicological data are generated under non environmentally relevant conditions we can perform risk assessments for aged actual level multiphase nps with higher accuracy and thus ensure natural water

continuous nps exposure method has been reported previously kulacki et al 2012 the required nanoparticle exposure concentration was reconfigured when the medium was replaced the culture medium containing the nps was replaced at least once every seven days considering the time required for the natural maturation of biofilms and the actual pressure caused by long term exposure the effect of tio2 nps on the formation and behavior of freshwater biofilms was monitored over 90 days under simulated solar irradiation fig s6 2 3 biofilm amount and activity during biofilm formation freshwater

characterize the biofilm activity respiration and metabolism and thus divide the biofilm developmental stages ouyang et al 2017 thuptimdang et al 2015 namely the classical steps in population growth

leica tcs sp8 was used to visualize the microstructure response of the biofilm formation processes to nps exposure by imaging their spatial distribution of eps components wang et al 2018 in different exposure stages whole slides from different experimental groups were randomly collected to analyze the development of bio macromolecules in microbial aggregation these biofilms on the slides were rinsed with 1 pbs to remove loosely adherent cells and then fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 2 h followed by their fluorescent staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo

process was strictly in accordance with the reported protocol of wang et al 2018 the excitation emission wavelengths namely 488 520 green 561 580 red and 400 435 nm blue were used to observe fitc con a and cw respectively moreover to evaluate the metabolic activity of microorganisms in the biofilm the distributions of live esterase active dead necrotic cells in the biofilm in the late mature stages were observed using a combination of 5 6 carboxyfluorescein diacetate propidium iodide cfda pi invitrogen and clsm imaging technology li et al 2019b details are provided in test s7 2 5

dapi 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole hydrochloride staining and counting under an epifluorescence microscope porter and feig 1980 were used to analyze the dynamics of the bacterial community structure and bacterial cell numbers respectively during the development and evolution early middle and late period of the exposed biofilm in addition the dynamic analysis of algal cell numbers and structure was carried out respectively using a phyto edf fluorometer heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany according to our previous protocol li et al 2017 2 6 regulation of molecular signals and quorum sensing qs the intracellular measurement of ros was carried out with an oxidation sensitive fluorescent probe 2 7 dichlorofluoresce diacetate dcfh da according to our previous protocol li et al 2019a the contents of ahl and ai 2 in biofilm during the exposure experiment were estimated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kit and the experiments were performed by nanjing senbeijia biological technology co ltd china briefly aliquots of samples collected from 6 well polystyrene microplates were added into the microtiter plate wells and coated by individually purified ahl ai 2 antibody to produce solid phase antibody which was then labeled by horseradish peroxidase hrp then 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb substrate was added to the complex for coloration and the reactions were stopped by the injection of 2 m l h2so4 finally the concentrations of ahl ai 2 were measured with a microplate reader at 450 nm and compared the od450 of the samples to their respective standard curve isolation and quantification of bis 3 5 cyclic diguanosine monophosphate c di gmp in biofilms were based on the previous reports simm et al 2004 zhang et al 2017 2 7 other analytical methods the development of biofilms in different exposed stages and the interaction with tio2 nps were observed using a high power optical microscope e100 nikon and scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy analysis eds for surface elements respectively at the end of continuous exposure the distributions of intracellular and extracellular tio2 nps of the biofilm were determined according to our previous protocol li et al 2019b the total eps extraction and quantitative analysis procedures including polysaccharides ps and proteins pro followed our previous protocol qian et al 2017 2 8 statistical analysis all the experiments were implemented at least in triplicate and the results are given in terms of the mean standard deviation the statistical significance was compared to the control by student s t test for p 0 05 using spss 18 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 pristine and aged tio2 nps characteristics firstly surface features of pristine and aged tio2 nps were determined as we reported previously li et al 2019a pristine tio2 a and tio2 r showed rough cube and sphere shaped and smooth nanosheet shaped particles respectively fig 1 a after 90 days of simulated natural aging high resolution tem hrtem jem 2100f japan and selected area electron diffraction saed images showed that the surface microstructures of the nps changed drastically with near disappearance of the clear lattice fringes and the appearance of distinct concentric circle outlines respectively probably because of the inclusion blue arrows of nom and the surface deposition of inorganic salt crystals in lake water x ray diffraction xrd model d8 advanced x ray diffractometer germany fig 1b and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir ir affinity 1 shimadzu kyoto japan fig s1 analysis confirmed our conjecture that both titanium metal al fe cu ca etc oxides and halite nacl etc salt crystals as well as nom with co or c h occurred on the surface of aged tio2 nps icp ms and toc analysis showed that the trace metal basis of atio2 a and atio2 r decreased to 96 7 and 97 9 respectively table 1 moreover for the surface chemical structure analysis of aged tio2 nps using raman spectra fig s2 several broad peaks at around 1000 1200 cm 1 attributable to c c c o c o h and c h stretching vibrations occurred leon et al 2017 as prominently as those in the ft ir indicating further the inclusion of nom on the particle surfaces in addition to the physical adsorption effects zhang et al 2016 revealed that uv irradiation induces the growth of tio2 surface hydroxyls which could chelate with both metal ions and nom and hydrogen bond with each other secondly crystal structures and defects of pristine and aged tio2 nps were determined xrd analysis showed that both tio2 a and tio2 r with or without aging are composed of single crystal types with dominant crystal surface indices of 101 and 110 respectively furthermore the crystallinity and grain size and arrangement of nps influencing the photocatalytic activity and selectivity of tio2 nps vance et al 2015 are not affected by aging similarly investigation of the nps surface element chemical state using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 1c indicated that compared to pristine tio2 nps the elements occurring on the surface of aged tio2 nps mainly include n al ca mg si etc suggesting that nom and metal inorganic salts are adsorbed deposited on the nps surface in the high resolution ti 2p spectra the appearance of ti4 in pristine tio2 a was proved by the appearance of a main peak at 458 5 ev assigned to ti 2p3 2 meanwhile a higher binding energy position at 465 9 ev corresponded to ti 2p1 2 after aging the two fitted peaks of ti 2p in atio2 r seemed to move slightly to the right while that in atio2 a obviously appeared in the positions of lower binding energy namely 457 6 ev and 463 2 ev respectively the lower oxidation states of which indicate that ti3 or oxygen defects were formed on the surface of atio2 a moreover the crystalline microstructure of aged tio2 nps was further identified by raman measurements renishaw invia raman spectrometer as shown in fig s2 the anatase phase of pristine tio2 nps is determined by the tetragonal space group of i41 amd and six raman active modes 1a1g 2b1g 3eg are allowed according to the factor group analysis the rutile crystal of pristine tio2 nps is determined by the tetragonal space group of p42 mnm and four raman active modes b1g multi proton process 230 cm 1 eg a1g are allowed yan et al 2013 similarly after aging the raman peaks of atio2 a weakened or widened and occurred as a red shift b1g 1 or a blue shift eg 3 compared to pristine tio2 a suggesting the formation of oxygen defects smith et al 2019 or ti3 or the relaxation surface and reconstruction caused by the enrichment of small particles on the surface while there were no significant changes in the raman fingerprints of atio2 r consistent with the xps patterns all of above these shifts caused by aging transformation might stem from the interaction between the tio2 nps and the specific water chemistry conditions nom salinity sunlight etc they also indicate that compared to the rutile structure the instability of the anatase structure could transform the surface microstructure i e ti3 or oxygen vacancy cluster formation more easily under reducing conditions this might have a differentially effect on their photooxidation activity yan et al 2013 and ultimately effect on the toxic behaviors imposed by the inherent crystal properties e g the distinctive crystallographic facets of different crystal forms of tio2 nps liu et al 2016 thirdly photoactivities of pristine and aged tio2 nps were determined intriguingly diffuse reflectance spectra drs shimadzhu 2600 japan analysis of the band gap energies eg revealed that natural aging could reduce the e g of tio2 r from 3 02 ev tio2 r to 2 85 ev atio2 r and increase the e g of tio2 a from 3 2 ev tio2 a to 3 32 ev atio2 a fig s3 this might mean a change in photoactivity as such acellular ros and oh production as indicated by the methylene blue mb degradation rates and photo oxidation of 3 p hydroxyphenyl fluorescein hpf figs s4a and s4b respectively were used to determine whether natural aging could passivate or sensitize the photoactivity of tio2 nps the results showed that pristine tio2 a and tio2 r exhibited relatively higher kox h 1 of mb mainly because of the sufficient ros oh production meanwhile aging seemed to reduce the essential differences between anatase and rutile nps and passivated their photoactivity i e not statistically significant p 0 05 even at 10 mg l he et al 2016 reported the passivation of photosensitivity might be attributed to the combination of shell photosensitization effects of the nom macromolecules such as humic acids and sheltering phenomenon of deposited salt on core tio2 nps in lake water the changing trend of e g may be closely related to the thickness of the coating layer and there is a threshold coating percentage for altering the photoreactivity and subsequent phototoxicity of tio2 he et al 2016 moreover the presence of inorganic salts more or less decreases the photocatalytic efficiency depending of their nature or effects on tio2 nps structure guillard et al 2005 qin et al 2017 this may suggest the related weak biotoxicity of atio2 nps in terms of photoreactivity in addition the uv vis spectra fig s4c of nps suspensions indicated that aging could cause the blue shift of spectral absorption of the anatase form while the red shift of spectral absorption of the rutile phase was consistent with the drs fig s3a which could seemingly explain the decrease in e g of atio2 r and increase in e g of atio2 a compared with the their corresponding pristine tio2 nps this caused a slight reversal of their photoactivity after aging figs s4a and s4b owing to a smaller e g up to 435 nm corresponding to 2 85 ev making atio2 r sensitive to visible light and a larger e g up to 373 nm corresponding to 3 32 ev making atio2 a insensitive to visible light in addition it seems that it was difficult for the simulated sunlight to excite atio2 a with a band gap of 3 32 ev and 2 85 ev atio2 r did not trigger significant ros production as well which could be the shielding effect of salt deposition on the nps surface guillard et al 2005 qin et al 2017 moreover the aggregation dynamics fig s4d showed that aging could increase the stability of nps because of the electrostatic repulsion of the higher negative potential table 1 of nps caused by nom inclusion zhang et al 2016 3 2 effects of tio2 nps on biofilm colonization and development as shown in fig 2 a the toc analysis was used to determine changes in biomass during the development of freshwater biofilms showing the fundamental nature of the biphasic dose response relationship regardless of the type of tio2 nps exposure to nps at concentrations no more than 0 1 mg l could promote the biofilm formation while showing high dosage inhibitory effects p 0 05 of nps on the biofilm amount at or above 10 mg l it is worth noting that regardless of the crystal form of 1 mg l tio2 nps the pristine antimicrobial roles p 0 05 and aged incentive roles p 0 05 tio2 nps showed contrasting effects this may be due to that 1 mg l pristine nps further promote biofilm development and maturity and preferential fading detachment more than that of aged nps confirmed in later chapters however the mechanism of low concentration nps 1 mg l promoting biofilm development is the comprehensive result of three functions namely hormone effect and stress response of freshwater biofilm as well as nps helping algae accelerate photoelectron conduction kulacki et al 2012 interestingly the highest exposure concentration 1000 mg l nps in this study did not cause the disappearance or depletion of the biofilm mainly because of two main mechanisms 1 enhancing biofilm formation activity the fast construction of a dense physical structure accelerated by rapid expression of the autoinducers acted as a barrier to nps exposure in the interior of the biofilm aggregate and then aggregation stabilized a complex microbial ecosystem that enhances the ability of the community to adapt to prolonged nps exposure tang et al 2018 2 decreasing photooxidation capacity of nps the loss of effective photoactive sites was caused by shadowing quenching and mass transport limitations at high tio2 nps exposure concentrations jassby et al 2012 these findings indicated a typical hormesis effect of tio2 nps on biofilm formation namely a two phase dose response relationship characterized by low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition gambino and cappitelli 2016 to further reveal the biphasic dose effects of four tio2 nps on the biofilm biomass the 90 day development process of biofilms from colonization to maturity during tio2 nps stress was investigated at non lethal and lethal concentrations of 0 0 1 and 10 mg l as shown in fig 2b and c three stages of biofilm development were identified from these atp activity levels in terms of the control group it showed the classical formation mode of the bio aggregates namely the first stage with reversible and irreversible adsorption early lag phase 1 15 day the second stage with peak metabolic activity middle exponential phase 15 45 day and the third stage with the mature period of gradual and stable attenuation late stationary phase 45 90 day interestingly the addition of 0 1 mg l tio2 nps could accelerate the biofilm colonization and development with pristine nps showing higher incentive effects than aged nps regardless of the crystal forms as for pristine nps 1 7 days 7 30 days and 30 90 days corresponded to the early middle and late development stages of biofilm formation respectively whereas for the aged nps 1 10 days 10 45 days and 45 90 days corresponded to the early middle and late stages of biofilm growth respectively conversely at 10 mg l the stress of four tio2 nps exerted elongation effects on the adaptive period of biofilm early colonization and inhibition effects on the peak metabolic activity in the biofilm exponential growth period with pristine nps having more prominent roles than aged nps regardless of the crystal forms for pristine nps 1 30 days 30 60 days and 60 90 days corresponded to the early middle and late stages of biofilm development respectively for aged nps the three growth stages were 1 20 days 20 45 days and 45 90 days respectively hall stoodley et al 2004 reported that biofilm formation is likely to be an ancient adaptation of prokaryotic life and changes in gene expression transform swimmers to stickers within minutes and the formed biofilm affords protection from a wide range of environmental challenges such as antibiotics and antimicrobial agents in addition subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics not only induced bacterial biofilm formation hoffman et al 2005 but also enhanced the aggregation of cyanobacteria tan et al 2018 and promoted biofilm formation of synechococcus elongates tan et al 2016 moreover low dose tio2 nps also promoted the formation of different bacterial biofilms by stimulating substantial production of eps chen et al 2018 mathur et al 2017 however the high concentration of nanoparticles partially lethal could inhibit or prolong the development of biofilms probably because of the adjustment of planktonic cells or a monoculture of one phylogenetic unit to obtain hormesis and the selective growth of persisters tang et al 2018 3 3 dynamic biomass and composition structure during biofilm formation according to the atp data we chose the 7th 30th and 60th day representing the early middle and late stages of biofilm development to study the colonization and evolution of algae and bacteria in biofilms during 0 1 and 10 mg l tio2 nps exposure respectively because algae and bacteria are the main microorganisms in freshwater biofilm as shown in fig s8a at 0 1 mg l nps the stimulated concentration seems to make algae colonization green algae and diatoms dinoflagellates table 2 easier and faster on the slide compared to bacteria seemingly tending to form an algal biofilm especially in the middle stage of biofilm development fig s8a this is supposed to reflect the potential for ti to enhance electron transport in ways that facilitate photosynthesis of certain types of plants kulacki et al 2012 cooksey and wigglesworth cooksey 1995 showed that the diatoms can be the first colonizers of a conditioned surface they are also proved that pristine tio2 a and tio2 r with higher photosensitivity could further promote algal development with higher chlorophyll a concentrations and related algal biomass p 0 05 table 2 in the middle and late stages of biofilm formation cyanobacteria and green algae became the dominant species table 2 probably because of less suitable environmental factors and nutritional conditions and the higher sensitivity of diatoms li et al 2017 however even if algal biomass and bacterial cell counts were not measured using the same methods at 10 mg l nps fig s8b might visually confirm bacteria became the main force of colonization in addition to the diatoms seemingly tending to form a yellow brown bacterial biofilm in the middle and late stages of development this is because high concentration tio2 nps deposited on the algal cell surface or produced a shading effects produced in suspension fig 6b sem confirmed that thus reducing light availability for photosynthesis baek et al 2019 and making bacteria the dominant colonizer liu et al 1993 dürr and thomason 2010 also confirmed the highest algal biomass in eutrophic non light limiting environments and the bacteria are more important in a lack of light environment interestingly in contrast to 0 1 mg l bacteria and diatoms dinoflagellates maintain a high biomass in all the biofilm formation stages table 2 and fig s8b this is in contrast to our previous study under the synergistic effect of tio2 nps and uvc li et al 2017 which might be attributed to the fact that under simulated sunlight of this study the growth dynamics of the diatom dinoflagellates community are weak light adaptive types and the suitable light intensity range is relatively wide zhou et al 2017 indeed the 10 mg l nps delayed the development of the biofilm screened tolerant microorganisms and promoted the selective and enriched growth of persisters under high oxidation pressure table 2 notably at 10 mg l algal biomass and bacterial cell in aged nps groups seem to have significant different results from the control more so than the pristine nps this might be because that the development mature of biofilm in the exposed group is relatively late and no premature degradation so there was more biomass compared to control group while compared to aged nps the toxicity inhibition effects of pristine nps are more significant so there was a relatively less biomass table 2 in terms of the bacterial community structure table s3 lists results similar to those in table 2 compared with the control group the low concentration nps promoted an increase in bacterial richness observed species and chao 1 indexes and diversity shannon and simpson indexes while the high concentration nps inhibited the growth of bacteria and development of bacterial diversity during the three processes of biofilm formation regardless of crystal forms and aging in addition upgma clustering showed that the microbial community structure was clustered based on the microbial development stages fig 3 a this suggests that although the diversity of the biofilms was disturbed the crystalline forms and dosage exposure could not reverse the evolution of the biofilm communities even at 10 mg l notably in the 0 1 and 10 mg l exposure samples the analysis of bacterial phylum level indicated that proteobacteria the abundance of 60 remained unchanged bacteroidetes planctomycetes verrucomicrobia acidobacteria cyanobacteria gemmatimonadetes and actinobacteria were the dominant phyla throughout the entire process of biofilm development regardless of the crystal forms the difference is that acidobacteria and cyanobacteria developed into the leading phyla at 0 1 mg l nps fig 3c while at 10 mg l nps verrucomicrobia actinobacteria and planctomycetes were selectively enriched fig 3a meanwhile fig 3b and d shows that the biofilm community structures at the genus level were gradually stable and mature in the exponential growth stage the second growth stage the abundant genera of gemmatimonas stenotrophobacter hyphomicrobium methyloversatilis terrimonas acidovorax luteolibacter and tolypothrix pcc 7601 etc during 10 mg l nps exposure fig 3b and sphingopyxis acidovorax candidatus amoebophilus and hyphomicrobium during 0 1 mg l nps exposure fig 3c might play a key role in the early colonization stage of biofilm formation in terms of the crystal structure the venn analysis fig s9 and chlorophyll fluorescence technology table 2 indicated that crystallinity and aging could change the microbial community structures bacteria and algae in different stages of biofilm development at 0 1 and 10 mg l fig 3a shows that the microbial community structure deviated from the control after exposure to four tio2 nps furthermore the bacterial communities of the control and atio2 a and atio2 r all showed clearly clustered spiking while pristine tio2 a and tio2 r showed apparently clustered spiking in the three stages of biofilm evolution during the 10 mg l nps exposure similarly compared to aged tio2 nps the growth stimulation of phytoplankton by low concentration and growth inhibition of phytoplankton by high concentration are more significant p 0 05 for pristine nps with higher photoactivities table 2 and fig s4a notably it seems that the effects of atio2 r on the biofilm growth stimulation and inhibition were more obvious than those of atio2 a which might be due to the smaller band gap of atio2 r in comparison to atio2 a fig s3b and broadening of the visible light absorption range fig s3a and fig s4c making it more active under simulated sunlight irradiation he et al 2016 therefore although aging reduced the photoactivity of pristine nps the photooxidation ability reversal of different crystalline phases caused by aging should be emphasized in the future outdoor long term aquatic ecotoxicology of nps the response patterns of above bacterial community composition at the level of phylum and genus similar to that of activated sludge li et al 2019a after being disturbed by different crystalline tio2 nps stress this might be attributed to community resilience including hormesis and the selective growth of persisters shade et al 2012 in addition adaptation mechanisms involving resistance by individual strains as well as community resilience and functional redundancy within the microbial community are accentuated by microbial diversity and social interactions within freshwater biofilm tang et al 2018 3 4 dynamic response of eps microstructure during biofilm formation the advantages of microbial aggregates in terms of the morphology and microstructure of eps dynamic responses against nps toxicity are determined further by the triple staining clsm technique because eps mainly including pro and ps acts as the scaffold for the 3d architecture of the biofilm during the biofilm formation process xu et al 2019 fig 4 and fig s10 show that in the early stage of biofilm development pro with low colonies tended to occupy the bottom while ps with relatively high density dominated the top of the biofilm with clear distribution in separate layers regardless of the type of tio2 nps and exposure concentrations it is assumed that the hydrophobic pro as the conditioning film on the surface of the carrier underlays the initial attachment of bacteria or algae dürr and thomason 2010 while the abundant expolysaccharides become glued to the nearby planktonic cells and guarantees continuous biofilm development to mature and differentiate vu et al 2009 in the presence of nps stresses of 10 mg l nps could inhibit or delay the production of eps conversely the 0 1 mg l nps promoted eps secretion but both exposure concentrations increased the proportion of pro in eps compared to the control table s4 the altered growth pattern caused by changeable environmental stresses might activate numerous stress response pathways including metabolism thickness density and composition and thus create an different important adaptation and survival strategy tang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 furthermore in the middle and late stages of biofilm development clsm images fig 4 and fig s10 confirmed that pro became dominant in the relatively mature biofilm while both α and β d glucopyranose ps were heterogeneously distributed across the biofilm matrix especially in nps exposed groups table s4 this shows that the ps rich and pro rich stages of the eps phases were inconsistent with the report of xu et al 2019 this might be due to the differences in the cell compositions of the biofilms specifically the extracellular enzyme contents and glycoconjugate structure are closely related to the biomass of bacteria and algae dürr and thomason 2010 or due to the leakage of extensive intracellular proteins resulting from considerable necrotic cells in the biofilms including late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells caused by photooxidation damage of the nps as in our previous research li et al 2019a necrosis data are available in the toxicity mechanism section naturally pristine nps with higher photoactivities could promote the production of pro while for aged nps atio2 r seemed to show a higher pro contribution compared to atio2 a regardless of the exposure concentrations table s4 moreover qian et al 2017 also reported that pro responses were more intense and faster than ps responses in mature freshwater biofilms exposed to tio2 nps this could be attributed to the following three factors i e the substantial extracellular pro were needed to 1 decompose organic macromolecules for microorganism uptake in the late stage of biofilm development especially when under duress chróst 1991 2 maintain the structural stability of the biofilm through a self repairing system and 3 actually be the first to bear the brunt rather than the expolysaccharide components when faced with poisons dignac et al 1998 zhang et al 2007 3 5 regulation of autoinducers and quorum sensing during biofilm formation firstly intracellular ros were determined because oxidative stress could be either detrimental or beneficial depending on the dosage as with other autoinducers exhibiting hormetic behaviors including mechanisms regulating biofilm formation gambino and cappitelli 2016 table 3 shows the development stage dependent production of ros during the exposure period with 0 1 and 10 mg l nps exposure the incentive 111 3 135 1 of control and traumatic 246 5 568 5 of control increase of ros occurred in the early stage of biofilm development respectively this might be an internal reason for the advance and lag of biofilm development under two concentrations of exposure the high oxidative stress is so persistent that it exceeds the point of no return and it can lead to cell death whereas the middle low levels of stress suggest adaptation acting as a stress inducer at a medium concentration and the shift of metabolic pathways acting as a cue at a low concentration bernier and surette 2013 such as for prebiotic chemistry and the origin of life xu et al 2013 interestingly in the middle late of biofilm formation the ros returned to a level slightly higher than that of control the especially at 0 1 mg l regardless of the crystal forms table 3 this suggests that in microbial aggregates the cells were able to not only face oxidative stress but also exploit it using ros as a signal or cue to prepare to adapt to a changing environment through a complex pathway involving various regulators so that cell death is avoided and even biofilm formation is enhanced xu et al 2019 gambino and cappitelli 2016 speculated that the integration of ros into several different signaling pathways including the switch between planktonic and sessile forms could still be fundamental from the eco evolutionary point of view in addition the c di gmp were determined because it has a strong ability of organization coordination to integrate transcription factors with completely opposite functions to jointly drive the expression of antioxidant enzymes and help bacteria quickly adapt to the adverse environment li et al 2018 as shown in table 3 at 0 1 mg l the c di gmp in bacteria has higher content up to nine times in the early middle stage of biofilm development than that of the control it is reported that c di gmp regulates biofilm formation and diffusion through the regulation of eps secretion and various movements of bacteria including swimming swarming and twitching wolska et al 2016 the role of the high concentration of c di gmp in bacteria can be precisely described as follows c di gmp locks bacteria in a sessile state by increasing the secretion of extracellular polysaccharides such as cellulose and thus reducing the motor ability of bacteria while the low level of c di gmp could stimulate bacteria swimming and cluster movement and get rid of eps boehm et al 2010 karaolis et al 2005 kearns 2010 predictability in the late stage of the mature and senescence of the biofilm compared to control a drastic decrease of c di gmp would facilitate the floating and the next colonization of bacteria table 3 with the relative decrease of polysaccharide content table s4 however at 10 mg l the nps severely inhibited the c di gmp levels in the early middle stages of biofilm formation while in the late stage c di gmp had higher levels than that of the control which might be due to the delayed maturation effects of biofilm fig 2b and c on prolonging the c di gmp accumulation moreover quorum sensing qs a mechanism of function in multicellular organisms were determined because it is more resistant to oxidative damage and will also be selected in terms of oxidative stress gambino and cappitelli 2016 table 3 shows that the whole changing tendency of qs molecules was in line with the biofilm development processes where the increase of both ahl and ai 2 concentrations were accompanied by the increase of biofilm density similarly the low concentration of nps clearly contributed to the secretion of ahl and ai 2 and thus to the biofilm development while 10 mg l delayed their secretion and reduced their concentration in the mature stage of biofilm formation table 3 in addition our results also confirmed that the ahl and ai 2 concentrations are proportional to the eps contents during biofilm formation table 3 and table s4 because the phenotypes such as eps generation and physiological behavior of entire microbial communities were mediated through qs moreover qs molecules secreted responses differentially altered by tio2 nps with different concentrations and crystal forms suggested that the social community structure fig 3 and table s3 and physical mass transfer related to eps production fig 4 and table s4 environments of microbial population were influenced or altered li et al 2019b notably it has been reported that ahl mediates not only the information exchange between bacteria but also the interaction between bacteria and algae joint et al 2002 tait et al 2005 in their pioneering study bruckner et al 2011 reported that during marine biofouling biofilm formation bacteria provide convenience for diatoms to attach grow secrete eps and form diatom biofilms in turn the eps secreted by diatoms provides nutrients for bacteria growth however the premise of all this is to ensure the proper concentration of ahl showing a typical hormesis effect namely low dose stimulation and high dose inhibition for the attachment and growth of diatoms yang et al 2016a 2016b and green algae bi et al 2012 therefore in the beginning of biofilm development diatom and green algae were the dominant species with the low dose stimulation of ahl while bacteria and cyanobacteria were the dominant species in the late stage regardless of exposure concentration and crystal types table 2 table 3 and fig s8 in terms of the nps crystal structure at low excitation concentration 0 1 mg l the excitation effects of the nps were consistent with their photooxidation capacities i e the higher the photooxidation capacity the stronger is the auxo action to biofilm formation the incentive effects of the pristine tio2 nps tio2 a tio2 r were greater than those of aged nps atio2 r atio2 a in terms of catalytic roles of the autoinducers ros c di gmp and qs molecules during the period of biofilm growth and development table 3 at high inhibitory concentration 10 mg l notably regardless of aging or not tio2 r showed stronger oxidative stress ros and the higher delay or inhibition of regulatory molecules cumulants effective doses than those of tio2 a table 3 these are consistent with end point biomass fig 1a and eps secretion contents in different growth exposure stages table s4 therefore it is necessary to further explore the potential mechanisms for all of above differential outcomes caused by pristine and aged tio2 nps with two crystal structures 3 6 potential toxic mechanisms of tio2 nps to biofilm formation firstly the distribution of esterase active cells and necrotic cells in different depths of a mature biofilm was observed by clsm in situ to explore the differences of the final stress status and metabolic levels of cells in the mature biofilms after continuous exposure of tio2 nps as shown in fig 5 a the left column is the 3d projection and the right side represents the 2 d image of the brightest layer in each sample through the contrast of green active cell and red necrotic cell we intuitively found that the overall green in the control group indicated high microbial activity fig 5aa and 5aa1 however from 0 1 to 10 mg l nps exposure the proportion of red necrotic cells visually increased sharply suggesting that the overall metabolic activities of microorganisms in mature biofilms were seriously degraded regardless of the crystal structures for the 0 1 mg l nps exposures there were an increase in the dead cells in the biofilm bottom layer along with the promoting the development and maturity of biofilms while live bacteria were mainly concentrated in the outermost biofilm layers fig 5aa 5ae which is consistent with a previous report neu and lawrence 1997 by contrast 10 mg l nps showed that the overall activity of biofilms was inhibited with the necrotic cells considerably beginning to proliferate on the surface of microorganisms fig 5aa1 5ae1 as shown in fig 5ba and 5ba1 the numerical value of fig 5a images also confirmed the abovementioned conclusions that in the same depth of the biofilm the ratio values of active necrotic cells in the control were much greater than those of the tio2 nps exposure groups the greater the exposure concentration the lower is the ratio in addition the total ratios of active necrotic cells decreased from 2 61 to 2 64 in the control groups to 1 45 2 12 in the 0 1 mg lnps exposed groups and to 0 64 1 67 in the 10 mg l nps exposed groups fig 5bb and 5bb1 respectively indicating a decline in the whole metabolic activity of exposed biofilm in terms of crystal forms pristine tio2 nps seemed to be more effective in reducing the activity of cells in different depths of the biofilm fig 5ba and 5ba1 mainly because 0 1 mg l pristine nps promoted senescence of the biofilm after preferential maturation fig 2 while for the 10 mg l pristine nps oxidative damage might be predominant reason compared with aging exposure groups table 3 interestingly compared to pristine tio2 a that generated more necrotic cells on the relative surface of the biofilm through direct contact oxidation death figs s4a and s4b pristine tio2 r led to more cell necrosis in the relative interior of the biofilm regardless of the exposure concentrations this might be the comprehensive result of the water environment behaviors of nps and biofilm responses such as eps secretions and compositions table s4 li et al 2019a comparatively speaking pristine tio2 a have the stronger photooxidation activity figs s4a and s4b while pristine tio2 r have the stronger ability to penetrate contact damage because of the greater particle stability in the culture medium fig s4d and a less protective layer of eps table s4 wang et al 2019 however at 0 1 and 10 mg l the atio2 a and atio2 r exposed groups did not show the above mentioned intersection trend of ratio values of active necrotic cells with slightly higher lethality rates in atio2 r exposed samples fig 5ba and 5ba1 this could be attributed to the aging induced passivation effects on both nps and enhanced visible light activity of tio2 r compared to tio2 a figs s3a and s3b moreover further analysis of fig 5ba and 5ba1 showed that after nps exposure the highest point of the ratio of live dead cells moved to the inner part of the biofilm at different degrees which indicated that the four nps had different effects on the distribution of the cell activity level in the biofilm moreover the surface characteristics of freshwater biofilm were observed by sem fig 6 a compared to the smooth and complete biofilm surface dotted with bacteria and algae in the control group a large number of nps dispersed or agglomerated on the surface of the exposed biofilm fig 6bb and 6bd and caused cell damage fragmentation and disorganization especially in the pristine tio2 nps exposed groups fig 6ab and 6ad which corresponds to their biomass and eps secretion fig 2a and table s4 notably fig 6c shows the crystalline and concentration dependent extracellular and intracellular titanium concentration in biofilm at low 0 1 mg l nps compared to pristine tio2 nps the atio2 nps seemed to be more likely to enter the cell especially in the atio2 r exposed sample p 0 05 which might mainly be due to the lower eps blocking table s4 and the retention of smaller particles size in the medium fig s4d at high 10 mg l nps the higher p 0 05 amount of nps entering the cells in pristine tio2 nps exposed samples might be due to the accumulation of nps on the surface of biofilms and the increase in the of plasma membrane permeability caused by high oxidative damage figs s4a and s4b summarily this study investigated the dynamic response process of biofilm development including biomass and atp levels microbial community structure and diversity eps yield and composition and secretion regulation of autoinducers etc and revealed the differential toxicity mechanisms of nps to cells in different depths of mature biofilms indeed above all these toxicity indexes have to be related to the initial characteristics of nps such as crystallinity and surface structure as well as their water environmental behaviors affected by aging transformation such as particle or structure stability and photooxidation activity 4 conclusions we compared the responses of freshwater biofilm formation from colonization to maturity to anatase and rutile tio2 nps and explored the effects of physicochemical transformation after simulated natural aging on exposure processes the main conclusions are as follows simulated natural aging in freshwater environmental did not change the crystal structure of tio2 nps however it could significantly p 0 05 deactivate the photo activities of tio2 a and tio2 r with energy band increase and decrease respectively and increase their water environmental stability these are mainly due to the comprehensive effects of nps surface inclusions such as nom and inorganic salt the low levels of tio2 nps 1 mg l evidently advanced planktonic cell colonization and biofilm formation and maturation while concentrations higher than or equal to 10 mg l inhibited and delayed biofilm development 10 mg l nps seemed to change the pioneers of biofilm colonization replacing algae with bacteria then nps changed the microorganism community structures because clustering of bacterial community was not only based on growth stages of biofilms but also closely related to the crystal forms regardless of the exposure concentrations the responses of the secretions and compositions pro ps of eps were crystal forms and concentration dependent during biofilm formation in the early stage of biofilm formation pro as the conditioning film with low colonies occupied the bottom while ps played glued roles with relatively high density dominating the top of the biofilm the ps rich and pro rich stages of the eps phases in the entire biofilm formation process were shown to occur regardless of the crystal structure and exposure concentration the ros induced by tio2 nps showed typical hormone effects on biofilm formation the changing trend of the autoinducers including c di gmp and qs ahl and ai 2 signaling molecules were highly consistent with the development stages of the biofilms and disturbed by tio2 nps the c di gmp messenger regulated the entire biofilm formation process while ahl and ai 2 molecules mainly regulated the middle late stages of biofilm development by mediating the exchange of information between cells and activating the inherent response mechanism of the eps components the responses of biofilm formation processes are closely related to the crystal structure of tio2 nps and aging significantly affects their toxic ability compared to atio2 nps pristine tio2 nps could further promote or delay biofilm formation as well as inhibit biofilm amount and cell activity more strongly especially for the stronger photoactive tio2 a aging significantly reduced cells necrosis rates at different depths of the biofilm mainly because of the blocking effect on photoactivity especially for the tio2 a with thick inclusions finally this is the first time that the effects of nps entering the water environment using typical tio2 nps after natural aging on the colonization and development process of freshwater biofilm have been fully understood and compared with the toxicity of the pristine nps it was found that aging could reduce the environmental pressure of nps and even reverse the toxicity of different nps such a study will pave the way for a better understanding of the post

17817,the control of dissolved methane ch4 and hydrogen sulfide h2s emissions in anaerobic effluents is essential for minimizing the environmental implications of greenhouse gases odor and carbon footprint as well as for preventing energy loss in the form of unrecovered dissolved methane this study assessed the feasibility of a vacuum degasifier for the removal of ch4 and h2s from staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr effluent the optimization results showed that the efficiency of the nozzle fitted degasifiers were superior to the media packed ones in three stage vacuum degasifiers at a 0 8 bar vacuum pressure h2s removal was mostly ph dependent and 88 removal efficiency was achieved with an initial concentration of 13 6 mg l methane removal was dependent primarily on the number of degasifier units and approximately 94 efficiency was achieved in a three stage degasifier energy balance analysis showed that energy production exceeded the system energy requirements with 0 05 0 07 kwh m3 of surplus energy these results provide deep insights into this new technology for simultaneous removal of dissolved ch4 and h2s which can be referred for potential future applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic effluent dissolved methane dissolved hydrogen sulfide energy recovery vacuum degasifier 1 introduction with the ever increasing population growth 40 and 50 rise in water and energy demand respectively was anticipated by 2030 burrows 2012 energy efficient wastewater treatment systems that facilitate water and energy recovery for subsequent use to meet the escalating demand are attracting attention consequently there has been considerable research interest in anaerobic wastewater treatments for energy recovery in the form of biogas making the process energy positive mccarty et al 2011 these treatments have several advantages such as low energy demand without aeration reduced sludge handling cost and renewable energy recovery from the biogas produced even though the issues with dissolved gases produced in the process are a potential barrier to practical applications that must be addressed methodically during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater a part of the ch4 produced is dissolved in the liquid phase depending on temperature partial pressure of ch4 in the biogas and degree of supersaturation matsuura et al 2015 shin et al 2016 reported that 40 60 of the ch4 produced was discharged with the effluent of the anmbr treating domestic wastewater post discharge the dissolved ch4 can be stripped off easily resulting in the emission of a greenhouse gas to the atmosphere that has 25 34 times more global warming potential than co2 crone et al 2016 in addition dissolved ch4 can result in an explosive atmosphere when discharged to drains or other enclosed conduits because the lower explosion limit lel of ch4 in air is only 5 v v henares et al 2016 therefore the discharge of dissolved ch4 in anaerobic effluent not only represents the loss of energy but also causes environmental hazards therefore the removal recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent is essential before discharging it to the environment another component of environmental concern in anaerobic wastewater treatment is h2s the anaerobic digestion of sulfur containing organic matter produces significant amounts of h2s because sulfate reducing bacteria outcompete methanogens for substrates díaz and fdz polanco 2012 because of its high solubility nature it remains mostly in the liquid phase as bisulfide hs which transforms to gaseous h2s when the ph decreases as shown in equation 1 h2s in the effluent emits to the environment when there is an increase in turbulence in effluent piping glória et al 2016 h2s is corrosive to steel and concrete installations and is responsible for sox and odorous emissions during combustion wei et al 2007 reported that 60 mg l of h2s caused irreversible process failure of both acetate and propionate fed chemostats in anaerobic digesters therefore h2s must be removed both from the liquid and gaseous phases not only to dispose of anaerobic process failures but also to prevent environmental hazards 1 h 2 s g h 2 s aq pk a 1 7 04 h hs pk a 2 12 89 2 h s 2 dissolved gases in anaerobic effluent can be removed using a range of techniques such as aeration gas stripping using packed columns microaeration mediated biological oxidation degassing membranes etc henares et al 2016 krayzelova et al 2014 heile et al 2017 hatamoto et al 2011 bandara et al 2011 in conventional packed columns the structured packing materials in the column provide a large surface area for the contact of liquid and gas phases to facilitate the mass transfer of dissolved gases from liquid to gaseous phases on the other hand these systems encounter problems such as flooding and foaming due to the direct contact of gas and liquid phases in addition significant airflow and sizable process scale are needed to enable sufficient contact time for efficient removal heile et al 2017 the application of a degassing membrane is effective in removing dissolved gases in many processes bandara et al 2011 the hydrophobic degassing membrane mediates contact between the gas and liquid phases and allows the dissolved gas to diffuse through the membrane the degassing membrane can be competitive in term of the gas recovery efficiency but membrane fouling mass transfer resistance from the membrane and the costs associated with the membrane could limit its application evans 2018 henares et al 2016 although several technologies are available studies on the removal of dissolved gases from anaerobic effluents are limited and the existing technologies are facing many challenges therefore further research is needed to improve an existing process or develop new processes owing to the fugitive emission of the dissolved gases that can have environmental and safety implications to address the pertinent issues of dissolved gas removal from anaerobic effluent a vacuum degasifier system with spraying technology has been investigated as a promising alternative vacuum degasification is the mechanism of reducing the gas solubility under vacuum conditions thereby facilitating their removal vacuum degasifiers are essentially the same design as that of air strippers except for the employment of a vacuum to remove the dissolved gases instead of air passage the spraying mode of the influent distribution ensures efficient mass transfer by increasing the liquid droplet surface area and proper surface exposure a vacuum degasifier was used for the first time in the 1930s to remove oxygen from water for corrosion prevention in pipelines they are also engaged in many industrial processes such as power plants to remove dissolved carbon dioxide and oxygen in boiler feed water oil recovery facilities to remove oxygen and hydrogen sulfide for secondary recovery of crude oil hussain 2001 this is one of the few attempts to study the applicability of vacuum degasifiers for dissolved gas removal particularly ch4 and h2s from the anaerobically treated domestic wastewater a bench scale staged vacuum degasifier unit was used to remove dissolved ch4 and h2s from the effluent of pilot scale staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactors saf mbr engaged in domestic wastewater treatment in gas stripping gas liquid mass transfer plays a key role in the removal of dissolved gases and can be expressed as equation 2 2 d c d t k l a c c where dc dt represents the rate of change of dissolved gas concentration kla is the overall mass transfer coefficient 1 s c is the dissolved gas concentration in the liquid phase mg l and c is the dissolved gas concentration in the liquid phase in equilibrium with the gas phase mg l the rate of change in the dissolved gas concentration is dependent on the overall mass transfer coefficient kla and the concentration difference between c and c c c a decrease in the vacuum mediated gas pressure in the chamber of a vacuum degasifier results in a low c value leading to an increased concentration difference between c and c similarly adequate retention time and appropriate contact surface area are crucial for an increased kla value this study examined the dissolved gas removal performance efficiency of a staged vacuum degasifier unit the experiments were planned in different parts first the experimental parameters injection rate packing ratio throughput volume retention time and reactor configuration was attempted to maximize the ch4 removal efficiency second the practical applicability of the obtained experimental parameters was examined and optimized in terms of cost effectiveness and efficiency of dissolved ch4 and h2s removal finally the energy efficiency of the vacuum degasification process was analyzed considering the energy demand and recovery in the form of ch4 for prospective practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 optimization of the experimental factors for vacuum degasifier operation case 1 2 1 1 vacuum degasifier configurations in case 1 two different types of cylindrical vacuum degasifiers were fabricated using an acryl tube i short and wide type vds with a 0 15 m diameter d and 0 175 m height h and ii long and narrow type vdl with dimensions of 0 07 m 0 5 m d x h a vacuum was drawn at the top of the degasifier unit with mechanical vacuum pumps rocker 410 taiwan and a constant vacuum pressure of 0 94 bar was monitored using a digital pressure gauge ashcroft usa the influent was injected into the vacuum degasifiers using plastic tubing unless specified otherwise to improve the gas liquid mass transfer rate a high specific interfacial surface area was ensured by packing media in the degasifier unit and spraying the influent through the nozzles installed at the top of the degasifier units for a uniform distribution structured polypropylene media tripack kumho tech republic of korea with a diameter 2 54 cm and a specific surface area per unit volume of 282 m2 m3 were used 2 1 2 experimental conditions table 1 lists the experimental details of case 1 the vacuum degasifiers were fed with effluents of a pilot scale saf mbr installed at the bucheon domestic wastewater treatment plant 10 m3 d capacity republic of korea and operated between 23 and 28 c the major operating parameters such as the media packing ratio exp 1 throughput volume exp 2 retention time exp 3 injection rate exp 4 and combined effect of the nozzle and media exp 5 were evaluated considering the following combinations of degasifier with the media and nozzle i vdshort with media vdsm ii vdlong with media vdlm iii vdshort with nozzle vdsn iv vdlong with nozzle vdln and v vdshort with nozzle and media vdsnm a single set of experiment was performed for each operational condition with duplicate samples for analysis experiments were conducted by changing a single design or operational parameter in each experimental set up for example in exp 1 similar experiments were conducted five times only by varying the packing ratio from 40 to 90 while keeping the other experimental parameters constant therefore repetitive experiments at the same packing ratio seemed to be not necessary however samples were prepared in duplicates to reduce analytical errors the similar approach was followed for all experiments conducted 2 2 dissolved gas removal in the three stage vacuum degasifier case 2 2 2 1 degasifier configurations for dissolved methane and hydrogen sulfide removal in case 2 three identical vacuum degasifiers were fabricated using stainless steel cylinders with a 10 cm diameter and 30 cm height which are slightly wider than the vdl type intermediate between the dimensions of vdsn and vdln considering the optimization conditions from case 1 media packed degasifiers were avoided and only nozzle fitted ones were used for the case 2 experiments the three vacuum degasifier units with nozzles were connected in series as illustrated in fig 1 vacuum conditions were maintained by the vacuum pump hjd 2120p hanjin air tech co ltd republic of korea connected to the individual degasifiers with plastic tubing and the pressure was monitored using digital pressure gauges the vacuum pressure in the first degasifier unit facilitated the inflow of the saf mbr permeate the second degasifier received the effluent from the first one but the injection rate was quite slow due to the prevailing negative pressure in the first degasifier therefore for the easier transportation of feed from the 1st to 2nd stage the pressure in the 1st stage was normalized to atmospheric conditions while maintaining vacuum condition in the 2nd stage the process was repeated for the 2nd to 3rd stage transfer as well 2 2 2 experimental conditions the three stage vacuum degasifier was fed using a pilot scale saf mbr 1 m3 d capacity permeate installed at the gongchon domestic wastewater treatment plant republic of korea and operated between 12 and 15 c the ph of the anaerobic effluent approximately 7 was adjusted to 5 5 5 and 6 below the pka1 of 7 04 equation 1 using 5 n hcl solutions before injecting into the vacuum degasifier systems to increase the fraction of aqueous phase h2s and thereby facilitating its subsequent emission to the gaseous phase the system was operated under a 0 8 bar vacuum pressure and 15 ml s injection rate corresponding to 450 ml throughput volume in sequential mode the process was controlled automatically by electromechanically operated solenoid valves in a cyclic manner comprising the following steps i vacuum generation ii wastewater inflow and reaction degasification and iii degasified wastewater outflow during the final outflow the pressure of the last degasifier unit was normalized to atmospheric pressure for smoother exit of the effluent the simultaneous occurrence of wastewater inflow and degasification process was observed in the case 1 experiments therefore additional retention time in individual degasifier units was avoided and the influent progressed from one stage to the other in an almost continuous manner after the completion of one cycle as mentioned above 2 3 analytical methods the detailed procedure of dissolved methane measurement and quantification is described elsewhere lee et al 2019 to measure the dissolved methane the wastewater samples were filled in the serum bottles without air contact and sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps subsequently 0 2 ml of 3 n naoh was injected into the serum bottles that increased the ph of the samples to more than 11 for possible inhibition of the biological activities and stimulation of co2 capture a 5 ml sample was drawn from the serum bottle with an equal volume of n2 gas as a replacement subsequently the serum bottles were shaken in an incubator shaker vs 8480 vision scientific co ltd republic of korea at 35 c for approximately 6 h until liquid gas phase equilibrium was reached the headspace gas composition of the serum bottles was measured by gas chromatography gc hewlett packard 6890 series equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a hayesep d packed column 80 100 agilent technology usa the dissolved hydrogen sulfide concentration was measured using ion selective electrode ise method according to the manufacturer s guideline a 20 ml wastewater sample was taken in a 100 ml bottle and 20 ml of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob solution was added to the bottle to minimize air contact the samples were then measured using a silver sulfide ion selective electrode 9616 bnwp silver sulfide combination electrode thermo scientific with orion 4 star ph ise benchtop meter thermo scientific 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the vacuum degasifier operation case 1 3 1 1 effect of media packing ratio exp 1 the influence of the media packing ratio on the dissolved methane removal efficiency was studied primarily using vdlm as summarized in table 2 the dissolved methane removal efficiency increased with increasing media packing ratio the dissolved methane removal efficiency was 74 9 at the lowest media packing ratio of 40 and the efficiency increased almost linearly to 82 3 at a maximum media packing ratio of 90 these observations were evident as a higher packing ratio helped maximize the surface area for mass transfer the structured tripack packing aided the high specific surface areas of approximately 282 m2 m3 promoted the development of thin water films moreover the media enabled interstitial mixing which boosted gas liquid contact the synergistic effects of the thin liquid boundary layer and interstitial mixing resulted in reduced mass transfer resistance thereby facilitating the evolution of dissolved methane to the gas phase based on the dissolved methane removal efficiency a 90 packing ratio was selected for subsequent experiments on the other hand for vdsm a low dissolved methane removal efficiency of 68 3 was observed at a packing ratio of 85 15 cm packed height of a 17 5 cm column the low vdsm efficiency might be due to a decrease in the effective interfacial area where mass transfer actually takes place owing to the short column height the major ratio of the packed media remained filled with the incoming wastewater the submerged media in the liquid phase behave as a static interfacial area which no longer participate in the mass transfer operation affecting the overall elimination of dissolved methane therefore the effects of the media packing height on dissolved methane removal were more pronounced than the effects of the media packing diameter this is in agreement with the earlier reports by scherer and wichmann 2000 on methane desorption from ground water in different column configurations the authors recommended the achievement of more than 90 methane desorption efficiency in packed columns by increasing the column heights the use of vdsm for dissolved methane removal is discouraged except in exp 5 for comparison for further experiments because of the inferior performance efficiency 3 1 2 effect of throughput volume exp 2 the experiments were conducted by considering the various throughput volumes of 100 800 ml per batch treatment with vdsn vdln and vdlm the influent dissolved methane concentration was 17 04 and 16 62 mg l for the degasifiers with a nozzle and media respectively as shown in fig 2 the efficiencies of the vdsn and vdln were in the range of 84 5 86 1 and 82 8 84 6 respectively therefore the dissolved methane removal efficiency was not affected significantly by the throughput volume the marginally better performance of the vdsn might be due to the higher gas liquid interfacial area in both degasifiers the influent was sprayed through nozzles that induced droplet formation with a considerable specific surface area for efficient mass transfer but mass transfer is dependent on several factors such as the spray angle droplet size degasifier diameter and degasifier length after spraying from the nozzle the droplets come in contact with the surroundings atomize further under the influence of a vacuum and follow definitive trajectories to cover the stopping distance sd before moving vertically downward as shown in fig 3 in vdsn the larger the diameter the broader the spray angle and the smaller the drop size accelerating the mass transfer rate around the drops moreover in vdln for a given spray angle the droplets strike the wall as the sd is higher than the impact distance id the surface area decreases due to the coalescence of the droplets formed and harms the mass transfer operation despite these differences the marginal efficiency variation between the two degasifiers can be explained based on the applied vacuum pressure the dominating factor of mass transfer with the application of similar vacuum pressure 0 94 bar the concentration gradient of dissolved methane increased correspondingly and a comparable degassing efficiency of dissolved methane from the liquid phase was achieved henares et al 2016 reported an increase in the efficiency with increasing vacuum pressure while attempting methane removal from anaerobic effluents by degassing membranes theoretically an increase in throughput volume is expected to promote higher mass transfer because an elevated concentration gradient is established due to the increased inlet methane load with the increasing influent flow a similar observation has been reported in recovering methane from anaerobic process effluent by membrane contactors cookney et al 2016 in this case however the injected liquid was collected at the bottom of both reactors under the same vacuum pressure the stagnant pool of liquid without turbulence or other means of driving force limits the scope of liquid side mass transfer furthermore the decrease in bulk liquid mass transfer due to the increased influent load can be attributed to the observed marginal fall in the degasifying efficiency with increasing throughput volume nevertheless the dissolved methane removal efficiency of the vdlm was affected by the changes in throughput volume per batch treatment as shown in fig 2 when the throughput volume was increased from 100 to 800 ml the dissolved methane removal efficiency decreased from 88 4 to 76 1 respectively progressive submersion of packed media ratio with increased throughput leaving limited exposed surfaces for gas liquid mass transfer may be the reason for this observed trend as already discussed in section 3 1 1 a similar trend of decreased dissolved methane removal efficiency with increasing influent load was observed in degassing membranes due to wetting of the hydrophobic membranes or fiber compression leading to reduced permeability and increased mass transfer resistance henares et al 2016 2017 therefore the throughput volume as a critical factor affected the performance efficiency of media packed degasifiers more prominently than that of the nozzle fitted ones and larger cross sectional areas would have added advantages for enhanced efficiency in the case of nozzle fitted degasifiers 3 1 3 effect of retention time and injection rate exp 3 and exp 4 based on the evidence from exp 1 and exp 2 vdsn and vdlm were chosen for exp 3 to evaluate the effects of the retention time on dissolved methane removal the retention time signifies the time after the completion of the injection phase and before the commencement of the outflow phase i e the time of residence of the influent liquid under the applied vacuum conditions as shown in fig 4 the dissolved methane removal efficiency of both reactors was improved marginally amounting to differences of approximately 3 when the retention time was increased from 0 to 18 min these findings indicate the non significant influence of the retention time as an experimental parameter on dissolved methane removal the observed trend was quite predictable in the case of vdsn as discussed earlier the stagnant liquid pool without any dominant mass transfer driving force allows limited mass transfer only through the available relatively small gas liquid interfacial area therefore provided the concentration gradient is maintained by decreasing c with increased vacuum pressure the dissolved methane transfer continued across the boundary on the other hand with constant vacuum pressure the thin layer of gas in contact with liquid gradually becomes stagnant sinha and de 2012 therefore even with a long retention time the overall dissolved methane removal efficiency did not increase significantly similarly in the case of vdlm percolation of the influent liquid through the packing layers not only assisted in interstitial mixing but also facilitated the rate of surface renewal thereby increasing mass transfer sinha and de 2012 with the liquid holdup the volume of liquid held per volume of the packed bed under operation conditions restricted the mass transfer operation only to the limited media liquid interfacial area on the upper part of the degasifier while saturating the media at the bottom consequently the retention time was ineffective in improving the methane removal efficiency due to the inadequate scope of surface renewal of the saturated media the effect of the injection rate on the efficiency of dissolved methane removal was investigated in vdsn and vdlm by varying the injection rate exp 4 the corresponding injection times of 36 81 s and 10 100 s were varied in vdsn and vdlm respectively for a similar treatment volume of approximately 800 ml while keeping the other parameters fixed to those of earlier experiments as shown in fig 5 unlike factors such as the throughput per batch treatment and retention time the dissolved methane removal efficiency was affected considerably when the injection rate was changed in vdsn the removal efficiency increased with increasing injection rate the removal efficiency was 84 3 at an injection rate of 22 2 ml s but decreased to 59 6 when the injection rate was reduced to 9 9 ml s the reason for the observed trend was that the higher injection rate induced shear stress which caused the breakage of liquid drops into smaller droplets ultimately reducing the gas liquid mass transfer resistance in addition a high injection rate increased the collision force among the liquid droplets that destabilized the methane equilibrium in the liquid phase and accelerated methane release with a complementary effect from the negative pressure caused by vacuum pressure cao et al 2019 reported a similar experimental outcome in achieving enhanced ammonia recovery from swine wastewater using innovative spraying technology in contrast to vdsn the dissolved methane removal efficiency increased in vdlm with a slower injection rate and the removal efficiencies were 70 5 and 84 4 at injection rates of 80 and 8 ml s respectively this might be because unlike vdsn liquid gas mass transfer in vdlm was mediated predominantly by the thin liquid boundary layers formed around the media that ensured a decrease in the mass transfer resistance through the increased interfacial area mass transfer being a time dependent process necessitates adequate contact time therefore a slower injection rate resulted in prolonged contact time between the media and the influent liquid phase improved liquid film formation with a higher contact time guaranteed the exposure of more liquid surface area to the gas phase per unit volume of influent thereby benefitting the increase in liquid side mass transfer both vdsn and vdlm exhibited similar maximum dissolved methane removal efficiencies of approximately 84 but with different optimal injection rates the optimal injection rates for vdsn and vdlm were 22 2 and 8 ml s respectively the corresponding injection times for vdsn and vdlm were 36 and 100 s respectively therefore vdsn can be used for the faster degassing of dissolved methane from a large volume of anaerobic effluent whereas vdlm can be better suited for a small volume of wastewater where slower degassing of dissolved methane is desirable 3 1 4 combined effect of nozzle and media exp 5 in exp 5 the individual and combined effects of the media and nozzle on the dissolved methane removal efficiency were examined in short type vacuum degasifiers vds and the results are plotted in fig 6 the reported dissolved methane removal efficiencies were in the order of vdsn vdsnm vdsm control this indicates that the nozzle mediated spraying of influent was a more effective way of enhancing the mass transfer operation than that of the packed media mode in vdsn concentration gradient driven molecular diffusion accelerated the mass transfer rates in the continuous gaseous phase around the liquid drops and inside the droplets resulting in higher removal efficiency on the other hand in vdsm although the media served as an interfacial surface area for gas and liquid phase interaction for effective mass transfer it was comparatively less effective than that of the direct gas liquid exchange mode as in the case of vdsn indeed the combined effects of the nozzle and media were intermediate between the individual effects the dissolved methane removal efficiency of vdsnm was 79 1 which was lower than that of the vdsn but higher than the removal efficiency exhibited by vdsm during the spray distribution of influent as in case of vdsnm the gas liquid contact time increased with increasing drop height thereby enhancing mass transfer on the other hand the packed media in vdsnm interfered with the aerial spreading of the influent as the droplets collided on the media surface before covering the adequate drop height thereby hindering the mass transfer process although the collision of droplets with a medium could promote mass transfer it is less effective than droplet collision among themselves resulting in an overall lower mass transfer rate than that of the vdsn in addition the optimal injection rate and injection time is different for nozzle and media type degasifiers as discussed in previous section therefore the difference in optimal operating parameters might explain the lack of a synergistic effect of combining both the nozzle and media in a single degasifier the negative pressure generated by a vacuum pump being the sole mass transfer driving force in the control degasifier registered the lowest dissolved methane removal efficiency from the experimental evidences from case 1 it was observed that nozzle fitted degasifiers were more effective than the media packed ones injection rate as an experimental parameters significantly governed the dissolved methane removal and larger cross sectional area of the degasifiers was an added advantage for higher removal efficiency trial experiments with two stage degasifiers results not shown at an injection rate of 20 ml min and 0 94 bar vacuum pressure in continuous mode overcome the issues pertaining to the efficiency of single degasifier units 90 role of spray angle sd and id in the nozzle fitted degasifiers as explained in fig 3 implied that a degasifier with an intermediate configuration to vdsn and vdln could be a better option for effective mass transfer application of reduced vacuum pressure 0 8 bar was planned for enhanced energy efficiency of the degasifiers three stage mode of operation was intended to ensure high performance efficiency under reduced vacuum pressure while dealing with the inherent variability of real wastewater characteristics and environmental conditions in field scale applications therefore the optimum experimental conditions for case 2 as mentioned in section 2 2 were fixed based on these preliminary observations and assumptions for simultaneous removal of dissolved ch4 and h2s in a more efficient and economical manner 3 2 dissolved gas removal in the three stage vacuum degasifier case 2 followed by the optimization process the simultaneous removal of dissolved ch4 and h2s from anaerobic effluents of saf mbr was attempted some minor adjustments in the optimized experimental parameters and configurations based on previous experiments were adopted to maintain a striking balance between the removal efficiency and economical aspect 3 2 1 removal of dissolved methane fig 7 presents the dissolved methane removal in the three stage vacuum degasifier the results suggest that ph had no significant effect on dissolved methane removal while the removal efficiencies increased with increasing number of degasifier units after receiving saf mbr effluent from the gongchon pilot plant with a dissolved methane concentration of approximately 12 15 mg l equivalent to 48 60 mg l cod the first degasifier unit exhibited a removal efficiency of 53 63 the removal efficiency was improved further to 80 84 in the second degasifier that received effluent from the first degasifier the dissolved methane concentration of the effluent from the third degasifier was below the detection limit 1 mg l ch4 the measured cod equivalent was 3 4 mg l approximately 1 mg l of ch4 amounting to a removal efficiency more than 92 94 as discussed earlier the formation of influent droplets with a large specific surface area caused by the nozzle spraying together with a negative pressure induced by a vacuum pump helped destabilize the liquid phase equilibrium of methane and the subsequent emission of the same to the gas phase the dissolved methane removal efficiency of the 1st degasifier was complemented by the second and the second by the third therefore an increase in the removal efficiency was observed with each integration of degasifier units the lower removal efficiency of the 1st degasifier unit might be due to the application of lower vacuum pressure 0 8 bar in this case against 0 94 bar in case 1 though the exact reason is unknown few approaches for the removal and or recovery of dissolved methane other than the methodology described above have been reported a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor reported by hatamoto et al 2010 achieved 95 dissolved methane removal but no methane was recovered as the dhs stimulated biological oxidation of the dissolved methane employing a two stage dhs reactor matsuura et al 2010 recovered 77 of dissolved methane in the first stage nevertheless the methane composition in the recovered biogas was quite low as the dissolved methane was released from the dhs liquid phase by gasification based on the gas liquid equilibrium a high efficiency of 78 was accomplished using a membrane contactor for removing dissolved methane from synthetic anaerobic effluent cookney et al 2012 but the methane concentration in the recovered gas was less than 30 which was either not burnable or sustained difficulties in burning browell et al 2009 bandara et al 2011 recovered 60 80 of the dissolved methane with methane concentrations of approximately 50 from uasb effluent using a degassing membrane on the other hand the process required high levels of energy to achieve gasification through a vacuum pump either a vacuum or sweep gas mode can be applied to provide the necessary mass transfer driving force for dissolved methane desorption the operating modes were chosen based on the desired removal efficiency reuse of recovered methane and energy consumption of the process although sweep gas mode consumes less energy than vacuum mode a high gas flow dilutes the recovered gas concentration as low concentration methane recovery is not beneficial for subsequent energy generation the process necessitates a further purification step thereby increasing the overall energy consumption moreover in sweep gas mode the pressure loss through the membrane contactors results in high energy consumption evans 2018 therefore vacuum mode is preferred when it is desired to recover high concentrations of methane for reuse as a source of energy henares et al 2016 more than 90 of the dissolved methane removal efficiency attained using vacuum a degasifier in the study was similar to the reported results in addition with the possibilities of reusing the recovered methane as an energy source this approach was energy positive which is discussed in the following section 3 2 2 removal of dissolved sulfide the removal efficiency of dissolved sulfide varied more prominently with decreasing ph than that of the series integration of a larger number of degasifiers fig 7b stable sulfide removal efficiency of 87 88 was achieved with ph adjusted samples the final concentration in the treated effluent was in the range of 1 5 1 7 mg l except for the sample without ph adjustment 4 mg l the removal efficiency of the ph adjusted samples was approximately 17 higher than the raw sample after the three stage treatment as far h2s removal is concerned only the non ionized form can be transferred across the air water interface in other words h2s is the only sulfide species that can be transformed from h2s aq to h2s g and leaves the aqueous phase as a free gas the transformation depends on the gas liquid equilibrium and h2s dissociation in water hence it is governed by factors such as ph contact time temperature and turbulence of the liquid phase and equilibrium constant ka silva et al 2020 approximately 50 of the total sulfide remains as h2s aq when the ph is maintained at pka1 7 04 further acidic conditions favor a higher h2s aq fraction which contribute to the enhanced emission of h2s to the gas phase after influent spraying the water droplets brought the sulfide compounds in contact with the gaseous phase subsequently the removal of dissolved h2s was realized through the process of h2s concentration equalization between the liquid and gas phases the process was prominent in the 1st degasifier as shown in fig 7b in the subsequent degasifier units however the partial effectiveness of the process mainly noticeable from raw samples without ph adjustment might be due to the unavailability of h2s aq which often requires a downward adjustment of the ph therefore with decreasing ph a high removal efficiency of dissolved hydrogen sulfide was observed in individual degasifiers and along the series integration the maximum removal efficiency of approximately 88 achieved at ph 5 might be based on the available non dissociated h2s aq at that ph after the three stages the final effluent ph of 6 5 7 5 was recorded for all the ph adjusted samples the observed increase in ph might be due to the consumption of h ions in the process of h2s elimination silva et al 2020 reported more than 50 higher dissolved sulfide removal efficiency at ph 4 than at ph 6 and justified their results based on the available h2s aq fraction of 100 and 66 6 at ph 4 and 6 respectively similarly agrahari et al 2013 reported 100 dissolved h2s removal efficiency from synthetic wastewater using hollow fiber membrane contactors such high removal efficiency was attributed to the conditions at ph 4 contact time of 60 min and maintenance of a temperature gradient between the feed and permeate side through a direct contact membrane distillation approach these results suggest that the staged vacuum degasifiers can be a promising technology for the effective removal of dissolved sulfide from low strength anaerobic effluent with the most straightforward approach of ph management although dissolved sulfide was reduced from 13 5 0 25 to 1 5 0 25 mg l the final effluent concentrations might not meet the desired performance objective of most of the anaerobic effluent treatments aiming at dissolved gas removal in the present study further enhanced efficiency could have been achieved by reducing the ph beyond 5 in this case however the finished water will then require additional neutralization treatment steps additional experimental investigations will be needed in this aspect and future studies should aim to improve the removal of residual hydrogen sulfide for example by conjugating a catalytic carbon filter to polish the treated effluent or by an inexpensive biological sulfide oxidation method therefore further research into cost effective and sustainable technologies for sulfide removal is highly desirable h2s in the recovered gas should be removed both from the prospective of reusability and to get rid of the environmental hazards as discussed earlier when the intended end use of biogas is in internal combustion engines the h2s concentration should be below 100 ppm whereas for boilers even up to 1000 ppm concentration might not be problematic therefore h2s removal approaches from the biogas are mainly dependent on the reuse aspect the methods commonly used in the field are activated carbon based adsorption chemical precipitation through iron chloride dosing and biological desulphurization using microorganisms ciahotny and kyselova 2019 díaz and fdz polanco 2012 microaeration is another emerging technology where h2s is oxidized to elemental sulfur by sulfur sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob krayzelova et al 2014 in gist there are established technologies for h2s removal from biogas and those are commonly practiced in biogas treatment plants so the focus of this study is not the h2s removal from biogas but from the anaerobic effluent which is important both from environmental impact and process sustainability aspects for example practicing chemical method of sulfide removal from anaerobic effluent alone contributes around 70 of overall environmental impacts thereby impacting the life cycle assessment of the adopted anaerobic membrane processes evans 2018 therefore the simultaneous removal approach of dissolved ch4 and h2s from anaerobic effluents in gaseous form as adopted in this study followed by an inexpensive treatment method like biological desulphurization could be an effective alternative for improved sustainability of treatment processes 3 3 energy and carbon balance of the vacuum degasifier the energy analysis of vacuum degasifiers for the recovery of dissolved methane from the saf mbr effluent was performed the net energy recovered from dissolved methane was determined after comparing the energy recovered as methane and the energy consumption in the vacuum degasifier operation the energy required to operate the vacuum degasifier can be estimated using the following equation crone et al 2016 3 w v d k w r t k 1 p o u t p i n k 1 k 1 1 1000 where wvd k w r t and pout pin are the power requirement of vacuum degasifier kw heat capacity ratio molar flow rate through the vacuum pump mol s universal gas constant in j mol k 8 314 inlet gas absolute temperature k and ratio between outlet and inlet of vacuum pressure kpa respectively the vacuum degasifier energy consumption was calculated based on the following assumptions heat capacity ratio of 1 3 as suggested by martin et al 2011 gas temperature of 25 c typical dissolved methane concentration of 17 mg l vacuum pressure of 730 mm hg and 75 gas phase methane composition the conversion of influent to water vapor due to the low pressure was estimated to be 10 considering a 60 vacuum pump energy efficiency the estimated corresponding energy requirement was 0 0132 kwh m3 in case 1 experiments in case 2 experiments however the vacuum pump energy requirement was still lower 0 0069 kwh m3 as 0 8 bar pressure was maintained instead of 0 95 bar in case 1 to evaluate the energy content of the dissolved methane recovered through the vacuum degasifier it was assumed that the dissolved methane could be used entirely without any losses methane has an energy content of approximately 47 mj kg based on the lower heating value crone et al 2016 which can be expressed further as 13 06 kwh kg choosing the specific optimized conditions of 20 ml s injection rate 40 s injection time and 17 mg l of influent dissolved methane concentration the energy equivalent of the influent dissolved methane was 0 22 kwh m3 therefore based on the removal efficiencies as exhibited in table 3 the energy equivalences of 0 169 0 1874 and 0 2068 kwh m3 were calculated from the recovered dissolved methane in vdlm vdsn and three stage degasifiers respectively the energy recovered from the dissolved methane can be converted to electricity using microturbines according to the following equation rongwong et al 2018 4 e n x c h 4 f ε c h 4 l where ɳ is the microturbine efficiency xch4 is the fraction of methane in the biogas f is biogas flow rate m3 day ϵch4 is the energy content of methane and l is the liquid flow rate m3 day in this study however considering the recommended conversion efficiency of 37 crone et al 2016 because most of the energy is wasted in the form of heat due to inefficiencies in the unit operations 0 0625 0 0773 kwh m3 electricity generation can be expected through vacuum degasifier applications the net energy or electricity obtained through the vacuum degasifier application can be calculated from the difference in electricity obtained and consumed in the process 5 n e t e e w v d accordingly the net energy of 0 0493 0 0696 kwh m3 can be obtained through the application of a vacuum degasifier in treating the saf mbr effluent indicating the overall energy positive approach in all the cases considered as listed in table 3 the maximum energy saving of 0 0696 was observed in three stage degasifiers as a high removal efficiency was achieved 94 under a low vacuum pressure 0 8 bar in continuous mode of operation this finding is in line with an earlier study by the same research group in which it was suggested that if dissolved methane could be recovered proficiently saf mbr could function without any supplementary energy input beyond what is generated by the system shin et al 2014 similar to the energy balance a carbon balance was undertaken to determine the resulting carbon footprint from the vacuum degasifier operation because the unproductive recovery of dissolved methane also ultimately results in an increased carbon footprint the recovery of sufficient amounts of dissolved methane and subsequent harnessing of renewable energy from dissolved methane can offset the global warming potential as well as the carbon footprint of dissolved methane the resulting carbon footprint can be obtained from the difference in the amount of electrical energy recovered and the amount of renewable electrical energy required to offset the fugitive methane emission the recovered electrical energy table 3 is applicable for carbon balance analysis in addition based on the reports by mcleod et al 2016 the grid electricity co2 footprint is 543 g kwh and the global warming potential of ch4 is 23 g co2 g ch4 therefore the renewable electrical energy required to offset 1 g of fugitive methane emission is 0 042 kwh g applying the mass balance to all the cases considered the net difference was found to be negative for vdlm and vdsn whereas it was positive in the case of the three stage degasifiers table 4 overall to achieve carbon neutrality more than 90 of dissolved methane recovery is a desirable criterion in the application of vacuum degasifiers for dissolved methane removal from anaerobic effluents cookney et al 2016 came to similar conclusions by recommending more than 90 recovery from anaerobic effluent with 14 mg l of dissolved methane to offset the carbon footprint of the residual left in the effluent after treatment similarly starting with an effluent concentration of 25 mg l mcleod et al 2016 suggested 88 dissolved methane recovery for the realization of carbon neutrality therefore the integration of vacuum degasifiers to saf mbr systems to recover the dissolved methane from the anaerobic effluent can be a promising alternative from an energy positive and carbon neutral prospective the recovery efficiency and knowledge of methane concentration in the recovered gas are vital components to estimate carbon footprint global warming and renewable energy potential of the recovered methane gas as this study is an indicative examination of the feasibility further experimental investigations are highly recommended for validation with an optimized methane recovery methodology 4 conclusions this paper reported the successful application of a three stage vacuum degasifier for the simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and hydrogen sulfide from the saf mbr effluent the results showed that the nozzle mediated spraying of influent was a more effective way of enhancing the mass transfer of dissolved gases from the liquid to the gas phase than that of the packed media mode the negative vacuum pressure as the mass transfer driving force mainly controlled the dissolved methane removal whereas the ph played a vital role in dissolved hydrogen sulfide removal the maximum degassing efficiency with respect to methane was 94 while that of hydrogen sulfide was 88 with the respective final concentrations of 4 mg l as a cod equivalent and 1 5 mg l respectively the vacuum degasification method was found to be energy positive with a net energy gain of 0 05 0 07 kwh m3 although a wide range of methane removal efficiencies of 54 94 under different experimental conditions attested to the viability of this technology the carbon neutrality of the process was realized only in more than 90 of methane recovery cases therefore owing to the efficiency energy positivity and carbon neutrality vacuum degasifiers can be explored as a sustainable and promising alternative for the removal of dissolved gas from anaerobic effluents declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this

17817,the control of dissolved methane ch4 and hydrogen sulfide h2s emissions in anaerobic effluents is essential for minimizing the environmental implications of greenhouse gases odor and carbon footprint as well as for preventing energy loss in the form of unrecovered dissolved methane this study assessed the feasibility of a vacuum degasifier for the removal of ch4 and h2s from staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor saf mbr effluent the optimization results showed that the efficiency of the nozzle fitted degasifiers were superior to the media packed ones in three stage vacuum degasifiers at a 0 8 bar vacuum pressure h2s removal was mostly ph dependent and 88 removal efficiency was achieved with an initial concentration of 13 6 mg l methane removal was dependent primarily on the number of degasifier units and approximately 94 efficiency was achieved in a three stage degasifier energy balance analysis showed that energy production exceeded the system energy requirements with 0 05 0 07 kwh m3 of surplus energy these results provide deep insights into this new technology for simultaneous removal of dissolved ch4 and h2s which can be referred for potential future applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic effluent dissolved methane dissolved hydrogen sulfide energy recovery vacuum degasifier 1 introduction with the ever increasing population growth 40 and 50 rise in water and energy demand respectively was anticipated by 2030 burrows 2012 energy efficient wastewater treatment systems that facilitate water and energy recovery for subsequent use to meet the escalating demand are attracting attention consequently there has been considerable research interest in anaerobic wastewater treatments for energy recovery in the form of biogas making the process energy positive mccarty et al 2011 these treatments have several advantages such as low energy demand without aeration reduced sludge handling cost and renewable energy recovery from the biogas produced even though the issues with dissolved gases produced in the process are a potential barrier to practical applications that must be addressed methodically during the anaerobic treatment of wastewater a part of the ch4 produced is dissolved in the liquid phase depending on temperature partial pressure of ch4 in the biogas and degree of supersaturation matsuura et al 2015 shin et al 2016 reported that 40 60 of the ch4 produced was discharged with the effluent of the anmbr treating domestic wastewater post discharge the dissolved ch4 can be stripped off easily resulting in the emission of a greenhouse gas to the atmosphere that has 25 34 times more global warming potential than co2 crone et al 2016 in addition dissolved ch4 can result in an explosive atmosphere when discharged to drains or other enclosed conduits because the lower explosion limit lel of ch4 in air is only 5 v v henares et al 2016 therefore the discharge of dissolved ch4 in anaerobic effluent not only represents the loss of energy but also causes environmental hazards therefore the removal recovery of dissolved methane from anaerobic effluent is essential before discharging it to the environment another component of environmental concern in anaerobic wastewater treatment is h2s the anaerobic digestion of sulfur containing organic matter produces significant amounts of h2s because sulfate reducing bacteria outcompete methanogens for substrates díaz and fdz polanco 2012 because of its high solubility nature it remains mostly in the liquid phase as bisulfide hs which transforms to gaseous h2s when the ph decreases as shown in equation 1 h2s in the effluent emits to the environment when there is an increase in turbulence in effluent piping glória et al 2016 h2s is corrosive to steel and concrete installations and is responsible for sox and odorous emissions during combustion wei et al 2007 reported that 60 mg l of h2s caused irreversible process failure of both acetate and propionate fed chemostats in anaerobic digesters therefore h2s must be removed both from the liquid and gaseous phases not only to dispose of anaerobic process failures but also to prevent environmental hazards 1 h 2 s g h 2 s aq pk a 1 7 04 h hs pk a 2 12 89 2 h s 2 dissolved gases in anaerobic effluent can be removed using a range of techniques such as aeration gas stripping using packed columns microaeration mediated biological oxidation degassing membranes etc henares et al 2016 krayzelova et al 2014 heile et al 2017 hatamoto et al 2011 bandara et al 2011 in conventional packed columns the structured packing materials in the column provide a large surface area for the contact of liquid and gas phases to facilitate the mass transfer of dissolved gases from liquid to gaseous phases on the other hand these systems encounter problems such as flooding and foaming due to the direct contact of gas and liquid phases in addition significant airflow and sizable process scale are needed to enable sufficient contact time for efficient removal heile et al 2017 the application of a degassing membrane is effective in removing dissolved gases in many processes bandara et al 2011 the hydrophobic degassing membrane mediates contact between the gas and liquid phases and allows the dissolved gas to diffuse through the membrane the degassing membrane can be competitive in term of the gas recovery efficiency but membrane fouling mass transfer resistance from the membrane and the costs associated with the membrane could limit its application evans 2018 henares et al 2016 although several technologies are available studies on the removal of dissolved gases from anaerobic effluents are limited and the existing technologies are facing many challenges therefore further research is needed to improve an existing process or develop new processes owing to the fugitive emission of the dissolved gases that can have environmental and safety implications to address the pertinent issues of dissolved gas removal from anaerobic effluent a vacuum degasifier system with spraying technology has been investigated as a promising alternative vacuum degasification is the mechanism of reducing the gas solubility under vacuum conditions thereby facilitating their removal vacuum degasifiers are essentially the same design as that of air strippers except for the employment of a vacuum to remove the dissolved gases instead of air passage the spraying mode of the influent distribution ensures efficient mass transfer by increasing the liquid droplet surface area and proper surface exposure a vacuum degasifier was used for the first time in the 1930s to remove oxygen from water for corrosion prevention in pipelines they are also engaged in many industrial processes such as power plants to remove dissolved carbon dioxide and oxygen in boiler feed water oil recovery facilities to remove oxygen and hydrogen sulfide for secondary recovery of crude oil hussain 2001 this is one of the few attempts to study the applicability of vacuum degasifiers for dissolved gas removal particularly ch4 and h2s from the anaerobically treated domestic wastewater a bench scale staged vacuum degasifier unit was used to remove dissolved ch4 and h2s from the effluent of pilot scale staged anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactors saf mbr engaged in domestic wastewater treatment in gas stripping gas liquid mass transfer plays a key role in the removal of dissolved gases and can be expressed as equation 2 2 d c d t k l a c c where dc dt represents the rate of change of dissolved gas concentration kla is the overall mass transfer coefficient 1 s c is the dissolved gas concentration in the liquid phase mg l and c is the dissolved gas concentration in the liquid phase in equilibrium with the gas phase mg l the rate of change in the dissolved gas concentration is dependent on the overall mass transfer coefficient kla and the concentration difference between c and c c c a decrease in the vacuum mediated gas pressure in the chamber of a vacuum degasifier results in a low c value leading to an increased concentration difference between c and c similarly adequate retention time and appropriate contact surface area are crucial for an increased kla value this study examined the dissolved gas removal performance efficiency of a staged vacuum degasifier unit the experiments were planned in different parts first the experimental parameters injection rate packing ratio throughput volume retention time and reactor configuration was attempted to maximize the ch4 removal efficiency second the practical applicability of the obtained experimental parameters was examined and optimized in terms of cost effectiveness and efficiency of dissolved ch4 and h2s removal finally the energy efficiency of the vacuum degasification process was analyzed considering the energy demand and recovery in the form of ch4 for prospective practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 optimization of the experimental factors for vacuum degasifier operation case 1 2 1 1 vacuum degasifier configurations in case 1 two different types of cylindrical vacuum degasifiers were fabricated using an acryl tube i short and wide type vds with a 0 15 m diameter d and 0 175 m height h and ii long and narrow type vdl with dimensions of 0 07 m 0 5 m d x h a vacuum was drawn at the top of the degasifier unit with mechanical vacuum pumps rocker 410 taiwan and a constant vacuum pressure of 0 94 bar was monitored using a digital pressure gauge ashcroft usa the influent was injected into the vacuum degasifiers using plastic tubing unless specified otherwise to improve the gas liquid mass transfer rate a high specific interfacial surface area was ensured by packing media in the degasifier unit and spraying the influent through the nozzles installed at the top of the degasifier units for a uniform distribution structured polypropylene media tripack kumho tech republic of korea with a diameter 2 54 cm and a specific surface area per unit volume of 282 m2 m3 were used 2 1 2 experimental conditions table 1 lists the experimental details of case 1 the vacuum degasifiers were fed with effluents of a pilot scale saf mbr installed at the bucheon domestic wastewater treatment plant 10 m3 d capacity republic of korea and operated between 23 and 28 c the major operating parameters such as the media packing ratio exp 1 throughput volume exp 2 retention time exp 3 injection rate exp 4 and combined effect of the nozzle and media exp 5 were evaluated considering the following combinations of degasifier with the media and nozzle i vdshort with media vdsm ii vdlong with media vdlm iii vdshort with nozzle vdsn iv vdlong with nozzle vdln and v vdshort with nozzle and media vdsnm a single set of experiment was performed for each operational condition with duplicate samples for analysis experiments were conducted by changing a single design or operational parameter in each experimental set up for example in exp 1 similar experiments were conducted five times only by varying the packing ratio from 40 to 90 while keeping the other experimental parameters constant therefore repetitive experiments at the same packing ratio seemed to be not necessary however samples were prepared in duplicates to reduce analytical errors the similar approach was followed for all experiments conducted 2 2 dissolved gas removal in the three stage vacuum degasifier case 2 2 2 1 degasifier configurations for dissolved methane and hydrogen sulfide removal in case 2 three identical vacuum degasifiers were fabricated using stainless steel cylinders with a 10 cm diameter and 30 cm height which are slightly wider than the vdl type intermediate between the dimensions of vdsn and vdln considering the optimization conditions from case 1 media packed degasifiers were avoided and only nozzle fitted ones were used for the case 2 experiments the three vacuum degasifier units with nozzles were connected in series as illustrated in fig 1 vacuum conditions were maintained by the vacuum pump hjd 2120p hanjin air tech co ltd republic of korea connected to the individual degasifiers with plastic tubing and the pressure was monitored using digital pressure gauges the vacuum pressure in the first degasifier unit facilitated the inflow of the saf mbr permeate the second degasifier received the effluent from the first one but the injection rate was quite slow due to the prevailing negative pressure in the first degasifier therefore for the easier transportation of feed from the 1st to 2nd stage the pressure in the 1st stage was normalized to atmospheric conditions while maintaining vacuum condition in the 2nd stage the process was repeated for the 2nd to 3rd stage transfer as well 2 2 2 experimental conditions the three stage vacuum degasifier was fed using a pilot scale saf mbr 1 m3 d capacity permeate installed at the gongchon domestic wastewater treatment plant republic of korea and operated between 12 and 15 c the ph of the anaerobic effluent approximately 7 was adjusted to 5 5 5 and 6 below the pka1 of 7 04 equation 1 using 5 n hcl solutions before injecting into the vacuum degasifier systems to increase the fraction of aqueous phase h2s and thereby facilitating its subsequent emission to the gaseous phase the system was operated under a 0 8 bar vacuum pressure and 15 ml s injection rate corresponding to 450 ml throughput volume in sequential mode the process was controlled automatically by electromechanically operated solenoid valves in a cyclic manner comprising the following steps i vacuum generation ii wastewater inflow and reaction degasification and iii degasified wastewater outflow during the final outflow the pressure of the last degasifier unit was normalized to atmospheric pressure for smoother exit of the effluent the simultaneous occurrence of wastewater inflow and degasification process was observed in the case 1 experiments therefore additional retention time in individual degasifier units was avoided and the influent progressed from one stage to the other in an almost continuous manner after the completion of one cycle as mentioned above 2 3 analytical methods the detailed procedure of dissolved methane measurement and quantification is described elsewhere lee et al 2019 to measure the dissolved methane the wastewater samples were filled in the serum bottles without air contact and sealed with rubber stoppers and aluminum caps subsequently 0 2 ml of 3 n naoh was injected into the serum bottles that increased the ph of the samples to more than 11 for possible inhibition of the biological activities and stimulation of co2 capture a 5 ml sample was drawn from the serum bottle with an equal volume of n2 gas as a replacement subsequently the serum bottles were shaken in an incubator shaker vs 8480 vision scientific co ltd republic of korea at 35 c for approximately 6 h until liquid gas phase equilibrium was reached the headspace gas composition of the serum bottles was measured by gas chromatography gc hewlett packard 6890 series equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and a hayesep d packed column 80 100 agilent technology usa the dissolved hydrogen sulfide concentration was measured using ion selective electrode ise method according to the manufacturer s guideline a 20 ml wastewater sample was taken in a 100 ml bottle and 20 ml of sulfide anti oxidant buffer saob solution was added to the bottle to minimize air contact the samples were then measured using a silver sulfide ion selective electrode 9616 bnwp silver sulfide combination electrode thermo scientific with orion 4 star ph ise benchtop meter thermo scientific 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the vacuum degasifier operation case 1 3 1 1 effect of media packing ratio exp 1 the influence of the media packing ratio on the dissolved methane removal efficiency was studied primarily using vdlm as summarized in table 2 the dissolved methane removal efficiency increased with increasing media packing ratio the dissolved methane removal efficiency was 74 9 at the lowest media packing ratio of 40 and the efficiency increased almost linearly to 82 3 at a maximum media packing ratio of 90 these observations were evident as a higher packing ratio helped maximize the surface area for mass transfer the structured tripack packing aided the high specific surface areas of approximately 282 m2 m3 promoted the development of thin water films moreover the media enabled interstitial mixing which boosted gas liquid contact the synergistic effects of the thin liquid boundary layer and interstitial mixing resulted in reduced mass transfer resistance thereby facilitating the evolution of dissolved methane to the gas phase based on the dissolved methane removal efficiency a 90 packing ratio was selected for subsequent experiments on the other hand for vdsm a low dissolved methane removal efficiency of 68 3 was observed at a packing ratio of 85 15 cm packed height of a 17 5 cm column the low vdsm efficiency might be due to a decrease in the effective interfacial area where mass transfer actually takes place owing to the short column height the major ratio of the packed media remained filled with the incoming wastewater the submerged media in the liquid phase behave as a static interfacial area which no longer participate in the mass transfer operation affecting the overall elimination of dissolved methane therefore the effects of the media packing height on dissolved methane removal were more pronounced than the effects of the media packing diameter this is in agreement with the earlier reports by scherer and wichmann 2000 on methane desorption from ground water in different column configurations the authors recommended the achievement of more than 90 methane desorption efficiency in packed columns by increasing the column heights the use of vdsm for dissolved methane removal is discouraged except in exp 5 for comparison for further experiments because of the inferior performance efficiency 3 1 2 effect of throughput volume exp 2 the experiments were conducted by considering the various throughput volumes of 100 800 ml per batch treatment with vdsn vdln and vdlm the influent dissolved methane concentration was 17 04 and 16 62 mg l for the degasifiers with a nozzle and media respectively as shown in fig 2 the efficiencies of the vdsn and vdln were in the range of 84 5 86 1 and 82 8 84 6 respectively therefore the dissolved methane removal efficiency was not affected significantly by the throughput volume the marginally better performance of the vdsn might be due to the higher gas liquid interfacial area in both degasifiers the influent was sprayed through nozzles that induced droplet formation with a considerable specific surface area for efficient mass transfer but mass transfer is dependent on several factors such as the spray angle droplet size degasifier diameter and degasifier length after spraying from the nozzle the droplets come in contact with the surroundings atomize further under the influence of a vacuum and follow definitive trajectories to cover the stopping distance sd before moving vertically downward as shown in fig 3 in vdsn the larger the diameter the broader the spray angle and the smaller the drop size accelerating the mass transfer rate around the drops moreover in vdln for a given spray angle the droplets strike the wall as the sd is higher than the impact distance id the surface area decreases due to the coalescence of the droplets formed and harms the mass transfer operation despite these differences the marginal efficiency variation between the two degasifiers can be explained based on the applied vacuum pressure the dominating factor of mass transfer with the application of similar vacuum pressure 0 94 bar the concentration gradient of dissolved methane increased correspondingly and a comparable degassing efficiency of dissolved methane from the liquid phase was achieved henares et al 2016 reported an increase in the efficiency with increasing vacuum pressure while attempting methane removal from anaerobic effluents by degassing membranes theoretically an increase in throughput volume is expected to promote higher mass transfer because an elevated concentration gradient is established due to the increased inlet methane load with the increasing influent flow a similar observation has been reported in recovering methane from anaerobic process effluent by membrane contactors cookney et al 2016 in this case however the injected liquid was collected at the bottom of both reactors under the same vacuum pressure the stagnant pool of liquid without turbulence or other means of driving force limits the scope of liquid side mass transfer furthermore the decrease in bulk liquid mass transfer due to the increased influent load can be attributed to the observed marginal fall in the degasifying efficiency with increasing throughput volume nevertheless the dissolved methane removal efficiency of the vdlm was affected by the changes in throughput volume per batch treatment as shown in fig 2 when the throughput volume was increased from 100 to 800 ml the dissolved methane removal efficiency decreased from 88 4 to 76 1 respectively progressive submersion of packed media ratio with increased throughput leaving limited exposed surfaces for gas liquid mass transfer may be the reason for this observed trend as already discussed in section 3 1 1 a similar trend of decreased dissolved methane removal efficiency with increasing influent load was observed in degassing membranes due to wetting of the hydrophobic membranes or fiber compression leading to reduced permeability and increased mass transfer resistance henares et al 2016 2017 therefore the throughput volume as a critical factor affected the performance efficiency of media packed degasifiers more prominently than that of the nozzle fitted ones and larger cross sectional areas would have added advantages for enhanced efficiency in the case of nozzle fitted degasifiers 3 1 3 effect of retention time and injection rate exp 3 and exp 4 based on the evidence from exp 1 and exp 2 vdsn and vdlm were chosen for exp 3 to evaluate the effects of the retention time on dissolved methane removal the retention time signifies the time after the completion of the injection phase and before the commencement of the outflow phase i e the time of residence of the influent liquid under the applied vacuum conditions as shown in fig 4 the dissolved methane removal efficiency of both reactors was improved marginally amounting to differences of approximately 3 when the retention time was increased from 0 to 18 min these findings indicate the non significant influence of the retention time as an experimental parameter on dissolved methane removal the observed trend was quite predictable in the case of vdsn as discussed earlier the stagnant liquid pool without any dominant mass transfer driving force allows limited mass transfer only through the available relatively small gas liquid interfacial area therefore provided the concentration gradient is maintained by decreasing c with increased vacuum pressure the dissolved methane transfer continued across the boundary on the other hand with constant vacuum pressure the thin layer of gas in contact with liquid gradually becomes stagnant sinha and de 2012 therefore even with a long retention time the overall dissolved methane removal efficiency did not increase significantly similarly in the case of vdlm percolation of the influent liquid through the packing layers not only assisted in interstitial mixing but also facilitated the rate of surface renewal thereby increasing mass transfer sinha and de 2012 with the liquid holdup the volume of liquid held per volume of the packed bed under operation conditions restricted the mass transfer operation only to the limited media liquid interfacial area on the upper part of the degasifier while saturating the media at the bottom consequently the retention time was ineffective in improving the methane removal efficiency due to the inadequate scope of surface renewal of the saturated media the effect of the injection rate on the efficiency of dissolved methane removal was investigated in vdsn and vdlm by varying the injection rate exp 4 the corresponding injection times of 36 81 s and 10 100 s were varied in vdsn and vdlm respectively for a similar treatment volume of approximately 800 ml while keeping the other parameters fixed to those of earlier experiments as shown in fig 5 unlike factors such as the throughput per batch treatment and retention time the dissolved methane removal efficiency was affected considerably when the injection rate was changed in vdsn the removal efficiency increased with increasing injection rate the removal efficiency was 84 3 at an injection rate of 22 2 ml s but decreased to 59 6 when the injection rate was reduced to 9 9 ml s the reason for the observed trend was that the higher injection rate induced shear stress which caused the breakage of liquid drops into smaller droplets ultimately reducing the gas liquid mass transfer resistance in addition a high injection rate increased the collision force among the liquid droplets that destabilized the methane equilibrium in the liquid phase and accelerated methane release with a complementary effect from the negative pressure caused by vacuum pressure cao et al 2019 reported a similar experimental outcome in achieving enhanced ammonia recovery from swine wastewater using innovative spraying technology in contrast to vdsn the dissolved methane removal efficiency increased in vdlm with a slower injection rate and the removal efficiencies were 70 5 and 84 4 at injection rates of 80 and 8 ml s respectively this might be because unlike vdsn liquid gas mass transfer in vdlm was mediated predominantly by the thin liquid boundary layers formed around the media that ensured a decrease in the mass transfer resistance through the increased interfacial area mass transfer being a time dependent process necessitates adequate contact time therefore a slower injection rate resulted in prolonged contact time between the media and the influent liquid phase improved liquid film formation with a higher contact time guaranteed the exposure of more liquid surface area to the gas phase per unit volume of influent thereby benefitting the increase in liquid side mass transfer both vdsn and vdlm exhibited similar maximum dissolved methane removal efficiencies of approximately 84 but with different optimal injection rates the optimal injection rates for vdsn and vdlm were 22 2 and 8 ml s respectively the corresponding injection times for vdsn and vdlm were 36 and 100 s respectively therefore vdsn can be used for the faster degassing of dissolved methane from a large volume of anaerobic effluent whereas vdlm can be better suited for a small volume of wastewater where slower degassing of dissolved methane is desirable 3 1 4 combined effect of nozzle and media exp 5 in exp 5 the individual and combined effects of the media and nozzle on the dissolved methane removal efficiency were examined in short type vacuum degasifiers vds and the results are plotted in fig 6 the reported dissolved methane removal efficiencies were in the order of vdsn vdsnm vdsm control this indicates that the nozzle mediated spraying of influent was a more effective way of enhancing the mass transfer operation than that of the packed media mode in vdsn concentration gradient driven molecular diffusion accelerated the mass transfer rates in the continuous gaseous phase around the liquid drops and inside the droplets resulting in higher removal efficiency on the other hand in vdsm although the media served as an interfacial surface area for gas and liquid phase interaction for effective mass transfer it was comparatively less effective than that of the direct gas liquid exchange mode as in the case of vdsn indeed the combined effects of the nozzle and media were intermediate between the individual effects the dissolved methane removal efficiency of vdsnm was 79 1 which was lower than that of the vdsn but higher than the removal efficiency exhibited by vdsm during the spray distribution of influent as in case of vdsnm the gas liquid contact time increased with increasing drop height thereby enhancing mass transfer on the other hand the packed media in vdsnm interfered with the aerial spreading of the influent as the droplets collided on the media surface before covering the adequate drop height thereby hindering the mass transfer process although the collision of droplets with a medium could promote mass transfer it is less effective than droplet collision among themselves resulting in an overall lower mass transfer rate than that of the vdsn in addition the optimal injection rate and injection time is different for nozzle and media type degasifiers as discussed in previous section therefore the difference in optimal operating parameters might explain the lack of a synergistic effect of combining both the nozzle and media in a single degasifier the negative pressure generated by a vacuum pump being the sole mass transfer driving force in the control degasifier registered the lowest dissolved methane removal efficiency from the experimental evidences from case 1 it was observed that nozzle fitted degasifiers were more effective than the media packed ones injection rate as an experimental parameters significantly governed the dissolved methane removal and larger cross sectional area of the degasifiers was an added advantage for higher removal efficiency trial experiments with two stage degasifiers results not shown at an injection rate of 20 ml min and 0 94 bar vacuum pressure in continuous mode overcome the issues pertaining to the efficiency of single degasifier units 90 role of spray angle sd and id in the nozzle fitted degasifiers as explained in fig 3 implied that a degasifier with an intermediate configuration to vdsn and vdln could be a better option for effective mass transfer application of reduced vacuum pressure 0 8 bar was planned for enhanced energy efficiency of the degasifiers three stage mode of operation was intended to ensure high performance efficiency under reduced vacuum pressure while dealing with the inherent variability of real wastewater characteristics and environmental conditions in field scale applications therefore the optimum experimental conditions for case 2 as mentioned in section 2 2 were fixed based on these preliminary observations and assumptions for simultaneous removal of dissolved ch4 and h2s in a more efficient and economical manner 3 2 dissolved gas removal in the three stage vacuum degasifier case 2 followed by the optimization process the simultaneous removal of dissolved ch4 and h2s from anaerobic effluents of saf mbr was attempted some minor adjustments in the optimized experimental parameters and configurations based on previous experiments were adopted to maintain a striking balance between the removal efficiency and economical aspect 3 2 1 removal of dissolved methane fig 7 presents the dissolved methane removal in the three stage vacuum degasifier the results suggest that ph had no significant effect on dissolved methane removal while the removal efficiencies increased with increasing number of degasifier units after receiving saf mbr effluent from the gongchon pilot plant with a dissolved methane concentration of approximately 12 15 mg l equivalent to 48 60 mg l cod the first degasifier unit exhibited a removal efficiency of 53 63 the removal efficiency was improved further to 80 84 in the second degasifier that received effluent from the first degasifier the dissolved methane concentration of the effluent from the third degasifier was below the detection limit 1 mg l ch4 the measured cod equivalent was 3 4 mg l approximately 1 mg l of ch4 amounting to a removal efficiency more than 92 94 as discussed earlier the formation of influent droplets with a large specific surface area caused by the nozzle spraying together with a negative pressure induced by a vacuum pump helped destabilize the liquid phase equilibrium of methane and the subsequent emission of the same to the gas phase the dissolved methane removal efficiency of the 1st degasifier was complemented by the second and the second by the third therefore an increase in the removal efficiency was observed with each integration of degasifier units the lower removal efficiency of the 1st degasifier unit might be due to the application of lower vacuum pressure 0 8 bar in this case against 0 94 bar in case 1 though the exact reason is unknown few approaches for the removal and or recovery of dissolved methane other than the methodology described above have been reported a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor reported by hatamoto et al 2010 achieved 95 dissolved methane removal but no methane was recovered as the dhs stimulated biological oxidation of the dissolved methane employing a two stage dhs reactor matsuura et al 2010 recovered 77 of dissolved methane in the first stage nevertheless the methane composition in the recovered biogas was quite low as the dissolved methane was released from the dhs liquid phase by gasification based on the gas liquid equilibrium a high efficiency of 78 was accomplished using a membrane contactor for removing dissolved methane from synthetic anaerobic effluent cookney et al 2012 but the methane concentration in the recovered gas was less than 30 which was either not burnable or sustained difficulties in burning browell et al 2009 bandara et al 2011 recovered 60 80 of the dissolved methane with methane concentrations of approximately 50 from uasb effluent using a degassing membrane on the other hand the process required high levels of energy to achieve gasification through a vacuum pump either a vacuum or sweep gas mode can be applied to provide the necessary mass transfer driving force for dissolved methane desorption the operating modes were chosen based on the desired removal efficiency reuse of recovered methane and energy consumption of the process although sweep gas mode consumes less energy than vacuum mode a high gas flow dilutes the recovered gas concentration as low concentration methane recovery is not beneficial for subsequent energy generation the process necessitates a further purification step thereby increasing the overall energy consumption moreover in sweep gas mode the pressure loss through the membrane contactors results in high energy consumption evans 2018 therefore vacuum mode is preferred when it is desired to recover high concentrations of methane for reuse as a source of energy henares et al 2016 more than 90 of the dissolved methane removal efficiency attained using vacuum a degasifier in the study was similar to the reported results in addition with the possibilities of reusing the recovered methane as an energy source this approach was energy positive which is discussed in the following section 3 2 2 removal of dissolved sulfide the removal efficiency of dissolved sulfide varied more prominently with decreasing ph than that of the series integration of a larger number of degasifiers fig 7b stable sulfide removal efficiency of 87 88 was achieved with ph adjusted samples the final concentration in the treated effluent was in the range of 1 5 1 7 mg l except for the sample without ph adjustment 4 mg l the removal efficiency of the ph adjusted samples was approximately 17 higher than the raw sample after the three stage treatment as far h2s removal is concerned only the non ionized form can be transferred across the air water interface in other words h2s is the only sulfide species that can be transformed from h2s aq to h2s g and leaves the aqueous phase as a free gas the transformation depends on the gas liquid equilibrium and h2s dissociation in water hence it is governed by factors such as ph contact time temperature and turbulence of the liquid phase and equilibrium constant ka silva et al 2020 approximately 50 of the total sulfide remains as h2s aq when the ph is maintained at pka1 7 04 further acidic conditions favor a higher h2s aq fraction which contribute to the enhanced emission of h2s to the gas phase after influent spraying the water droplets brought the sulfide compounds in contact with the gaseous phase subsequently the removal of dissolved h2s was realized through the process of h2s concentration equalization between the liquid and gas phases the process was prominent in the 1st degasifier as shown in fig 7b in the subsequent degasifier units however the partial effectiveness of the process mainly noticeable from raw samples without ph adjustment might be due to the unavailability of h2s aq which often requires a downward adjustment of the ph therefore with decreasing ph a high removal efficiency of dissolved hydrogen sulfide was observed in individual degasifiers and along the series integration the maximum removal efficiency of approximately 88 achieved at ph 5 might be based on the available non dissociated h2s aq at that ph after the three stages the final effluent ph of 6 5 7 5 was recorded for all the ph adjusted samples the observed increase in ph might be due to the consumption of h ions in the process of h2s elimination silva et al 2020 reported more than 50 higher dissolved sulfide removal efficiency at ph 4 than at ph 6 and justified their results based on the available h2s aq fraction of 100 and 66 6 at ph 4 and 6 respectively similarly agrahari et al 2013 reported 100 dissolved h2s removal efficiency from synthetic wastewater using hollow fiber membrane contactors such high removal efficiency was attributed to the conditions at ph 4 contact time of 60 min and maintenance of a temperature gradient between the feed and permeate side through a direct contact membrane distillation approach these results suggest that the staged vacuum degasifiers can be a promising technology for the effective removal of dissolved sulfide from low strength anaerobic effluent with the most straightforward approach of ph management although dissolved sulfide was reduced from 13 5 0 25 to 1 5 0 25 mg l the final effluent concentrations might not meet the desired performance objective of most of the anaerobic effluent treatments aiming at dissolved gas removal in the present study further enhanced efficiency could have been achieved by reducing the ph beyond 5 in this case however the finished water will then require additional neutralization treatment steps additional experimental investigations will be needed in this aspect and future studies should aim to improve the removal of residual hydrogen sulfide for example by conjugating a catalytic carbon filter to polish the treated effluent or by an inexpensive biological sulfide oxidation method therefore further research into cost effective and sustainable technologies for sulfide removal is highly desirable h2s in the recovered gas should be removed both from the prospective of reusability and to get rid of the environmental hazards as discussed earlier when the intended end use of biogas is in internal combustion engines the h2s concentration should be below 100 ppm whereas for boilers even up to 1000 ppm concentration might not be problematic therefore h2s removal approaches from the biogas are mainly dependent on the reuse aspect the methods commonly used in the field are activated carbon based adsorption chemical precipitation through iron chloride dosing and biological desulphurization using microorganisms ciahotny and kyselova 2019 díaz and fdz polanco 2012 microaeration is another emerging technology where h2s is oxidized to elemental sulfur by sulfur sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob krayzelova et al 2014 in gist there are established technologies for h2s removal from biogas and those are commonly practiced in biogas treatment plants so the focus of this study is not the h2s removal from biogas but from the anaerobic effluent which is important both from environmental impact and process sustainability aspects for example practicing chemical method of sulfide removal from anaerobic effluent alone contributes around 70 of overall environmental impacts thereby impacting the life cycle assessment of the adopted anaerobic membrane processes evans 2018 therefore the simultaneous removal approach of dissolved ch4 and h2s from anaerobic effluents in gaseous form as adopted in this study followed by an inexpensive treatment method like biological desulphurization could be an effective alternative for improved sustainability of treatment processes 3 3 energy and carbon balance of the vacuum degasifier the energy analysis of vacuum degasifiers for the recovery of dissolved methane from the saf mbr effluent was performed the net energy recovered from dissolved methane was determined after comparing the energy recovered as methane and the energy consumption in the vacuum degasifier operation the energy required to operate the vacuum degasifier can be estimated using the following equation crone et al 2016 3 w v d k w r t k 1 p o u t p i n k 1 k 1 1 1000 where wvd k w r t and pout pin are the power requirement of vacuum degasifier kw heat capacity ratio molar flow rate through the vacuum pump mol s universal gas constant in j mol k 8 314 inlet gas absolute temperature k and ratio between outlet and inlet of vacuum pressure kpa respectively the vacuum degasifier energy consumption was calculated based on the following assumptions heat capacity ratio of 1 3 as suggested by martin et al 2011 gas temperature of 25 c typical dissolved methane concentration of 17 mg l vacuum pressure of 730 mm hg and 75 gas phase methane composition the conversion of influent to water vapor due to the low pressure was estimated to be 10 considering a 60 vacuum pump energy efficiency the estimated corresponding energy requirement was 0 0132 kwh m3 in case 1 experiments in case 2 experiments however the vacuum pump energy requirement was still lower 0 0069 kwh m3 as 0 8 bar pressure was maintained instead of 0 95 bar in case 1 to evaluate the energy content of the dissolved methane recovered through the vacuum degasifier it was assumed that the dissolved methane could be used entirely without any losses methane has an energy content of approximately 47 mj kg based on the lower heating value crone et al 2016 which can be expressed further as 13 06 kwh kg choosing the specific optimized conditions of 20 ml s injection rate 40 s injection time and 17 mg l of influent dissolved methane concentration the energy equivalent of the influent dissolved methane was 0 22 kwh m3 therefore based on the removal efficiencies as exhibited in table 3 the energy equivalences of 0 169 0 1874 and 0 2068 kwh m3 were calculated from the recovered dissolved methane in vdlm vdsn and three stage degasifiers respectively the energy recovered from the dissolved methane can be converted to electricity using microturbines according to the following equation rongwong et al 2018 4 e n x c h 4 f ε c h 4 l where ɳ is the microturbine efficiency xch4 is the fraction of methane in the biogas f is biogas flow rate m3 day ϵch4 is the energy content of methane and l is the liquid flow rate m3 day in this study however considering the recommended conversion efficiency of 37 crone et al 2016 because most of the energy is wasted in the form of heat due to inefficiencies in the unit operations 0 0625 0 0773 kwh m3 electricity generation can be expected through vacuum degasifier applications the net energy or electricity obtained through the vacuum degasifier application can be calculated from the difference in electricity obtained and consumed in the process 5 n e t e e w v d accordingly the net energy of 0 0493 0 0696 kwh m3 can be obtained through the application of a vacuum degasifier in treating the saf mbr effluent indicating the overall energy positive approach in all the cases considered as listed in table 3 the maximum energy saving of 0 0696 was observed in three stage degasifiers as a high removal efficiency was achieved 94 under a low vacuum pressure 0 8 bar in continuous mode of operation this finding is in line with an earlier study by the same research group in which it was suggested that if dissolved methane could be recovered proficiently saf mbr could function without any supplementary energy input beyond what is generated by the system shin et al 2014 similar to the energy balance a carbon balance was undertaken to determine the resulting carbon footprint from the vacuum degasifier operation because the unproductive recovery of dissolved methane also ultimately results in an increased carbon footprint the recovery of sufficient amounts of dissolved methane and subsequent harnessing of renewable energy from dissolved methane can offset the global warming potential as well as the carbon footprint of dissolved methane the resulting carbon footprint can be obtained from the difference in the amount of electrical energy recovered and the amount of renewable electrical energy required to offset the fugitive methane emission the recovered electrical energy table 3 is applicable for carbon balance analysis in addition based on the reports by mcleod et al 2016 the grid electricity co2 footprint is 543 g kwh and the global warming potential of ch4 is 23 g co2 g ch4 therefore the renewable electrical energy required to offset 1 g of fugitive methane emission is 0 042 kwh g applying the mass balance to all the cases considered the net difference was found to be negative for vdlm and vdsn whereas it was positive in the case of the three stage degasifiers table 4 overall to achieve carbon neutrality more than 90 of dissolved methane recovery is a desirable criterion in the application of vacuum degasifiers for dissolved methane removal from anaerobic effluents cookney et al 2016 came to similar conclusions by recommending more than 90 recovery from anaerobic effluent with 14 mg l of dissolved methane to offset the carbon footprint of the residual left in the effluent after treatment similarly starting with an effluent concentration of 25 mg l mcleod et al 2016 suggested 88 dissolved methane recovery for the realization of carbon neutrality therefore the integration of vacuum degasifiers to saf mbr systems to recover the dissolved methane from the anaerobic effluent can be a promising alternative from an energy positive and carbon neutral prospective the recovery efficiency and knowledge of methane concentration in the recovered gas are vital components to estimate carbon footprint global warming and renewable energy potential of the recovered methane gas as this study is an indicative examination of the feasibility further experimental investigations are highly recommended for validation with an optimized methane recovery methodology 4 conclusions this paper reported the successful application of a three stage vacuum degasifier for the simultaneous removal of dissolved methane and hydrogen sulfide from the saf mbr effluent the results showed that the nozzle mediated spraying of influent was a more effective way of enhancing the mass transfer of dissolved gases from the liquid to the gas phase than that of the packed media mode the negative vacuum pressure as the mass transfer driving force mainly controlled the dissolved methane removal whereas the ph played a vital role in dissolved hydrogen sulfide removal the maximum degassing efficiency with respect to methane was 94 while that of hydrogen sulfide was 88 with the respective final concentrations of 4 mg l as a cod equivalent and 1 5 mg l respectively the vacuum degasification method was found to be energy positive with a net energy gain of 0 05 0 07 kwh m3 although a wide range of methane removal efficiencies of 54 94 under different experimental conditions attested to the viability of this technology the carbon neutrality of the process was realized only in more than 90 of methane recovery cases therefore owing to the efficiency energy positivity and carbon neutrality vacuum degasifiers can be explored as a sustainable and promising alternative for the removal of dissolved gas from anaerobic effluents declaration of competing

17818,emerging threats such as climate change and urbanisation pose an unprecedented challenge to the integrated management of urban wastewater systems which are expected to function in a reliable resilient and sustainable manner regardless of future conditions traditional long term planning is rather limited in developing no regret strategies that avoid maladaptive lock ins in the near term and allow for flexibility in the long term in this study a novel adaptation pathways approach for urban wastewater management is developed in order to explore the compliance and adaptability potential of intervention strategies in a long term operational period accounting for different future scenarios and multiple performance objectives in terms of reliability resilience and sustainability this multi criteria multi scenario approach implements a regret based method to assess the relative performance of two types of adaptation strategies i standalone strategies i e green or grey strategies only and ii hybrid strategies i e combined green and grey strategies a number of adaptation thresholds i e the points at which the current strategy can no longer meet defined objectives are defined to identify compliant domains i e periods of time in a future scenario when the performance of a strategy can meet the targets the results obtained from a case study illustrate the trade off between adapting to short term pressures and addressing long term challenges green strategies show the highest performance in simultaneously meeting near and long term needs while grey strategies are found less adaptable to changing circumstances in contrast hybrid strategies are effective in delivering both short term compliance and long term adaptability it is also shown that the proposed adaption pathways method can contribute to the identification of adaptation strategies that are developed as future conditions unfold allowing for more flexibility and avoiding long term commitment to strategies that may cause maladaptation this provides insights into the near term and long term planning of ensuring the reliability resilience and sustainability of integrated urban drainage systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords adaptation pathways green strategies hybrid strategies resilience sustainability urban wastewater systems 1 introduction urban wastewater management has become increasingly challenging due to deep uncertainties posed by global climate change urbanization population growth economic and technological developments and other unforeseen changing factors such as societal perspectives and preferences as such the level of service delivered by urban wastewater infrastructure in the future can deteriorate causing important system failures brugge et al 2005 offermans et al 2011 to this end there is a growing interest to manage present and future uncertainties particularly those in the form of exceptional disturbances that could lead to extremely adverse consequences maier et al 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2017 in the context of urban wastewater management emphasis has shifted towards adaptation o brien 2012 and addressing the short and long term challenges posed by deep uncertainties manocha and babovic 2018 rather than simply focusing on how change has occurred in the past fazey et al 2016 in the face of deep uncertainties and their unknown impacts and consequences it is essential to consider the indicators that can measure system performance in the future such as those of reliability resilience and sustainability the reliability of a system is measured under design conditions whereas resilience measures the system performance under extreme conditions when the required level of service is not achieved butler et al 2017 sustainability measures system performance from economic environmental and socio cultural consequences over the life span although these three concepts measure different aspects of system performance butler et al 2017 they are interconnected to each other blockley et al 2012 it has been suggested that reliability is necessary but not sufficient for resilience and resilience is necessary but not sufficient for sustainability butler et al 2014 there is a lack of understanding regarding the long term and short term impacts of adaptation strategies on the system performance in terms of reliability resilience and sustainability the understanding is critical to avoid maladaptive lock ins reduce potential regrets and allow flexibility as conditions change over time maru and stafford smith 2014 such a course of action allows decision makers to consider a strategy limited in time and resources and therefore rectify if needed whilst still permitting them to foresee the possible long term consequences of specific adaptation pathways dessai and van der sluijs 2007 tanaka et al 2015 in recent years several planning methods and policy making approaches within the field of water and wastewater management have been developed to dynamically respond to changing circumstances and deep uncertainties manocha and babovic 2017 van veelen et al 2015 including robust decision making casal campos et al 2015 lempert et al 2006 mortazavi naeini et al 2015 adaptive policy making walker et al 2013 adaptation pathways bloemen et al 2018 haasnoot et al 2019 kingsborough et al 2016 manocha and babovic 2017 maru and stafford smith 2014 uncertainty framework assessment kundzewicz et al 2018 refsgaard et al 2013 dynamic adaptation policy pathways haasnoot et al 2013 kwakkel et al 2015 risk model merz et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 real option analysis deng et al 2013 zhang and babovic 2012 among these adaptation pathway ap methods assess the adaptability potential of management strategies and evaluate system performance in different epochs i e transient scenarios from the baseline year to the future horizon with respect to different objectives and indicators to identify pathways without any maladaptive lock ins an adaptation pathway provides a visual representation of the potential sequencing and type of actions to be implemented or strategies to be considered in the future kingsborough et al 2016 the core of ap approaches lies in adaptation thresholds or tipping points which are defined as the points where changing conditions force a normally stable state of a system into another state or facilitate adaptation of the system van veelen et al 2015 these methods take system vulnerabilities as the initial point to identify a range of adaptation options jeuken et al 2015 such approaches have mainly been used within the fields of stormwater management and flood risk management for example barnett et al 2014 bloemen et al 2018 haasnoot et al 2019 2013 kwadijk et al 2010 manocha and babovic 2017 ranger et al 2013 van veelen et al 2015 werners et al 2013 a number of studies have applied adaptation pathway methods for long term planning of urban water supply systems cradock henry et al 2020 forsythe et al 2018 haasnoot et al 2012 kingsborough et al 2016 some of these approaches need to be reoriented towards resilience assessment juan garcía et al 2017 and to consider both short and long term adaptation planning hecht and kirshen 2019 according to gersonius et al 2013 some of these approaches may fail in reliably addressing uncertainties and non stationarity in future drivers such as climate change this is due to the fact that they only consider one future scenario at a time and cannot identify solutions with high levels of confidence adger et al 2009 jafino et al 2019 to date aps have not been applied to iuwwss with socio economic complexities that assess reliability resilience and sustainability simultaneously the aim of this paper is therefore to develop an ap approach to assess the compliance and adaptability potential of various strategies in reliability resilience and sustainability domains both individually and conjunctively along the pathway of transient scenarios future scenarios every 5 years in an iuwws it will focus on the identification and application of adaptation strategies associated with the management of stormwater and wastewater in urban areas as to ameliorate a number of impacts and consequences used to describe system performance casal campos et al 2015 assessed the relative performance of green and grey strategies in multiple impact categories on an integrated catchment using a regret based approach casal campos et al 2018 further investigated the robustness of a number of strategies in delivering reliable resilient and sustainable wastewater services in the future although these two studies assessed the performance of strategies in the year 2050 long term they did not identify possible adaptation pathways that span from the baseline year to the future horizon in the present study a novel approach is developed for the dynamic assessment of interventions that leads to adaptive management of the iuwws in both the short and long terms the proposed approach brings the time domain to adaptation planning and identifies possible adaptation pathways based on different adaptation thresholds for individual and conjunctive performance domains of under different future scenarios defined as transient scenarios assessed every 5 years every 5 years here they are defined as epochs or transient scenarios for the period 2015 2050 section 2 provides an overview of the proposed methodology through two steps step 1 identification of compliant domains and step 2 evaluation of compliant domains via regret indices section 3 describes the case studies including definition and description of the integrated urban wastewater system future scenarios adaptation strategies and decision indicators section 4 reports the results and a wider discussion of their implications finally section 5 summarises the conclusions and implications of this study 2 methodology adaptation pathways mathematical models are developed and used in order to understand the current and future states of the wastewater system haasnoot et al 2011 there are numerous uncertainties that hinder our understanding of the system and constrict the predictive capacity of models regarding its future state asselt 2000 walker et al 2003 if future conditions happen to be different from the predicted conditions adaptation strategies may fail to deliver their expected performance mcinerney et al 2012 adaptation strategies are therefore required to respond to the new conditions when the future state unfolds manocha and babovic 2017 when the future is revealed adaptation measures need to be updated based on what is experienced and learnt therefore in order to establish a framework to manage the future a planning approach is required that consists of a strategic vision of the future kingsborough et al 2016 committing to both short term and long term plans and actions bloemen et al 2018 the approach of adaptation pathways has recently received growing attention from researchers and decision makers fazey et al 2016 and is being applied as a planning and foresight tool to help evaluate the adaptability of management strategies in both the short and the long terms adaptation pathways have several definitions and different studies examine the approach from distinctive perspectives wise et al 2014 for example leach et al 2010 defined this approach as alternative possible trajectories for knowledge intervention and change which prioritize different goals values and functions they considered temporal uncertainties in the long term future for adaptation to climate change haasnoot et al 2013 defined it as an analytical and foresight approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible strategies along the planning timeline haasnoot et al 2019 adapted their aforementioned definition to the following an approach that explores alternative sequences of investment decisions to achieve objectives over time in the context of uncertain future developments and environmental changes in this study an adaptation pathway is defined as a pathway in which a strategy or a combination of strategies is compliant with the adaptation threshold s along the planning timeline an overview of definitions for the adaptation pathways is presented in the supporting information si section s1 fig 1 illustrates a flow chart of different steps considered in the proposed ap approach highlighting the preliminary steps steps 0 1 to 0 5 and main steps steps 1 and 2 of the methodology in this study a novel ap approach is introduced to identify possible pathways the possible compliant domains in different future states along the planning timelines with respect to different adaptation thresholds step 1 section 2 1 and facilitates a detailed regret based analysis of each management strategy in the form of reliability resilience and or sustainability step 2 section 2 2 prior to the

able to meet a defined objective or objectives across a timeline at this point alternative adaptation strategies should be considered this is similar to an adaptation tipping point the term which is normally used in the climate change community manocha and babovic 2017 renaud et al 2013 an adaptation threshold is also known as the recovery threshold i e at this point measures should be adopted to meet the objectives van veelen et al 2015 adaptation thresholds are used to identify the compliant domain of each strategy described in section 3 2 along the planning timeline further details on adaptation thresholds are discussed in section 3 4 in this study each strategy is assessed under future scenarios defined in section 3 1 at time intervals of 5 years i e epochs or transient scenarios defining a pathway that spanned from the baseline year 2015 to the future horizon 2050 the particular scenario conditions and their variation along the timeline are considered by setting 5 year assessment periods i e epochs in 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 and 2050 see fig 2 the time epoch when a strategy violates an adaptation threshold the system no longer complies with a specific objective value is referred to as its sell by date haasnoot et al 2013 i e the period when a strategy is expected to require adaptation or additional measures due to an interruption of its satisfactory performance across pathway of transient scenarios van veelen et al 2015 the assessment at the end of each epoch e g 2020 for the period 2015 2020 is assumed to be representative of the full period which may well be the case when considering for example asset investment plans in the uk or similar regulatory or planning horizons in other contexts in the proposed method the compliant domain is evaluated in two complementary ways i the number of complying epochs across the scenarios and ii whether the pathways are uninterrupted i e compliant or interrupted i e non compliant in relation to one or more adaptation thresholds across the entire timeline this is achieved by assessing the compliance of each strategy with specific adaptation thresholds in different future scenarios and epochs when an adaptation threshold is reached another strategy or measure should be considered for implementation van veelen et al 2015 for example in fig 2 strategy a is compliant along the lifestyles and innovation scenarios however the market and austerity scenarios see the description of each future scenario in section 3 1 are interrupted after 10 years and 25 years respectively therefore if future conditions resemble those of the austerity scenario for instance another adaptation strategy is required in 2040 2 2 step 2 evaluation of compliant domains via regret indices the first step of the proposed ap approach described in section 2 1 is to identify the compliant epochs and uninterrupted pathways in accordance with the adaptation thresholds the identified compliant epochs and pathways are further assessed using a regret based multi criteria analysis model that provides additional benefits and details of system performance regrets are calculated in the form of reliability r e l s f resilience r e s s f or sustainability s u s s f indices see eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 1 r e l s f i w i f r e g r e t i s f max s r e g r e t i s r e l f for i 1 m 2 r e s s f j w j f r e g r e t j s f max s r e g r e t j s r e s f for j 1 n 3 s u s s f k w k f r e g r e t k s f max s r e g r e t k s s u s f for k 1 q where w i f w j f and w k f are the importance weights assigned by a group of water experts of the i th reliability indicator j th resilience indicator and k th sustainability indicator in future state f respectively in this study five reliability indicators m 5 five resilience indicators n 5 and eight sustainability indicators q 8 are taken into account the adaptation indicators and the assigned weights in different future scenarios are discussed in section 3 3 r e g r e t i s f r e g r e t j s f and r e g r e t k s f see eq 4 eq 5 and eq 6 represent the regret or opportunity loss of strategy s under a future state f with respect to ith jth or kth indicator respectively casal campos et al 2015 the regret of strategy s under a future state f is defined as the difference between the performance p of s for reliability objective i resilience objective j or sustainability objective k and that of the best performing strategy s for the same future scenario f and objective i j or k 4 r e g r e t i s f m a x s p i s f p i s f 5 r e g r e t j s f m a x s p j s f p j s f 6 r e g r e t k s f m a x s p k s f p k s f m a x s p s f is the best performing strategy s under future scenario f with respect to indicator i j or k p s f represents the performance of strategy s under the same future scenario and allied with the same indicator lempert et al 2006 regret index for multiple i e conjunctive or mutual performance domains i n d e x m e g reliability resilience sustainability is determined as the average of reliability resilience and sustainability indices for each epoch within each scenario eq 7 7 i n d e x m s f r e l s f r e s s f s u s s f n where n denotes the number of individual indices reliability resilience and sustainability considered concurrently for this assessment if a strategy s regret is one i e full regret in any transient scenario being therefore the worst performing solution for all category objectives then the strategy is defined as non compliant for that transient scenario regardless of compliance with the adaptation threshold as described in section 3 4 that transient scenario is added to those epochs that do not comply with the adaptation threshold in a grey shade in fig 2 this means that if a regret index of a strategy is 0 99 the strategy is still compliant for transient scenario but the level of reliability resilient and or sustainability is very low in fig 2 coloured shades refer to different levels of regret expressed by reliability resilience or sustainability indices for each transient scenario for example in fig 2 strategy a in the innovation scenario for the epoch between 2025 and 2030 in green colour performs well and is highly reliable resilient and or sustainable as the level of regret is very low or nearly zero whereas this strategy does not perform well under the austerity scenario from 2045 to 2050 the epoch is in orange colour meaning the regret index is high i e not very reliable resilient and or sustainable if there are more than one performance domain and or one adaptation threshold which is the case in the current study the domains for each strategy need to be first identified for reliability resilience and sustainability thresholds individually for single and multiple thresholds the domains will then be overlapped to recognize the multiple domain of reliable resilient and sustainable performance for the adaptation thresholds individually and mutually the overlapping process is done using the mathematical intersection where a multiple domain of x y the intersection of x and y is formed of the epochs compliant in both x and y see fig 3 this can also be calculated by the union of x y where x and y denote the non compliant epochs of x and y respectively the identified compliant domains will then be further analysed by the regret indices relative to the strategies in terms of reliability resilience and or sustainability regret one of the main benefits of the ap approach is that it takes a step further in operationalizing multi objective criteria planning which would be crucial in the future as adaptation thresholds change overtime and require improved performance for example planning for multi functionality to incorporate ecosystem services hansen and pauleit 2014 the method can also help to balance between addressing current pressing issues in the iuwws and increasing the capacity to adapt to future needs and challenges that may emerge in the long term 3 case study overview the integrated urban wastewater system iuwws has been used as a case study to test the previously described approach this hypothetical iuwws consists of three subsystems casal campos et al 2015 fu et al 2008 1 an urban watershed with a combined sewer system this consists of 15 urban sub watersheds with a total area of 758 9 ha and a population of 181 000 inhabitants 2 a wastewater treatment plant wwtp with a conventional activated sludge process casp and average dry weather flow dwf of 377 1 l s and 3 an urban river with the mean flow rate mfr of 129 600 m3 d the catchment is modelled using simba 6 0 ifak 2007 a simulation tool that allows users to create and develop specific modelling modules tailored to the requirements of their project further details on the iuwws and the simulation tool can be found in the si in the s1 section of casal campos et al 2015 and in the s1 section of casal campos et al 2018 3 1 future scenarios the uncertain nature of threats affecting the performance of the iuwws in the future requires exploration of internal and external driving forces that may cause significant physical or social changes the equiprobable socio economic scenarios considered in this study are characterized by two main drivers namely governance economic growth vs environmental awareness and values consumerism vs conservationism casal campos et al 2018 based on these drivers four future scenarios are considered to assess the reliability resilience and sustainability of the iuwws in the planning timeline between 2015 and 2050 under various conditions 1 markets 2 innovation 3 austerity and 4 lifestyles the general description of each future scenario is illustrated in table 1 each of the above future scenarios is characterized by four key scenario factors associated with the management of the iuwws namely regulation i e level of regulatory control of stormwater and wastewater management activities centralized maintenance i e the level of activity in each scenario aimed at preserving and caring the existing wastewater infrastructure public attitudes i e public willingness towards the decentralization of responsibilities concerning urban drainage and technology i e the level of technological development occurring under each scenario casal campos et al 2015 the future scenarios differ from one another with respect to nine parameters variables indicative of various iuwws uncertain conditions 1 misconnections l s 2 urban creep ha 3 water use l head day 4 infiltration l s 5 siltation 6 population inhabitants 7 precipitation uplift 8 impervious area in new developments ha and 9 acceptability preference the selected parameters address main issues relevant to the management of stormwater and wastewater in the context of uk sewer systems which have been investigated in the past and can therefore be assigned with reasonable estimates in the year 2050 casal campos et al 2018 the description of each parameter and their values in different scenarios are provided in the si section s2 further details about the narratives of the future scenarios modeling of scenario parameters definitions of uncertainties future scenarios and literature estimates of uncertain future threats parameters can be found in section 2 2 and in the si section s2 of casal campos et al 2015 and in the si section s2 of casal campos et al 2018 the allocation of specific estimates from the literature to each scenario was carried out through the following three steps 1 associating internal threats with key scenario factors 2 estimating the relative strength of threats under each scenario 3 allocating threat estimates to each scenario for simplicity it is assumed that all scenario parameters vary linearly along the 2015 2050 timeline until they reach the levels defined for the year 2050 the implementation of each strategy along the timeline is also assumed to occur in a linear fashion so that each 5 year epoch represents the lead time required to implement the proportional fraction of each strategy to achieve completion in 2050 3 2 adaptation strategies various adaptation strategies are considered to investigate their effects on two types of urban areas in the catchment 1 the existing baseline area the original urban area presented in casal campos et al 2015 and 2 the new development area occurring as a consequence of urbanization due to population growth in the catchment under future scenarios in this context strategies only implemented in the baseline area are defined as retrofit strategies casal campos et al 2018 as opposed to those strategies which are implemented in new developments or those that serve both area types e g rehabilitation of the combined sewer network to this end adaptation strategies are divided into the following two categories stand alone section 3 2 1 and hybrid strategies section 3 2 2 3 2 1 stand alone strategies stand alone strategies can be categorized into three groups a green strategies 1 source control of pavements scp stores and infiltrate half of road runoff through retrofit bio retention planters 2 source control of roofs scr strategy disconnects roof downspouts into retrofitted rain gardens and 3 source control of urban creep scc strategy mitigates the effects of urban creep the term urban creep is used in the uk to describe the gradual loss of permeable area to impermeable area in the urban environment casal campos et al 2015 by using permeable pavement in residential driveways b grey strategies 1 separation of combined sewers ss separates the existing combined sewer system by retrofitting storm sewers 2 rehabilitation of combined sewer infrastructure with a new storage tank cst rehabilitates the existing combined sewer pipes without a new storage tank 3 rehabilitation of combined sewer infrastructure cs rehabilitates the existing combined sewer pipes but does not include a new storage tank and 4 on site treatment ot is considered for wastewater treatment and disposal of half of new developments c do nothing d n is considered to estimate the impacts of future scenario conditions without any interventions and is regarded as a base case for comparison 3 2 2 hybrid strategies in this study four hybrid strategies are considered each developed as a combination of two original stand alone strategies out of the four 1 roof disconnection scr 2 sewer separation ss 3 on site wastewater treatment ot and 4 rehabilitation of combined sewers in the network cs table 2 shows the hybrid solutions by integration of stand alone fractions the first three stand alone strategies scr ss and ot are selected as representative for retrofit decentralized retrofit centralized and new development solutions respectively casal campos et al 2018 the scr strategy is used as the reference to define hybrid options mainly due to the results reported in the literature that scr strategy shows the most promising stand alone performance casal campos et al 2015 for each hybrid solution two stand alone strategies were combined so that the resulting solution removes an annual volume of stormwater and wastewater equivalent to that of runoff removed by scr from the system the only hybrid strategy that does not consist of scr is h3 representing 20 sewer separation in the existing catchment ss and 31 5 of new developments ot the assumptions made in table 2 are in accordance with common practice in the uk and based on what has been proposed in casal campos et al 2018 2015 the main design considerations for hybrid strategies are presented in the si section s4 3 3 reliability resilience and sustainability indicators the level of reliability resilience and sustainability of each adaptation strategy is assessed by the regret based model described in section 2 2 using objectives and indicators presented in table s3 in the si these are the key objectives or criteria considered by the uk water industry to make strategic decisions for improving urban wastewater infrastructure and the levels of service these objectives characterise the concepts of reliability resilience and sustainability through impacts and consequences occurring as a result of system failure the operational side of failure i e reliability and resilience was therefore represented by impacts for example flooding probability duration or magnitude affecting these performance objectives whereas the strategic side i e sustainability was covered by the wider consequences of failure to society the environment and the economy for example material or environmental damage it is noteworthy that weights shown in table 3 are assigned to each objective by scenario so that these reflect the relevance of each objective under a specific world view the importance of the objective is irrespective of the metric that it is used in each case whether resilience reliability or sustainability as a consequence the numerator of the weight relative importance within each scenario for each objective remains the same for reliability resilience sustainability the only difference is the amount of objectives taken into account in each case five for reliability and resilience and eight for sustainability as mentioned in section 2 2 there are weights associated with objectives indicators table 3 which are calculated using the method of swing weighting the swing weighting approach allows decision makers to assess weights by swinging the value measure from its worst to its best level parnell and trainor 2009 the swing weighting approach allows allocation of the relative preference of criteria as well as incorporating an evaluation of their importance in the context of the decision dclg 2009 zheng and lienert 2017 the weights were selected by a panel of six experts in the field of urban water and wastewater management from both academia and regulatory authorities in the uk the weight assignment task was performed by this panel based on the defined future conditions and uncertainties described for each future scenario in the uk each panel member individually assigned weights to different indicators based on their expertise opinions and preferences the weight of each objective was next determined as the arithmetic mean of the weights assigned by all experts for that particular objective the result was then discussed within the panel and all panel members agreed to proceed with the calculated mean weights without applying any changes 3 4 adaptation thresholds adaptation thresholds are defined as a representation of organizational regulatory or personal views potentially any objective or combination of objectives could be used to set an adaptation threshold haasnoot et al 2013 for example an economic threshold that reflects the willingness to pay for avoided impacts or environmental thresholds that represent the acceptable level of environmental damage poff et al 2016 in this study the following objectives are used individually and conjunctively to set adaptation thresholds in the future scenarios 1 sewer flooding 2 river flooding and 3 combined sewer overflow csos reliability thresholds are defined as percentage of time free of failure whereas resilience thresholds are presented as duration weighted magnitudes of failure sustainability thresholds are shown as magnitude of failure associated with economic damage due to flooding and aesthetic health effects of csos the values in table 4 are based on the baseline performance of the iuwws in the year 2015 as described in casal campos et al 2015 each adaptation objective refers to its threshold in terms of the reliability resilience and sustainability indicators discussed in section 3 3 these are considered the main objectives in the context of urban drainage planning in the uk shaffer et al 2010 stovin et al 2013 although it is noteworthy that adaptation thresholds could change over time carpenter et al 2006 the adaptation thresholds assume that the performance of the iuwws in 2015 the baseline performance is an acceptable level of performance for the future in reality adaptation thresholds should be set according to changing circumstances e g ecological economic or social and management shifts as new information and views become available carpenter et al 2006 for simplicity in presenting the method the adaptation thresholds have been maintained constant across future scenarios from 2015 to 2050 4 results and discussion the performance domains for each strategy were first identified for reliability resilience and sustainability individually using single and multiple adaptation thresholds the domains were then overlapped to recognize the multiple domain of reliable resilient and sustainable performance for the adaptation thresholds individually and mutually table 5 categorises the results based on adaptation thresholds against reliability resilience and sustainability the table also signposts all the result figures whether they are presented in the paper or in the si here an example of the results on individual domain using a single adaptation threshold is presented see section 4 1 then the results on the multiple domains of transient scenarios will be discussed see sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 1 individual domains for single adaptation threshold in this section the resilience domains for sewer flooding fig 4 and for csos fig 5 are presented and discussed as examples of the results on the individual domains for single thresholds the results for the other domains are illustrated in the si see table 5 for the caption number of each figure the compliant domain of each strategy in the ap approach is shown as a two dimensional space illustrating 1 the time periods when a strategy is expected to fulfil a a set of adaptation threshold s before it requires further adaptation and 2 the color coded regret indices see figs 4 and 5 of that strategy for each scenario and epoch 5 year tiles as shown in fig 4 the h4 strategy the combination of rain gardens for roofs scr and sewer rehabilitation cs illustrated greener shades compared to the other alternatives this means that this strategy has the largest satisfactory resilience domain concerning sewer flooding improved sewer capacity and a new storage tank cst and cs also show an ample domain of satisfactory performance however the resilience indices obtained across objectives are more regretful i e lighter green and yellow shades than those of h4 i e green shades it can also be seen that cs is less resilient i e more regretful in the domain of resilience than cst as the tiles presenting the cs strategy are yellower throughout the domain both rain gardens for roofs scr and sewer separation ss lead to less compliant domains for scr s compliance is interrupted in two scenarios markets and austerity but still showing less regretful performance although ss s compliance is interrupted in the austerity scenario it generally presents high regrets throughout i e yellow shades from the results shown in fig 4 different decision makers can select different adaptation pathways pertaining to their beliefs and views haasnoot et al 2013 for example an environmentalist or a drainage engineer might construct a pathway of strategies that would have the lowest impacts on sewer flooding in such a case sewer rehabilitation cs may be initially implemented to ensure compliance with the adaptation threshold sewer flooding however its regret indices are relatively high consequently if necessary based on the future conditions it would be possible to switch to the lower regret cst strategy cs plus a new storage tank to accommodate for new future conditions fig 5 illustrates the resilience domains for the adaptation threshold of csos again h4 cst and ss outperform the other strategies across scenarios and epochs cs however does not perform well for the csos adaptation threshold when compared to the sewer flooding threshold there are many non compliant epochs i e interrupted pathways under three scenarios namely markets austerity and innovation comparing figs 4 and 5 it can be seen that sewer flooding is more restrictive as a threshold because it causes more interruption in the pathways of transient scenarios and consequently the reduction of the compliant domains across strategies the most restrictive threshold in this study is found to be river flooding see fig s4 in the si where only two strategies have potential to achieve compliance for the lifestyles innovations and austerity scenarios 1 the stand alone implementation of rain gardens for roofs scr for the lifestyles scenario and 2 its combination with sewer rehabilitation h4 the results concerning sewer flooding fig 4 show three strategies d n scc and ot without any compliant epochs i e all in grey colour whereas five strategies d n scc ot ss cs and h3 did not show compliant domains for any transient scenario regarding the river flooding threshold see fig s4 in the si conversely the results concerning resilience domains for the csos adaptation threshold illustrate that all strategies presented compliant domains for at least in three epochs fig 5 4 2 multiple domains of transient scenarios for two adaptation thresholds the compliant domains are jointly analysed to identify those resulting in mutually conjunctively satisfactory reliability resilience and sustainability for each set of adaptation thresholds as explained in section 4 1 river flooding is found to be the most restrictive threshold therefore in this section performance domains for resilience and sustainability are aggregated for sewer flooding and cso objectives see fig 6 the results for the multiple domain of reliability resilience and sustainability are shown in fig 7 other domain combinations are presented in the si section s6 the coloured shades see fig 6 representing performance regret for multiple objectives are determined as the average of resilience and sustainability indices for each epoch within each scenario h4 outperforms the other strategies in all the four scenarios scr ss and h2 also have un interrupted pathways in the innovation and lifestyles scenarios scr is less regrettable than the ss and h2 as it has greener shades compared to the other two the most noticeable difference in the results shown in figs 6 and 7 is that the satisfactory domain for the most compliant strategies scr ss h2 h4 and cst regarding resilience and sustainability thresholds fig 6 is superior to the satisfactory domain regarding reliability resilience and sustainability thresholds fig 7 most strategies are affected by a deterioration of their regret indices when the reliability adaptation threshold is removed from the assessment fig 6 and the si sections 5 and 6 this effect is more obvious for grey infrastructure strategies ss cst and cs as these alternatives are generally favoured by reliability assessments due to their focus on failure frequency and omission of failure magnitude and duration the details on the domain multiple compliance and regret indices are presented in the si sections s6 and s7 respectively given the domains presented in figs 6 and 7 several strategies could be combined to comply with adaptation thresholds while allowing for flexibility and delaying decisions until future conditions are more certain formation and selection of different pathways for example the h4 strategy rain gardens and sewer expansion could be implemented for the first two epochs until 2025 to ensure compliance and if future conditions are similar to those in the innovation and lifestyles scenarios then continue with scr alone i e stopping the expansion of sewers and requiring less investment effort alternatively sewer separation ss could initially be implemented with additional measures to comply within austerity and then responsible parties could wait for future conditions to unfold in order to shift to the lower regret h2 strategy i e slow down the implementation of separate sewers and intensify that of rain gardens for roofs in half of residential areas the compatibility of strategies could be improved by increasing lead times and implementation rates as required by the adaptation thresholds more strategies and adaptation thresholds can be incorporated as information becomes available and conditions change such a process would improve the potential consideration of combined strategies and the flexibility of investment in the decision making process 4 3 multiple domains of transient scenarios for three adaptation thresholds the addition of river flooding adaptation thresholds for reliability resilience and sustainability to the assessment fig 8 shows that this adaptation threshold has a limiting effect in the compliant domain for all the strategies in particular those involving grey infrastructure interventions have a detrimental effect in increasing risk of flooding in downstream sections of the river this can also be seen in the results of both individual and multiple domains for the single adaptation threshold of river flooding fig s3 fig s6 fig s9 and fig s12 in the si fig 8 illustrates that scr and h4 strategies are again the most viable options for compliance along the scenarios although with very limited compliance if future conditions move away from the most lenient conditions for these alternatives i e lifestyles the consideration of resilience and sustainability alone for the three adaptation thresholds see fig s30 in the si ensures the compliance of these strategies along the lifestyles scenario however any of the remaining scenarios is continuously disrupted failing to comply after 2025 similar to the results shown in fig 8 the reliable resilient sustainable and resilient sustainable regret indices shown in fig 8 and fig s30 respectively suggest that scr and h4 could provide additional benefits associated with a larger set of objectives to the iuwws given the low regret of their sustainability indices these additional benefits are particularly important in the sustainability assessment as a larger number of objectives and trade offs are involved given these integrated assessments of performance the implementation of rain gardens scr for roof runoff infiltration and its combinations with other alternatives e g sewer rehabilitation in h4 or separate sewers in h2 are the most promising options in order to comply with adaptation thresholds while providing lower regrets along the timeline this performance is substantially improved compared to that of stand alone grey infrastructure strategies which could potentially provide an acceptable level of compliance regarding water quantity objectives at the cost of increased regrets associated with additional objectives along the timeline reducing the adaptability of the iuwws to changing adaptation thresholds and increasing the likelihood of lock in or maladaptation within the scenarios 4 4 adaptation pathways and robustness the attribute of robustness as defined in casal campos et al 2018 i e low regrets across scenarios is not a definitive characteristic to ensure compliance with adaptation thresholds for reliability resilience and sustainability along the planning timeline however robustness may facilitate adaptation as thresholds shift and additional or alternative objectives are introduced to redefine our views on reliability resilience and sustainability in the future in this sense there is a tension between adapting to short term issues in the iuwws e g flooding csos and avoiding maladaptation when increasing the capacity to adapt to future needs and challenges that may emerge in the long term for example in fig 7 cst is compliant with the conditions up until the year 2025 for three future scenarios but for the epochs after that other strategies ss h2 or h4 should be considered the compliant domains described in this study extend the concept of robustness by i considering the performance of each strategy relative to the others i e regret across scenario epochs ii introducing the dynamic assessment of robustness along transient scenarios robustness understood as the capacity to maintain low regrets as scenario conditions develop and iii identifying the ability of a strategy to satisfy a set of adaptation thresholds along time and across scenarios i e to maximize the compliant domain regardless of future conditions or even as adaptation thresholds change in this sense this study contributes to a growing body of knowledge concerned with the robustness of urban drainage options in the face of future uncertainty both short and long terms and sheds light into the existing relationships between the qualities of reliability resilience and sustainability in the iuwws 5 conclusions this paper presented a novel adaptation pathways approach for the dynamic assessment of green grey and hybrid strategies for urban wastewater management in the long term the approach first identifies the compliance of the strategies with three adaptation thresholds i e regarding sewer flooding river flooding and cso spills across four future scenarios and then establishes the compliant domain for each strategy the adaptability potential is measured using regret indices for reliability resilience and sustainability which are calculated by the weighted aggregation of regrets for various performance indicators from water quantity water quality and other social economic and environmental aspects the key findings of this study are summarised below this new approach is able to identify adaption pathways under deep uncertainties allowing for more flexibility and avoiding long term commitment to strategies that may cause maladaptation delayed or staged investments can also be incorporated into such pathways to maximize their compliance and adaptability green strategies outperform grey strategies in balancing near term and long term needs for reliability resilience and sustainability as they are able to comply with adaptation thresholds while keeping low regrets across the compliant domains grey strategies are compliant with the considered thresholds but cast doubts regarding their adaptability to changing circumstances regardless of the context the proposed hybrid strategies are shown more feasible and achievable compared to the stand alone individual strategies this is due to the fact that the robustness of grey strategies regarding reliability resilience and sustainability is enhanced using green strategies with low regret values one key strength of the proposed adaptation pathways approach is its scalability in other words it can easily be applied to other contexts or case studies in the water sector although the current and future conditions can vary in different parts of the world the proposed approach could be applicable to any regions and catchments considering varying values of parameters objectives and indicator weights the present study has focused on dynamic adaptation strategies considering a fixed set of performance thresholds future research would benefit from including uncertainties associated with the concept of compliance and the possibility of adaptation thresholds changing in the future i e changing perceptions and values that influence these thresholds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

17818,emerging threats such as climate change and urbanisation pose an unprecedented challenge to the integrated management of urban wastewater systems which are expected to function in a reliable resilient and sustainable manner regardless of future conditions traditional long term planning is rather limited in developing no regret strategies that avoid maladaptive lock ins in the near term and allow for flexibility in the long term in this study a novel adaptation pathways approach for urban wastewater management is developed in order to explore the compliance and adaptability potential of intervention strategies in a long term operational period accounting for different future scenarios and multiple performance objectives in terms of reliability resilience and sustainability this multi criteria multi scenario approach implements a regret based method to assess the relative performance of two types of adaptation strategies i standalone strategies i e green or grey strategies only and ii hybrid strategies i e combined green and grey strategies a number of adaptation thresholds i e the points at which the current strategy can no longer meet defined objectives are defined to identify compliant domains i e periods of time in a future scenario when the performance of a strategy can meet the targets the results obtained from a case study illustrate the trade off between adapting to short term pressures and addressing long term challenges green strategies show the highest performance in simultaneously meeting near and long term needs while grey strategies are found less adaptable to changing circumstances in contrast hybrid strategies are effective in delivering both short term compliance and long term adaptability it is also shown that the proposed adaption pathways method can contribute to the identification of adaptation strategies that are developed as future conditions unfold allowing for more flexibility and avoiding long term commitment to strategies that may cause maladaptation this provides insights into the near term and long term planning of ensuring the reliability resilience and sustainability of integrated urban drainage systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords adaptation pathways green strategies hybrid strategies resilience sustainability urban wastewater systems 1 introduction urban wastewater management has become increasingly challenging due to deep uncertainties posed by global climate change urbanization population growth economic and technological developments and other unforeseen changing factors such as societal perspectives and preferences as such the level of service delivered by urban wastewater infrastructure in the future can deteriorate causing important system failures brugge et al 2005 offermans et al 2011 to this end there is a growing interest to manage present and future uncertainties particularly those in the form of exceptional disturbances that could lead to extremely adverse consequences maier et al 2016 pechlivanidis et al 2017 in the context of urban wastewater management emphasis has shifted towards adaptation o brien 2012 and addressing the short and long term challenges posed by deep uncertainties manocha and babovic 2018 rather than simply focusing on how change has occurred in the past fazey et al 2016 in the face of deep uncertainties and their unknown impacts and consequences it is essential to consider the indicators that can measure system performance in the future such as those of reliability resilience and sustainability the reliability of a system is measured under design conditions whereas resilience measures the system performance under extreme conditions when the required level of service is not achieved butler et al 2017 sustainability measures system performance from economic environmental and socio cultural consequences over the life span although these three concepts measure different aspects of system performance butler et al 2017 they are interconnected to each other blockley et al 2012 it has been suggested that reliability is necessary but not sufficient for resilience and resilience is necessary but not sufficient for sustainability butler et al 2014 there is a lack of understanding regarding the long term and short term impacts of adaptation strategies on the system performance in terms of reliability resilience and sustainability the understanding is critical to avoid maladaptive lock ins reduce potential regrets and allow flexibility as conditions change over time maru and stafford smith 2014 such a course of action allows decision makers to consider a strategy limited in time and resources and therefore rectify if needed whilst still permitting them to foresee the possible long term consequences of specific adaptation pathways dessai and van der sluijs 2007 tanaka et al 2015 in recent years several planning methods and policy making approaches within the field of water and wastewater management have been developed to dynamically respond to changing circumstances and deep uncertainties manocha and babovic 2017 van veelen et al 2015 including robust decision making casal

without any maladaptive lock ins an adaptation pathway provides a visual representation of the potential sequencing and type of actions to be implemented or strategies to be considered in the future kingsborough et al 2016 the core of ap approaches lies in adaptation thresholds or tipping points which are defined as the points where changing conditions force a normally stable state of a system into another state or facilitate adaptation of the system van veelen et al 2015 these methods take system vulnerabilities as the initial point to identify a range of adaptation options jeuken et al 2015 such approaches have mainly been used within the fields of stormwater management and flood risk management for example barnett et al 2014 bloemen et al 2018 haasnoot et al 2019 2013 kwadijk et al 2010 manocha and babovic 2017 ranger et al 2013 van veelen et al 2015 werners et al 2013 a number of studies have applied adaptation pathway methods for long term planning of urban water supply systems cradock henry et al 2020 forsythe et al 2018 haasnoot et al 2012 kingsborough et al 2016 some of these approaches need to be reoriented towards resilience assessment juan garcía et al 2017 and to consider both short and long term adaptation planning hecht and kirshen 2019 according to gersonius et al 2013 some of these approaches may fail in reliably addressing uncertainties and non stationarity in future drivers such as climate change this is due to the fact that they only consider one future scenario at a time and cannot identify solutions with high levels of confidence adger et al 2009 jafino et al 2019 to date aps have not been applied to iuwwss with socio economic complexities that assess reliability resilience and sustainability simultaneously the aim of this paper is therefore to develop an ap approach to assess the compliance and adaptability potential of various strategies in reliability resilience and sustainability domains both individually and conjunctively along the pathway of transient scenarios future scenarios every 5 years in an iuwws it will focus on the identification and application of adaptation strategies associated with the management of stormwater and wastewater in urban areas as to ameliorate a number of impacts and consequences used to describe system performance casal campos et al 2015 assessed the relative performance of green and grey strategies in multiple impact categories on an integrated catchment using a regret based approach casal campos et al 2018 further investigated the robustness of a number of strategies in delivering reliable resilient and sustainable wastewater services in the future although these two studies assessed the performance of strategies in the year 2050 long term they did not identify possible adaptation pathways that span from the baseline year to the future horizon in the present study a novel approach is developed for the dynamic assessment of interventions that leads to adaptive management of the iuwws in both the short and long terms the proposed approach brings the time domain to adaptation planning and identifies possible adaptation pathways based on different adaptation thresholds for individual and conjunctive performance domains of under different future scenarios defined as transient scenarios assessed every 5 years every 5 years here they are defined as epochs or transient scenarios for the period 2015 2050 section 2 provides an overview of the proposed methodology through two steps step 1 identification of compliant domains and step 2 evaluation of compliant domains via regret indices section 3 describes the case studies including definition and description of the integrated urban wastewater system future scenarios adaptation strategies and decision indicators section 4 reports the results and a wider discussion of their implications finally section 5 summarises the conclusions and implications of this study 2 methodology adaptation pathways mathematical models are developed and used in order to understand the current and future states of the wastewater system haasnoot et al 2011 there are numerous uncertainties that hinder our understanding of the system and constrict the predictive capacity of models regarding its future state asselt 2000 walker et al 2003 if future conditions happen to be different from the predicted conditions adaptation strategies may fail to deliver their expected performance mcinerney et al 2012 adaptation strategies are therefore required to respond to the new conditions when the future state unfolds manocha and babovic 2017 when the future is revealed adaptation measures need to be updated based on what is experienced and learnt therefore in order to establish a framework to manage the future a planning approach is required that consists of a strategic vision of the future kingsborough et al 2016 committing to both short term and long term plans and actions bloemen et al 2018 the approach of adaptation pathways has recently received growing attention from researchers and decision makers fazey et al 2016 and is being applied as a planning and foresight tool to help evaluate the adaptability of management strategies in both the short and the long terms adaptation pathways have several definitions and different studies examine the approach from distinctive perspectives wise et al 2014 for example leach et al 2010 defined this approach as alternative possible trajectories for knowledge intervention and change which prioritize different goals values and functions they considered temporal uncertainties in the long term future for adaptation to climate change haasnoot et al 2013 defined it as an analytical and foresight approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible strategies along the planning timeline haasnoot et al 2019 adapted their aforementioned definition to the following an approach that explores alternative sequences of investment decisions to achieve objectives over time in the context of uncertain future developments and environmental changes in this study an adaptation pathway is defined as a pathway in which a strategy or a combination of strategies is compliant with the adaptation threshold s along the planning timeline an overview of definitions for the adaptation pathways is presented in the supporting information si section s1 fig 1 illustrates a flow chart of different steps considered in the proposed ap approach highlighting the preliminary steps steps 0 1 to 0 5 and main steps steps 1 and 2 of the methodology in this study a novel ap approach is introduced to identify possible pathways the possible compliant domains in different future states along the planning timelines with respect to different adaptation thresholds step 1 section 2 1 and facilitates a detailed regret based analysis of each management strategy in the form of reliability resilience and or sustainability step 2 section 2 2 prior to the above steps the following preliminary steps should be considered specifying the water systems and identifying the variables step 0 1 section 3 identifying or defining future scenarios step 0 2 section 3 1 identifying adaptation strategies step 0 3 section 3 2 identifying the performance domains and assessment indicators criteria step 0 4 section 3 3 and defining suitable adaptation thresholds step 0 5 section 3 4 2 1 step 1 identification of compliant domains the core of the ap approach is the adaptation threshold which is defined as the condition beyond which a management strategy is no longer able to meet a defined objective or objectives across a timeline at this point alternative adaptation strategies should be considered this is similar to an adaptation tipping point the term which is normally used in the climate change community manocha and babovic 2017 renaud et al 2013 an adaptation threshold is also known as the recovery threshold i e at this point measures should be adopted to meet the objectives van veelen et al 2015 adaptation thresholds are used to identify the compliant domain of each strategy described in section 3 2 along the planning timeline further details on adaptation thresholds are discussed in section 3 4 in this study each strategy is assessed under future scenarios defined in section 3 1 at time intervals of 5 years i e epochs or transient scenarios defining a pathway that spanned from the baseline year 2015 to the future horizon 2050 the particular scenario conditions and their variation along the timeline are considered by setting 5 year assessment periods i e epochs in 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 and 2050 see fig 2 the time epoch when a strategy violates an adaptation threshold the system no longer complies with a specific objective value is referred to as its sell by date haasnoot et al 2013 i e the period when a strategy is expected to require adaptation or additional measures due to an interruption of its satisfactory performance across pathway of transient scenarios van veelen et al 2015 the assessment at the end of each epoch e g 2020 for the period 2015 2020 is assumed to be representative of the full period which may well be the case when considering for example asset investment plans in the uk or similar regulatory or planning horizons in other contexts in the proposed method the compliant domain is evaluated in two complementary ways i the number of complying epochs across the scenarios and ii whether the pathways are uninterrupted i e compliant or interrupted i e non compliant in relation to one or more adaptation thresholds across the entire timeline this is achieved by assessing the compliance of each strategy with specific adaptation thresholds in different future scenarios and epochs when an adaptation threshold is reached another strategy or measure should be considered for implementation van veelen et al 2015 for example in fig 2 strategy a is compliant along the lifestyles and innovation scenarios however the market and austerity scenarios see the description of each future scenario in section 3 1 are interrupted after 10 years and 25 years respectively therefore if future conditions resemble those of the austerity scenario for instance another adaptation strategy is required in 2040 2 2 step 2 evaluation of compliant domains via regret indices the first step of the proposed ap approach described in section 2 1 is to identify the compliant epochs and uninterrupted pathways in accordance with the adaptation thresholds the identified compliant epochs and pathways are further assessed using a regret based multi criteria analysis model that provides additional benefits and details of system performance regrets are calculated in the form of reliability r e l s f resilience r e s s f or sustainability s u s s f indices see eq 1 eq 2 and eq 3 1 r e l s f i w i f r e g r e t i s f max s r e g r e t i s r e l f for i 1 m 2 r e s s f j w j f r e g r e t j s f max s r e g r e t j s r e s f for j 1 n 3 s u s s f k w k f r e g r e t k s f max s r e g r e t k s s u s f for k 1 q where w i f w j f and w k f are the importance weights assigned by a group of water experts of the i th reliability indicator j th resilience indicator and k th sustainability indicator in future state f respectively in this study five reliability indicators m 5 five resilience indicators n 5 and eight sustainability indicators q 8 are taken into account the adaptation indicators and the assigned weights in different future scenarios are discussed in section 3 3 r e g r e t i s f r e g r e t j s f and r e g r e t k s f see eq 4 eq 5 and eq 6 represent the regret or opportunity loss of strategy s under a future state f with respect to ith jth or kth indicator respectively casal campos et al 2015 the regret of strategy s under a future state f is defined as the difference between the performance p of s for reliability objective i resilience objective j or sustainability objective k and that of the best performing strategy s for the same future scenario f and objective i j or k 4 r e g r e t i s f m a x s p i s f p i s f 5 r e g r e t j s f m a x s p j s f p j s f 6 r e g r e t k s f m a x s p k s f p k s f m a x s p s f is the best performing strategy s under future scenario f with respect to indicator i j or k p s f represents the performance of strategy s under the same future scenario and allied with the same indicator lempert et al 2006 regret index for multiple i e conjunctive or mutual performance domains i n d e x m e g reliability resilience sustainability is determined as the average of reliability resilience and sustainability indices for each epoch within each scenario eq 7 7 i n d e x m s f r e l s f r e s s f s u s s f n where n denotes the number of individual indices reliability resilience and sustainability considered concurrently for this assessment if a strategy s regret is one i e full regret in any transient scenario being therefore the worst performing solution for all category objectives then the strategy is defined as non compliant for that transient scenario regardless of compliance with the adaptation threshold as described in section 3 4 that transient scenario is added to those epochs that do not comply with the adaptation threshold in a grey shade in fig 2 this means that if a regret index of a strategy is 0 99 the strategy is still compliant for transient scenario but the level of reliability resilient and or sustainability is very low in fig 2 coloured shades refer to different levels of regret expressed by reliability resilience or sustainability indices for each transient scenario for example in fig 2 strategy a in the innovation scenario for the epoch between 2025 and 2030 in green colour performs well and is highly reliable resilient and or sustainable as the level of regret is very low or nearly zero whereas this strategy does not perform well under the austerity scenario from 2045 to 2050 the epoch is in orange colour meaning the regret index is high i e not very reliable resilient and or sustainable if there are more than one performance domain and or one adaptation threshold which is the case in the current study the domains for each strategy need to be first identified for reliability resilience and sustainability thresholds individually for single and multiple thresholds the domains will then be overlapped to recognize the multiple domain of reliable resilient and sustainable performance for the adaptation thresholds individually and mutually the overlapping process is done using the mathematical intersection where a multiple domain of x y the intersection of x and y is formed of the epochs compliant in both x and y see fig 3 this can also be calculated by the union of x y where x and y denote the non compliant epochs of x and y respectively the identified compliant domains will then be further analysed by the regret indices relative to the strategies in terms of reliability resilience and or sustainability regret one of the main benefits of the ap approach is that it takes a step further in operationalizing multi objective criteria planning which would be crucial in the future as adaptation thresholds change overtime and require improved performance for example planning for multi functionality to incorporate ecosystem services hansen and pauleit 2014 the method can also help to balance between addressing current pressing issues in the iuwws and increasing the capacity to adapt to future needs and challenges that may emerge in the long term 3 case study overview the integrated urban wastewater system iuwws has been used as a case study to test the previously described approach this hypothetical iuwws consists of three subsystems casal campos et al 2015 fu et al 2008 1 an urban watershed with a combined sewer system this consists of 15 urban sub watersheds with a total area of 758 9 ha and a population of 181 000 inhabitants 2 a wastewater treatment plant wwtp with a conventional activated sludge process casp and average dry weather flow dwf of 377 1 l s and 3 an urban river with the mean flow rate mfr of 129 600 m3 d the catchment is modelled using simba 6 0 ifak 2007 a simulation tool that allows users to create and develop specific modelling modules tailored to the requirements of their project further details on the iuwws and the simulation tool can be found in the si in the s1 section of casal campos et al 2015 and in the s1 section of casal campos et al 2018 3 1 future scenarios the uncertain nature of threats affecting the performance of the iuwws in the future requires exploration of internal and external driving forces that may cause significant physical or social changes the equiprobable socio economic scenarios considered in this study are characterized by two main drivers namely governance economic growth vs environmental awareness and values consumerism vs conservationism casal campos et al 2018 based on these drivers four future scenarios are considered to assess the reliability resilience and sustainability of the iuwws in the planning timeline between 2015 and 2050 under various conditions 1 markets 2 innovation 3 austerity and 4 lifestyles the general description of each future scenario is illustrated in table 1 each of the above future scenarios is characterized by four key scenario factors associated with the management of the iuwws namely regulation i e level of regulatory control of stormwater and wastewater management activities centralized maintenance i e the level of activity in each scenario aimed at preserving and caring the existing wastewater infrastructure public attitudes i e public willingness towards the decentralization of responsibilities concerning urban drainage and technology i e the level of technological development occurring under each scenario casal campos et al 2015 the future scenarios differ from one another with respect to nine parameters variables indicative of various iuwws uncertain conditions 1 misconnections l s 2 urban creep ha 3 water use l head day 4 infiltration l s 5 siltation 6 population inhabitants 7 precipitation uplift 8 impervious area in new developments ha and 9 acceptability preference the selected parameters address main issues relevant to the management of stormwater and wastewater in the context of uk sewer systems which have been investigated in the past and can therefore be assigned with reasonable estimates in the year 2050 casal campos et al 2018 the description of each parameter and their values in different scenarios are provided in the si section s2 further details about the narratives of the future scenarios modeling of scenario parameters definitions of uncertainties future scenarios and literature estimates of uncertain future threats parameters can be found in section 2 2 and in the si section s2 of casal campos et al 2015 and in the si section s2 of casal campos et al 2018 the allocation of specific estimates from the literature to each scenario was carried out through the following three steps 1 associating internal threats with key scenario factors 2 estimating the relative strength of threats under each scenario 3 allocating threat estimates to each scenario for simplicity it is assumed that all scenario parameters vary linearly along the 2015 2050 timeline until they reach the levels defined for the year 2050 the implementation of each strategy along the timeline is also assumed to occur in a linear fashion so that each 5 year epoch represents the lead time required to implement the proportional fraction of each strategy to achieve completion in 2050 3 2 adaptation strategies various adaptation strategies are considered to investigate their effects on two types of urban areas in the catchment 1 the existing baseline area the original urban area presented in casal campos et al 2015 and 2 the new development area occurring as a consequence of urbanization due to population growth in the catchment under future scenarios in this context strategies only implemented in the baseline area are defined as retrofit strategies casal campos et al 2018 as opposed to those strategies which are implemented in new developments or those that serve both area types e g rehabilitation of the combined sewer network to this end adaptation strategies are divided into the following two categories stand alone section 3 2 1 and hybrid strategies section 3 2 2 3 2 1 stand alone strategies stand alone strategies can be categorized into three groups a green strategies 1 source control of pavements scp stores and infiltrate half of road runoff through retrofit bio retention planters 2 source control of roofs scr strategy disconnects roof downspouts into retrofitted rain gardens and 3 source control of urban creep scc strategy mitigates the effects of urban creep the term urban creep is used in the uk to describe the gradual loss of permeable area to impermeable area in the urban environment casal campos et al 2015 by using permeable pavement in residential driveways b grey strategies 1 separation of combined sewers ss separates the existing combined sewer system by retrofitting storm sewers 2 rehabilitation of combined sewer infrastructure with a new storage tank cst rehabilitates the existing combined sewer pipes without a new storage tank 3 rehabilitation of combined sewer infrastructure cs rehabilitates the existing combined sewer pipes but does not include a new storage tank and 4 on site treatment ot is considered for wastewater treatment and disposal of half of new developments c do nothing d n is considered to estimate the impacts of future scenario conditions without any interventions and is regarded as a base case for comparison 3 2 2 hybrid strategies in this study four hybrid strategies are considered each developed as a combination of two original stand alone strategies out of the four 1 roof disconnection scr 2 sewer separation ss 3 on site wastewater treatment ot and 4 rehabilitation of combined sewers in the network cs table 2 shows the hybrid solutions by integration of stand alone fractions the first three stand alone strategies scr ss and ot are selected as representative for retrofit decentralized retrofit centralized and new development solutions respectively casal campos et al 2018 the scr strategy is used as the reference to define hybrid options mainly due to the results reported in the literature that scr strategy shows the most promising stand alone performance casal campos et al 2015 for each hybrid solution two stand alone strategies were combined so that the resulting solution removes an annual volume of stormwater and wastewater equivalent to that of runoff removed by scr from the system the only hybrid strategy that does not consist of scr is h3 representing 20 sewer separation in the existing catchment ss and 31 5 of new developments ot the assumptions made in table 2 are in accordance with common practice in the uk and based on what has been proposed in casal campos et al 2018 2015 the main design considerations for hybrid strategies are presented in the si section s4 3 3 reliability resilience and sustainability indicators the level of reliability resilience and sustainability of each adaptation strategy is assessed by the regret based model described in section 2 2 using objectives and indicators presented in table s3 in the si these are the key objectives or criteria considered by the uk water industry to make strategic decisions for improving urban wastewater infrastructure and the levels of service these objectives characterise the concepts of reliability resilience and sustainability through impacts and consequences occurring as a result of system failure the operational side of failure i e reliability and resilience was therefore represented by impacts for example flooding probability duration or magnitude affecting these performance objectives whereas the strategic side i e sustainability was covered by the wider consequences of failure to society the environment and the economy for example material or environmental damage it is noteworthy that weights shown in table 3 are assigned to each objective by scenario so that these reflect the relevance of each objective under a specific world view the importance of the objective is irrespective of the metric that it is used in each case whether resilience reliability or sustainability as a consequence the numerator of the weight relative importance within each scenario for each objective remains the same for reliability resilience sustainability the only difference is the amount of objectives taken into account in each case five for reliability and resilience and eight for sustainability as mentioned in section 2 2 there are weights associated with objectives indicators table 3 which are calculated using the method of swing weighting the swing weighting approach allows decision makers to assess weights by swinging the value measure from its worst to its best level parnell and trainor 2009 the swing weighting approach allows allocation of the relative preference of criteria as well as incorporating an evaluation of their importance in the context of the decision dclg 2009 zheng and lienert 2017 the weights were selected by a panel of six experts in the field of urban water and wastewater management from both academia and regulatory authorities in the uk the weight assignment task was performed by this panel based on the defined future conditions and uncertainties described for each future scenario in the uk each panel member individually assigned weights to different indicators based on their expertise opinions and preferences the weight of each objective was next determined as the arithmetic mean of the weights assigned by all experts for that particular objective the result was then discussed within the panel and all panel members agreed to proceed with the calculated mean weights without applying any changes 3 4 adaptation thresholds adaptation thresholds are defined as a representation of organizational regulatory or personal views potentially any objective or combination of objectives could be used to set an adaptation threshold haasnoot et al 2013 for example an economic threshold that reflects the willingness to pay for avoided impacts or environmental thresholds that represent the acceptable level of environmental damage poff et al 2016 in this study the following objectives are used individually and conjunctively to set adaptation thresholds in the future scenarios 1 sewer flooding 2 river flooding and 3 combined sewer overflow csos reliability thresholds are defined as percentage of time free of failure whereas resilience thresholds are presented as duration weighted magnitudes of failure sustainability thresholds are shown as magnitude of failure associated with economic damage due to flooding and aesthetic health effects of csos the values in table 4 are based on the baseline performance of the iuwws in the year 2015 as described in casal campos et al 2015 each adaptation objective refers to its threshold in terms of the reliability resilience and sustainability indicators discussed in section 3 3 these are considered the main objectives in the context of urban drainage planning in the uk shaffer et al 2010 stovin et al 2013 although it is noteworthy that adaptation thresholds could change over time carpenter et al 2006 the adaptation thresholds assume that the performance of the iuwws in 2015 the baseline performance is an acceptable level of performance for the future in reality adaptation thresholds should be set according to changing circumstances e g ecological economic or social and management shifts as new information and views become available carpenter et al 2006 for simplicity in presenting the method the adaptation thresholds have been maintained constant across future scenarios from 2015 to 2050 4 results and discussion the performance domains for each strategy were first identified for reliability resilience and sustainability individually using single and multiple adaptation thresholds the domains were then overlapped to recognize the multiple domain of reliable resilient and sustainable performance for the adaptation thresholds individually and mutually table 5 categorises the results based on adaptation thresholds against reliability resilience and sustainability the table also signposts all the result figures whether they are presented in the paper or in the si here an example of the results on individual domain using a single adaptation threshold is presented see section 4 1 then the results on the multiple domains of transient scenarios will be discussed see sections 4 2 and 4 3 4 1 individual domains for single adaptation threshold in this section the resilience domains for sewer flooding fig 4 and for csos fig 5 are presented and discussed as examples of the results on the individual domains for single thresholds the results for the other domains are illustrated in the si see table 5 for the caption number of each figure the compliant domain of each strategy in the ap approach is shown as a two dimensional space illustrating 1 the time periods when a strategy is expected to fulfil a a set of adaptation threshold s before it requires further adaptation and 2 the color coded regret indices see figs 4 and 5 of that strategy for each scenario and epoch 5 year tiles as shown in fig 4 the h4 strategy the combination of rain gardens for roofs scr and sewer rehabilitation cs illustrated greener shades compared to the other alternatives this means that this strategy has the largest satisfactory resilience domain concerning sewer flooding improved sewer capacity and a new storage tank cst and cs also show an ample domain of satisfactory performance however the resilience indices obtained across objectives are more regretful i e lighter green and yellow shades than those of h4 i e green shades it can also be seen that cs is less resilient i e more regretful in the domain of resilience than cst as the tiles presenting the cs strategy are yellower throughout the domain both rain gardens for roofs scr and sewer separation ss lead to less compliant domains for scr s compliance is interrupted in two scenarios markets and austerity but still showing less regretful performance although ss s compliance is interrupted in the austerity scenario it generally presents high regrets throughout i e yellow shades from the results shown in fig 4 different decision makers can select different adaptation pathways pertaining to their beliefs and views haasnoot et al 2013 for example an environmentalist or a drainage engineer might construct a pathway of strategies that would have the lowest impacts on sewer flooding in such a case sewer rehabilitation cs may be initially implemented to ensure compliance with the adaptation threshold sewer flooding however its regret indices are relatively high consequently if necessary based on the future conditions it would be possible to switch to the lower regret cst strategy cs plus a new storage tank to accommodate for new future conditions fig 5 illustrates the resilience domains for the adaptation threshold of csos again h4 cst and ss outperform the other strategies across scenarios and epochs cs however does not perform well for the csos adaptation threshold when compared to the sewer flooding threshold there are many non compliant epochs i e interrupted pathways under three scenarios namely markets austerity and innovation comparing figs 4 and 5 it can be seen that sewer flooding is more restrictive as a threshold because it causes more interruption in the pathways of transient scenarios and consequently the reduction of the compliant domains across strategies the most restrictive threshold in this study is found to be river flooding see fig s4 in the si where only two strategies have potential to achieve compliance for the lifestyles innovations and austerity scenarios 1 the stand alone implementation of rain gardens for roofs scr for the lifestyles scenario and 2 its combination with sewer rehabilitation h4 the results concerning sewer flooding fig 4 show three strategies d n scc and ot without any compliant epochs i e all in grey colour whereas five strategies d n scc ot ss cs and h3 did not show compliant domains for any transient scenario regarding the river flooding threshold see fig s4 in the si conversely the results concerning resilience domains for the csos adaptation threshold illustrate that all strategies presented compliant domains for at least in three epochs fig 5 4 2 multiple domains of transient scenarios for two adaptation thresholds the compliant domains are jointly analysed to identify those resulting in mutually conjunctively satisfactory reliability resilience and sustainability for each set of adaptation thresholds as explained in section 4 1 river flooding is found to be the most restrictive threshold therefore in this section performance domains for resilience and sustainability are aggregated for sewer flooding and cso objectives see fig 6 the results for the multiple domain of reliability resilience and sustainability are shown in fig 7 other domain combinations are presented in the si section s6 the coloured shades see fig 6 representing performance regret for multiple objectives are determined as the average of resilience and sustainability indices for each epoch within each scenario h4 outperforms the other strategies in all the four scenarios scr ss and h2 also have un interrupted pathways in the innovation and lifestyles scenarios scr is less regrettable than the ss and h2 as it has greener shades compared to the other two the most noticeable difference in the results shown in figs 6 and 7 is that the satisfactory domain for the most compliant strategies scr ss h2 h4 and cst regarding resilience and sustainability thresholds fig 6 is superior to the satisfactory domain regarding reliability resilience and sustainability thresholds fig 7 most strategies are affected by a deterioration of their regret indices when the reliability adaptation threshold is removed from the assessment fig 6 and the si sections 5 and 6 this effect is more obvious for grey infrastructure strategies ss cst and cs as these alternatives are generally favoured by reliability assessments due to their focus on failure frequency and omission of failure magnitude and duration the details on the domain multiple compliance and regret indices are presented in the si sections s6 and s7 respectively given the domains presented in figs 6 and 7 several strategies could be combined to comply with adaptation thresholds while allowing for flexibility and delaying decisions until future conditions are more certain formation and selection of different pathways for example the h4 strategy rain gardens and sewer expansion could be implemented for the first two epochs until 2025 to ensure compliance and if future conditions are similar to those in the innovation and lifestyles scenarios then continue with scr alone i e stopping the expansion of sewers and requiring less investment effort alternatively sewer separation ss could initially be implemented with additional measures to comply within austerity and then responsible parties could wait for future conditions to unfold in order to shift to the lower regret h2 strategy i e slow down the implementation of separate sewers and intensify that of rain gardens for roofs in half of residential areas the compatibility of strategies could be improved by increasing lead times and implementation rates as required by the adaptation thresholds more strategies and adaptation thresholds can be incorporated as information becomes available and conditions change such a process would improve the potential consideration of combined strategies and the flexibility of investment in the decision making process 4 3 multiple domains of transient scenarios for three adaptation thresholds the addition of river flooding adaptation thresholds for reliability resilience and sustainability to the assessment fig 8 shows that this adaptation threshold has a limiting effect in the compliant domain for all the strategies in particular those involving grey infrastructure interventions have a detrimental effect in increasing risk of flooding in downstream sections of the river this can also be seen in the results of both individual and multiple domains for the single adaptation threshold of river flooding fig s3 fig s6 fig s9 and fig s12 in the si fig 8 illustrates that scr and h4 strategies are again the most viable options for compliance along the scenarios although with very limited compliance if future conditions move away from the most lenient conditions for these alternatives i e lifestyles the consideration of resilience and sustainability alone for the three adaptation thresholds see fig s30 in the si ensures the compliance of these strategies along the lifestyles scenario however any of the remaining scenarios is continuously disrupted failing to comply after 2025 similar to the results shown in fig 8 the reliable resilient sustainable and resilient sustainable regret indices shown in fig 8 and fig s30 respectively suggest that scr and h4 could provide additional benefits associated with a larger set of objectives to the iuwws given the low regret of their sustainability indices these additional benefits are particularly important in the sustainability assessment as a larger number of objectives and trade offs are involved given these integrated assessments of performance the implementation of rain gardens scr for roof runoff infiltration and its combinations with other alternatives e g sewer rehabilitation in h4 or separate sewers in h2 are the most promising options in order to comply with adaptation thresholds while providing lower regrets along the timeline this performance is substantially improved compared to that of stand alone grey infrastructure strategies which could potentially provide an acceptable level of compliance regarding water quantity objectives at the cost of increased regrets associated with additional objectives along the timeline reducing the adaptability of the iuwws to changing adaptation thresholds and increasing the likelihood of lock in or maladaptation within the scenarios 4 4 adaptation pathways and robustness the attribute of robustness as defined in casal campos et al 2018 i e low regrets across scenarios is not a definitive characteristic to ensure compliance with adaptation thresholds for reliability resilience and sustainability along the planning timeline however robustness may facilitate adaptation as thresholds shift and additional or alternative objectives are introduced to redefine our views on reliability resilience and sustainability in the future in this sense there is a tension between adapting to short term issues in the iuwws e g flooding csos and avoiding maladaptation when increasing the capacity to adapt to future needs and challenges that may emerge in the long term for example in fig 7 cst is compliant with the conditions up until the year 2025 for three future scenarios but for the epochs after that other strategies ss h2 or h4 should be considered the compliant domains described in this study extend the concept of robustness by i considering the performance of each strategy relative to the others i e regret across scenario epochs ii introducing the dynamic assessment of robustness along transient scenarios robustness understood as the capacity to maintain low regrets as scenario conditions develop and iii identifying the ability of a strategy to satisfy a set of adaptation thresholds along time and across scenarios i e to maximize the compliant domain regardless of future conditions or even as adaptation thresholds change in this sense this study contributes to a growing body of knowledge concerned with the robustness of urban drainage options in the face of future uncertainty both short and long terms and sheds light into the existing relationships between the qualities of reliability resilience and sustainability in the iuwws 5 conclusions this paper presented a novel adaptation pathways approach for the dynamic assessment of green grey and hybrid strategies for urban wastewater management in the long term the approach first identifies the compliance of the strategies with three adaptation thresholds i e regarding sewer flooding river flooding and cso spills across four future scenarios and then establishes the compliant domain for each strategy the adaptability potential is measured using regret indices for reliability resilience and sustainability which are calculated by the weighted aggregation of regrets for various performance indicators from water quantity water quality and other social economic and environmental aspects the key findings of this study are summarised below this new approach is able to identify adaption pathways under deep uncertainties allowing for more flexibility and avoiding long term commitment to strategies that may cause maladaptation delayed or staged investments can also be incorporated into such pathways to maximize their compliance and adaptability green strategies outperform grey strategies in balancing near term and long term needs for reliability resilience and sustainability as they are able to comply with adaptation thresholds while keeping low regrets across the compliant domains grey strategies are compliant with the considered thresholds but cast doubts regarding their adaptability to changing circumstances regardless of the context the proposed hybrid strategies are shown more feasible and achievable compared to the stand alone individual strategies this is due to the fact that the robustness of grey strategies regarding reliability resilience and sustainability is enhanced using green strategies with low regret values one key strength of the proposed adaptation pathways approach is its scalability in other words it can easily be applied to other contexts or case studies in the water sector although the current and future conditions can vary in different parts of the world the proposed approach could be applicable to any regions and catchments considering varying values of parameters objectives and indicator weights the present study has focused on dynamic adaptation strategies considering a fixed set of performance thresholds future research would benefit from including uncertainties associated with the concept of compliance and the

17819,the development of low dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the hypolimnion of drinking water reservoirs during thermal stratification can lead to the reduction of oxidized insoluble iron fe and manganese mn in sediments to soluble forms which are then released into the water column as metals degrade drinking water quality robust measurements of metal fluxes under changing oxygen conditions are critical for optimizing water treatment in this study we conducted benthic flux chamber experiments in summer 2018 to directly quantify fe and mn fluxes at the sediment water interface under different do and redox conditions of a eutrophic drinking water reservoir with an oxygenation system falling creek reservoir vinton va usa throughout the experiments we monitored do oxidation reduction potential orp water temperature and ph in the chambers and compared the metal fluxes in the chambers with time series of fluxes calculated using a hypolimnetic mass balance method our results showed that metal fluxes were highly variable during the monitoring period and were sensitive to redox conditions in the water column at the sediment water interface the time series changes in fluxes and relationship to redox conditions are suggestive of hot moments short time periods of intense biogeochemical cycling although the metal concentrations and fluxes are specific to this site the approaches for examining relationships between metals oxygen concentrations and overall redox conditions can be applied by water utilities to improve water quality management of fe and mn graphical abstract image 1 keywords anoxia hypolimnion metals oxidation reduction redox water quality hot moments 1 introduction elevated concentrations of iron fe and manganese mn in drinking waters degrade water quality by affecting taste odor and color usepa 2003 in addition chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of mn in drinking water has been associated with adverse health impacts including neurological disorders in children bouchard et al 2007 2011 khan et al 2011 wasserman et al 2011 the u s environmental protection agency usepa has set secondary drinking water standards for fe and mn in drinking water of 0 3 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively usepa 2017 the usepa also established a health reference level of 0 3 mg l 1 for mn usepa 2003 as both fe and mn are common constituents in soils sediments and rocks they are often found in natural waters fe is commonly detected in fresh water at concentrations ranging from 0 04 to 6200 mg l 1 pais and jones 1997 mn is also commonly detected in both surface water and groundwater worldwide with median concentrations of 0 02 mg l 1 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively who 2008 due to their prevalence in natural waters fe and mn are commonly identified as parameters of concerns in public water systems awwa 2009 in freshwater bodies such as lakes and reservoirs dissolved oxygen do concentrations have a strong influence on fe and mn dynamics davison 1993 under oxic conditions do 2 mg l 1 fe and mn occur in their oxidized insoluble forms e g fe and mn oxyhydroxides in sediments however the development of anoxic do 0 5 mg l 1 conditions in the hypolimnion of many lakes and reservoirs during summer thermal stratification leads to microbial reduction of fe and mn in the sediments releasing reduced soluble forms of fe and mn into the water column brannon et al 1985 davison 1993 de vitre et al 1988 myers and nealson 1988 the high cost of treating water with elevated metal concentrations coupled with the knowledge that metals are redox sensitive has led many water utilities to install hypolimnetic oxygenation hox systems to control metal concentrations in situ in lakes and reservoirs used as drinking water supplies bryant et al 2011 gantzer et al 2009 gerling et al 2014 hox systems aim to maintain thermal stratification while adding oxygen to bottom waters beutel and horne 1999 one of the goals of hox systems is to control metal release from the sediments by introducing oxygen to the sediments and maintaining oxic hypolimnia which helps to oxidize and precipitate soluble metals that are released into the water column bryant et al 2011 preece et al 2019 however even when oxygen is added to the hypolimnion reduced metals in sediment can still diffuse upward towards the sediment water interface swi and enter the water column bryant et al 2011 at the swi which represents a redox boundary between the anoxic sediments and the oxic water column reduced fe diffusing upward is oxidized davison 1993 zaw and chiswell 1999 mn behavior in freshwaters differs from that of fe because it oxidizes more slowly and oxidation rates are controlled by ph davison 1993 thus fluxes of reduced mn into the overlying water column can persist even when the water column is oxic designing and implementing successful hox systems require information on the oxygen demand of the water column and the underlying sediments beutel 2003 bierlein et al 2017 gantzer et al 2009 gerling et al 2014 hypolimnetic oxygen demand is calculated as the rate of decrease of do concentration in the water column of the hypolimnion wetzel 2001 after thermal stratification sets up hypolimnetic oxygen demand reflects a combination of both water column and sediment oxygen demand sod adams et al 1982 sod the consumption of do in the sediments contributes to the overall hypolimnetic oxygen demand walker and snodgrass 1986 making it an important parameter when designing hox systems for example sod has been estimated to be 18 and 40 of the total hypolimnetic oxygen demand in hamilton harbour of lake ontario polak and haffner 1978 and lake erie di toro and connolly 1980 respectively design of hox systems also benefits from accurate measurement of metal fluxes from sediments to the water column adams et al 1982 as reduced metals impart an additional chemical oxygen demand metal flux measurements are used to quantify metal loads into the water column which are important for cost effective treatment in addition measurements of metal fluxes under varying oxygen conditions are useful for constraining metal processes and cycling in freshwaters and provide important inputs into water quality models the goal of this study was to quantify fe and mn fluxes across the swi of a drinking water reservoir under different redox conditions to address this objective we conducted field experiments at the reservoir using in situ benthic flux chambers to directly measure fe and mn fluxes at the swi and compared results to hypolimnetic mass balance calculations 2 methods 2 1 site description falling creek reservoir fcr fig 1 is a small zmax 9 3 m mean depth 4 m surface area 0 119 km2 volume 3 1 105 m3 at full pond eutrophic reservoir near vinton virginia usa gerling et al 2014 the reservoir is owned and operated by the western virginia water authority fcr historically exhibits thermal stratification from may to october which in the absence of hypolimnetic oxygenation leads to the development of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion gerling et al 2014 munger et al 2016 inflow from the upstream tributary is the largest surface water input 90 to the reservoir gerling et al 2016 in september 2012 a side stream supersaturation hypolimnetic oxygenation system hox was installed in fcr to increase do concentrations in the hypolimnion of the reservoir while maintaining thermal stratification see gerling et al 2014 for details on the hox system the hox system consists of a submersible pump at 8 5 m depth inlet piping an oxygen source an oxygen contact chamber and distribution headers at 8 5 m depth water is withdrawn from the reservoir via the pump transferred to the oxygen contact chamber and supersaturated with oxygen the water is then transported to the distribution headers via the outlet piping where it is injected back into the hypolimnion previous work gerling et al 2014 and continued oxygen monitoring carey et al 2019 demonstrate that during operation the hox system introduces oxygen into the hypolimnion while maintaining thermal stratification in 2018 when this study was conducted the hox system was operating at full capacity table 1 from april 24 to july 19 after july 19 the hox system operated either at reduced capacity july 19 30 august 9 september 10 or was deactivated july 30 august 9 september 10 on the reservoir exhibited fall turnover to and onset of isothermal conditions on october 21 2 2 water column sampling we collected water samples from fcr for total and soluble fe and mn concentrations weekly from may to october 2018 and monthly from november 2018 to april 2019 water samples were collected at 0 1 1 6 3 8 5 0 8 0 9 0 m depths using a 4 l van dorn sampler these depths correspond to withdrawal elevations on the water treatment outlet structure near the deepest site in fcr fig 1 unfiltered samples for analysis of operationally defined total metals were collected into 15 ml centrifuge tubes filtered samples 0 45 μm nylon membrane were collected for analysis of soluble metals munger et al 2016 we recognize that this method of filtration does not remove all particulates so use of the term soluble is operationally defined for the purposes of this study total and soluble samples for metal analysis were preserved using 0 5 ml trace metal grade nitric acid to ph 2 samples were analyzed for fe and mn concentrations using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes spectro arcos following epa method 200 7 usepa 1994 detection limits were 0 004 mg l 1 for fe and 0 001 mg l 1 for mn depth profiles were measured at 0 1 m increments twice per week from the deepest site using a seabird electronics sbe 19plus v2 high resolution profiler ctd with an sbe 43 do probe and an sbe 27 ph orp probe to measure do temperature ph conductivity and orp carey et al 2019 previous work by gerling et al 2014 supported by continued ctd data collection carey et al 2019 showed that do concentrations measured at the deepest site in the reservoir were representative of hypolimnetic conditions throughout the reservoir we used temperature data to calculate the thermocline depth which defined the upper boundary of the hypolimnion using the matlab lake analyzer program read et al 2011 2 3 sediment sampling and analysis sediment samples were collected at the sediment water interface in summer 2018 using an ekman sampler at six locations within 150 m of the location of the benthic flux chambers in the laboratory sediment samples were oven dried 95 c for 96 h to digest the samples 10 ml of trace metal grade nitric acid was added to 0 5 g of dried sediment the samples were then microwave digested cem mars express following epa method 3051a usepa 2007 we analyzed the resulting digestion solution for fe and mn using icp ms thermo electron x series powder x ray diffraction xrd was used to examine mineralogy of five of the six samples collected samples were powdered using a mortar and pestle xrd analyses were conducted using a rigaku mini flex ii desktop x ray diffractometer copper kα radiation was used with a fixed tubed output voltage of 30 kv and fixed tube output current of 15 ma xrd patterns were analyzed to match peaks to known minerals 2 4 measuring benthic fluxes metal fluxes across the swi were measured using two methods benthic flux chambers and a hypolimnetic mass balance method the flux chambers were deployed at the deepest site to make direct measurements of fe and mn fluxes and oxygen demand at the swi at two time intervals june 21 july 2 and august 13 23 the mass balance method used measurements of discharge and metal concentrations in the hypolimnion to indirectly estimate the net release of fe and mn from the sediments into the hypolimnion following the methods described by gerling et al 2016 2 4 1 benthic flux chambers to measure metal fluxes in situ at the swi benthic flux chambers similar to those described and deployed by murphy and hicks 1986 and hicks 1990 and further modified for this study were deployed in triplicate at the deepest site in fcr flux chambers capture diffusive fluxes of solutes across the swi and have been utilized to measure fluxes of oxygen nutrients and contaminants in a variety of coastal marine settings and in freshwater bodies frogner kockum et al 2016 pakhomova et al 2007 tengberg et al 2005 for this study we conducted two ten day experiments in 2018 june 21 july 2 and august 13 23 to examine the effects of different initial do conditions on metal fluxes during the june experiment hypolimnetic do concentrations were high 7 mg l 1 71 saturation during the august experiment do concentrations in the hypolimnion were substantially lower 2 mg l 1 18 saturation average temperature was 1 c higher in the hypolimnion in august than it was in june the flux chambers used for this study isolated 24 cm of hypolimnetic water above the sediments and 0 27 m2 of the swi for a total volume of 64 86 l of hypolimnetic water enclosed within the chambers for diagrams of the flux chamber see figs s1 and s2 each chamber was connected to a circulation pump which promotes circulation of the water within the chamber so that measured concentrations are representative of the entire chamber volume tengberg et al 2005 the pump was fitted with a valve and sampling tubing on the outlet to collect water samples from the chambers during the incubation period to allow for high frequency monitoring of field parameters each chamber contained an insiteig slidell la model 31 fluorescent do sensor to measure temperature and do comparison of do data collected from replicate chamber experiments indicated a mean percent difference of 2 in addition to do sensors one chamber contained two additional sensors an insiteig model m51 ph and an insiteig model m52 orp sensor slidell la all sensors were connected to a gwr master data logger gantzer water livingston tx and programmed to collect data at a 2 min interval the flux chambers were deployed from a boat by slowly lowering them through the water column to the bottom to minimize sediment disturbance once the chambers were seated on the bottom they were flushed with hypolimnion water for 90 120 min until chamber do concentrations and temperature stabilized and reflected the surrounding hypolimnetic conditions after flushing the chambers were allowed to incubate and then checked after 24 h proper sealing of the chamber was verified by analyzing the linear regression of the do data as oxygen depleted over time where an r2 of 0 99 or better indicated proper sealing if the chamber was not properly sealed which happened in one chamber the start of the august experiment we lifted the chamber off the sediments re deployed it in a nearby location and re started the flushing and incubation processes in addition to the triplicate flux chambers we also deployed one water column chamber which had the same construction specifications as the flux chambers but had a bottom plate to seal off the chamber this chamber was deployed to account for changes in metal concentrations within the water column that were not associated with fluxes across the swi this chamber was deployed for the same interval as the flux chambers in the second experiment during the two 10 day deployments we collected samples for total and soluble fe and mn every 3 4 days to sample the chamber we turned the pump on and allowed water to circulate through the chamber and tubing for 1 min we then collected 15 ml of unfiltered water for total metals analysis and an additional 15 ml of filtered 0 45 μm water for soluble metals analysis during both experiments a maximum of 100 ml of chamber water was withdrawn at each sampling event to minimize the effects of removing chamber water on the chemical diffusion gradient within the chamber the fe and mn samples were analyzed in the laboratory as described above for the depth profiles of fe and mn metal fluxes for each chamber were calculated using the following equation 1 j b v a where j is the flux of the soluble or total metal mg m 2 d 1 b is the slope of the line of best fit of the soluble or total metal concentrations mg l 1 d 1 v is the volume of the flux chamber 64 86 l and a is the surface area of the flux chamber 0 27 m2 sod was measured as the rate at which do depletes from the start of the experiment hypolimnetic conditions until do reached 0 5 mg l 1 following usepa 2015 sod for each chamber in each experiment was calculated using the following equation 2 j s o d b v a where j sod is the sod mg m 2 d 1 b is the slope of the line of best fit of the do concentrations mg l 1 d 1 v is the volume of the flux chamber 64 86 l and a is the surface area of the flux chamber 0 27 m2 2 4 2 hypolimnetic metals mass budget we calculated the hypolimnetic fe and mn budget at weekly intervals from may to october 2018 to estimate fe and mn swi fluxes using the following equation 3 d m d t q i n c i n q o u t c t h e r m j where d m d t is the change in the hypolimnetic mass mg d 1 q in is the flow rate of the primary tributary l d 1 q out is the flow rate across the thermocline c in is the concentration of metals either fe or mn in mg l 1 at the inflow sampling site c therm is concentration of metals mg l 1 at the thermocline depth and j is the estimated metal flux at the swi see fig s3 for the conceptual model of the mass balance positive values of j indicate that metals are released from the sediments into the water column negative values of j indicate that metals are removed from the water column and returned to the sediments we assumed that all water coming in from the tributary went directly to the hypolimnion because the tributary was consistently 2 c colder than the hypolimnion carey et al 2020 additionally we assumed that q in q out as there was no change in water level in the reservoir the water treatment plant did not extract any water from the reservoir during the monitoring period and shallow groundwater wells were routinely dry in summer 2018 suggesting that shallow groundwater inputs during this period were likely small to calculate the entrained metal load across the thermocline we used the metal concentration at the median depth 3 8 m s d 1 7 m range 1 6 8 m of the thermocline for 2018 because the metals budget was only for the hypolimnion we did not need to account for precipitation or evaporation inflow to the reservoir was measured using a rectangular weir with a notch width of 1 1 m installed at the primary inflow of fcr an inw aquistar pt2x pressure sensor inw kirkland wa recorded water level at the weir every 15 min which we used to calculate the flow rate into the reservoir following gerling et al 2014 4 q k l 0 2 h h 1 5 where q is the flow rate m3 min 1 k is 110 29 a unit conversion constant l is the crest length of the weir m and h is the hydraulic head water level behind the weir m gerling et al 2014 we used the data to calculate an average weekly flow for each sampling week total and soluble samples for fe and mn analysis in addition to temperature and do measurements were collected weekly at the inflow stream to yield a weekly average c in to address the uncertainty in metals inputs that occurred during unsampled storm events we also calculated fluxes assuming 50 100 and 200 increases in inflow metal concentrations to calculate d m d t we first calculated the total mass of metals in the hypolimnion using the metal concentrations in samples collected from the four depths of the hypolimnion 5 0 8 0 6 2 and 9 0 m multiplied by the layer volume of the depth from which they were sampled and then summed to find the total hypolimnetic metal mass these sampling depths have been used in previous studies to reflect hypolimnetic conditions gerling et al 2014 2016 munger et al 2016 2019 as we found that the do and temperature conditions measured at the dam sampling site were representative of upstream conditions throughout the reservoir carey et al 2019 thus although we sampled for fe and mn along one depth profile near the dam our do and temperature data along the reservoir transect support the use of this profile as representative of hypolimnion conditions throughout the reservoir in a similar fashion sod was calculated using the change of oxygen mass in the hypolimnion d m d t the volume of the hypolimnion was calculated using bathymetry data that were interpolated using kriging interpolation techniques in arcgis 10 5 1 the area of the swi was taken as the 3 d surface area of the reservoir below the median thermocline 3 8 m the layer volume was calculated as the difference between the reservoir volume at the sample depth and the reservoir volume at the sampling depth immediately below fig s3 to determine the change in metals mass each week we subtracted the hypolimnetic mass of the preceding week and then divided by 7 days the period between sampling dates to calculate the flux per unit area of the reservoir we divided the total hypolimnetic flux mg d 1 per week by the area of the swi m2 in the hypolimnion 2 4 3 statistical analysis we used the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum tests in jmp pro 14 sas institute cary nc usa to statistically compare 1 the benthic fluxes measured with the chamber to those estimated with mass balance and 2 the benthic chamber fluxes in june with those measured in august non parametric tests were needed because of the non independence of time series data and the unbalanced design there were different numbers of flux estimates between the chambers and whole reservoir mass balance as well as a different number of flux measurements collected in the june vs august chamber experiments significance was set at a p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 do orp temperature and ph conditions fcr began to thermally stratify in may 2018 and remained stratified through fall turnover in late october fig 2 the thermocline ranged from 1 6 to 8 m depth throughout the stratified period median depth 3 8 m 1 7 m 1 s d within the hypolimnion the do concentrations were influenced by both the natural conditions of thermal stratification and the operation of the hox system between late april and mid july volume weighted hypolimnetic vwh do concentrations were 4 7 0 3 mg l 1 table 1 and do near the swi was 2 mg l 1 figs 2 and 3 between july 19 and 30 vwh do concentrations decreased to 1 8 mg l 1 after july 30 vwh do decreased to 0 5 mg l 1 or lower for the rest of the stratification season until turnover table 1 similar to do orp measurements show that the water column was more oxidizing in the spring and early summer fig 2 although orp generally mimicked do patterns under oxic conditions see fig s4 when do concentrations were depleted orp generally continued to decline indicating that conditions were becoming increasingly reducing however one exception occurred in august september when the water column at the sediment water interface was fully anoxic do was close to 0 but orp values increased from 100 mv to 266 mv for two weeks early september before steadily decreasing to 0 mv on september 10 the ph in the hypolimnion remained between 6 and 7 throughout the stratification period figs 2 and 3 temperature in the hypolimnion increased during the stratification period with a peak swi temperature of 13 c on september 24 3 2 metal concentrations metal concentrations both total and soluble forms increased in the hypolimnion during the stratification period fig 4 during the early stratified period total and soluble concentrations were low 0 5 mg l 1 for fe 0 05 mg l 1 for mn but began to increase during july reaching maximum concentrations 30 9 mg l 1 for total fe and 2 7 mg l 1 for total mn at the deepest sample point 9 0 m in late august figs 4 and 5 from september 10 to turnover on october 21 fe and mn concentrations were consistently elevated in the hypolimnion and were highest at the swi in the early part of the stratification period total and soluble metal concentrations were similar however later in the season total fe was measurably greater than soluble fe figs 4 and 5 reflecting the presence of particulate fe in contrast total mn concentrations were similar to soluble mn reflecting negligible particulates metal concentrations at the swi were sensitive to orp changes for example when there was a 65 increase in swi orp in september fig 3 total and soluble fe concentrations at the swi decreased 64 and 67 respectively while swi total and soluble mn decreased by 42 fig 5 when orp subsequently declined to lower values 100 mv in september and october fe and mn concentrations at the swi increased concomitantly fig 5 sediment fe and mn concentrations in the six samples collected at the swi near the location of the flux chambers are shown in fig s5 results show that fe concentrations ranged from 42 015 to 72 060 mean 53 466 mg kg 1 dry weight and mn concentrations ranged from 347 to 897 mean 577 mg kg 1 dry weight xrd analyses confirmed the presence of quartz and muscovite but did not indicate the presence of crystalline fe or mn mineral phases data not shown 3 3 benthic flux chambers 3 3 1 metal concentrations and do orp conditions concentrations of fe in the benthic flux chambers increased steadily over time during both incubation experiments fig 6 table s1 total fe concentrations reached 14 mg l 1 in june and 27 mg l 1 in august over a 10 day incubation overall the majority 57 33 of total fe in the experimental samples was composed of soluble fe however there was considerable variation at the start of the june experiment as oxygen was depleted in the chambers less than one third 18 27 of the total fe was in soluble form but as conditions became anoxic the dominant form of total fe was soluble 80 96 during the august experiment conditions were anoxic at the start of the experiment and for most of the sampling intervals the majority of fe was in soluble form however there were several samples where 20 of the fe was soluble signifying the presence of particulate fe similar to fe mn concentrations increased linearly over the incubation period reaching a maximum of 3 4 mg l 1 in both the june and august experiments in contrast to fe all mn was present in soluble form orp values measured during the flux chamber experiments indicate reducing conditions fig 6 table s1 in the june experiment orp values started at 200 mv indicating oxidizing conditions but orp decreased rapidly within the first few days reaching 0 mv on day 4 and a low of 300 mv by the end of the experiment similarly during the august experiment orp values started at 200 mv but they decreased rapidly within the first day to negative values reaching 410 mv by the end of the incubation in both chamber experiments orp and do were correlated when do is detectable fig s6 below a do concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 the lower detection limit of the sensor orp continued to decline indicating the utility of measuring orp to yield information on redox conditions interestingly as orp decreased during the experiments it exhibited small plateaus over periods of 0 5 6 days that were often associated with sharp increases in metal concentrations temperature and ph remained between 12 and 15 c and 6 3 to 7 6 respectively throughout both experiments for all experiments the water column chamber measured negligible changes in soluble and total fe and mn concentrations table s1 suggesting that the reactions affecting metal cycling in the hypolimnion primarily occurred at the swi in addition all or nearly all oxygen demand measured in the flux chambers can be attributed to sod as the water column chamber measured a negligible oxygen demand 3 3 2 chamber metal fluxes and sod we calculated metal fluxes from the chamber experiments using the time series of metal concentrations eq 1 see data in tables s1 and s2 fe fluxes measured from the chamber experiments excluding the water column experiment ranged from 290 to 672 mg m 2 d 1 total and 255 594 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fig 7 as suggested by the wide range in measured flux values there was considerable variability between the replicates of the flux chamber experiments reflected by a coefficient of variation cv of 17 and 14 for soluble and total fe respectively in june and 3 and 6 for soluble and total fe respectively in august there was no statistical difference in total or soluble fe fluxes between the june and august experiments wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 3 0 p 0 08 table s3 mn fluxes measured from the chamber experiments excluding the water column experiment ranged from 28 to 88 mg m 2 d 1 total and 29 to 89 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fig 7 similar to fe there was variability between replicates of the flux chamber experiments for the mn measurements as reflected by the coefficient of variation cv of 30 for both total and soluble mn in the june experiments and 5 for both total and soluble in the august experiments also similar to fe there was no statistical difference in total or soluble mn fluxes between the june and august experiments wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 0 3 p 0 56 table s3 almost all the mn 98 0 04 was in soluble form do concentrations measured using flux chambers were used to calculate sod eq 2 fig 7 although the initial do concentrations between the june and august experiments were different vwh do in june and august was 8 and 2 mg l 1 respectively a comparison of the two experiments showed the rate of oxygen depletion was not statistically different wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 0 p 1 0 table s3 fluxes of total and soluble fe and mn in the chamber experiments increased as sediment oxygen demand increased i e became increasingly negative fig 7 excluding one outlier for a flux chamber during the august experiment the total and soluble fe flux vs sod data fit a polynomial quadratic equation p 0 05 table s4 the highest total and soluble fe fluxes 672 51 and 594 128 mg m 2 d 1 respectively were measured when sod was also the highest 1203 7 mg m 2 d 1 similarly excluding one outlier the total and soluble mn flux vs sod data fit a polynomial quadratic equation p 0 05 soluble and total mn fluxes were highest ranging between 35 and 37 mg m 2 d 1 for both total and soluble mn when sod was elevated greater than 450 mg m 2 d 1 fig 7 3 4 hypolimnetic mass balance 3 4 1 fe and mn loading in the early stratification period may june inflow to the reservoir was 94 higher 5 1 2 8 ml d 1 than during july september 0 32 0 44 ml d 1 fig s7 in october immediately before turnover inflow was also high 4 7 0 4 ml d 1 to the reservoir due to storms during the may june high inflow period the hypolimnion experienced high input loading of metals 0 4 0 8 kg d 1 for total mn 4 8 kg d 1 for total fe fig 8 a and b but with low export of metals 0 2 kg d 1 for total mn 2 4 kg d 1 for total fe across the thermocline fig 8c and d during the october high inflow period the hypolimnion also received high input of metals but metal export across the thermocline downstream was substantially higher than it was in may june 3 4 2 hypolimnetic fe and mn mass the overall metal mass increased in the hypolimnion during the stratified period fig 8e and f excluding one week in may total mn mass in the hypolimnion was dominated by soluble forms 73 100 throughout the stratified period in contrast total fe mass was dominated by particulate forms especially during july early september after mid september more than half 41 96 of total fe mass was in soluble form 3 4 3 fe and mn fluxes between sediments and hypolimnion metal fluxes calculated using the mass balance eq 3 were highly variable throughout the stratification period fig 9 total and soluble fe fluxes included both positive net release to the water column and negative net return to the sediment values 559 to 408 mg m 2 d 1 for total fe 695 to 392 mg m 2 d 1 for soluble fe similarly total and soluble mn included positive and negative values ranging from 96 to 61 mg m 2 d 1 total and 99 to 62 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fluxes were also calculated assuming 50 100 and 200 increases in inflow metal concentrations to account for the uncertainty of unsampled inflows during storm events results of these calculations fig s8 show that higher metal inflow loads will result in lower positive fluxes and higher negative fluxes however the calculations assuming higher metals concentrations do not affect if the calculated flux is positive release or negative return fluxes of total and soluble fe varied throughout the monitoring period in concert with changes in do and orp fig 9 from may to early july do concentrations were generally 6 mg l 1 at the swi orp 300 mv during this time the average total fe flux was generally negative but small range 153 to 37 median 28 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fe flux was close to 0 range 16 to 12 median 0 2 mg m 2 d 1 from mid to late july decreases in do and orp coincided with fe fluxes becoming increasingly positive on august 9 sharp but brief increases in do and orp which were likely related to the reactivation of the hox system were associated with negative fluxes of fe in mid september when do was fully depleted total fe flux was initially negative 64 mg m 2 d 1 but shifted to positive values after one week while soluble fe flux quickly became positive and remained so until immediately before turnover fluxes of total and soluble mn followed similar patterns to fe but were more variable throughout the monitoring period fig 9 during the high oxygen may to early july period total and soluble mn fluxes exhibited a negligible to small but positive flux median 0 8 and 7 mg m 2 d 1 respectively from sediments into the hypolimnion from mid july to july 30 when vwh do concentrations decreased to 1 8 mg l 1 mn fluxes were variable with positive fluxes occurring during times of decreasing orp and negative fluxes occurring during times of increasing orp fig 9 overall as do and orp decreased there was substantial release of mn to the hypolimnion just as with fe there were negative fluxes of mn beginning august 9 likely due to the re activation of the hox system finally in mid september coincident with a do decrease and deactivation of the hox system total and soluble mn fluxes were initially negative but became positive after one week and remained so until immediately before turnover after turnover october 21 metal fluxes of both fe and mn were negative reaching their maximum value for the season up to 600 mg m 2 d 1 for fe and 100 mg m 2 d 1 for mn 3 5 comparison of direct and indirect methods for estimating fluxes metal fluxes measured using the chambers were consistently higher than fluxes estimated using the mass balance fig 10 the chamber measured fluxes for total and soluble fe for all experiments n 5 all experiments except for the water column were 504 149 and 472 138 mg m 2 d 1 respectively in comparison the total and soluble fe fluxes estimated using mass balance during the same time period n 5 were 19 44 and 43 96 mg m 2 d 1 respectively analysis of chamber measured fe fluxes to mass balance estimated fluxes showed that they are statistically different wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 6 8 and p 0 009 for both total and soluble table s3 chamber measured fluxes for total and soluble mn were also higher than those estimated using the mass balance fig 10 the chamber measured fluxes n 5 all experiments except the water column were positive 44 9 25 and 45 25 mg m 2 d 1 for total and soluble mn respectively while the mass balance method estimates n 5 during the same period were close to 0 1 9 21 4 and 2 3 21 mg m 2 d 1 for total and soluble mn respectively similar to fe statistical comparison of the chamber measured to the mass balance fluxes showed that the two methods yielded different fluxes wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 6 8 and p 0 009 for both total and soluble table s3 4 discussion 4 1 metal fluxes are highly variable and sensitive to redox conditions our results show that metal fluxes were highly variable over the 2018 monitoring period using the mass balance method we observed negative fluxes generally under oxic conditions and positive fluxes under more reducing conditions fig 9 with the switch from positive to negative fluxes coinciding with changes in do and or orp the flux chamber results support this pattern showing that fe and mn fluxes increased as oxygen demand increased fig 7 higher metal release under reducing conditions and lower release under oxidizing conditions have been observed in many other studies on metal fluxes e g beutel et al 2020 debroux et al 2012 but our study examined these patterns as a time series over changing redox conditions the rapid decrease in orp during the flux chamber experiments reflects how quickly the redox conditions changed in the chamber over the scale of days fig 6 at the start of the june experiment orp data combined with the metal concentration data suggest that mn reducing conditions dominated the volume of water sediment enclosed by the flux chamber as there was an increase in mn concentrations but no difference in fe concentrations between the first two sampling points after do within the chamber depleted concomitant with a decrease in orp our data suggest that the dominant electron accepting process within the chamber was fe reduction leading to a positive fe flux these patterns are supported by thermodynamic predictions of terminal electron accepting processes e g langmuir 1997 stumm and morgan 2012 and others in the august experiment initial conditions within the flux chamber were more strongly reducing than in june fig 6 and orp and metals data suggest that the chamber was likely already experiencing fe reducing conditions when the experiment began however even under anoxic conditions the higher concentrations of total fe than soluble fe fig 6 suggest that fe was being oxidized even in the absence of do suggesting the presence of another oxidant likely mno2 de vitre et al 1988 havig et al 2015 myers and nealson 1988 which can interact with fe ii at the sediment water interface further experiments are being planned to test this idea the time series of metal fluxes estimated from the mass balance method also show the sensitivity of metal fluxes to changes in redox conditions fig 9 fluxes of fe were overall negative during periods of oxidizing conditions and were positive during periods of reducing conditions the relationship between mn flux and redox conditions was less predictable than fe likely because mn oxidation kinetics are slower than that of fe and are less dependent on oxygen morgan 2005 munger et al 2016 in addition they are also strongly influenced by other biogeochemical variables such as ph davison 1993 and bacterial processes e g davison 1993 ghiorse 1984 nealson et al 1988 tebo et al 2005 however mn fluxes were highest during orp shifts in the water column fig 9 shown by the large positive mn flux that occurred during the steep decline of do orp in july and the sharp shift to negative mn fluxes that occurred during the rapid increase in orp in early september when orp declined on september 10 after final hox deactivation fe and mn fluxes become increasingly positive and at turnover fluxes became negative in response to mixing of oxic epilimnetic and anoxic hypolimnetic waters resulting in oxidation and precipitation of metals and a seasonal return of metals to the sediment the time series changes in fluxes and relationship to redox conditions are suggestive of hot moments short time periods of intense biogeochemical cycling e g mcclain et al 2003 our time series mass balance calculations were done on a weekly basis based on our routine monitoring of water chemistry samples however we have other data to suggest that metal fluxes may vary on an even shorter time interval birgand et al 2016 present data collected every 30 min for one week in the fcr hypolimnion using a high frequency monitoring system which includes a spectrophotometer connected to a multiplexor pump results show rapid changes in spectral data associated with fe concentrations on a sub daily basis suggestive that metal fluxes may vary on hourly time scales further work is planned using the high frequency monitoring system to examine metal fluxes over these short periods 4 2 comparison of direct and indirect methods for measuring metal fluxes comparison of metal fluxes measured by the flux chamber method to those estimated by mass balance show that the fluxes measured with the flux chamber were consistently higher than those calculated using the mass balance method fig 10 although previous work on phosphorous fluxes has found agreement between different methods of measuring fluxes nürnberg 1987 other studies on metal fluxes have found that the flux chamber method measures the maximum metal fluxes across the swi adams et al 1982 frogner kockum et al 2016 pakhomova et al 2007 as the isolated chamber water does not allow for mixing with the rest of the hypolimnion in addition processes such as sediment resuspension and bioturbation may play a role pakhomova et al 2007 in contrast because the mass balance method relies on water column data results are affected by mixing that can remove metals from the water column thus flux estimates using this method will reflect minimum values belzile et al 1996 4 3 comparing metal fluxes in falling creek reservoir to other lakes and reservoirs overall our mass balance fe fluxes are comparable than those published in other studies on freshwater systems while our chamber measured fe fluxes are typically higher table 2 for example our mass balance soluble fe fluxes over the 2018 stratification period fall within the range of fluxes measured by belzile et al 1996 davison 1993 and urban et al 1997 but our chamber measured soluble fe fluxes are considerably higher comparison of the total fe fluxes shows similar patterns our mass balance total fe flux estimates over the 2018 stratification period are within the range estimated by brannon et al 1985 however our chamber estimates are substantially higher than those reported in other studies unlike fe mn fluxes measured in fcr regardless of method are comparable to fluxes measured in other studies table 2 our mn fluxes from chambers and mass balance are in the range reported by others belzile et al 1996 davison and woof 1984 kawana et al 1980 sakata 1985 yagi 1996 the only studies with substantially higher mn fluxes were from rostherne mere england davison and woof 1984 and beppu bay japan kawana et al 1980 we did not expect that our flux results would necessarily be comparable to other studies as there are multiple variables including different biogeochemical conditions climate conditions and underlying geology amongst others that will affect metal fluxes this variability is one of the reasons why site specific flux measurements are needed for quantifying metal cycles in freshwater ecosystems for example the fe fluxes in falling creek reservoir are likely higher than most other sites because the geologic units underlying the reservoir are crystalline rocks that contain fe bearing minerals including magnetite and ilmenite woodward 1932 as a result of this fe rich bedrock the sediment fe concentrations at the sediment water interface of fcr fig s4 mean and s d of 53 467 11 019 mg kg 1 are elevated in comparison to 25 sediment samples collected from anoxic lakes nürnberg 1995 mean and s d of 32 542 13 233 mg kg 1 in addition as shown in table 2 other studies used a range of methods and conducted experiments under different conditions and or time periods however comparison of our data to others provides context for our results 4 4 study limitations both the flux chamber and the mass balance approaches have limitations as each method has its own sources of variability and uncertainty the main source of variability in flux chamber measurements is related to the difference in replicate measurements which is influenced by placement of the chambers and how well the chamber was sealed in addition to site differences in sediment and pore water characteristics results obtained from flux chambers can also be difficult to scale up to the whole reservoir if multiple experiments are not conducted furthermore like all specialized equipment flux chamber deployments have an associated learning curve for proper deployment and operation for example we quickly learned that the chamber size requires the coordination of two people to deploy however once deployed we were able to leave the chambers largely unattended between sampling and battery swaps finally if time is restricted and only a limited number of experiments can be conducted the flux chamber method runs the risk of low statistical strength when evaluating results for the mass balance method results had inherently higher uncertainty as each variable measured had its own associated error and there are likely components of unmeasured inflow such as surface runoff and deep groundwater flow that are not considered the use of grab samples instead of flow proportional samples likely underestimated inflow metal loadings in addition the effects of the hox system are difficult to disentangle from the high inflow events in the mass balance making it hard to differentiate between hydrological and redox drivers of fluxes furthermore the mass balance calculations were performed assuming one thermocline depth however the thermocline is variable during the stratification period as the water column continues to warm or storms entrain water downward last our study was limited in its analysis of fe and mn oxidation states we used an operational definition of a 0 45 μm filter size to differentiate total from soluble concentrations as we have done in previous studies of metal cycling at our study site munger et al 2016 2019 but recognize that this approach does not truly reflect the fe and mn oxidation states in our system we have conducted analysis of fe ii using the ferrozine method stookey 1970 for other projects in this reservoir data not shown results show that soluble fe concentrations match fe ii concentrations but we have not conducted a similar analysis to distinguish mn ii from mn iii and mn iv using the lbb method krumbein and altmann 1973 for example nor were we able to analyze fe or mn complexes madison et al 2011 oldham et al 2017 we plan to analyze these in future monitoring and experiments at this site to provide a more detailed analysis of metal cycling in the reservoir 5 conclusions the primary goal of this study was to quantify metal fluxes across the sediment water interface into a drinking water reservoir under different redox conditions overall our results showed that metal fluxes are highly variable during the stratification period with some periods having positive fluxes release of metals from sediment to the water column and some with negative fluxes return of metals from the water column to sediment in addition to being highly variable the time series fluxes are highly sensitive to redox conditions in the overlying water column suggestive of high levels of rapid metals cycling over short time periods hot moments for example we observed rapid changes in fluxes associated with fluctuations in orp when do was fully depleted these observations suggest that when the reservoir is anoxic orp is a useful parameter as an indicator of potential increases in metal fluxes into the water column our results also show the utility of using multiple methods for estimating fluxes for quantifying the dynamics of metal exchange between sediments and the water column our chamber measured fluxes provide an upper limit of metal release an important parameter for designing hox systems for in situ treatment of metals the mass balance fluxes for which we have estimates for the entire stratification season yield information on when to expect potential shifts in fluxes release vs return of metals a critical parameter for predicting when additional oxygen should be added overall our study suggests that use of both methods provides complementary information for evaluating fe and mn dynamics in reservoirs data availability data shown in fig 2 are available in the

17819,the development of low dissolved oxygen do concentrations in the hypolimnion of drinking water reservoirs during thermal stratification can lead to the reduction of oxidized insoluble iron fe and manganese mn in sediments to soluble forms which are then released into the water column as metals degrade drinking water quality robust measurements of metal fluxes under changing oxygen conditions are critical for optimizing water treatment in this study we conducted benthic flux chamber experiments in summer 2018 to directly quantify fe and mn fluxes at the sediment water interface under different do and redox conditions of a eutrophic drinking water reservoir with an oxygenation system falling creek reservoir vinton va usa throughout the experiments we monitored do oxidation reduction potential orp water temperature and ph in the chambers and compared the metal fluxes in the chambers with time series of fluxes calculated using a hypolimnetic mass balance method our results showed that metal fluxes were highly variable during the monitoring period and were sensitive to redox conditions in the water column at the sediment water interface the time series changes in fluxes and relationship to redox conditions are suggestive of hot moments short time periods of intense biogeochemical cycling although the metal concentrations and fluxes are specific to this site the approaches for examining relationships between metals oxygen concentrations and overall redox conditions can be applied by water utilities to improve water quality management of fe and mn graphical abstract image 1 keywords anoxia hypolimnion metals oxidation reduction redox water quality hot moments 1 introduction elevated concentrations of iron fe and manganese mn in drinking waters degrade water quality by affecting taste odor and color usepa 2003 in addition chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of mn in drinking water has been associated with adverse health impacts including neurological disorders in children bouchard et al 2007 2011 khan et al 2011 wasserman et al 2011 the u s environmental protection agency usepa has set secondary drinking water standards for fe and mn in drinking water of 0 3 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively usepa 2017 the usepa also established a health reference level of 0 3 mg l 1 for mn usepa 2003 as both fe and mn are common constituents in soils sediments and rocks they are often found in natural waters fe is commonly detected in fresh water at concentrations ranging from 0 04 to 6200 mg l 1 pais and jones 1997 mn is also commonly detected in both surface water and groundwater worldwide with median concentrations of 0 02 mg l 1 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively who 2008 due to their prevalence in natural waters fe and mn are commonly identified as parameters of concerns in public water systems awwa 2009 in freshwater bodies such as lakes and reservoirs dissolved oxygen do concentrations have a strong influence on fe and mn dynamics davison 1993 under oxic conditions do 2 mg l 1 fe and mn occur in their oxidized insoluble forms e g fe and mn oxyhydroxides in sediments however the development of anoxic do 0 5 mg l 1 conditions in the hypolimnion of many lakes and reservoirs during summer thermal stratification leads to microbial reduction of fe and mn in the sediments releasing reduced soluble forms of fe and mn into the water column brannon et al 1985 davison 1993 de vitre et al 1988 myers and nealson 1988 the high cost of treating water with elevated metal concentrations coupled with the knowledge that metals are redox sensitive has led many water utilities to install hypolimnetic oxygenation hox systems to control metal concentrations in situ in lakes and reservoirs used as drinking water supplies bryant et al 2011 gantzer et al 2009 gerling et al 2014 hox systems aim to maintain thermal stratification while adding oxygen to bottom waters beutel and horne 1999 one of the goals of hox systems is to control metal release from the sediments by introducing oxygen to the sediments and maintaining oxic hypolimnia which helps to oxidize and precipitate soluble metals that are released into the water column bryant et al 2011 preece et al 2019 however even when oxygen is added to the hypolimnion reduced metals in sediment can still diffuse upward towards the sediment water interface swi and enter the water column bryant et al 2011 at the swi which represents a redox boundary between the anoxic sediments and the oxic water column reduced fe diffusing upward is oxidized davison 1993 zaw and chiswell 1999 mn behavior in freshwaters differs from that of fe because it oxidizes more slowly and oxidation rates are controlled by ph davison 1993 thus fluxes of reduced mn into the overlying water column can persist even when the water column is oxic designing and implementing successful hox systems require information on the oxygen demand of the water column and the underlying sediments beutel 2003 bierlein et al 2017 gantzer et al 2009 gerling et al 2014 hypolimnetic oxygen demand is calculated as the rate of decrease of do concentration in the water column of the hypolimnion wetzel 2001 after thermal stratification sets up hypolimnetic oxygen demand reflects a combination of both water column and sediment oxygen demand sod adams et al 1982 sod the consumption of do in the sediments contributes to the overall hypolimnetic oxygen demand walker and snodgrass 1986 making it an important parameter when designing hox systems for example sod has been estimated to be 18 and 40 of the total hypolimnetic oxygen demand in hamilton harbour of lake ontario polak and haffner 1978 and lake erie di toro and connolly 1980 respectively design of hox systems also benefits from accurate measurement of metal fluxes from sediments to the water column adams et al 1982 as reduced metals impart an additional chemical oxygen demand metal flux measurements are used to quantify metal loads into the water column which are important for cost effective treatment in addition measurements of metal fluxes under varying oxygen conditions are useful for constraining metal processes and cycling in freshwaters and provide important inputs into water quality models the goal of this study was to quantify fe and mn fluxes across the swi of a drinking water reservoir under different redox conditions to address this objective we conducted field experiments at the reservoir using in situ benthic flux chambers to directly measure fe and mn fluxes at the swi and compared results to hypolimnetic mass balance calculations 2 methods 2 1 site description falling creek reservoir fcr fig 1 is a small zmax 9 3 m mean depth 4 m surface area 0 119 km2 volume 3 1 105 m3 at full pond eutrophic reservoir near vinton virginia usa gerling et al 2014 the reservoir is owned and operated by the western virginia water authority fcr historically exhibits thermal stratification from may to october which in the absence of hypolimnetic oxygenation leads to the development of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion gerling et al 2014 munger et al 2016 inflow from the upstream tributary is the largest surface water input 90 to the reservoir gerling et al 2016 in september 2012 a side stream supersaturation hypolimnetic oxygenation system hox was installed in fcr to increase do concentrations in the hypolimnion of the reservoir while maintaining thermal stratification see gerling et al 2014 for details on the hox system the hox system consists of a submersible pump at 8 5 m depth inlet piping an oxygen source an oxygen contact chamber and distribution headers at 8 5 m depth water is withdrawn from the reservoir via the pump transferred to the oxygen contact chamber and supersaturated with oxygen the water is then transported to the distribution headers via the outlet piping where it is injected back into the hypolimnion previous work gerling et al 2014 and continued oxygen monitoring carey et al 2019 demonstrate that during operation the hox system introduces oxygen into the hypolimnion while maintaining thermal stratification in 2018 when this study was conducted the hox system was operating at full capacity table 1 from april 24 to july 19 after july 19 the hox system operated either at reduced capacity july 19 30 august 9 september 10 or was deactivated july 30 august 9 september 10 on the reservoir exhibited fall turnover to and onset of isothermal conditions on october 21 2 2 water column sampling we collected water samples from fcr for total and soluble fe and mn concentrations weekly from may to october 2018 and monthly from november 2018 to april 2019 water samples were collected at 0 1 1 6 3 8 5 0 8 0 9 0 m depths using a 4 l van dorn sampler these depths correspond to withdrawal elevations on the water treatment outlet structure near the deepest site in fcr fig 1 unfiltered samples for analysis of operationally defined total metals were collected into 15 ml centrifuge tubes filtered samples 0 45 μm nylon membrane were collected for analysis of soluble metals munger et al 2016 we recognize that this method of filtration does not remove all particulates so use of the term soluble is operationally defined for the purposes of this study total and soluble samples for metal analysis were preserved using 0 5 ml trace metal grade nitric acid to ph 2 samples were analyzed for fe and mn concentrations using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes spectro arcos following epa method 200 7 usepa 1994 detection limits were 0 004 mg l 1 for fe and 0 001 mg l 1 for mn depth profiles were measured at 0 1 m increments twice per week from the deepest site using a seabird electronics sbe 19plus v2 high resolution profiler ctd with an sbe 43 do probe and an sbe 27 ph orp probe to measure do temperature ph conductivity and orp carey et al 2019 previous work by gerling et al 2014 supported by continued ctd data collection carey et al 2019 showed that do concentrations measured at the deepest site in the reservoir were representative of hypolimnetic conditions throughout the reservoir we used temperature data to calculate the thermocline depth which defined the upper boundary of the hypolimnion using the matlab lake analyzer program read et al 2011 2 3 sediment sampling and analysis sediment samples were collected at the sediment water interface in summer 2018 using an ekman sampler at six locations within 150 m of the location of the benthic flux chambers in the laboratory sediment samples were oven dried 95 c for 96 h to digest the samples 10 ml of trace metal grade nitric acid was added to 0 5 g of dried sediment the samples were then microwave digested cem mars express following epa method 3051a usepa 2007 we analyzed the resulting digestion solution for fe and mn using icp ms thermo electron x series powder x ray diffraction xrd was used to examine mineralogy of five of the six samples collected samples were powdered using a mortar and pestle xrd analyses were conducted using a rigaku mini flex ii desktop x ray diffractometer copper kα radiation was used with a fixed tubed output voltage of 30 kv and fixed tube output current of 15 ma xrd patterns were analyzed to match peaks to known minerals 2 4 measuring benthic fluxes metal fluxes across the swi were measured using two methods benthic flux chambers and a hypolimnetic mass balance method the flux chambers were deployed at the deepest site to make direct measurements of fe and mn fluxes and oxygen demand at the swi at two time intervals june 21 july 2 and august 13 23 the mass balance method used measurements of discharge and metal concentrations in the hypolimnion to indirectly estimate the net release of fe and mn from the sediments into the hypolimnion following the methods described by gerling et al 2016 2 4 1 benthic flux chambers to measure metal fluxes in situ at the swi benthic flux chambers similar to those described and deployed by murphy and hicks 1986 and hicks 1990 and further modified for this study were deployed in triplicate at the deepest site in fcr flux chambers capture diffusive fluxes of solutes across the swi and have been utilized to measure fluxes of oxygen nutrients and contaminants in a variety of coastal marine settings and in freshwater bodies frogner kockum et al 2016 pakhomova et al 2007 tengberg et al 2005 for this study we conducted two ten day experiments in 2018 june 21 july 2 and august 13 23 to examine the effects of different initial do conditions on metal fluxes during the june experiment hypolimnetic do concentrations were high 7 mg l 1 71 saturation during the august experiment do concentrations in the hypolimnion were substantially lower 2 mg l 1 18 saturation average temperature was 1 c higher in the hypolimnion in august than it was in june the flux chambers used for this study isolated 24 cm of hypolimnetic water above the sediments and 0 27 m2 of the swi for a total volume of 64 86 l of hypolimnetic water enclosed within the chambers for diagrams of the flux chamber see figs s1 and s2 each chamber was connected to a circulation pump which promotes circulation of the water within the chamber so that measured concentrations are representative of the entire chamber volume tengberg et al 2005 the pump was fitted with a valve and sampling tubing on the outlet to collect water samples from the chambers during the incubation period to allow for high frequency monitoring of field parameters each chamber contained an insiteig slidell la model 31 fluorescent do sensor to measure temperature and do comparison of do data collected from replicate chamber experiments indicated a mean percent difference of 2 in addition to do sensors one chamber contained two additional sensors an insiteig model m51 ph and an insiteig model m52 orp sensor slidell la all sensors were connected to a gwr master data logger gantzer water livingston tx and programmed to collect data at a 2 min interval the flux chambers were deployed from a boat by slowly lowering them through the water column to the bottom to minimize sediment disturbance once the chambers were seated on the bottom they were flushed with hypolimnion water for 90 120 min until chamber do concentrations and temperature stabilized and reflected the surrounding hypolimnetic conditions after flushing the chambers were allowed to incubate and then checked after 24 h proper sealing of the chamber was verified by analyzing the linear regression of the do data as oxygen depleted over time where an r2 of 0 99 or better indicated proper sealing if the chamber was not properly sealed which happened in one chamber the start of the august experiment we lifted the chamber off the sediments re deployed it in a nearby location and re started the flushing and incubation processes in addition to the triplicate flux chambers we also deployed one water column chamber which had the same construction specifications as the flux chambers but had a bottom plate to seal off the chamber this chamber was deployed to account for changes in metal concentrations within the water column that were not associated with fluxes across the swi this chamber was deployed for the same interval as the flux chambers in the second experiment during the two 10 day deployments we collected samples for total and soluble fe and mn every 3 4 days to sample the chamber we turned the pump on and allowed water to circulate through the chamber and tubing for 1 min we then collected 15 ml of unfiltered water for total metals analysis and an additional 15 ml of filtered 0 45 μm water for soluble metals analysis during both experiments a maximum of 100 ml of chamber water was withdrawn at each sampling event to minimize the effects of removing chamber water on the chemical diffusion gradient within the chamber the fe and mn samples were analyzed in the laboratory as described above for the depth profiles of fe and mn metal fluxes for each chamber were calculated using the following equation 1 j b v a where j is the flux of the soluble or total metal mg m 2 d 1 b is the slope of the line of best fit of the soluble or total metal concentrations mg l 1 d 1 v is the volume of the flux chamber 64 86 l and a is the surface area of the flux chamber 0 27 m2 sod was measured as the rate at which do depletes from the start of the experiment hypolimnetic conditions until do reached 0 5 mg l 1 following usepa 2015 sod for each chamber in each experiment was calculated using the following equation 2 j s o d b v a where j sod is the sod mg m 2 d 1 b is the slope of the line of best fit of the do concentrations mg l 1 d 1 v is the volume of the flux chamber 64 86 l and a is the surface area of the flux chamber 0 27 m2 2 4 2 hypolimnetic metals mass budget we calculated the hypolimnetic fe and mn budget at weekly intervals from may to october 2018 to estimate fe and mn swi fluxes using the following equation 3 d m d t q i n c i n q o u t c t h e r m j where d m d t is the change in the hypolimnetic mass mg d 1 q in is the flow rate of the primary tributary l d 1 q out is the flow rate across the thermocline c in is the concentration of metals either fe or mn in mg l 1 at the inflow sampling site c therm is concentration of metals mg l 1 at the thermocline depth and j is the estimated metal flux at the swi see fig s3 for the conceptual model of the mass balance positive values of j indicate that metals are released from the sediments into the water column negative values of j indicate that metals are removed from the water column and returned to the sediments we assumed that all water coming in from the tributary went directly to the hypolimnion because the tributary was consistently 2 c colder than the hypolimnion carey et al 2020 additionally we assumed that q in q out as there was no change in water level in the reservoir the water treatment plant did not extract any water from the reservoir during the monitoring period and shallow groundwater wells were routinely dry in summer 2018 suggesting that shallow groundwater inputs during this period were likely small to calculate the entrained metal load across the thermocline we used the metal concentration at the median depth 3 8 m s d 1 7 m range 1 6 8 m of the thermocline for 2018 because the metals budget was only for the hypolimnion we did not need to account for precipitation or evaporation inflow to the reservoir was measured using a rectangular weir with a notch width of 1 1 m installed at the primary inflow of fcr an inw aquistar pt2x pressure sensor inw kirkland wa recorded water level at the weir every 15 min which we used to calculate the flow rate into the reservoir following gerling et al 2014 4 q k l 0 2 h h 1 5 where q is the flow rate m3 min 1 k is 110 29 a unit conversion constant l is the crest length of the weir m and h is the hydraulic head water level behind the weir m gerling et al 2014 we used the data to calculate an average weekly flow for each sampling week total and soluble samples for fe and mn analysis in addition to temperature and do measurements were collected weekly at the inflow stream to yield a weekly average c in to address the uncertainty in metals inputs that occurred during unsampled storm events we also calculated fluxes assuming 50 100 and 200 increases in inflow metal concentrations to calculate d m d t we first calculated the total mass of metals in the hypolimnion using the metal concentrations in samples collected from the four depths of the hypolimnion 5 0 8 0 6 2 and 9 0 m multiplied by the layer volume of the depth from which they were sampled and then summed to find the total hypolimnetic metal mass these sampling depths have been used in previous studies to reflect hypolimnetic conditions gerling et al 2014 2016 munger et al 2016 2019 as we found that the do and temperature conditions measured at the dam sampling site were representative of upstream conditions throughout the reservoir carey et al 2019 thus although we sampled for fe and mn along one depth profile near the dam our do and temperature data along the reservoir transect support the use of this profile as representative of hypolimnion conditions throughout the reservoir in a similar fashion sod was calculated using the change of oxygen mass in the hypolimnion d m d t the volume of the hypolimnion was calculated using bathymetry data that were interpolated using kriging interpolation techniques in arcgis 10 5 1 the area of the swi was taken as the 3 d surface area of the reservoir below the median thermocline 3 8 m the layer volume was calculated as the difference between the reservoir volume at the sample depth and the reservoir volume at the sampling depth immediately below fig s3 to determine the change in metals mass each week we subtracted the hypolimnetic mass of the preceding week and then divided by 7 days the period between sampling dates to calculate the flux per unit area of the reservoir we divided the total hypolimnetic flux mg d 1 per week by the area of the swi m2 in the hypolimnion 2 4 3 statistical analysis we used the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum tests in jmp pro 14 sas institute cary nc usa to statistically compare 1 the benthic fluxes measured with the chamber to those estimated with mass balance and 2 the benthic chamber fluxes in june with those measured in august non parametric tests were needed because of the non independence of time series data and the unbalanced design there were different numbers of flux estimates between the chambers and whole reservoir mass balance as well as a different number of flux measurements collected in the june vs august chamber experiments significance was set at a p value 0 05 3 results 3 1 do orp temperature and ph conditions fcr began to thermally stratify in may 2018 and remained stratified through fall turnover in late october fig 2 the thermocline ranged from 1 6 to 8 m depth throughout the stratified period median depth 3 8 m 1 7 m 1 s d within the hypolimnion the do concentrations were influenced by both the natural conditions of thermal stratification and the operation of the hox system between late april and mid july volume weighted hypolimnetic vwh do concentrations were 4 7 0 3 mg l 1 table 1 and do near the swi was 2 mg l 1 figs 2 and 3 between july 19 and 30 vwh do concentrations decreased to 1 8 mg l 1 after july 30 vwh do decreased to 0 5 mg l 1 or lower for the rest of the stratification season until turnover table 1 similar to do orp measurements show that the water column was more oxidizing in the spring and early summer fig 2 although orp generally mimicked do patterns under oxic conditions see fig s4 when do concentrations were depleted orp generally continued to decline indicating that conditions were becoming increasingly reducing however one exception occurred in august september when the water column at the sediment water interface was fully anoxic do was close to 0 but orp values increased from 100 mv to 266 mv for two weeks early september before steadily decreasing to 0 mv on september 10 the ph in the hypolimnion remained between 6 and 7 throughout the stratification period figs 2 and 3 temperature in the hypolimnion increased during the stratification period with a peak swi temperature of 13 c on september 24 3 2 metal concentrations metal concentrations both total and soluble forms increased in the hypolimnion during the stratification period fig 4 during the early stratified period total and soluble concentrations were low 0 5 mg l 1 for fe 0 05 mg l 1 for mn but began to increase during july reaching maximum concentrations 30 9 mg l 1 for total fe and 2 7 mg l 1 for total mn at the deepest sample point 9 0 m in late august figs 4 and 5 from september 10 to turnover on october 21 fe and mn concentrations were consistently elevated in the hypolimnion and were highest at the swi in the early part of the stratification period total and soluble metal concentrations were similar however later in the season total fe was measurably greater than soluble fe figs 4 and 5 reflecting the presence of particulate fe in contrast total mn concentrations were similar to soluble mn reflecting negligible particulates metal concentrations at the swi were sensitive to orp changes for example when there was a 65 increase in swi orp in september fig 3 total and soluble fe concentrations at the swi decreased 64 and 67 respectively while swi total and soluble mn decreased by 42 fig 5 when orp subsequently declined to lower values 100 mv in september and october fe and mn concentrations at the swi increased concomitantly fig 5 sediment fe and mn concentrations in the six samples collected at the swi near the location of the flux chambers are shown in fig s5 results show that fe concentrations ranged from 42 015 to 72 060 mean 53 466 mg kg 1 dry weight and mn concentrations ranged from 347 to 897 mean 577 mg kg 1 dry weight xrd analyses confirmed the presence of quartz and muscovite but did not indicate the presence of crystalline fe or mn mineral phases data not shown 3 3 benthic flux chambers 3 3 1 metal concentrations and do orp conditions concentrations of fe in the benthic flux chambers increased steadily over time during both incubation experiments fig 6 table s1 total fe concentrations reached 14 mg l 1 in june and 27 mg l 1 in august over a 10 day incubation overall the majority 57 33 of total fe in the experimental samples was composed of soluble fe however there was considerable variation at the start of the june experiment as oxygen was depleted in the chambers less than one third 18 27 of the total fe was in soluble form but as conditions became anoxic the dominant form of total fe was soluble 80 96 during the august experiment conditions were anoxic at the start of the experiment and for most of the sampling intervals the majority of fe was in soluble form however there were several samples where 20 of the fe was soluble signifying the presence of particulate fe similar to fe mn concentrations increased linearly over the incubation period reaching a maximum of 3 4 mg l 1 in both the june and august experiments in contrast to fe all mn was present in soluble form orp values measured during the flux chamber experiments indicate reducing conditions fig 6 table s1 in the june experiment orp values started at 200 mv indicating oxidizing conditions but orp decreased rapidly within the first few days reaching 0 mv on day 4 and a low of 300 mv by the end of the experiment similarly during the august experiment orp values started at 200 mv but they decreased rapidly within the first day to negative values reaching 410 mv by the end of the incubation in both chamber experiments orp and do were correlated when do is detectable fig s6 below a do concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 the lower detection limit of the sensor orp continued to decline indicating the utility of measuring orp to yield information on redox conditions interestingly as orp decreased during the experiments it exhibited small plateaus over periods of 0 5 6 days that were often associated with sharp increases in metal concentrations temperature and ph remained between 12 and 15 c and 6 3 to 7 6 respectively throughout both experiments for all experiments the water column chamber measured negligible changes in soluble and total fe and mn concentrations table s1 suggesting that the reactions affecting metal cycling in the hypolimnion primarily occurred at the swi in addition all or nearly all oxygen demand measured in the flux chambers can be attributed to sod as the water column chamber measured a negligible oxygen demand 3 3 2 chamber metal fluxes and sod we calculated metal fluxes from the chamber experiments using the time series of metal concentrations eq 1 see data in tables s1 and s2 fe fluxes measured from the chamber experiments excluding the water column experiment ranged from 290 to 672 mg m 2 d 1 total and 255 594 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fig 7 as suggested by the wide range in measured flux values there was considerable variability between the replicates of the flux chamber experiments reflected by a coefficient of variation cv of 17 and 14 for soluble and total fe respectively in june and 3 and 6 for soluble and total fe respectively in august there was no statistical difference in total or soluble fe fluxes between the june and august experiments wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 3 0 p 0 08 table s3 mn fluxes measured from the chamber experiments excluding the water column experiment ranged from 28 to 88 mg m 2 d 1 total and 29 to 89 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fig 7 similar to fe there was variability between replicates of the flux chamber experiments for the mn measurements as reflected by the coefficient of variation cv of 30 for both total and soluble mn in the june experiments and 5 for both total and soluble in the august experiments also similar to fe there was no statistical difference in total or soluble mn fluxes between the june and august experiments wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 0 3 p 0 56 table s3 almost all the mn 98 0 04 was in soluble form do concentrations measured using flux chambers were used to calculate sod eq 2 fig 7 although the initial do concentrations between the june and august experiments were different vwh do in june and august was 8 and 2 mg l 1 respectively a comparison of the two experiments showed the rate of oxygen depletion was not statistically different wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 0 p 1 0 table s3 fluxes of total and soluble fe and mn in the chamber experiments increased as sediment oxygen demand increased i e became increasingly negative fig 7 excluding one outlier for a flux chamber during the august experiment the total and soluble fe flux vs sod data fit a polynomial quadratic equation p 0 05 table s4 the highest total and soluble fe fluxes 672 51 and 594 128 mg m 2 d 1 respectively were measured when sod was also the highest 1203 7 mg m 2 d 1 similarly excluding one outlier the total and soluble mn flux vs sod data fit a polynomial quadratic equation p 0 05 soluble and total mn fluxes were highest ranging between 35 and 37 mg m 2 d 1 for both total and soluble mn when sod was elevated greater than 450 mg m 2 d 1 fig 7 3 4 hypolimnetic mass balance 3 4 1 fe and mn loading in the early stratification period may june inflow to the reservoir was 94 higher 5 1 2 8 ml d 1 than during july september 0 32 0 44 ml d 1 fig s7 in october immediately before turnover inflow was also high 4 7 0 4 ml d 1 to the reservoir due to storms during the may june high inflow period the hypolimnion experienced high input loading of metals 0 4 0 8 kg d 1 for total mn 4 8 kg d 1 for total fe fig 8 a and b but with low export of metals 0 2 kg d 1 for total mn 2 4 kg d 1 for total fe across the thermocline fig 8c and d during the october high inflow period the hypolimnion also received high input of metals but metal export across the thermocline downstream was substantially higher than it was in may june 3 4 2 hypolimnetic fe and mn mass the overall metal mass increased in the hypolimnion during the stratified period fig 8e and f excluding one week in may total mn mass in the hypolimnion was dominated by soluble forms 73 100 throughout the stratified period in contrast total fe mass was dominated by particulate forms especially during july early september after mid september more than half 41 96 of total fe mass was in soluble form 3 4 3 fe and mn fluxes between sediments and hypolimnion metal fluxes calculated using the mass balance eq 3 were highly variable throughout the stratification period fig 9 total and soluble fe fluxes included both positive net release to the water column and negative net return to the sediment values 559 to 408 mg m 2 d 1 for total fe 695 to 392 mg m 2 d 1 for soluble fe similarly total and soluble mn included positive and negative values ranging from 96 to 61 mg m 2 d 1 total and 99 to 62 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fluxes were also calculated assuming 50 100 and 200 increases in inflow metal concentrations to account for the uncertainty of unsampled inflows during storm events results of these calculations fig s8 show that higher metal inflow loads will result in lower positive fluxes and higher negative fluxes however the calculations assuming higher metals concentrations do not affect if the calculated flux is positive release or negative return fluxes of total and soluble fe varied throughout the monitoring period in concert with changes in do and orp fig 9 from may to early july do concentrations were generally 6 mg l 1 at the swi orp 300 mv during this time the average total fe flux was generally negative but small range 153 to 37 median 28 mg m 2 d 1 soluble fe flux was close to 0 range 16 to 12 median 0 2 mg m 2 d 1 from mid to late july decreases in do and orp coincided with fe fluxes becoming increasingly positive on august 9 sharp but brief increases in do and orp which were likely related to the reactivation of the hox system were associated with negative fluxes of fe in mid september when do was fully depleted total fe flux was initially negative 64 mg m 2 d 1 but shifted to positive values after one week while soluble fe flux quickly became positive and remained so until immediately before turnover fluxes of total and soluble mn followed similar patterns to fe but were more variable throughout the monitoring period fig 9 during the high oxygen may to early july period total and soluble mn fluxes exhibited a negligible to small but positive flux median 0 8 and 7 mg m 2 d 1 respectively from sediments into the hypolimnion from mid july to july 30 when vwh do concentrations decreased to 1 8 mg l 1 mn fluxes were variable with positive fluxes occurring during times of decreasing orp and negative fluxes occurring during times of increasing orp fig 9 overall as do and orp decreased there was substantial release of mn to the hypolimnion just as with fe there were negative fluxes of mn beginning august 9 likely due to the re activation of the hox system finally in mid september coincident with a do decrease and deactivation of the hox system total and soluble mn fluxes were initially negative but became positive after one week and remained so until immediately before turnover after turnover october 21 metal fluxes of both fe and mn were negative reaching their maximum value for the season up to 600 mg m 2 d 1 for fe and 100 mg m 2 d 1 for mn 3 5 comparison of direct and indirect methods for estimating fluxes metal fluxes measured using the chambers were consistently higher than fluxes estimated using the mass balance fig 10 the chamber measured fluxes for total and soluble fe for all experiments n 5 all experiments except for the water column were 504 149 and 472 138 mg m 2 d 1 respectively in comparison the total and soluble fe fluxes estimated using mass balance during the same time period n 5 were 19 44 and 43 96 mg m 2 d 1 respectively analysis of chamber measured fe fluxes to mass balance estimated fluxes showed that they are statistically different wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 6 8 and p 0 009 for both total and soluble table s3 chamber measured fluxes for total and soluble mn were also higher than those estimated using the mass balance fig 10 the chamber measured fluxes n 5 all experiments except the water column were positive 44 9 25 and 45 25 mg m 2 d 1 for total and soluble mn respectively while the mass balance method estimates n 5 during the same period were close to 0 1 9 21 4 and 2 3 21 mg m 2 d 1 for total and soluble mn respectively similar to fe statistical comparison of the chamber measured to the mass balance fluxes showed that the two methods yielded different fluxes wilcoxon rank sum test χ 1 2 6 8 and p 0 009 for both total and soluble table s3 4 discussion 4 1 metal fluxes are highly variable and sensitive to redox conditions our results show that metal fluxes were highly variable over the 2018 monitoring period using the mass balance method we observed negative fluxes generally under oxic conditions and positive fluxes under more reducing conditions fig 9 with the switch from positive to negative fluxes coinciding with changes in do and or orp the flux chamber results support this pattern showing that fe and mn fluxes increased as oxygen demand increased fig 7 higher metal release under reducing conditions and lower release under oxidizing conditions have been observed in many other studies on metal fluxes e g beutel et al 2020 debroux et al 2012 but our study examined these patterns as a time series over changing redox conditions the rapid decrease in orp during the flux chamber experiments reflects how quickly the redox conditions changed in the chamber over the scale of days fig 6 at the start of the june experiment orp data combined with the metal concentration data suggest that mn reducing conditions dominated the volume of water sediment enclosed by the flux chamber as there was an increase in mn concentrations but no difference in fe concentrations between the first two sampling points after do within the chamber depleted concomitant with a decrease in orp our data suggest that the dominant electron accepting process within the chamber was fe reduction leading to a positive fe flux these patterns are supported by thermodynamic predictions of terminal electron accepting processes e g langmuir 1997 stumm and morgan 2012 and others in the august experiment initial conditions within the flux chamber were more strongly reducing than in june fig 6 and orp and metals data suggest that the chamber was likely already experiencing fe reducing conditions when the experiment began however even under anoxic conditions the higher concentrations of total fe than soluble fe fig 6 suggest that fe was being oxidized even in the absence of do suggesting the presence of another oxidant likely mno2 de vitre et al 1988 havig et al 2015 myers and nealson 1988 which can interact with fe ii at the sediment water interface further experiments are being planned to test this idea the time series of metal fluxes estimated from the mass balance method also show the sensitivity of metal fluxes to changes in redox conditions fig 9 fluxes of fe were overall negative during periods of oxidizing conditions and were positive during periods of reducing conditions the relationship between mn flux and redox conditions was less predictable than fe likely because mn oxidation kinetics are slower than that of fe and are less dependent on oxygen morgan 2005 munger et al 2016 in addition they are also strongly influenced by other biogeochemical variables such as ph davison 1993 and bacterial processes e g davison 1993 ghiorse 1984 nealson et al 1988 tebo et al 2005 however mn fluxes were highest during orp shifts in the water column fig 9 shown by the large positive mn flux that occurred during the steep decline of do orp in july and the sharp shift to negative mn fluxes that occurred during the rapid increase in orp in early september when orp declined on september 10 after final hox deactivation fe and mn fluxes become increasingly positive and at turnover fluxes became negative in response to mixing of oxic epilimnetic and anoxic hypolimnetic waters resulting in oxidation and precipitation of metals and a seasonal return of metals to the sediment the time series changes in fluxes and relationship to redox conditions are suggestive of hot moments short time periods of intense biogeochemical cycling e g mcclain et al 2003 our time series mass balance calculations were done on a weekly basis based on our routine monitoring of water chemistry samples however we have other data to suggest that metal fluxes may vary on an even shorter time interval birgand et al 2016 present data collected every 30 min for one week in the fcr hypolimnion using a high frequency monitoring system which includes a spectrophotometer connected to a multiplexor pump results show rapid changes in spectral data associated with fe concentrations on a sub daily basis suggestive that metal fluxes may vary on hourly time scales further work is planned using the high frequency monitoring system to examine metal fluxes over these short periods 4 2 comparison of direct and indirect methods for measuring metal fluxes comparison of metal fluxes measured by the flux chamber method to those estimated by mass balance show that the fluxes measured with the flux chamber were consistently higher than those calculated using the mass balance method fig 10 although previous work on phosphorous fluxes has found agreement between different methods of measuring fluxes nürnberg 1987 other studies on metal fluxes have found that the flux chamber method measures the maximum metal fluxes across the swi adams et al 1982 frogner kockum et al 2016 pakhomova et al 2007 as the isolated chamber water does not allow for mixing with the rest of the hypolimnion in addition processes such as sediment resuspension and bioturbation may play a role pakhomova et al 2007 in contrast because the mass balance method relies on water column data results are affected by mixing that can remove metals from the water column thus flux estimates using this method will reflect minimum values belzile et al 1996 4 3 comparing metal fluxes in falling creek reservoir to other lakes and reservoirs overall our mass balance fe fluxes are comparable than those published in other studies on freshwater systems while our chamber measured fe fluxes are typically higher table 2 for example our mass balance soluble fe fluxes over the 2018 stratification period fall within the range of fluxes measured by belzile et al 1996 davison 1993 and urban et al 1997 but our chamber measured soluble fe fluxes are considerably higher comparison of the total fe fluxes shows similar patterns our mass balance total fe flux estimates over the 2018 stratification period are within the range estimated by brannon et al 1985 however our chamber estimates are substantially higher than those reported in other studies unlike fe mn fluxes measured in fcr regardless of method are comparable to fluxes measured in other studies table 2 our mn fluxes from chambers and mass balance are in the range reported by others belzile et al 1996 davison and woof 1984 kawana et al 1980 sakata 1985 yagi 1996 the only studies with substantially higher mn fluxes were from rostherne mere england davison and woof 1984 and beppu bay japan kawana et al 1980 we did not expect that our flux results would necessarily be comparable to other studies as there are multiple variables including different biogeochemical conditions climate conditions and underlying geology amongst others that will affect metal fluxes this variability is one of the reasons why site specific flux measurements are needed for quantifying metal cycles in freshwater ecosystems for example the fe fluxes in falling creek reservoir are likely higher than most other sites because the geologic units underlying the reservoir are crystalline rocks that contain fe bearing minerals including magnetite and ilmenite woodward 1932 as a result of this fe rich bedrock the sediment fe concentrations at the sediment water interface of fcr fig s4 mean and s d of 53 467 11 019 mg kg 1 are elevated in comparison to 25 sediment samples collected from anoxic lakes nürnberg 1995 mean and s d of 32 542 13 233 mg kg 1 in addition as shown in table 2 other studies used a range of methods and conducted experiments under different conditions and or time periods however comparison of our data to others provides context for our results 4 4 study limitations both the flux chamber and the mass balance approaches have limitations as each method has its own sources of variability and uncertainty the main source of variability in flux chamber measurements is related to the difference in replicate measurements which is influenced by placement of the chambers and how well the chamber was sealed in addition to site differences in sediment and pore water characteristics results obtained from flux chambers can also be difficult to scale up to the whole reservoir if multiple experiments are not conducted furthermore like all specialized equipment flux chamber deployments have an associated learning curve for proper deployment and operation for example we quickly learned that the chamber size requires the coordination of two people to deploy however once deployed we were able to leave the chambers largely unattended between sampling and battery swaps finally if time is restricted and only a limited number of experiments can be conducted the flux chamber method runs the risk of low statistical strength when evaluating results for the mass balance method results had inherently higher uncertainty as each variable measured had its own associated error and there are likely components of unmeasured inflow such as surface runoff and deep groundwater flow that are not considered the use of grab samples instead of flow proportional samples likely underestimated inflow metal loadings in addition the effects of the hox system are difficult to disentangle from the high inflow events in the mass balance making it hard to differentiate between hydrological and redox drivers of fluxes furthermore the mass balance calculations were performed assuming one thermocline depth however the thermocline is variable during the stratification period as the water column continues to warm or storms entrain water downward last our study was limited in its analysis of fe and mn oxidation states we used an operational definition of a 0 45 μm filter size to differentiate total from soluble concentrations as we have done in previous studies of metal cycling at our study site munger et al 2016 2019 but recognize that this approach does not truly reflect the fe and mn oxidation states in our system we have conducted analysis of fe ii using the ferrozine method stookey 1970 for other projects in this reservoir data not shown results show that soluble fe concentrations match fe ii concentrations but we have not conducted a similar analysis to distinguish mn ii from mn iii and mn iv using the lbb method krumbein and altmann 1973 for example nor were we able to analyze fe or mn complexes madison et al 2011 oldham et al 2017 we plan to analyze these in future monitoring and experiments at this site to provide a more detailed analysis of metal cycling in the reservoir 5 conclusions the primary goal of this study was to quantify metal fluxes across the sediment water interface into a drinking water reservoir under different redox conditions overall our results showed that metal fluxes are highly variable during the stratification period with some periods having positive fluxes release of metals from sediment to the water column and some with negative fluxes return of metals from the water column to sediment in addition to being highly variable the time series fluxes are highly sensitive to redox conditions in the overlying water column suggestive of high levels of rapid metals cycling over short time periods hot moments for example we observed rapid changes in fluxes associated with fluctuations in orp when do was fully depleted these observations suggest that when the reservoir is anoxic orp is a useful parameter as an indicator of potential increases in metal fluxes into the water column our results also show the utility of using multiple methods for estimating fluxes for quantifying the dynamics of metal exchange between sediments and the water column our chamber measured fluxes provide an upper limit of metal release an important parameter for designing hox systems for in situ treatment of metals the mass balance fluxes for which we have estimates for the entire stratification season yield information on when to expect potential shifts in fluxes release vs return of metals a critical parameter for predicting when additional oxygen should be added overall our study suggests that use of both methods provides complementary information for evaluating fe and mn dynamics in reservoirs data availability data shown in fig 2 are available in the
