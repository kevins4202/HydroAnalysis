14490,the cooling water from an oil refinery was sampled on monthly basis over a year the water samples were characterized and studied with the treatment technologies of uv and uv tio2 photocatalysis respectively the experiments were conducted in a bench scale uv reactor with the wavelength of 254 nm the reactor was loaded with tio2 nanoparticles coated on glass substrates the original and treated refinery water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon toc biological oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod and total bacteria count bc it was found that 1 the cooling water of the refinery was subject to bio chemical foulings which varied significantly over the year 2 uv vis is an effective technique to monitor the overall quality of the water samples 3 the uv and uv tio2 photocatalysis are highly effective in disinfecting the cooling water at a residence time of 30 s the bacteria count was decreased by 22 with uv alone and decreased by 62 with uv tio2 technology respectively the uv tio2 was also found effective in the photodegradation and mineralization of organic compounds 4 the efficiency of the uv tio2 system is dependent on the effective surface area of the photocatalyst keywords uv photocatalyst tio2 refinery cooling water water treatment nomenclature list of symbols dc dt photodegradation rate of organic compounds k apparent reaction rate constant c concentration of organics to be degraded k adsorption coefficient of organic compounds onto illuminated tio2 1 introduction the cooling water systems in petrochemicals and oil gas industries are prone to biological chemical foulings which result in the decreased heat transfer efficiency increased corrosion and subsequently the higher operational cost 1 3 in a local oil refinery in abu dhabi uae the closed loop fresh cooling water desalinated seawater from multistage evaporator has a circulation rate of 400 m3 hour which adsorbs the heat from process units and rejects it to sea water loop via the shell and tube heat exchangers over the years bacteria flourished in the system and became resistant to conventional chemical additives such as biocides and other chemical additives thereby presenting a serious threat to the efficiency and life of the process equipment traditionally chlorine or halogen based biocides are commonly used to treat the cooling water in large scale petrochemicals however the use of such chemicals is subject to local authorities regulations because they may react with natural organic matter nom to form by products such as trihalomethanes haloaceto nitriles and halophenols etc which are harmful to life and environment 4 furthermore the excessive dosage of chlorine may cause corrosion and break down noms mostly humic and fulvic acids into smaller molecules such as organic acids and aldehydes which are nutrients of bacteria 5 6 hence the effective treatment disinfection of cooling water is a challenging task which calls for new technologies solutions over the past decades photocatalysis has shown great potential as a low cost environmentally benign technology for water and wastewater treatment 7 9 working on the mechanism of advanced oxidation it is a sustainable technology which requires the minimal addition of chemicals and produces zero waste a number of photocatalysts such as zno sio2 fe2o3 etc have been developed over the years amongst which tio2 is the most popular one due to its excellent performance low cost chemical thermal stability and easy availability 9 12 numerous researches have confirmed that the uv irradiation of tio2 leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals hydrogen peroxide and superoxide which are capable of disintegrating bacteria and organic pollutants into co2 mineral acids and h2o 13 14 compared with traditional chemical additives uv photocatalysis technology has such advantages as high efficiency less pollution and fast kinetics 15 there are abundant researches on the use of uv 16 and tio2 photocatalyst for the treatment of industrial municipal and agricultural drinking waste water 14 17 19 for example rizzo et al 17 studied the photocatalytic degradation of wastewater spiked with pharmaceutical mixture 10 mg l amoxicillin 5 mg l carbamazepine and 2 5 mg l diclofenac and compared with the distilled water spiked with the same pharmaceutical mixture their studies showed that at a load of 0 8 g tio2 l in a 100 ml of pharmaceutical water the toc mineralization rate was slower for the pharmaceutical wastewater t1 2 86 6 min as compared to distilled water spiked pharmaceutical t1 2 46 5 min the slow photo mineralization rate in pharmaceutical wastewater was attributed to interference of radical scavengers due to their high concentrations in the water sample sanchez et al 14 reported the photocatalytic oxidation of greywater and found a 65 reduction in dissolved organic carbon doc after a 150 min treatment in addition to doc removal anionic surfactants were also 100 removed pastrana mart√≠nez et al 20 compared the photocatalytic degradation of water pollutants using degussa p 25 tio2 tio2 graphene composite and organic shell layer modified tio2 respectively their studies showed that tio2 graphene composites demonstrated the higher rates of degradation and mineralization with a 50 reduction in toc as compared to 48 and 23 by p 25 and modified tio2 respectively li et al 21 studied the decontamination of oilfield produced wastewater opw containing refractory organic pollutants by using tio2 photocatalyst their results showed a 38 reduction in the cod after 60 min of treatment with the photocatalysis the cooling water from oil refinery has some unique characteristics such as the higher content of hydrocarbons organic matters due to the leakage from the pipelines joints of process units high turbulent flowrate and addition of chemical additives biocides dispersant scale corrosion inhibitors etc 22 the traditional chemical based treatment technology is expensive and generates secondary pollutions to the environment therefore this study will investigate the use of the advanced oxidation technology uv tio2 in the treatment of the cooling water from an oil refinery 2 experimental 2 1 sample analysis the cooling water samples were taken from the sampling point of the buffer tank in the cooling loop the tank has a volume of 10 m3 filled with cooling water up to 60 of its capacity and is under a nitrogen blanket about 2 l of cooling water was filled into the pre sterilized opaque glass bottles which were then placed in a cool box filled with ice and sent to the laboratory for immediate analysis the chemical oxygen demand cod was analyzed using a hach lange cod digestion solution vial lck 514 kit supplied by concorde trading co llc uae which uses dichromate as the oxidizing agent the water samples were digested in a hach drb 200 reactor and cod levels were measured using a hach 5000 spectrophotometer using the wavelength up to 620 nm the biological oxygen demand bod5 was determined with the protocol of apha 5210b in which 2 ml water sample was homogenized diluted added into sample cuvette with other chemicals lck 555 bod test kit hach incubated in darkness at 20 c and then analyzed with the photometer total organic carbon toc was determined using an o i analytical aurora model 1030 which uses a non dispersive infrared ndir detection technique bacteria count bc analysis was done using the pour plate method with a lab m plate count agar lab 149 as the growth media the samples were incubated for two days at 35 c and viable colonies were counted using a rocker colony counter galaxy 330 an agilent cary 5000 uv vis nir spectrophotometer was used to examine the overall spectra of each cooling water sample all the analyses were repeated at least 3 times to ensure the reproducibility 2 2 uv reactor a bench scale uv reactor a flow through reactor with recirculation was set up and schematically shown in fig 1 reactor model uv a 1gpm 11 w kontec co llc dubai uae the reactor has a 403 stainless steel cylindrical chamber with 500 mm in length and 80 mm in diameter the uv lamp a tubular low pressure hg lamp was placed into a quartz tube the sleeve fixed in the center of the reactor the average uv intensity is 120 mw cm2 with an emission peak wavelength of 254 nm a peristatic pump was used to circulate the water sample directly taken from the refinery between the reactor and a 6 l storage tank the experiments were carried out at the room temperature of 23 2 c the fresh and treated cooling water samples were subject to the analysis methods listed in table 1 2 3 uv photocatalyst experiment the tio2 photocatalyst gpr rectapur vwr chemicals consists of nano sized particles d 25 nm mainly in the anatase phase 95 the photocatalyst was coated onto glass beads which also serve as the transmission media of uv light via the dip coating method 23 in brief the cleaned silica glass beads d 1 5 mm were submerged into tio2 nano solution 5 wt in ethanol then dried in dustless air for 15 min and transferred into a furnace the coated beads were further dried at 150 c for 1 h and the temperature was steadily increased at a ramping rate of 10 c min till 500 c and held for 2 h for calcination the process of dip coating and calcination were repeated three times to ensure the homogeneity of tio2 coated beads it has been reported that calcination at high temperatures may cause the transformation from anatase to rutile phase 24 26 to ensure that tio2 nanoparticles were in anatase phase after calcination fig 2 compares the xrd patterns panalytical x pert pro cu ka radiation of the commercial tio2 nanopowder and these of the tio2 calcinated at 500 and 600 c respectively the characteristic peaks at 25 5 38 01 and 48 31 represent anatase in the 101 004 and 200 planes respectively while strong diffraction peaks at 27 7 and 55 43 represent the rutile 24 26 it is seen that the calcination temperature of 600 c caused a sharp peak of rutile at 27 7 while the temperature at 500 c largely preserved the original structure of the nanoparticles therefore 500 c was selected as the calcination temperature fig 3 shows the sem image of tio2 coating on the glass substrate with the edx analysis it is seen that the coated tio2 are largely nanoparticles with the size of 20 30 nm mainly consisting of ti o ca mg si from the glass substrate 3 results and discussion 3 1 sampling the cooling water was sampled on monthly basis over a 12 months period the analyzed results are shown in fig 4 a bod5 cod toc and b bc respectively it can be seen that in general the data fluctuated and scattered throughout the year but the average reading of bod5 toc bc are on the high end of industrial norms suggesting that the bacteria in the cooling water have developed some resistance to the chemical additives biocides and the bio chemical fouling of the cooling water in this refinery need to be adequately addressed a close examination of the data revealed that toc was higher during winter months 150 ppm compared to that of summer 80 ppm possibly due to the decrease in nom as the result of high summer temperature up to 50 c of the gulf region this trend in toc was also reported by allard et al 27 who attributed the lower humics in summer to the long daylight which increased the degradation rate bc generally followed the trend of toc possibly due to the less organic carbon which serves as a source of nutrient present in cooling water during summer months the exceptional high reading of bc at february may be due to system sample contamination notably the refinery also replenishes discharges a small portion of cooling water as well as the chemical additives from time to time approximately on the quarterly basis which may also cause the fluctuation of the reading as well 3 2 uv tio2 on organics fig 5 shows the uv vis spectra of the cooling water samples over different time intervals of uv irradiation the spectrum gives a qualitative view of the overall quality the reading at the wavelength of 254 nm is largely the lumped effect of bod5 cod toc bc etc while the turbidity algal etc are reflected at 650 nm 28 it can be observed that the uv irradiation improved the overall quality of water consistently over the time uv irradiation had a small effect on toc reduction i e mineralization of nom into co2 and h2o since there were no ho radicals in the system as reported by gustavo et al 29 however it was seen in fig 5 that after 99 h of uv irradiation the change in the structure of nom which was monitored by absorbance at 254 nm wavelength decreased by 30 this slow degradation can be attributed to the presence of a highly concentrated and stable noms as well as chemical additives such as corrosion inhibitors and chlorine based biocides as reported by allard et al 27 such a slow degradation kinetics suggest that uv at 254 nm alone is insufficient for an effective complete disintegration of those chemicals in cooling water meanwhile turbidity which is largely dependent on organic matter soluble colored organic compounds and microorganisms etc showed a 79 5 reduction over the same period of time the reduction in turbidity is accompanied with the change in color the degradation of inhibitors and biocides in the cooling water from a light blue the original color of the cooling water sample to a clear solution after the 99h treatment period 14 as revealed in the photo inset of fig 5 next uv tio2 photocatalyst was employed to repeat the above experiment and the results were compared in fig 6 a photocatalytic degradation of organic compounds using tio2 photocatalysis can be described by the langmuir hinshelwood l h kinetics model 30 1 r d c d t k k c 1 k c where dc dt is the photodegradation rate of organic compounds k is the apparent reaction rate constant c is the concentration of organics and k is the adsorption coefficient of organic compounds onto illuminated tio2 the l h kinetics model can be simplified to a zero order rate equation when the concentrations of organic contaminants exceed saturation coverage of tio2 surface kc 1 2 c t k a pseudo first order kinetics model is derived when the concentration of organic contaminants is low kc 1 and k is the pseudo first order rate constant 3 c t k c c t c o e k t the pseudo first order kinetic model was observed for the degradation of nom when using uv and uv tio2 as seen in fig 6a which is in agreement with the findings of hijnen et al 16 it is seen that tio2 can effectively enhance the degradation of noms with a 43 reduction in the absorbance at Œ±254 254 nm assuming linearly proportional to the overall concentration of noms in 72 h furthermore a 17 reduction in toc was also observed after 72 h of treatment fig 6b although a 17 reduction in toc is relatively small it has been known that the rate of photocatalytic degradation of nom is strongly dependent on the concentration and structure of organic inorganic compounds as well as the transparency of the cooling water 31 32 it is known that the high concentration of organics may cover the surface of tio2 and thereby reduce the efficiency of photocatalysis 33 the chemical additives chlorine based biocides and inhibitors molybdate salts and nitrite salts in the cooling water may further complicate this issue however it is obvious that uv tio2 is effective in degrading chemicals and noms and its efficiency can be further improved if the concentration of the chemical additives biocides and inhibitor etc is reduced 3 3 effects of uv and photocatalysis on bacteria count it is an established principle that uv irradiation can inactivate bacteria however the inactivated bacteria remains in the cooling water and may form biofilms over time and subsequently harm the system the integration of tio2 photocatalyst can further disintegrate the active and inactivated bacteria cells thereby offering a complete solution for the cooling water system to verify the feasibility of the uv tio2 technology our experiments were conducted in a bench scale uv reactor fig 1 loaded with and without tio2 photocatalyst respectively for each run the rig was charged with 6 l of cooling water sample directly taken from the refinery it can be seen in fig 7 that uv alone is effective in inactivating bacteria 12 33 with a reduction rate of 33 71 and 95 in bc at the residence time of 30 s 180 s and 600 s respectively with a loading of 50 g of tio2 coated beads into the uv reactor however the bc reduction was significantly enhanced to 62 81 and 99 4 respectively at the same time interval which confirmed that uv tio2 photocatalysis is a superior and very promising technology for treating cooling water from the oil refinery to further investigate the performance of uv tio2 technology in treating refinery water experiments were conducted to study the effect of photocatalyst loading on the rate of disinfection the reactor was loaded with 25 g 50 g and 100 g of tio2 coated glass beads respectively to repeat the above experiments it was observed in fig 8 that the loading of 50 g beads gave the best performance further increase in catalyst loading to 100 g beads led to a slower disinfection kinetics this can be attributed to the transmission of uv light in the reactor jacket which was obstructed by the excessive loading of the catalyst beads therefore the surface area of the photocatalyst directly under the uv irradiation is a more reliable bench mark 32 34 for the system efficiency 4 conclusion the practical cooling water of an oil refinery was sampled and characterized over 12 months operation it was found that such cooling water is to prone to bio chemical foulings and became resistant to conventional treatment methods uv vis is found to be an economical effective and quick method for monitoring the overall quality of the cooling water experimental results showed that uv treatment is effective in disinfecting bacteria in the cooling water and its efficiency can be greatly enhanced when combined with tio2 nano photocatalyst coated on the glass substrates under proper loading of the photocatalyst the uv tio2 photocatalysis technology can significantly reduce the bacteria content and organic compounds with fast kinetics therefore uv tio2 technology represents a complete and environmental benign solution for the treatment of cooling water from oil

demonstrates that the treatment with the aluminum polychloride pac containing actifluo after a preliminary precipitation step with ca oh 2 improved the efficiency in the fluoride removal this has been proved on wastewaters coming from four different companies of the south of italy in all the cases the actifluo treatment led to residual fluorides falling within the italian law limits fixed at 12 mg l for sewage and 6 mg l for surface waters as a matter of fact independently of the initial fluoride concentration final values lower than 3 mg l were obtained by treating wastewaters coming either from glass or dye factories to determine whether ph and particle surface influenced the decontamination efficiency in surface water synthetic wastewaters were analyzed by means of Œ∂ potential and dynamic light scattering the close relationship between ph and surface charge of the coagulant polymer present in the actifluo was established and their effects on the fluoride removal efficiency assessed keywords water treatment fluoride flocculant adsorption 1 introduction fluorides are released into the environment either naturally during the weathering of rocks and through atmospheric emissions from volcanoes and seawater or due to human activities 1 2 application of phosphate fertilizers pesticides as well as the manufacture of aluminum copper steel glass ceramic glues and adhesives are the artificial sources of fluoride in groundwater and in surface water as well 3 5 drinking water is the largest supplier of fluoride in daily intake 6 depending on its concentration fluoride in drinking water can be either helpful or harmful in the first case the presence of fluoride in drinking water within acceptable limits is beneficial like for example in the calcification of dental surface in the latter case high fluoride concentrations pose a health threat to millions of people around the world with the occurrence of fluorosis dental discoloration bony lesions and so on 7 8 according to the world health organization who the maximum acceptable concentration of fluoride is 1 5 mg l 9 based on this limit it is known that minute concentrations of fluoride are related with beneficial effects by reducing incidence of caries and by the preventing dental fluorosis 10 11 the effect of fluoride in drinking water on children s intelligence was also previously ascertained 12 fluorides enter the human body through foods and beverages to a slighter extent and evidence has been reported connecting fluorides present in fish juices tea and carbonated soft drinks with fluorosis development 13 15 since drinking water sources are both surface and ground waters it is mandatory to take under control the fluoride level as well as that of other pollutants in sewage and wastewaters of any origin at present many countries have fixed quality standards for effluent water including an upper limit value for fluoride 16 in particular the italian law establishes 12 mg l for sewage and 6 mg l for surface waters 17 the defluoridation processes used for treating industrial wastewater range from electrodialysis to donnan dialysis to adsorption 18 in particular the methods can be classified as fluoride removal via activated alumina membrane technology ion exchange and precipitation as calcium fluoride caf2 19 20 commonly strategies employing adsorption based treatments represent the main routes for removal and destruction of contaminants in groundwater 18 21 23 numerous adsorbent materials have been used to find out efficient and economical defluoridating agents 18 24 ranging from classic materials like aluminum salt activated carbons clays ion exchange resins sulfonated coals magnesium compounds iron 25 27 to natural materials like chitosan and cellulose 28 31 and soils and minerals 32 several of these strategies involve the flocculant aluminium polychloride pac this compound obtained by partial hydrolysis of acidic aluminum chloride solutions is a well recognized tool used in coagulation flocculation wastewater treatment technologies 33 35 the caf2 solubility in water is around 17 mg l at 20 c that corresponds to 8 mg l of fluoride this value is intermediate between the italian law limits of 12 mg l of fluoride for sewage and 6 mg l for surface waters furthermore the fluoride concentrations in wastewaters can be higher than the above mentioned solubility of caf2 due to the influence of parameters like ph temperature and surface charge of particulate in fact the presence of particles molecules and ions can affect caf2 solubility and thus the removal efficiency based on any precipitation treatment therefore it becomes mandatory to implement this classical approach with further treatments in this direction actifluo is a commercial product containing the coagulant pac in coformulation with polymeric material ad hoc formulated for removing fluorides from the wastewater its mechanism of action is based on the further precipitation of fluorides to be applied after the already mentioned ca oh 2 pretreatment according to the manufacturer the product is recommended for wastewaters coming from steelworks and glassworks actifluo forms insoluble salts fluoride complexes in a very short time compared to normal treatments achieving very satisfactory results by using this commercial product discharged waters respect the italian law limits although actifluo is indicated by the producer brenntag as approved product for fluoride decontamination of water a in depth investigation on its efficiency as well as on its mechanism of action has never yet been reported in detail this paper is mainly devoted to get insight on the performances of the product with these purposes in mind the actifluo capability in removing fluoride ions was evaluated for real applications by analyzing four different wastewaters coming from factories in south of italy as well as synthetic wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the commercial coagulant actifluo was purchased from brenntag italy according to the technical information sheet by the manufacturer actifluo consists of aluminum polychloride pac and inorganic acid the actifluo is a pure product and it appears as a liquid throughout the paper the content of each chemical is referred to the commercial sample composition synthetic wastewaters samples were prepared by diluting with water a 1000 mg l hydrofluoric acid standard solution to get fluoride solutions in the concentration range of 1 500 mg l hydrochloric acid was purchased from sigma aldrich the industrial wastewaters were obtained from four different glass and dye companies in the south of italy labelled throughout the paper as w1 w2 w3 and w4 2 2 industrial wastewaters treatment according to what depicted in scheme 1 to reduce the fluoride concentration the industrial wastewaters were subjected to a pre treatment with calcium hydroxide then the supernatant was separated from the sludge in the first circulator and adjusted at ph 6 5 with hydrochloric acid and treated with the commercial product actifluo within a concentration range of 500 1500 mg l more frequently expressed in g m3 grams of product cubic meter of wastewaters the actifluo fluoride complex precipitates in the second circulator and the water coming out of the plant was then tested see next paragraph for fluoride concentration 2 3 fluoride determination the fluoride concentration during the industrial wastewater treatment was determined by colorimetric method cuvette test lck323 with a hach dr 2800 portable spectrophotometer the method is based on the reaction between fluoride ions with zirconium to form a colorless zirconium fluoride complex this causes the red zirconium lake initially present to lose color fluoride concentrations were determined for all the wastewaters before and after the ca oh 2 pre treatment and after the actifluo treatment actifluo was dosed with a pump checking the added volume with a graduated cylinder the dosage for wastewaters treatments was in the range of 500 g m3 1500 g m3 the amount of actifluo after the treatment with calcium hydroxide was tuned depending on the different characteristics of the wastewater in some cases it was necessary to increase the dosage to reach the desired final fluoride concentration in the case of laboratory prepared fluoride solutions the actifluo dosage was fixed to 600 mg l 2 4 Œ∂ potential and dynamic light scattering dls analysis the hydrodynamic diameter the polydispersity index pdi and the Œ∂ potential values of the actifluo treated synthetic wastewaters were determined using a malvern uk zetasizer nano zs90 commercial instrument operating with a 4 mw he ne laser 633 nm wavelength the average aggregate size and the pdi values were estimated with a fixed detector angle of 90 by a cumulant analysis of the autocorrelation function using the software provided by the manufacturer Œ∂ potential measurements were performed by checking the electrophoretic mobilities of the aggregates as determined by laser doppler velocimetry Œ∂ potential values were calculated from the smoluchowski approximation of the henry equation all measurements were performed at 25 c 36 to check the ph dependence of the actifluo product dls and Œ∂ potential measurements were performed on solutions with a fixed amount of actifluo 600 mg l and by adding suitable amounts of hydrochloric acid to cover the ph range 4 9 the surface accessibility to fluoride ions of pac in the commercial product actifluo was followed by means of Œ∂ potential measurements performed on buffered solutions 10 mm h2po4 hpo4 with a fixed amount of actifluo 600 mg l and by varying the fluoride concentration in the range of 0 500 mg l at ph 6 0 6 5 7 0 and 8 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 real samples fluoride removal the performances of actifluo have been tested for four different wastewaters coming from different types of companies all having high levels of fluoride in their water effluxes wastewaters were subjected to a pre treatment with calcium hydroxide before the actifluo treatment the fluoride removal treatment can be briefly schematized with a classic precipitation step with ca oh 2 followed by the pac containing actifluo commercial product treatment according to scheme 1 scheme 1 illustrates the waters pathway followed in the used plant as reported after the ca oh 2 treatment waters were put in the first sedimentator then the obtained supernatant was reacted with actifluo and after the treatment transferred in the second sedimentator the fundamental reactions taking place during the two steps treatment can be schematized as in eqs 1 and 2 1 ca2 2f caf2 2 actifluo f actifluo f this approach leads to the data depicted in fig 1 where the fluoride concentrations before and after each steps of scheme 1 are reported for the four real samples depending on the sample the initial fluoride concentrations varied between 10 000 mg l and 250 mg l see also table 1 as shown for all the companies the pre treatment was carried out in order to obtain a waste with a concentration of about 10 20 mg l this represents an important value since it allows to calculate the maximum fluoride concentration that can be removed with calcium hydroxide and is in reasonable agreement with the maximum solubility in water of calcium fluoride 17 mg l at 20 c reported in the literature 37 accordingly the fluoride concentrations after the pre treatment were between 20 5 mg l fig 1 and table 1 as reported after the pre treatment by adjusting the ph at 6 5 and supplying the commercial compound actifluo the fluoride concentration of the waters was further lowered via a precipitation process induced by the flocculant remarkably after the complete treatment the fluoride concentration in water reached levels 2 3 mg l well below the italian law limit concentration red dashed line in fig 1 for surface wastewaters this result evidenced that a further treatment after the preliminary treatment with ca oh 2 is necessary and that the extent of the efficiency of the commercial product under analysis can be considered quite satisfactory another aspect to evidence is that the actifluo efficiency was independent on the source of water effluxes coming either from dye or glass industry 3 2 role of ph and fluoride ions in order to get further insight on the mechanism of action of actifluo the role of ph has been investigated in some laboratory prepared fluoride solutions it is out of doubt that in this new product a pivotal role should be attributed to the presence of pac used for the coagulation and the precipitation process it is well established that among the different factors affecting the coagulation mechanisms ph and coagulant dosage play an important role recently wei and co workers reported a study performed on the coagulation mechanisms of kaolin suspension with pac at various ph 38 to this end the Œ∂ potential evaluation of the suspended particles represents the most reliable way to understand how ph dosage of pac and ratio fluoride pac will affect the charge neutralization zone and thus the coagulation efficiency 39 generally the stability of a colloid system depends on the balance between the repulsive electrostatic forces and the attractive van der waals forces the energy barrier created by the electrostatic repulsions should be large enough in order to shield the particles from coalescence progressions consequently preventing the incidence of aggregation occurrences when the repulsive energy is not sufficiently high the particles are prone to aggregation therefore particle size morphology and surface charge modification induced by ph variations should be called into play in justifying the efficiency observed for actifluo in fluoride removal fig 2 shows the Œ∂ potential and dls profiles for actifluo 600 mg l solutions by varying the ph value for the same sample as inferred the increase in ph leads to a change in the charge and a consequent rearrangement of the polymer that leads to a size increase probably due to aggregation see further from the dls measurements no further size increase was detected at ph 6 at this stage the samples showed a macroscopic increase in turbidity due to the precipitation of the stabilized polymer the onset of aggregation is clearly correlated to the particles surface charge as can be deduced from the Œ∂ potential values fig 2 left hand axis around a ph of 6 0 6 5 the particles surface charge practically neutralizes and the onset of precipitation is clearly detected fig 2 right hand axis from the Œ∂ potential measurements the role of oh species in saturating the positive active sites of pac was evidenced giving a clear indication concerning the charge neutralization zone ph 5 5 7 0 this evidence represents a confirmation of the pac high activity in binding anionic species at acidic phs 33 from the present investigation it appears evident that the mechanism of precipitation and the whole coagulation flocculation event is strongly related to the ph of the medium to get insight on the ph role on the precipitation process and thus in the fluoride removal efficiency Œ∂ potential measurements were performed on actifluo solutions of a well defined composition upon varying both the ph in the range of 6 0 8 0 by means of a 10 mm phosphate buffer and the fluoride concentration fig 3 this experiment was designed to make sure that ph and ionic strength values were kept constant at least within the ph range of 6 0 8 0 Œ∂ potential measurements indeed depend on ionic conductivity and thus by ionic strength besides the ph of the medium the complexation induced by mixing different charged pac molecules in actifluo and the negatively charged fluoride ion was performed to detect the lower limit of the ph range that allows the presence of positively charged sites on the aggregates able to bind negative ions thus allowing the precipitation process to take place as can be deduced from the data of fig 3 the Œ∂ potential profile of the titration of actifluo with fluoride ions at ph 6 starts at a positive value 32 mv by increasing the fluoride concentration the Œ∂ potential values started to decrease reaching a value close to the zero at 50 mg l of fluoride this concentration represents the maximum loading efficiency for fluoride ions at this ph and at fixed actifluo concentration this evidence shows that an uptake of fluoride ions occurs at ph 6 5 the initial Œ∂ potential of actifluo solutions in the absence of fluoride ions is close to the electrostatic neutrality see also inset of fig 3 upper panel since the fluoride uptake is mainly due to electrostatic interaction at this ph the amount of fluoride that can be bound from the actifluo is expected to be low as evidenced by the small reduction of the Œ∂ potential upon increasing the fluoride concentration when the surface charge is highly negative ph 7 0 and 8 0 no effects of the presence of fluoride ions on the Œ∂ potential were detected these evidences are a clear indication that the loading efficiency of actifluo towards anionic species is strongly ph related and that for ph values higher than 6 5 no fluoride uptake has to be expected the difference between the data reported in fig 2 and in fig 3 can be safely explained by the different conditions in which the measurements were performed the presence of even a slight amount of phosphate anions leads to a reduction of the initial i e in the absence of fluoride anions Œ∂ potential the mechanism that leads to the precipitation of the fluoride loaded pac is driven by the adsorption of ions onto a charged matrix electrostatic forces and by the attractive van der waals forces among the particles 40 the data here presented outline that the ph affects the delicate balance between the chloride ions present in the actifluo product the oh ions and the fluoride ions in fact it appears clear that by lowering the ph the net electrical charge of the aggregates strongly affects the physico chemical behavior from these data the identification of the charge neutralization zone around ph 6 7 can be deduced 41 42 this is in agreement with the operating conditions used for wastewaters treated in this study it should be recalled here that after the treatment with ca oh 2 the ph value of the wastewaters was around 10 and that the actifluo working ph was kept at 6 5 furthermore it is highlighted that for a high efficiency of the commercial product the ph must be high enough to guarantee the saturation of the complex charge neutralization zone but at the same time not too high in order to avoid the saturation of all the available positive sites 4 conclusions this study was focused on the product actifluo performances towards fluoride removal evaluated for real applications by analyzing different wastewaters coming from factories in the south of italy as well as synthetic wastewaters it was demonstrated that after the actifluo treatment the fluoride concentration in water reached levels well below the italian law limit additionally it was evidenced that the efficiency of actifluo was independent of the source of water effluxes coming either from dye or glass industry Œ∂ potential and dls experiments highlighted that the mechanism of precipitation and the whole coagulation flocculation event is strongly related to the ph of the medium in particular from Œ∂ potential measurements the role of oh

desalination the hypothesis was that coagulation can be effective at removing turbidity causing species alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates from csg associated water compositions both simulated and real csg associated water samples were treated using a jar tester and addition of either aluminium chlorohydrate ach aluminium sulphate alum or ferric chloride all coagulants reduced turbidity 95 and also removed alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates ca 29 for calcium 0 for magnesium 60 for barium 21 for strontium 33 for silica formation of a muscovite like material was predicted using aqmb process simulation software to be responsible for silicate removal and barium sulphate precipitated when alum was used increasing turbidity and salinity did not appear to exhibit a significant impact upon coagulant performance notably the co presence of solution turbidity and organic matter in real csg associated water samples promoted coagulant performance ca 75 for calcium 30 for magnesium 75 for barium 50 for strontium 48 for silica this observation was ascribed to the promotion of polymeric alb and colloidal alc species which were more effective materials for water clarification compared to monomeric ala species coagulation strategies appear prospective for the pre treatment of csg associated water samples to minimize fouling of downstream equipment and membranes employed for desalination keywords coal seam gas coal bed methane coagulation aluminium associated water turbidity 1 introduction production of coal seam gas csg also known as coal bed methane cbm has expanded in recent years 1 2 in the australian context the largest deposits of coal seam gas occur in queensland with particular commercial focus centered on the surat and bowen basins 3 as the coal seam gas is trapped in coal cleats due to water pressure extraction of the gas is invariably accompanied by the production of water especially in the initial years of the well life 4 towler et al 5 reported that volumes of associated water collected from operating csg wells in queensland were presently averaging 120 ml day 44 g l year the csg associated water is saline in character with salt concentrations ranging from ca 200 to 10 000 mg l 6 outside of australia the salinity of the associated water from csg operations can be significantly greater 7 9 dahm et al 7 created a geochemical database for csg associated water produced in the rocky mountain region of the usa which revealed that the chemical composition varied with coal type fresh water recharge availability and basin geology typically sodium bicarbonate and chloride species are dominant in csg associated water 10 12 minor species also present in the associated water include calcium magnesium dissolved silicates dissolved organic matter suspended solids sulphate aluminium iron manganese fluoride barium and strontium 1 6 13 there are strict regulations regarding the beneficial reuse of csg associated water not only may the salinity be too high but also the sodium adsorption ratio sar can be in excess of recommended limits for direct soil irrigation 14 vance et al 15 investigated the impact of irrigation of soils with csg associated water and noted that not only did soil electrical conductivity increase but also plant diversity decreased burkhardt et al 16 additionally discovered that irrigation with csg associated water could lead to a reduction in the oil content of crops and high sodium content in the leaves of mints therefore the general necessity of treating csg associated water prior to crop irrigation is illustrated reverse osmosis ro is the principal desalination process for treating csg associated water 17 20 ion exchange has also been reported to be especially viable for csg associated water with high alkalinity 21 23 with either technology there is a requirement to protect the membrane or resins from fouling 24 25 the selection of the most appropriate method for feedwater pre treatment is critical as it can represent up to 20 of the overall cost for desalination 26 in terms of the presence of suspended solids it has been reported that csg associated water can be highly turbid in some instances for example rebello et al 3 analyzed associated water from 150 different wells in the surat basin queensland and discovered that total suspended solids tss concentrations ranged from 5 to 7560 mg l qian et al 27 evaluated a pilot plant system for treating csg associated water using a central reverse osmosis unit notably the feed water was characterized as having a high turbidity value of 409 ntu hence a range of unit operations such as greensand filters sand filters coagulants and ultrafiltration were required to pre treat the water prior to the ro membranes the situation in queensland is exacerbated by the fact that regular flooding events occur which encourage surface run off to receiving waterways such as csg associated water storage dams 28 chemical coagulation methods are widely used for reducing the turbidity of water and wastewater samples 29 30 however the application of coagulants for the treatment of csg associated water has been limited lin et al 31 recently described the addition of aluminium based coagulants to both simulated and actual csg associated water samples dissolved silicates were removed effectively by the use of aluminium sulphate alum or aluminium chlorohydrate ach 85 a lesser but nonetheless significant decrease in the concentration of alkaline earth ions was also evident barium ions were most readily removed from the csg associated water sample whereas magnesium ions were relatively difficult to remediate iron based coagulants for csg associated water treatment have also been described 32 similar behaviour of ferric sulphate and ferric chloride to the aluminium based coagulants was observed 31 an interesting finding in these two studies was the reduced efficiency of inorganic coagulants when applied to real csg associated water compared to simulated solutions for example when ach was used as a coagulant the silicate removal was reduced to ca 50 the factors not addressed in simulated solutions included lack of species which caused turbidity organic carbon and potentially the presence of microorganisms such as algae inspection of existing literature has revealed that there are no published studies regarding the reduction in turbidity in csg associated water by the use of coagulants despite the importance to csg companies who need to ensure that the associated water does not foul and degrade downstream desalination equipment therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of both aluminium and iron based coagulants when added to simulated and actual csg associated water which comprised of a range of turbidity values the hypothesis was that coagulation methods may have to be tailored to adequately treat csg associated water which comprised of not only varying water composition but also differing levels of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon consequently the following research questions were addressed to support this latter idea 1 how does the identity of the inorganic coagulant impact csg associated water quality 2 which dissolved and suspended solids are removed as a function of coagulant dose 3 what are the properties of the flocs produced 4 is the salinity of the csg associated water important in terms of coagulant performance 5 what is the difference in behaviour between simulated and actual csg associated water jar tests were conducted in order to address the aforementioned challenges and computational modelling using aqmb water process software also applied in order to predict coagulant performance both simulated and real csg associated water were tested and turbidity produced by added kaolin was examined in accord with the methodology of mahdavi et al 33 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical coagulants two aluminium and one iron based coagulant was used in this study the properties are presented in table 1 2 2 chemicals analytical or laboratory grade chemicals in this study were supplied by chem supply pty ltd sigma aldrich bdh chemicals ltd acros organics and omega chemicals the following chemicals were used alcl3 6h2o h3bo3 bacl2 2h2o cacl2 2h2o fecl3 6h2o kcl mgcl2 6h2o

samples appropriate amounts of salts were weighed and mixed with deionized milli q water to form simulated csg associated water for each experiment 10 l of feedwater was prepared the chemicals were dissolved in water separately and mixed one by one in a 10 l container the container was manually agitated until the salts were fully dissolved an actual csg associated water sample from an operating site in queensland was also acquired for this study due to confidentiality reasons the identity of the company cannot be revealed the compositions and physical properties of the csg associated water samples used are displayed in table 2 2 4 jar tests a digitally controlled platypus jar tester supplied by aquagenics australia was used this apparatus consisted of four 2 l square jars with supernatant sample taps an 80 x 35 mm butterfly paddle was placed in each jar and this paddle could operate with programmable speed and time settings both jars and paddles were made of clear polycarbonate material jar tests were done according to astm d2035 13 the first stage involved rapid mixing of the coagulant at the rate of 100 rpm for 1 min the second maturation stage was operated at 30 rpm for 10 min from the jar tester manufacturers chart the velocity gradients were estimated as 195 and 32 s 1 for the rapid and slow mixing steps respectively following the maturation step the sample was allowed to settle under static conditions in a 1 l measuring cylinder for 30 min the level of the mud line was recorded regularly in order to determine floc settling rates after the settling period was completed 200 ml of supernatant was collected for further analysis 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 inductively coupled plasma optimal emission spectroscopy icp oes solutions were analysed using a perkin elmer optima 8300 dv icp oes instrument to identify elemental traces for online internal standardisation and auto dilution this instrument was connected with an esi sc 4dx auto sampler and prepfast 2 sample handling unit icp ms grade single element solutions supplied by high purity standards charleston usa were used to calibrate the instrument the samples were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm filter and diluted in a 1 10 ratio by purified nitric acid to reduce the ph to 2 2 5 2 solution ph and conductivity ph and conductivity were measured by a labchem cp benchtop conductivity tds ph mv temperature meter supplied by tps australia the ph meter was calibrated using ph buffer 4 00 7 00 and 10 06 standard solutions while the conductivity sensor k 10 meter was calibrated using 58 00 ms cm conductivity standard supplied by tps australia 2 5 3 apparent colour true colour and uv 254 nm absorbance a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure apparent colour true colour and uv254 nm absorbance platinum cobalt pt co standard method hach method 8025 and direct reading method hach method 10054 were used for measuring colour and uv 254 respectively solutions were filtered through 0 45 Œºm filters before measuring true colour 2 5 4 turbidity a hach 2100q portable turbidity meter was used to measure turbidity the meter was calibrated with 10 20 100 and 800 ntu turbidity standards both standard and sample vials were coated with silicone oil to avoid the effect of glass scratches 2 5 5 optical microscopy flocs images were taken by a nikon smz 1500 stereoscopic zoom microscope wet samples were placed on a frosted microscope slide in a very thin layer to capture the shape and color of floc 2 5 6 floc settling rates immediately after the slow mixing stage in the jar test experiments treated csg associated water samples were transferred to 1 l graduated cylinders and the settling height was recorded at time intervals of 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 and 60 min 2 6 process simulation aqmb software is a process engineering simulation package designed specifically for the water treatment industry 34 aqmb can simulate a wide range of unit operations including coagulant addition to suitable equipment such as solid contact clarifier thickener and lamella clarifier the clarifier had the following design criteria surface loading rate of 3 m h floc contact zone detention 5 min k factor to determine rake drive torque 70 n m and mixer power number 0 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of various coagulants for treatment of simulated csg associated water 3 1 1 solution physical parameters simulated csg associated water sample 1 was chosen to investigate the baseline performance of coagulant addition fig 2 displays the impact of coagulant identity and dose rate upon the solution conductivity and ph of the simulated csg associated water in general the solution ph gradually diminished with increasing coagulant dose with the precise rate of ph decrease dependent upon the coagulant type alum and ferric chloride induced the greatest reduction in solution ph which was ca 7 1 at the end of the coagulant addition stage notably the rate of ph decrease when aluminium chlorohydrate was employed was significantly slower than when either alum or ferric chloride was applied to the simulated csg associated water to understand the ph behaviour we need to consider eqs 1 3 1 a l 2 s o 4 3 14 h 2 o 2 al oh 3 6 h 3 s o 4 2 8 h 2 o 2 2 fec l 3 6 h 2 o 2 fe oh 3 6 h 6 c l 6 h 2 o 3 a l 2 oh 5 cl h 2 o 2 al oh 3 h c l it can be seen that for the same dose of iron or aluminium the amount of protons generated in the treated solution was the same for both alum and ferric chloride 6 h ions thus it was not unexpected that the ph profile would be similar in both instances in contrast only one h species was released when using ach eq 3 hence the decrease in solution ph was diminished compared to the other coagulants employed fig 1 also revealed that the solution conductivity remained relatively constant when dosing ach 2880 2900 Œºs cm whereas the conductivity steadily increased for both alum 2880 2980 Œºs cm and ferric chloride 2880 3010 Œºs cm coagulants which probably correlated with the greater evolution of protons and anions with these two coagulants compared to ach from fig 2 it was noted that a similar dose rate of 1 mmol l al or fe was required for alum and fecl3 to achieve high turbidity removal efficiency the initial turbidity was reduced from 210 to 6 44 ntu using fecl3 and to 8 33 ntu using alum coagulant baghvand et al 35 reported comparable behaviour when either alum or fecl3 was used to remove turbidity from a turbid water sample in contrast ach required a higher dose rate 3 4 mmol l as al to remove turbidity albeit it was noted that ach performed best as turbidity was diminished to 2 56 ntu in this study the apparent colour was also measured and the trend in value mirrored the turbidity behaviour with coagulant addition results not shown for sake of brevity alternatively the true colour values did not follow the turbidity trend when the coagulants were added to the turbid csg associated water sample the initial true colour of the raw water was 14 pt co unit which reduced to 6 pt co units for 0 76 mmol l fe dose as fecl3 when the fe dose was increased to 1 15 and 1 72 mmol l true colour values also increased to 15 and 22 pt co units respectively this behaviour was consistent with the presence of residual iron in the treated water which was measured as 0 046 0 169 and 0 210 mg l for iron doses of 0 76 1 15 and 1 72 mmol l respectively visually the colour of the effluent was yellow orange which was typical of dissolved iron species along with residual iron very fine flocs less than 0 45 Œºm remained in the filtered effluent and thus also may have contributed to the true colour values interestingly the true colour of ach treated csg associated water was recorded as 7 17 and 18 pt co units for al doses of 2 2 3 4 and 4 1 mmol l respectively fig 2 it was tentatively concluded that the true colour in this instance was due majorly to the presence of fine flocs in the solution alum addition similarly gave rise to true colour values which were best attributed to fine flocs in the sample 3 1 2 species removed from csg associated water due to coagulant addition no discernible impact upon the concentration of sodium or potassium ions was found when analysing the treated csg associated water samples for all three coagulants employed which was in agreement with previously published studies 31 32 fig 3 shows the degree of alkaline earth ion and dissolved silica removal from csg associated water for the three coagulants used in addition to changes in chloride and sulphate concentration in all cases barium ions were removed to the highest extent ca 42 to 64 followed by silica ca 25 to 40 calcium ca 17 to 31 and strontium ca 20 5 to 24 magnesium ions were not removed to any discernible level removal rates within errors in experimental measurement du et al 36 found in a study of cooling water softening with alkali and coagulant that barium was the easiest species to remove followed by silica and strontium the formation of highly insoluble barium carbonate was suggested to be the reason why barium concentration was reduced by the greatest extent o donnell et al 37 studied the removal of strontium ions from drinking water using both aluminium and iron based coagulants removal rates were typically less than 6 5 regardless of strontium concentration solution ph or turbidity level which was significantly less than the maximum value of 24 recorded in this study when ferric chloride was added however upon addition of calcium in the form of lime and soda ash once a ph of 8 8 was attained the removal of strontium ions was accelerated this behaviour was attributed to the formation of a solid solution of strontium ions in the lattice of precipitated calcium carbonate notably the presence of sufficient alkalinity was required to allow the precipitation of carbonate species to occur csg associated water inherently contains substantial amounts of bicarbonate and carbonate species 38 and thus the observed higher level of strontium ion removal in this solution compared to the surface water studied by o donnell et al 37 was not unexpected o donnell et al 37 also noted that magnesium ions did not exhibit similar chemistry to calcium ions in the water samples studied magnesium was not significantly removed until a ph 9 8 upon which time mg oh 2 precipitated this discovery was in accord with the data recorded in this investigation wherein the ph was a maximum of 9 in the coagulation tests and no magnesium precipitation was thus possible cheng et al 39 added alum to brackish water and found that up to 65 of dissolved silica could be removed these authors indicated that the silica removal was by means of precipitation with aluminium hydroxide flocs the chloride content of the csg associated water was controlled by the nature of the coagulant used in harmony with the fact that aluminium sulphate did not contain any chloride ions in its structure the chloride ion concentration in the treated csg associated water was not observed to change in value relative to the feed 602 8 mg l cl in contrast both ferric chloride 737 7 mg l cl and aluminium chlorohydrate 895 8 mg l cl released chloride ions into the treated csg associated water sample likewise the only coagulant to influence sulphate ion concentration in the csg associated water was alum lin et al 31 evaluated the behaviour of ach and alum coagulants to treat csg associated water without the presence of turbidity in this study dissolved silica was majorly removed using ach addition whereas barium strontium and magnesium ion concentrations were minimally impacted by the presence of the coagulant calcium was removed but only by ca 20 at a comparable csg associated water quality as kaolin was used as the source of turbidity it is possible that this material may have ion exchanged some of the alkaline earth ions from solution for example kleven and alsted 40 investigated the exchange behaviour of alkaline earth ions with kaolin and discovered that barium ions were preferred to calcium ions which was consistent with our data the dose rate of ach required to remove dissolved silica was not only significantly increased relative to the study of lin et al 31 when turbidity was present c f 2 24 compared to 0 56 mmol l al but also the removal of dissolved silica was inhibited c f 34 9 to 86 5 however it was noted when lin et al 31 investigated actual csg associated water from an operating gas field that the amount of aluminium dosed was higher up to 2 80 mmol l al and the degree of silica removal less 50 the real csg associated water sample did exhibit turbidity but only 8 4 ntu which was a value substantially less than used in csg associated water sample 1 210 ntu consequently it can be deduced that turbidity causing species can potentially inhibit coagulant performance in relation to the removal of dissolved species from csg associated water but that other factors must also be considered in this study turbidity was simulated using an inorganic material namely kaolin in an actual csg associated water sample it is entirely possible that the species responsible for turbidity could be partially organic in character 41 the presence of residual iron or aluminium was also considered following the coagulation process for ach and alum the aluminium concentrations were 0 03 and 0 02 mg l respectively whereas for ferric chloride the residual iron content was 0 17 mg l result not shown for sake of brevity these latter values were all within typical guidelines for water discharge 42 this data was also consistent with the report by knowles et al 42 that application of iron based coagulants normally results in a higher concentration of residual iron in solution compared to residual aluminium produced by aluminium based coagulants 3 1 3 simulation of coagulant performance using aqmb software a scenario was made wherein csg associated water sample 1 was dosed with either ach alum or ferric chloride and passed into a solid contact clarifier vessel an arbitrary flow rate of 100 m3 h was chosen for simulation purposes addition of ach was predicted to result in a slight increase in solution ph as the dose of ach was increased 8 99 to 9 40 table 3 whereas in the actual jar test the ph decreased to ca 8 1 a decrease in ph was expected on the basis of the process described in equation 3 in harmony with the increase in ph was a lowering of the bicarbonate concentration and increase in carbonate species the discrepancy in ph values between simulation and experimental needs to be considered in the context that the software is estimating the performance of a commercial clarifier unit complete with overflow and underflow streams whereas in a lab only a stirred solution is evaluated the influence of the underflow stream can be seen when inspecting the overflow flowrates when different coagulant doses are used a reduction from an initial flow rate of 99 99 m3 h to 79 35 m3 h was observed when 4 1 mmol l al was added moreover it is possible that dissolved carbon dioxide in the simulated csg associated water was displaced by oxygen in the air which would promote a rise in solution ph in all instances the removal of total suspended solids was estimated to be 96 5 which was in agreement with experimental studies fig 2 and concomitantly the turbidity was suitably diminished in value it was predicted that some residual aluminium would be present in the treated water albeit at about an order of magnitude greater than the experimental values likewise chloride ions increased in concentration as more ach was added which was in harmony with eq 3 notably aqmb suggested that the reduction in dissolved silicates induced by ach addition was related to the formation of muscovite table 4 muscovite materials have the general formula kal2 si3alo10 oh 2 potassium ions can be exchanged other single charged ions such as sodium a situation most likely for the current evaluation of csg associated water the only other precipitate which was proposed to be present was the gibbsite like floc formed by ach dosing a similar evaluation of alum addition to csg associated water was conducted using aqmb software table 5 in this instance the solution ph was predicted to significantly decrease as alum was added 8 99 to 6 93 which was in agreement with the data shown in fig 2 and described in eq 1 accordingly the total alkalinity of the solution decreased with the presence of carbonate almost eradicated and a gradual decline in the concentration of bicarbonate species as summarized in eqs 4 and 5 4 c o 3 2 h hc o 3 5 hc o 3 h c o 2 h 2 o again the removal of suspended solids and reduction in turbidity was successfully predicted in agreement with the experimental data similarly a substantial increase in sulphate species was estimated due to the process shown in eq 1 silicate species were again predicted to be removed from solution although only at the lowest coagulant dose rates in contrast to the results for ach addition alum dosing of the csg associated water was suggested to be able to remove some barium ions from solution table 5 table 6 provides some insight as the chemistry occurring as barite barium sulphate was indicated to precipitate at increasing amounts with greater alum addition muscovite was also predicted to form but the quantity precipitated decreased with increasing alum dose hence why silicate removal was estimated to decrease with increasing coagulant addition as described by hermosilla et al 43 alkaline ph favours the solubility of dissolved silicates therefore the lower ph values induced by addition of alum would inhibit the formation of aluminosilicate phases ferric chloride addition to csg associated water was evaluated using aqmb software table 7 consistent with the release of protons upon addition of ferric chloride eq 2 the solution ph was significantly reduced from 8 99 to 6 99 in harmony with the fact that both alum and ferric chloride release 3 protons per al or fe ion the magnitude of the ph reduction was comparable for both coagulants therefore the decrease in alkalinity reduction in carbonate concentration and decrease in bicarbonate concentration was not unexpected the degree of suspended solids removal was the same for all three coagulants studied due to the lack of sulphate addition to the csg associated water sample no barium removal was predicted moreover no silicate removal was estimated to form due to the lack of aluminium added to the solution in practice some silicate was recorded to be removed from the csg associated water albeit iron chloride was found to be the least effective of the three coagulants tested which was in agreement with the computational data the only precipitate formed according to aqmb was amorphous ferrihydrite feooh 3 1 4 floc characteristics when evaluating the effectiveness of coagulants one must consider the settling behaviour of the resulting flocs fig 4 shows the settling behaviour of flocs resulting from the addition of ach to csg associated water it is noted that no clear mud line was observed for either alum or ferric chloride albeit some dense flocs at the bottom of the vessel were visually observed and thus no discussion of settling behaviour could be provided fig 4 reveals that the rate of settling and volume of floc after 60 min depended upon the amount of coagulant added at the lowest dose studied there was no observable mud line which suggested the flocs were colloidal in nature however upon increasing the aluminium dose to 60 5 mg l 2 24 mmol l the flocs settled reasonably quickly with the majority of the settling completed within the initial 10 min period the final settled volume of floc was smallest for the least amount of coagulant used 2 24 mmol l al and increased as the amount of coagulant dosed was increased this behaviour may simply reflect the enhanced quantity of flocs formed in the process which occupied more volume of the treated solution correspondingly fig 4 confirmed that the amount of floc increased almost linearly with coagulant dose overall ferric chloride and aluminium chlorohydrate addition resulted in the highest mass of floc formed the higher floc mass of ferric chloride relative to alum could be explained simply as the difference in atomic mass of iron 55 845 amu compared to aluminium 26 982 amu for ach the same explanation did not appear to apply undoubtedly higher dose rates were used for ach and the predicted formation of gibbsite was substantially greater for ach compared to alum however the data in fig 4 was based upon moles of aluminium added and thus allowed direct comparison between alum and ach behaviour one possible explanation was that the floc composition for ach addition was different from that of alum for example chloride ions may have incorporated in the floc when using ach guseva et al 44 examined the electrochemical dissolution of aluminium in the presence of dissolved salt and suggested that chloride ions could incorporate within the floc material al oh cl and al oh 2cl the higher mass of chloride 35 45 amu relative to oh 17 amu would then explain the higher mass of floc recorded for ach compared with alum further information about the floc characteristics was gained from the optical microscopy images in fig 5 it was evident that ach and fecl3 produced very fine flocs with respect to alum flocs this observation was consistent with the aforementioned thoughts that the true colour for ach and fecl3 treated csg associated water was at least partially explained by the presence of fine flocs in these materials hence the higher true colour values compared to alum fig 2 lin et al 32 described the flocs produced when ferric chloride was added to csg associated water as thin networked which was comparable to the floc found in our study closer inspection of the optical images in fig 5 suggested that the ferric chloride flocs were fractal in nature li et al 45 examined flocs produced by addition of alum coagulant to a solution dosed with kaolin the flocs were also shown to be fractal in character which was again consistent with the image shown in fig 5 jiao et al 46 noted that the alum flocs were particularly suited to removing suspended solids via sweep flocculation chakraborti et al 47 also recorded the growth of flocs resulting from alum addition to lake water containing suspended clay particles the mechanism for clay removal varied from charge neutralization to sweep flocculation as time progressed 3 2 effect of csg associated water composition upon coagulant performance the composition of csg associated water differs greatly in practical situations 1 6 13 therefore it was necessary to examine the effect of coagulant performance with csg associated water of varying dissolved ion compositions furthermore an understanding of the differences between simulated and real csg associated water samples was also required consequently tests were conducted using ach coagulant to treat csg associated water sample 2 and a real csg associated water sample from an operating field in queensland figs 6 and 7 an important aspect was that the composition of csg associated water sample 2 was chosen to mimic that of the real csg associated water this situation facilitated not only insight into the factors which may not be taken into account in the simulated sample but also what the performance variations were the ph gradually reduced for both the csg associated water types which was consistent with the fact that ach does not release a significant amount of protons into solution fig 6 similarly minimal changes in solution conductivity were observed which was in agreement with the data shown in fig 2 it was noted that the ph diminished to a lesser extent with the high tds csg associated water sample compared to the low tds sample this behaviour can be attributed to the greater buffering capacity of the high tds sample although turbidity was majorly diminished for both water samples it was noted that the clarity of the real csg associated water was generally not as good as the simulated sample substantial differences in the true colour of the water samples after coagulation were apparent it was clear that the simulated sample did not replicate the real sample in terms of species which gave rise to a coloured solution the true colour was initially 62 pt co units for the real sample compared to 20 pt co units for the simulated sample when ach was added the true colour did not exhibit a definitive change from the initial value within error whereas the true colour of the csg associated water sample 2 steadily decreased with increasing coagulant dose the salinity of the csg associated water did not appear to significantly influence the ability of the coagulant to reduce turbidity as the removal performance was similar for both high and low tds samples this result was in contrast to the study of pontius 48 who found that reduction of turbidity using ach coagulant was challenging when attempting to clarify highly saline water with a tds of 70 000 mg l however it was noted that the tds of the csg associated water was significantly lower than 70 000 mg l as outlined by umar et al 49 higher salinity samples tend to solubilize aluminium coagulants and inhibit the formation of flocs therefore the recorded effectiveness of ach to remove turbidity over the salinity range evaluated for csg associated water was in accord with the relative stability of flocs under the experimental conditions in terms of what caused the colour in the real sample organic species would be expected to be present and support for this assertion was provided by the relatively high uv254 value shown in table 2 for the real sample in agreement le 50 analysed the composition of csg associated water from the narrabri gas project in new south wales and found not only dissolved organic carbon 14 3 mg l but also algae 600 000 cells ml the presence of organic material is problematic in terms of downstream stability of the reverse osmosis desalination unit and thus le 50 employed biocides to control the algae growth and a microfiltration stage de julio et al 51 reported that humic substances caused the true colour of aqueous samples to increase and the presence of such species in csg associated water is considered plausible coagulation is usually a reliable method to reduce normal organic matter from water samples staaks et al 52 evaluated the performance of both alum and ach to reduce organic content of three water samples from south australia these authors found that generally alum was more effective than ach for the water samples tested and that the reduction in organic content was between 31 and 52 greater ability to reduce organic matter levels by alum was correlated to relate to the degree of hydrophobic character of the organic material comparison of the true colour values for the high and low tds csg associated water samples revealed that the colour was lower as the salinity increased this behaviour may be due to the greater dissolution of small floc material 0 45 Œºms in the high salt solution 49 fig 7 shows the variation of dissolved ions in ach treated water as a function of coagulant dose overall the removal of alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates was promoted by use of real csg associated water compared to the simulated solution as stated above the major difference in the real water was the presence of dissolved organic carbon with the inorganic ions being very similar in concentration for both samples lin et al 31 found that the coagulation performance of a real csg associated water sample was inferior to simulated solutions it was thus inferred that the presence of dissolved organic carbon inhibited the coagulation flocculation process the contrary results in this study suggested that the combination of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon was actually promoting the removal of dissolved species from the csg associated water hermosilla et al 43 noted that organic species in solution can react with the inorganic ions from the coagulant xue et al 53 discovered that the co existence of silica and natural organic matter in river water influenced the characteristics of the floc in particular the formation of alb polymeric and alc colloidal species was promoted and the coagulation performance enhanced notably the only instance where coagulation of real csg associated water showed inferior performance was in relation to the presence of residual aluminium in solution kimura et al 54 studied the removal of nom in river water using aluminium based coagulants a key finding was that the formation of residual aluminium in solution was correlated with the increasing presence of ala species monomeric hence it was concluded that with real csg associated water samples the formation of alb and alc species was promoted and concomitantly the presence of ala was reduced comparison of the dissolved species removal efficiency between the high and low tds csg associated water samples did not reveal any significant difference in the performance of the ach coagulant this observation was in harmony with the conclusion that the floc species were majorly stable in waters of the salinity range studied the settling behaviour of the flocs formed by ach addition to csg associated water sample 2 and real csg associated water was also examined supplementary figure s1 in general the final settled volume of flocs formed with either water sample was similar and the time required for the flocs to settle satisfied typical commercial timeframes of 60 min or less the most notable aspect was the more rapid settling of the flocs generated by ach addition to real csg associated water during the initial 10 min period supplementary figure s2 provided greater insight into the settling process as the optimal microscopy images revealed that the flocs from the real csg associated water were denser than those for the simulated sample the observation of ach flocs which were different in shape from those shown in fig 5 was consistent with the established view that variables such as ph and water composition influence floc structure and performance 55 3 3 effect of turbidity level in csg associated water upon coagulant performance the impact of turbidity level was also investigated in relation to coagulant performance when treating csg associated water as this parameter is known to vary over a significant range in real csg associated water samples 3 hence three additional samples were prepared using real csg associated water wherein no additional kaolin was added no turbidity kaolin was added until turbidity was approximately 100 low turbidity and finally kaolin was dosed to give a turbidity of 800 ntu high turbidity ach coagulant was dosed to the three samples of varying turbidity and the results shown in fig 8 the changes in ph and solution conductivity were similar for all three water types regardless of turbidity level interestingly the effectiveness of the coagulant was essentially unaffected by the extent of turbidity present which was important in respect to practical application where turbidity of csg associated water was dependent upon the location of well the residence time in storage ponds and climatic conditions 3 it was observed that the true colour of the real csg associated water was related to the amount of kaolin added to create turbidity the trend was increasing turbidity as more kaolin was added although not in a linear relationship this observation indicated that organic species were not the only source of colour in the water sample the identity of the species causing the residual colour was not unequivocal the true colour measurement involved application of a 0 45 Œºm filter to the water sample hence if the kaolin was causing the detection of colour in solution then these materials would be of very fine size the data displayed in fig 8 was also enlightening in relation to providing an insight as to how species such as alkaline earth ions and silicates were removed from solution one possibility for the reduction in alkaline earth ion concentration was the ion exchange of these ions with surface sites on the kaolin for example ockert et al 56 investigated the ion exchange properties of kaolin and calcium ions in a marine setting not only was the exchange relatively rapid ca 2 min but also up to 20 of the exchange sites were occupied by calcium ions even with the strong competition from the abundant sodium ions in the seawater medium gasco and mendez 57 also studied the exchange behaviour of calcium magnesium sodium and potassium ions with kaolin in aqueous solution magnesium and calcium ions were preferentially sorbed on the kaolin surface and the uptake of these ions was favoured by increasing ph 6 5 9 and greater initial concentrations in solution nevertheless as shown in fig 8 the data recorded was essentially the same whether kaolin was present or not in the csg associated water sample hence the reduction in concentration of both alkaline earth ions and silicate species was due to not only the coagulant addition but also from fig 7 the presence of organic matter this latter conclusion supported the deduction that alb and alc species were promoted when both kaolin and dissolved organic carbon were present in the csg associated water sample 4 conclusions addition of inorganic coagulants can effectively reduce not only the turbidity of csg associated water but also the presence of alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates all three coagulants studied were capable of reducing the content of alkaline earth ions however aluminium based coagulants were preferred in terms of their ability to promote the formation of aluminosilicates which were responsible for the reduction in dissolved silicate content of the csg associated water modelling predicted that muscovite type minerals were formed due to the interaction of dissolved aluminium and silicate species ach did not introduce sulphate species to the csg associated water unlike alum therefore this may be a preferable trait depending upon which downstream technologies are employed to desalinate the water sample the flocs produced by coagulant addition generally settled within 60 min the alum based flocs were larger and fractal in character however problems were found in relation to the settling ability of flocs produced from both alum and ferric chloride addition to csg associated water therefore consideration must be given to not only the extent of turbidity and dissolved species removal from solution but also the practicality of floc separation from the treated water sample coagulants performed equally as well under a wide range of turbidity values a key finding was that the co presence of kaolin and dissolved organic carbon in real csg associated water promoted the formation of alb and alc species the polymeric and colloidal forms of aluminium complexes in solution performed better than solutions where monomeric ala species were relatively more abundant simulated solutions could not adequately mimic the range of organic species which may be in csg associated water hence testing of real solutions was recommended the salinity of the csg associated water did not appear to be a critical parameter with respect to coagulant performance this observation suggested that coagulation processes may cope with the variation in csg associated water quality expected in an actual csg operation coagulation is currently not a core technology for treating csg associated water yet this study has shown that it can be highly effective at reducing the impact of problematic alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates which both can foul downstream membranes used for desalination acknowledgements

14492,this study demonstrated the value of coagulation approaches for control of species in coal seam gas csg associated water which can result in scaling of downstream membranes and equipment during desalination the hypothesis was that coagulation can be effective at removing turbidity causing species alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates from csg associated water compositions both simulated and real csg associated water samples were treated using a jar tester and addition of either aluminium chlorohydrate ach aluminium sulphate alum or ferric chloride all coagulants reduced turbidity 95 and also removed alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates ca 29 for calcium 0 for magnesium 60 for barium 21 for strontium 33 for silica formation of a muscovite like material was predicted using aqmb process simulation software to be responsible for silicate removal and barium sulphate precipitated when alum was used increasing turbidity and salinity did not appear to exhibit a significant impact upon coagulant performance notably the co presence of solution turbidity and organic matter in real csg associated water samples promoted coagulant performance ca 75 for calcium 30 for magnesium 75 for barium 50 for strontium 48 for silica this observation was ascribed to the promotion of polymeric alb and colloidal alc species which were more effective materials for water clarification compared to monomeric ala species coagulation strategies appear prospective for the pre treatment of csg associated water samples to minimize fouling of downstream equipment and membranes employed for desalination keywords coal seam gas coal bed methane coagulation aluminium associated water turbidity 1 introduction production of coal seam gas csg also known as coal bed methane cbm has expanded in recent years 1 2 in the australian context the largest deposits of coal seam gas occur in queensland with particular commercial focus centered on the surat and bowen basins 3 as the coal seam gas is trapped in coal cleats due to water pressure extraction of the gas is invariably accompanied by the production of water especially in the initial years of the well life 4 towler et al 5 reported that volumes of associated water collected from operating csg wells in queensland were presently averaging 120 ml day 44 g l year the csg associated water is saline in character with salt concentrations ranging from ca 200 to 10 000 mg l 6 outside of australia the salinity of the associated water from csg operations can be significantly greater 7 9 dahm et al 7 created a geochemical database for csg associated water produced in the rocky mountain region of the usa which revealed that the chemical composition varied with coal type fresh water recharge availability and basin geology typically sodium bicarbonate and chloride species are dominant in csg associated water 10 12 minor species also present in the associated water include calcium magnesium dissolved silicates dissolved organic matter suspended solids sulphate aluminium iron manganese fluoride barium and strontium 1 6 13 there are strict regulations regarding the beneficial reuse of csg associated water not only may the salinity be too high but also the sodium adsorption ratio sar can be in excess of recommended limits for direct soil irrigation 14 vance et al 15 investigated the impact of irrigation of soils with csg associated water and noted that not only did soil electrical conductivity increase but also plant diversity decreased burkhardt et al 16 additionally discovered that irrigation with csg associated water could lead to a reduction in the oil content of crops and high sodium content in the leaves of mints therefore the general necessity of treating csg associated water prior to crop irrigation is illustrated reverse osmosis ro is the principal desalination process for treating csg associated water 17 20 ion exchange has also been reported to be especially viable for csg associated water with high alkalinity 21 23 with either technology there is a requirement to protect the membrane or resins from fouling 24 25 the selection of the most appropriate method for feedwater pre treatment is critical as it can represent up to 20 of the overall cost for desalination 26 in terms of the presence of suspended solids it has been reported that csg associated water can be highly turbid in some instances for example rebello et al 3 analyzed associated water from 150 different wells in the surat basin queensland and discovered that total suspended solids tss concentrations ranged from 5 to 7560 mg l qian et al 27 evaluated a pilot plant system for treating csg associated water using a central reverse osmosis unit notably the feed water was characterized as having a high turbidity value of 409 ntu hence a range of unit operations such as greensand filters sand filters coagulants and ultrafiltration were required to pre treat the water prior to the ro membranes the situation in queensland is exacerbated by the fact that regular flooding events occur which encourage surface run off to receiving waterways such as csg associated water storage dams 28 chemical coagulation methods are widely used for reducing the turbidity of water and wastewater samples 29 30 however the application of coagulants for the treatment of csg associated water has been limited lin et al 31 recently described the addition of aluminium based coagulants to both simulated and actual csg associated water samples dissolved silicates were removed effectively by the use of aluminium sulphate alum or aluminium chlorohydrate ach 85 a lesser but nonetheless significant decrease in the concentration of alkaline earth ions was also evident barium ions were most readily removed from the csg associated water sample whereas magnesium ions were relatively difficult to remediate iron based coagulants for csg associated water treatment have also been described 32 similar behaviour of ferric sulphate and ferric chloride to the aluminium based coagulants was observed 31 an interesting finding in these two studies was the reduced efficiency of inorganic coagulants when applied to real csg associated water compared to simulated solutions for example when ach was used as a coagulant the silicate removal was reduced to ca 50 the factors not addressed in simulated solutions included lack of species which caused turbidity organic carbon and potentially the presence of microorganisms such as algae inspection of existing literature has revealed that there are no published studies regarding the reduction in turbidity in csg associated water by the use of coagulants despite the importance to csg companies who need to ensure that the associated water does not foul and degrade downstream desalination equipment therefore the objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of both aluminium and iron based coagulants when added to simulated and actual csg associated water which comprised of a range of turbidity values the hypothesis was that coagulation methods may have to be tailored to adequately treat csg associated water which comprised of not only varying water composition but also differing levels of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon consequently the following research questions were addressed to support this latter idea 1 how does the identity of the inorganic coagulant impact csg associated water quality 2 which dissolved and suspended solids are removed as a function of coagulant dose 3 what are the properties of the flocs produced 4 is the salinity of the csg associated water important in terms of coagulant performance 5 what is the difference in behaviour between simulated and actual csg associated water jar tests were conducted in order to address the aforementioned challenges and computational modelling using aqmb water process software also applied in order to predict coagulant performance both simulated and real csg associated water were tested and turbidity produced by added kaolin was examined in accord with the methodology of mahdavi et al 33 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical coagulants two aluminium and one iron based coagulant was used in this study the properties are presented in table 1 2 2 chemicals analytical or laboratory grade chemicals in this study were supplied by chem supply pty ltd sigma aldrich bdh chemicals ltd acros organics and omega chemicals the following chemicals were used alcl3 6h2o h3bo3 bacl2 2h2o cacl2 2h2o fecl3 6h2o kcl mgcl2 6h2o

samples appropriate amounts of salts were weighed and mixed with deionized milli q water to form simulated csg associated water for each experiment 10 l of feedwater was prepared the chemicals were dissolved in water separately and mixed one by one in a 10 l container the container was manually agitated until the salts were fully dissolved an actual csg associated water sample from an operating site in queensland was also acquired for this study due to confidentiality reasons the identity of the company cannot be revealed the compositions and physical properties of the csg associated water samples used are displayed in table 2 2 4 jar tests a digitally controlled platypus jar tester supplied by aquagenics australia was used this apparatus consisted of four 2 l square jars with supernatant sample taps an 80 x 35 mm butterfly paddle was placed in each jar and this paddle could operate with programmable speed and time settings both jars and paddles were made of clear polycarbonate material jar tests were done according to astm d2035 13 the first stage involved rapid mixing of the coagulant at the rate of 100 rpm for 1 min the second maturation stage was operated at 30 rpm for 10 min from the jar tester manufacturers chart the velocity gradients were estimated as 195 and 32 s 1 for the rapid and slow mixing steps respectively following the maturation step the sample was allowed to settle under static conditions in a 1 l measuring cylinder for 30 min the level of the mud line was recorded regularly in order to determine floc settling rates after the settling period was completed 200 ml of supernatant was collected for further analysis 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 inductively coupled plasma optimal emission spectroscopy icp oes solutions were analysed using a perkin elmer optima 8300 dv icp oes instrument to identify elemental traces for online internal standardisation and auto dilution this instrument was connected with an esi sc 4dx auto sampler and prepfast 2 sample handling unit icp ms grade single element solutions supplied by high purity standards charleston usa were used to calibrate the instrument the samples were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm filter and diluted in a 1 10 ratio by purified nitric acid to reduce the ph to 2 2 5 2 solution ph and conductivity ph and conductivity were measured by a labchem cp benchtop conductivity tds ph mv temperature meter supplied by tps australia the ph meter was calibrated using ph buffer 4 00 7 00 and 10 06 standard solutions while the conductivity sensor k 10 meter was calibrated using 58 00 ms cm conductivity standard supplied by tps australia 2 5 3 apparent colour true colour and uv 254 nm absorbance a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrophotometer was used to measure apparent colour true colour and uv254 nm absorbance platinum cobalt pt co standard method hach method 8025 and direct reading method hach method 10054 were used for measuring colour and uv 254 respectively solutions were filtered through 0 45 Œºm filters before measuring true colour 2 5 4 turbidity a hach 2100q portable turbidity meter was used to measure turbidity the meter was calibrated with 10 20 100 and 800 ntu turbidity standards both standard and sample vials were coated with silicone oil to avoid the effect of glass scratches 2 5 5 optical microscopy flocs images were taken by a nikon smz 1500 stereoscopic zoom microscope wet samples were placed on a frosted microscope slide in a very thin layer to capture the shape and color of floc 2 5 6 floc settling rates immediately after the slow mixing stage in the jar test experiments treated csg associated water samples were transferred to 1 l graduated cylinders and the settling height was recorded at time intervals of 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 and 60 min 2 6 process simulation aqmb software is a process engineering simulation package designed specifically for the water treatment industry 34 aqmb can simulate a wide range of unit operations including coagulant addition to suitable equipment such as solid contact clarifier thickener and lamella clarifier the clarifier had the following design criteria surface loading rate of 3 m h floc contact zone detention 5 min k factor to determine rake drive torque 70 n m and mixer power number 0 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of various coagulants for treatment of simulated csg associated water 3 1 1 solution physical parameters simulated csg associated water sample 1 was chosen to investigate the baseline performance of coagulant addition fig 2 displays the impact of coagulant identity and dose rate upon the solution conductivity and ph of the simulated csg associated water in general the solution ph gradually diminished with increasing coagulant dose with the precise rate of ph decrease dependent upon the coagulant type alum and ferric chloride induced the greatest reduction in solution ph which was ca 7 1 at the end of the coagulant addition stage notably the rate of ph decrease when aluminium chlorohydrate was employed was significantly slower than when either alum or ferric chloride was applied to the simulated csg associated water to understand the ph behaviour we need to consider eqs 1 3 1 a l 2 s o 4 3 14 h 2 o 2 al oh 3 6 h 3 s o 4 2 8 h 2 o 2 2 fec l 3 6 h 2 o 2 fe oh 3 6 h 6 c l 6 h 2 o 3 a l 2 oh 5 cl h 2 o 2 al oh 3 h c l it can be seen that for the same dose of iron or aluminium the amount of protons generated in the treated solution was the same for both alum and ferric chloride 6 h ions thus it was not unexpected that the ph profile would be similar in both instances in contrast only one h species was released when using ach eq 3 hence the decrease in solution ph was diminished compared to the other coagulants employed fig 1 also revealed that the solution conductivity remained relatively constant when dosing ach 2880 2900 Œºs cm whereas the conductivity steadily increased for both alum 2880 2980 Œºs cm and ferric chloride 2880 3010 Œºs cm coagulants which probably correlated with the greater evolution of protons and anions with these two coagulants compared to ach from fig 2 it was noted that a similar dose rate of 1 mmol l al or fe was required for alum and fecl3 to achieve high turbidity removal efficiency the initial turbidity was reduced from 210 to 6 44 ntu using fecl3 and to 8 33 ntu using alum coagulant baghvand et al 35 reported comparable behaviour when either alum or fecl3 was used to remove turbidity from a turbid water sample in contrast ach required a higher dose rate 3 4 mmol l as al to remove turbidity albeit it was noted that ach performed best as turbidity was diminished to 2 56 ntu in this study the apparent colour was also measured and the trend in value mirrored the turbidity behaviour with coagulant addition results not shown for sake of brevity alternatively the true colour values did not follow the turbidity trend when the coagulants were added to the turbid csg associated water sample the initial true colour of the raw water was 14 pt co unit which reduced to 6 pt co units for 0 76 mmol l fe dose as fecl3 when the fe dose was increased to 1 15 and 1 72 mmol l true colour values also increased to 15 and 22 pt co units respectively this behaviour was consistent with the presence of residual iron in the treated water which was measured as 0 046 0 169 and 0 210 mg l for iron doses of 0 76 1 15 and 1 72 mmol l respectively visually the colour of the effluent was yellow orange which was typical of dissolved iron species along with residual iron very fine flocs less than 0 45 Œºm remained in the filtered effluent and thus also may have contributed to the true colour values interestingly the true colour of ach treated csg associated water was recorded as 7 17 and 18 pt co units for al doses of 2 2 3 4 and 4 1 mmol l respectively fig 2 it was tentatively concluded that the true colour in this instance was due majorly to the presence of fine flocs in the solution alum addition similarly gave rise to true colour values which were best attributed to fine flocs in the sample 3 1 2 species removed from csg associated water due to coagulant addition no discernible impact upon the concentration of sodium or potassium ions was found when analysing the treated csg associated water samples for all three coagulants employed which was in agreement with previously published studies 31 32 fig 3 shows the degree of alkaline earth ion and dissolved silica removal from csg associated water for the three coagulants used in addition to changes in chloride and sulphate concentration in all cases barium ions were removed to the highest extent ca 42 to 64 followed by silica ca 25 to 40 calcium ca 17 to 31 and strontium ca 20 5 to 24 magnesium ions were not removed to any discernible level removal rates within errors in experimental measurement du et al 36 found in a study of cooling water softening with alkali and coagulant that barium was the easiest species to remove followed by silica and strontium the formation of highly insoluble barium carbonate was suggested to be the reason why barium concentration was reduced by the greatest extent o donnell et al 37 studied the removal of strontium ions from drinking water using both aluminium and iron based coagulants removal rates were typically less than 6 5 regardless of strontium concentration solution ph or turbidity level which was significantly less than the maximum value of 24 recorded in this study when ferric chloride was added however upon addition of calcium in the form of lime and soda ash once a ph of 8 8 was attained the removal of strontium ions was accelerated this behaviour was attributed to the formation of a solid solution of strontium ions in the lattice of precipitated calcium carbonate notably the presence of sufficient alkalinity was required to allow the precipitation of carbonate species to occur csg associated water inherently contains substantial amounts of bicarbonate and carbonate species 38 and thus the observed higher level of strontium ion removal in this solution compared to the surface water studied by o donnell et al 37 was not unexpected o donnell et al 37 also noted that magnesium ions did not exhibit similar chemistry to calcium ions in the water samples studied magnesium was not significantly removed until a ph 9 8 upon which time mg oh 2 precipitated this discovery was in accord with the data recorded in this investigation wherein the ph was a maximum of 9 in the coagulation tests and no magnesium precipitation was thus possible cheng et al 39 added alum to brackish water and found that up to 65 of dissolved silica could be removed these authors indicated that the silica removal was by means of precipitation with aluminium hydroxide flocs the chloride content of the csg associated water was controlled by the nature of the coagulant used in harmony with the fact that aluminium sulphate did not contain any chloride ions in its structure the chloride ion concentration in the treated csg associated water was not observed to change in value relative to the feed 602 8 mg l cl in contrast both ferric chloride 737 7 mg l cl and aluminium chlorohydrate 895 8 mg l cl released chloride ions into the treated csg associated water sample likewise the only coagulant to influence sulphate ion concentration in the csg associated water was alum lin et al 31 evaluated the behaviour of ach and alum coagulants to treat csg associated water without the presence of turbidity in this study dissolved silica was majorly removed using ach addition whereas barium strontium and magnesium ion concentrations were minimally impacted by the presence of the coagulant calcium was removed but only by ca 20 at a comparable csg associated water quality as kaolin was used as the source of turbidity it is possible that this material may have ion exchanged some of the alkaline earth ions from solution for example kleven and alsted 40 investigated the exchange behaviour of alkaline earth ions with kaolin and discovered that barium ions were preferred to calcium ions which was consistent with our data the dose rate of ach required to remove dissolved silica was not only significantly increased relative to the study of lin et al 31 when turbidity was present c f 2 24 compared to 0 56 mmol l al but also the removal of dissolved silica was inhibited c f 34 9 to 86 5 however it was noted when lin et al 31 investigated actual csg associated water from an operating gas field that the amount of aluminium dosed was higher up to 2 80 mmol l al and the degree of silica removal less 50 the real csg associated water sample did exhibit turbidity but only 8 4 ntu which was a value substantially less than used in csg associated water sample 1 210 ntu consequently it can be deduced that turbidity causing species can potentially inhibit coagulant performance in relation to the removal of dissolved species from csg associated water but that other factors must also be considered in this study turbidity was simulated using an inorganic material namely kaolin in an actual csg associated water sample it is entirely possible that the species responsible for turbidity could be partially organic in character 41 the presence of residual iron or aluminium was also considered following the coagulation process for ach and alum the aluminium concentrations were 0 03 and 0 02 mg l respectively whereas for ferric chloride the residual iron content was 0 17 mg l result not shown for sake of brevity these latter values were all within typical guidelines for water discharge 42 this data was also consistent with the report by knowles et al 42 that application of iron based coagulants normally results in a higher concentration of residual iron in solution compared to residual aluminium produced by aluminium based coagulants 3 1 3 simulation of coagulant performance using aqmb software a scenario was made wherein csg associated water sample 1 was dosed with either ach alum or ferric chloride and passed into a solid contact clarifier vessel an arbitrary flow rate of 100 m3 h was chosen for simulation purposes addition of ach was predicted to result in a slight increase in solution ph as the dose of ach was increased 8 99 to 9 40 table 3 whereas in the actual jar test the ph decreased to ca 8 1 a decrease in ph was expected on the basis of the process described in equation 3 in harmony with the increase in ph was a lowering of the bicarbonate concentration and increase in carbonate species the discrepancy in ph values between simulation and experimental needs to be considered in the context that the software is estimating the performance of a commercial clarifier unit complete with overflow and underflow streams whereas in a lab only a stirred solution is evaluated the influence of the underflow stream can be seen when inspecting the overflow flowrates when different coagulant doses are used a reduction from an initial flow rate of 99 99 m3 h to 79 35 m3 h was observed when 4 1 mmol l al was added moreover it is possible that dissolved carbon dioxide in the simulated csg associated water was displaced by oxygen in the air which would promote a rise in solution ph in all instances the removal of total suspended solids was estimated to be 96 5 which was in agreement with experimental studies fig 2 and concomitantly the turbidity was suitably diminished in value it was predicted that some residual aluminium would be present in the treated water albeit at about an order of magnitude greater than the experimental values likewise chloride ions increased in concentration as more ach was added which was in harmony with eq 3 notably aqmb suggested that the reduction in dissolved silicates induced by ach addition was related to the formation of muscovite table 4 muscovite materials have the general formula kal2 si3alo10 oh 2 potassium ions can be exchanged other single charged ions such as sodium a situation most likely for the current evaluation of csg associated water the only other precipitate which was proposed to be present was the gibbsite like floc formed by ach dosing a similar evaluation of alum addition to csg associated water was conducted using aqmb software table 5 in this instance the solution ph was predicted to significantly decrease as alum was added 8 99 to 6 93 which was in agreement with the data shown in fig 2 and described in eq 1 accordingly the total alkalinity of the solution decreased with the presence of carbonate almost eradicated and a gradual decline in the concentration of bicarbonate species as summarized in eqs 4 and 5 4 c o 3 2 h hc o 3 5 hc o 3 h c o 2 h 2 o again the removal of suspended solids and reduction in turbidity was successfully predicted in agreement with the experimental data similarly a substantial increase in sulphate species was estimated due to the process shown in eq 1 silicate species were again predicted to be removed from solution although only at the lowest coagulant dose rates in contrast to the results for ach addition alum dosing of the csg associated water was suggested to be able to remove some barium ions from solution table 5 table 6 provides some insight as the chemistry occurring as barite barium sulphate was indicated to precipitate at increasing amounts with greater alum addition muscovite was also predicted to form but the quantity precipitated decreased with increasing alum dose hence why silicate removal was estimated to decrease with increasing coagulant addition as described by hermosilla et al 43 alkaline ph favours the solubility of dissolved silicates therefore the lower ph values induced by addition of alum would inhibit the formation of aluminosilicate phases ferric chloride addition to csg associated water was evaluated using aqmb software table 7 consistent with the release of protons upon addition of ferric chloride eq 2 the solution ph was significantly reduced from 8 99 to 6 99 in harmony with the fact that both alum and ferric chloride release 3 protons per al or fe ion the magnitude of the ph reduction was comparable for both coagulants therefore the decrease in alkalinity reduction in carbonate concentration and decrease in bicarbonate concentration was not unexpected the degree of suspended solids removal was the same for all three coagulants studied due to the lack of sulphate addition to the csg associated water sample no barium removal was predicted moreover no silicate removal was estimated to form due to the lack of aluminium added to the solution in practice some silicate was recorded to be removed from the csg associated water albeit iron chloride was found to be the least effective of the three coagulants tested which was in agreement with the computational data the only precipitate formed according to aqmb was amorphous ferrihydrite feooh 3 1 4 floc characteristics when evaluating the effectiveness of coagulants one must consider the settling behaviour of the resulting flocs fig 4 shows the settling behaviour of flocs resulting from the addition of ach to csg associated water it is noted that no clear mud line was observed for either alum or ferric chloride albeit some dense flocs at the bottom of the vessel were visually observed and thus no discussion of settling behaviour could be provided fig 4 reveals that the rate of settling and volume of floc after 60 min depended upon the amount of coagulant added at the lowest dose studied there was no observable mud line which suggested the flocs were colloidal in nature however upon increasing the aluminium dose to 60 5 mg l 2 24 mmol l the flocs settled reasonably quickly with the majority of the settling completed within the initial 10 min period the final settled volume of floc was smallest for the least amount of coagulant used 2 24 mmol l al and increased as the amount of coagulant dosed was increased this behaviour may simply reflect the enhanced quantity of flocs formed in the process which occupied more volume of the treated solution correspondingly fig 4 confirmed that the amount of floc increased almost linearly with coagulant dose overall ferric chloride and aluminium chlorohydrate addition resulted in the highest mass of floc formed the higher floc mass of ferric chloride relative to alum could be explained simply as the difference in atomic mass of iron 55 845 amu compared to aluminium 26 982 amu for ach the same explanation did not appear to apply undoubtedly higher dose rates were used for ach and the predicted formation of gibbsite was substantially greater for ach compared to alum however the data in fig 4 was based upon moles of aluminium added and thus allowed direct comparison between alum and ach behaviour one possible explanation was that the floc composition for ach addition was different from that of alum for example chloride ions may have incorporated in the floc when using ach guseva et al 44 examined the electrochemical dissolution of aluminium in the presence of dissolved salt and suggested that chloride ions could incorporate within the floc material al oh cl and al oh 2cl the higher mass of chloride 35 45 amu relative to oh 17 amu would then explain the higher mass of floc recorded for ach compared with alum further information about the floc characteristics was gained from the optical microscopy images in fig 5 it was evident that ach and fecl3 produced very fine flocs with respect to alum flocs this observation was consistent with the aforementioned thoughts that the true colour for ach and fecl3 treated csg associated water was at least partially explained by the presence of fine flocs in these materials hence the higher true colour values compared to alum fig 2 lin et al 32 described the flocs produced when ferric chloride was added to csg associated water as thin networked which was comparable to the floc found in our study closer inspection of the optical images in fig 5 suggested that the ferric chloride flocs were fractal in nature li et al 45 examined flocs produced by addition of alum coagulant to a solution dosed with kaolin the flocs were also shown to be fractal in character which was again consistent with the image shown in fig 5 jiao et al 46 noted that the alum flocs were particularly suited to removing suspended solids via sweep flocculation chakraborti et al 47 also recorded the growth of flocs resulting from alum addition to lake water containing suspended clay particles the mechanism for clay removal varied from charge neutralization to sweep flocculation as time progressed 3 2 effect of csg associated water composition upon coagulant performance the composition of csg associated water differs greatly in practical situations 1 6 13 therefore it was necessary to examine the effect of coagulant performance with csg associated water of varying dissolved ion compositions furthermore an understanding of the differences between simulated and real csg associated water samples was also required consequently tests were conducted using ach coagulant to treat csg associated water sample 2 and a real csg associated water sample from an operating field in queensland figs 6 and 7 an important aspect was that the composition of csg associated water sample 2 was chosen to mimic that of the real csg associated water this situation facilitated not only insight into the factors which may not be taken into account in the simulated sample but also what the performance variations were the ph gradually reduced for both the csg associated water types which was consistent with the fact that ach does not release a significant amount of protons into solution fig 6 similarly minimal changes in solution conductivity were observed which was in agreement with the data shown in fig 2 it was noted that the ph diminished to a lesser extent with the high tds csg associated water sample compared to the low tds sample this behaviour can be attributed to the greater buffering capacity of the high tds sample although turbidity was majorly diminished for both water samples it was noted that the clarity of the real csg associated water was generally not as good as the simulated sample substantial differences in the true colour of the water samples after coagulation were apparent it was clear that the simulated sample did not replicate the real sample in terms of species which gave rise to a coloured solution the true colour was initially 62 pt co units for the real sample compared to 20 pt co units for the simulated sample when ach was added the true colour did not exhibit a definitive change from the initial value within error whereas the true colour of the csg associated water sample 2 steadily decreased with increasing coagulant dose the salinity of the csg associated water did not appear to significantly influence the ability of the coagulant to reduce turbidity as the removal performance was similar for both high and low tds samples this result was in contrast to the study of pontius 48 who found that reduction of turbidity using ach coagulant was challenging when attempting to clarify highly saline water with a tds of 70 000 mg l however it was noted that the tds of the csg associated water was significantly lower than 70 000 mg l as outlined by umar et al 49 higher salinity samples tend to solubilize aluminium coagulants and inhibit the formation of flocs therefore the recorded effectiveness of ach to remove turbidity over the salinity range evaluated for csg associated water was in accord with the relative stability of flocs under the experimental conditions in terms of what caused the colour in the real sample organic species would be expected to be present and support for this assertion was provided by the relatively high uv254 value shown in table 2 for the real sample in agreement le 50 analysed the composition of csg associated water from the narrabri gas project in new south wales and found not only dissolved organic carbon 14 3 mg l but also algae 600 000 cells ml the presence of organic material is problematic in terms of downstream stability of the reverse osmosis desalination unit and thus le 50 employed biocides to control the algae growth and a microfiltration stage de julio et al 51 reported that humic substances caused the true colour of aqueous samples to increase and the presence of such species in csg associated water is considered plausible coagulation is usually a reliable method to reduce normal organic matter from water samples staaks et al 52 evaluated the performance of both alum and ach to reduce organic content of three water samples from south australia these authors found that generally alum was more effective than ach for the water samples tested and that the reduction in organic content was between 31 and 52 greater ability to reduce organic matter levels by alum was correlated to relate to the degree of hydrophobic character of the organic material comparison of the true colour values for the high and low tds csg associated water samples revealed that the colour was lower as the salinity increased this behaviour may be due to the greater dissolution of small floc material 0 45 Œºms in the high salt solution 49 fig 7 shows the variation of dissolved ions in ach treated water as a function of coagulant dose overall the removal of alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates was promoted by use of real csg associated water compared to the simulated solution as stated above the major difference in the real water was the presence of dissolved organic carbon with the inorganic ions being very similar in concentration for both samples lin et al 31 found that the coagulation performance of a real csg associated water sample was inferior to simulated solutions it was thus inferred that the presence of dissolved organic carbon inhibited the coagulation flocculation process the contrary results in this study suggested that the combination of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon was actually promoting the removal of dissolved species from the csg associated water hermosilla et al 43 noted that organic species in solution can react with the inorganic ions from the coagulant xue et al 53 discovered that the co existence of silica and natural organic matter in river water influenced the characteristics of the floc in particular the formation of alb polymeric and alc colloidal species was promoted and the coagulation performance enhanced notably the only instance where coagulation of real csg associated water showed inferior performance was in relation to the presence of residual aluminium in solution kimura et al 54 studied the removal of nom in river water using aluminium based coagulants a key finding was that the formation of residual aluminium in solution was correlated with the increasing presence of ala species monomeric hence it was concluded that with real csg associated water samples the formation of alb and alc species was promoted and concomitantly the presence of ala was reduced comparison of the dissolved species removal efficiency between the high and low tds csg associated water samples did not reveal any significant difference in the performance of the ach coagulant this observation was in harmony with the conclusion that the floc species were majorly stable in waters of the salinity range studied the settling behaviour of the flocs formed by ach addition to csg associated water sample 2 and real csg associated water was also examined supplementary figure s1 in general the final settled volume of flocs formed with either water sample was similar and the time required for the flocs to settle satisfied typical commercial timeframes of 60 min or less the most notable aspect was the more rapid settling of the flocs generated by ach addition to real csg associated water during the initial 10 min period supplementary figure s2 provided greater insight into the settling process as the optimal microscopy images revealed that the flocs from the real csg associated water were denser than those for the simulated sample the observation of ach flocs which were different in shape from those shown in fig 5 was consistent with the established view that variables such as ph and water composition influence floc structure and performance 55 3 3 effect of turbidity level in csg associated water upon coagulant performance the impact of turbidity level was also investigated in relation to coagulant performance when treating csg associated water as this parameter is known to vary over a significant range in real csg associated water samples 3 hence three additional samples were prepared using real csg associated water wherein no additional kaolin was added no turbidity kaolin was added until turbidity was approximately 100 low turbidity and finally kaolin was dosed to give a turbidity of 800 ntu high turbidity ach coagulant was dosed to the three samples of varying turbidity and the results shown in fig 8 the changes in ph and solution conductivity were similar for all three water types regardless of turbidity level interestingly the effectiveness of the coagulant was essentially unaffected by the extent of turbidity present which was important in respect to practical application where turbidity of csg associated water was dependent upon the location of well the residence time in storage ponds and climatic conditions 3 it was observed that the true colour of the real csg associated water was related to the amount of kaolin added to create turbidity the trend was increasing turbidity as more kaolin was added although not in a linear relationship this observation indicated that organic species were not the only source of colour in the water sample the identity of the species causing the residual colour was not unequivocal the true colour measurement involved application of a 0 45 Œºm filter to the water sample hence if the kaolin was causing the detection of colour in solution then these materials would be of very fine size the data displayed in fig 8 was also enlightening in relation to providing an insight as to how species such as alkaline earth ions and silicates were removed from solution one possibility for the reduction in alkaline earth ion concentration was the ion exchange of these ions with surface sites on the kaolin for example ockert et al 56 investigated the ion exchange properties of kaolin and calcium ions in a marine setting not only was the exchange relatively rapid ca 2 min but also up to 20 of the exchange sites were occupied by calcium ions even with the strong competition from the abundant sodium ions in the seawater medium gasco and mendez 57 also studied the exchange behaviour of calcium magnesium sodium and potassium ions with kaolin in aqueous solution magnesium and calcium ions were preferentially sorbed on the kaolin surface and the uptake of these ions was favoured by increasing ph 6 5 9 and greater initial concentrations in solution nevertheless as shown in fig 8 the data recorded was essentially the same whether kaolin was present or not in the csg associated water sample hence the reduction in concentration of both alkaline earth ions and silicate species was due to not only the coagulant addition but also from fig 7 the presence of organic matter this latter conclusion supported the deduction that alb and alc species were promoted when both kaolin and dissolved organic carbon were present in the csg associated water sample 4 conclusions addition of inorganic coagulants can effectively reduce not only the turbidity of csg associated water but also the presence of alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates all three coagulants studied were capable of reducing the content of alkaline earth ions however aluminium based coagulants were preferred in terms of their ability to promote the formation of aluminosilicates which were responsible for the reduction in dissolved silicate content of the csg associated water modelling predicted that muscovite type minerals were formed due to the interaction of dissolved aluminium and silicate species ach did not introduce sulphate species to the csg associated water unlike alum therefore this may be a preferable trait depending upon which downstream technologies are employed to desalinate the water sample the flocs produced by coagulant addition generally settled within 60 min the alum based flocs were larger and fractal in character however problems were found in relation to the settling ability of flocs produced from both alum and ferric chloride addition to csg associated water therefore consideration must be given to not only the extent of turbidity and dissolved species removal from solution but also the practicality of floc separation from the treated water sample coagulants performed equally as well under a wide range of turbidity values a key finding was that the co presence of kaolin and dissolved organic carbon in real csg associated water promoted the formation of alb and alc species the polymeric and colloidal forms of aluminium complexes in solution performed better than solutions where monomeric ala species were relatively more abundant simulated solutions could not adequately mimic the range of organic species which may be in csg associated water hence testing of real solutions was recommended the salinity of the csg associated water did not appear to be a critical parameter with respect to coagulant performance this observation suggested that coagulation processes may cope with the variation in csg associated water quality expected in an actual csg operation coagulation is currently not a core technology for treating csg associated water yet this study has shown that it can be highly effective at reducing the impact of problematic alkaline earth ions and dissolved silicates which both can foul downstream membranes used for desalination acknowledgements

global population 2 9 billion live in developing countries with limited professional interest in environmental issues india is yet to adopt safe treatment and waste disposal technologies for healthcare facility wastewaters hcfwws toxic wastewater generation and discharge from healthcare facilities hcf has increased with more inpatients and as a result of scale up in development of medical services and pharmaceuticals products multiple non point source networking of professional practices and healthcare facilities like surgery drug treatment radiology laundry operation room chemical and biological laboratories are the principal sources of toxic organic inorganic pollutants hazardous contaminants in wastewater are discharged into the aquatic and land environment most pollutants contaminants in the wastewater are detergents disinfectants and drug residues 1 in india the ministry of environment and forest and climate change moef cc has superficially formulated a framework for management of hcf wastewater under the bio medical waste management and handling rules in 1998 with an intent to reduce the generation and impact of bio medical wastes the central government has reviewed the existing rules under the environment protection act 1986 improper collection treatment and disposal of healthcare wastewaters pose serious threat to both the public and the environment leading to severe pollution and contamination of water courses hcfwws are loaded with pathogens and toxins causing water borne and vector borne diseases which further have a cumulative effect leading to biological degradation of nutrients in ground water lakes and rivers inducing eutrophication these issues raise prime concern on potential negative externalities on human health viz caused by antibiotics in drinking water transfer and spread of antibiotics resistant genes passing along in different food chains pharmaceutical wastewater contain antibiotics used in healthcare facilities for treatment which finds its way in to the wastewater stream through urine and feces 2 healthcare facility wastewater contain bacteria with acquired resistance to antibiotics over 2 10 times than in

in the absence of prevention of significant deterioration program psd and peq check in india by pollution control authorities hcf effluents become a source of many toxic elements in the aquatic environment as they are discharged into the urban drainage network rivers and lakes and on land without appropriate treatment hcf effluents in india are now seen as a serious problem for its

setup and operating procedures a laboratory scale electrochemical reactor ecr of cubical shape was designed and fabricated using perspex material having an effective working volume 1 5 l the cubical design of the ecr provides effective mass transfer during electrolysis improving floc formation aggregation and flotation of scum atop the ecr electrochemical treatment was carried out in batch mode using four aluminum and stainless steel electrodes of ss 304 grade each of 100 mm 50 mm size and 1 mm thick having a 20 m2 m3 specific electrode area to volume sa v ratio aluminum al and stainless steel ss were chosen because of its low cost and is commercially available having good in situ coagulant generating properties there is limited information in the open literature on the use of comparing al and ss electrodes for the treatment of real hcfwws al and ss plate electrodes were arranged in parallel with the extreme electrodes connected with lead wires to the dc power supply units in bipolar mode the inter electrode distance between the anode and cathode plates were kept constant 10 mm apart in all the becc experiments direct current was supplied using dc regulated power source by means of copper lead wires and crocodile clips all becc experiments were carried out at ambient temperature 25 28 c applying cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v the contents of the ecr were inductively stirred using a magnetic stirrer at a fixed agitation speed of 400 rpm throughout the experiments for the set electrolysis time to accelerate mass transfer all the electrodes were marked for its position in the ecr before conducting batch experiments the location of electrode in the ecr was fixed and was marked to occupy a specific position in the ecr in all the becc experiments each electrode was weighed before and after use in the ecr experiments collecting information on electrode dissolution ed is vital as it provides information on the amount of electrode consumption for every kg of cod removed and also for every cubic meter of wastewater treated information on ed helps to estimate the operating costs 1 5 l of raw hcfwws was poured into the ecr ensuring full submergence of the plate electrodes during ecc small aliquot samples were retrieved at regular time intervals and filtered on whatman 42 filter paper for further analyses and characterization for prime parameters like cod ec chlorides th ph and ta settling of post ecc slurry was performed using a 1000 ml graduated glass cylinder of 1 l without any stirring the settling behavior of ecc treated

hcfwws for use in the electrochemical experiments was collected as and when required from a major healthcare facility hcf equipped with over 1000 beds for inpatients raw wastewater samples were brought and characterized each time before use in the ecc experiments in accordance with the standard procedures 34 wastewater samples were collected in 20 l polymer containers from the outfall conduit of the hcf the various physico chemical characteristics of raw hcfwws were analyzed in duplicate and are given in table 3 and then used in the becc experiments physico chemical

wastewater in the treatment favor the ecc treatment process else hinder the ecc process 2 2 reactions and mechanisms in becc of hcwws during the ecc process destabilization of suspended and dissolved contaminants pollutants present in wastewater takes place by in situ generation of m ions as electro coagulant by electrolytic oxidation of sacrificial anode as the electrochemical reaction begins metal ions complex with hydroxyl oh groups and gradually form large size flocs scouring off contaminants pollutants and metals entrapping them within the floc matrix in a viscous state which float to the top of the ecr the gas bubbles o2 h2 nh3 cl2 hclo clo2 nh3 n n2 o3 co2 etc generated on the face of the electrodes buoy up and further assist in the sweeping process of cleaning up micro flocs

the anode face is given by eq 4 4 al al3 3e at the cathode face in bipolar arrangement the reduction reaction of water occurs resulting in the generation of hydrogen bubbles on the surface of the

observed in raw hcfwws favor the ecc process preventing passivation related issues and deposition of scales on anode material during ecc 3 results and discussion the effect of various operating variables such as cell voltage discrete et and 75 min et etc were carried out treating raw hcwws using batch ecc operated in batch mode in a bipolar electrode arrangement al and ss two dimensional 2d

for al and ss electrodes fig 1 a and b shows variations in ph of the bulk solution during becc with et when using al and ss electrode for pre set et of 75 min the ph of the bulk solution was seen to increase for both al and ss electrodes the increase in ph was marginally high when using ss electrodes mainly ascribed to the release of large quantities of oh ions by electrochemical hydrolysis of wastewater near the face of the electrode which aid in floc formation with al3 ions at the appropriate ph following the pourbaix path in the presence of sufficient alkalinity in the wastewater the ph of the bulk solution manifests in the alkaline range at which time most of the contaminants pollutants are removed as a slimy gel which appear floating atop the ecr see plate 1 thus achieving maximum removal of cod tds and color though ph values increase by 1 5 2 units from its initial value during ecc these values recede down from 9 5 to 8 0 in a time lapse of 1 h after ecc well within the discharge standards prescribed by the cpcb moef cc new delhi india 7 3 1 2 effect of applied cell voltage current density on cod removal for al and ss electrodes batch ecc experiments were conducted

precipitates these precipitates react with organic compounds present in wastewater causing intermittent sweep flocculation at specific ets causing pollutant contaminant removal by flotation soluble al3 cations prevail at ph values 4 and soluble aluminate anions exists at ph 9 5 forming insoluble aluminum hydroxide as observed in this work a greater balance by the insoluble forms of floc are maintained during ecc which finally manifest into insoluble precipitate which turns out as scum sludge the insoluble materials make the floc sturdy and strong making the slurry easy for gravity filtration fig 2 b shows the degradation curves for cod removal using ss electrodes for different cell voltages in ecc experiments ss electrodes showed residual cod of 138 mg l codo 768 mg l at 20 min et due to increased amount of dissolved iron at 12 v leading to the formation of gelatinous iron hydroxide by electrolytic oxidation of electrodes which polymerize resulting in entrapment and pollutant removal the formula used to determine cod is given in eq 35 35 cod mg l a b m 8000 ml of sample where a is ml of ferrous ammonium sulfate fas for blank b is ml of fas for sample and m is the molarity of fas 3 1 3 water quality control during ecc water quality parameters were kept under control to the desired level in ecc by using appropriate electrode material and current 3 1 3 1 chlorides fig 3 a shows reduction in chlorides during becc at applied cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v after 75 min et for al and ss electrodes ineffective removal of chlorides was observed using al and ss electrodes during ecc at the anode though hydroxide ions are less stable than chloride ions the latter has a greater tendency to discharge over hydroxide ion due to its high concentration in the wastewater 35 chloride reduction during ecc is because of the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at the anode face an increase in the chlorides concentration in the bulk solution was observed while using ss electrodes because of the generation of strong oxidants such as hypochlorite chlorine and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 through indirect oxidation 36 also aid in disinfection similar observations were also reported by mamelkina et al 37 where increase in the iron coagulant dosage showed increase in the chloride concentration as chloride is the counter ion of fe 37 al electrode showed better removal of chloride compared to ss electrodes 3 1 3 2 total dissolved solids tds fig 3 b shows tds reductions during becc at voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v after 75 min et when using al and ss electrodes tds removal by 25 36 and 26 94 were achieved at an applied voltage of 24 v for al and ss electrodes due to charge destabilization of the pollutants contaminants resulting in the formation of floc having more specific gravity giving good settling properties with the pollutants tds removal follows a declining trend for al electrodes as the cell voltage increases compared to ss electrodes 3 1 3 3 nitrates phosphates and sulfates removal all the water quality parameters were seen to decrease significantly at 75 min et for cell voltages 12 24 v fig 4 a shows removal of nitrates during becc for cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v after 75 min et using al and ss electrodes removal of nitrates at cell voltages above 12 v occur for ph 8 because of its adsorption onto the particles 38 at higher applied cell voltages anodic dissolution of aluminum and bubble generation increases 39 producing large quantities of al oh 3 which binds nitrates into the precipitate gel matrix and gets removed by flotation as scum sludge the dominating species of solid compounds fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 at alkaline ph serve as adsorbents for removal of the pollutants contaminants by adsorption mechanism fig 4 b shows removal of phosphates during becc at cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v for 75 min et using al and ss electrodes freshly formed amorphous al oh 3 have large surface which provide adsorption sites for soluble organic compounds and trapping phosphates into the floc material removal of phosphates using ss electrodes is linked to the coagulation of po4 3 with fe iii salts by formation of fe hydroxo phosphate complexes which either adsorb onto positively charged fe iii hydrolysis species or act as center of precipitation for the hydrolysed products fig 4 c shows removal of sulfate during becc for cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v for 75 min et using al and ss electrodes an applied cell voltage of 12 v using al and ss electrodes showed maximum sulfate removal the mechanism of removal is the entrapment of sulfate ions so4 2 on porous iron and aluminum hydroxide precipitates 3 1 4 color the color of wastewater is because of the solids turbidity and dissolved metals other inorganic constituents present in it fig 5 a and b shows color removal in during becc experiments using al and ss electrodes for applied cell voltages of 6 24 v it may be observed that at 75 min et the maximum removal of color achieved was 77 15 using al electrodes for 12 v and 75 22 using ss electrodes fig 5 b removal of color showed improvement when using al electrodes compared to ss electrodes the release of poly nuclear hydroxyl aluminum complexes coagulate colloidal solids present in the wastewater thus favoring removal of apparent color 3 1 5 electrode dissolution electrode dissolution ed assist in electro floc formation is an integral part of any treatment process thereby removing contaminant pollutants from the wastewater fig 6 a and b shows ed for different cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v used in becc experiments for 1 cm inter electrode distance and electrodes arranged in bipolar mode using al and ss electrodes in bipolar mode ed is strongly influenced by position of the electrodes in the ecr and the applied cell voltage with the corresponding current across the electrodes the extreme electrode 1 connected to the positive terminal showed higher ed compared to electrode 4 away from the positive terminal where ed is least because of low electrical resistance when the electrodes are close to each other it results in the increased oxidation rate causing more coagulant generation because of the larger current between the electrodes an inter electrode distance of 5 mm may cause short circuiting as the electrolysis proceed 3 2 effect of applied cell voltage 12 and 18 v on discrete time electrolysis of raw hcfwws becc experiments were carried out using al and ss electrodes at 12 and 18 v for discrete et of 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min to extract intricate information about the electrode dissolution pattern sludge quantity level of contaminant pollutant removal post ecc water quality settling pattern of sludge and filterability potential 3 2 1 cod fig 7 a and b shows raw cod value and cod removal during becc of raw hcfwws for discrete ets for cell voltages 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes at an applied cell voltage of 12 v both al fig 7a and ss fig 7b electrodes showed cod removal of 192 mg l and 196 mg l codo 1536 mg l at 20 min et due to formation of electro coagulants by anodic dissolution leading to the pollutant contaminant removal by floc formation floc aggregation and sedimentation 50 of cod is removed when using al electrodes and 40 cod is removed when using ss electrodes in the first 5 min et irrespective of the cell voltages applied with progress in the ecc treatment cod removal is maximum at 20 25 min et for both al and ss electrodes the unusual cod removal trends during electrolysis is surmised for the presence of pharmaceutical compounds disinfectants dissolved salts and refractory recalcitrant compounds present in hcfwws hindering ecc 3 2 2 control of water quality parameters during ecc most water quality parameters can be kept under control to the desired level of treatment in ecc by simply controlling the flow of current across the electrodes in the presence of sufficient alkalinity and chlorides electrochemical treatment in aqueous solutions using distilled water is seen not as a wise option because the results are not dependable and quite away from real situation 3 2 2 1 chlorides fig 8 a and b shows chloride reduction for discrete ets for sa v 20 m2 m3 at 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes inefficient removal of chlorides during ecc was ascribed to high solubility during ets where most of the pollutant contaminants are removed from solution 5 25 min et and also high initial values of cl in hcfwws 3 2 2 2 tds fig 9 a and b shows the tds reduction for discrete ets during becc for sa v 20 m2 m3 four electrodes at 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes tds removal was observed to be low as the metal ion dosage had no sufficient strength charge power to destabilize the dissolved colloidal and suspended particles in the absence of colloids particles solids there is grave tendency that the tds values increase as electrolysis progress in certain special cases particularly at higher cell voltages 3 2 2 3 nitrates fig 10 a shows the plot of nitrate removal comparing al and ss electrodes for applied cell voltage of 12 v it may be observed that al electrodes show maximum nitrate removal compared to ss nitrates removal is because of electro reduction where nitrate is converted into nitrogen and ammonia which is readily adsorbed by the electro coagulants produced in situ during ecc and adsorption on the surfaces of hydroxide precipitates 40 the reactions involved in the removal of nitrate using al electrodes are shown in eqs 36 38 36 3no3 3h2o 2al 2al3 3no2 6oh 37 6no3 18h2o 10al 10al3 3n2 6oh 38 3no3 18h2o 8al 8al3 3nh3 27oh nitrates removal was observed to increase progressively at higher cell voltage of 18 v for al compared to ss electrodes fig 11 a because of high rate of metal oxidation resulting in greater amount of precipitate formation 3 2 2 4 phosphates fig 10 b shows phosphate removal from its initial value of 23 03 mg l for 12 v for discrete et using both al and ss electrodes phosphate removal is effected by the formation of fepo4 and fe oh 3 during ecc the solubility of fepo4 increases with increase in ph of the bulk solution enhancing phosphate removal because at higher ph fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 are formed in the dissolved state ss electrodes showed marginally higher removal of phosphate compared to al for 12 v similarly phosphate adsorption with al hydroxide and its precipitation forming alpo4 removes po4 from the wastewater when using al electrodes 41 following the reactions shown in eqs 39 and 40 39 al3 3h2o al oh 3 3h 40 al3 po4 3 alpo4 fig 11 b shows the phosphate removal using al and ss electrodes for 18 v both al and ss showed higher removal of phosphate due to charge neutralization by cationic hydrolysis products and entrapment of pollutants contaminants in the amorphous hydroxide precipitate matrix produced as a result sweep flocculation 3 2 2 5 sulfates fig 10 c shows sulfate removal for applied voltage of 12 v using al and ss electrodes a maximum removal of sulfates was achieved at 20 min et using al electrodes the removal of sulfates was attributed to al oh 3 produced during ecc resulting in precipitation and flotation 42 amorphous iron hydroxide precipitate generated during ecc at neutral and alkaline ph are considered as primary coagulants species fe2so4 resulting in pollutant contaminant removal by adsorption on the particles a quick removal of sulfates was achieved up to 20 min et after which the removal of phosphates was marginal for both al and ss electrodes fig 11 c shows sulfate removal using al and ss electrodes for 18 v removal of sulfate was due to the enmeshment of sulfate ion into the porous metal oxide or hydroxide precipitate 3 2 3 chloride to sulfate ratio chloride to sulfate mass ratio is often considered as corrosion potential parameter used to predict the effect of changes in water quality because of ecc treatment wastewater corrosivity is defined as the concentration of chloride mg l divided by the concentration of sulfate mg l because of high cl so4 ratios in the wastewater lead to higher metal corrosion rates during treatment although it is not known if this ratio determines corrosion 43 fig 12 a and b shows changes in chlorides to sulfates for discrete ets for cell voltages 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes the cl so4 show an undulating increase in the trend up to 20 min reaction time for 12 v and up to 30 min for 18 v when using al and ss electrodes after which time the ratio more or less seem to be stabilized the formation of carbonates in the solution during ecc is shown in eqs 41 43 as quoted by kabda≈ülƒ± et al 44 these reactions increase the ohmic resistance by the electrodes in the ecr 41 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 42 co3 2 ca2 caco3 43 co3 2 mg2 mgco3 during ecc th values were seen to decrease with increase in reaction time the ca and mg salts react with alkalinity in the solution to form caco3 and mgco3 which tend to deposit on the cathode faces causing a very small reduction in the current on keen observation of the electrodes after ecc very thin layers of inorganic scale like deposit were seen to be removed as thin nano sized flakes hcwws contain high cl values which produce chlorine during ecc which also assist in the disinfection requirement and the chlorine demand of fe0 and fe2 in the ecr during treatment the cl so4 showed a decrease after 50 min et for 12 v for both the electrodes because sulfate values decrease with increase in et see fig 11 c low values of so4 in the cl so4 ratio causes increase in the cl so4 ratio as seen in fig 12 3 2 4 color fig 13 a and b shows color removal for discrete ets irrespective of the electrodes cell voltages and current across the electrodes a maximum color removal of 80 was achieved at 25 min et for both cell voltages and both electrodes after which time the color removal was only marginal by 5 al electrodes delivered a crystal clear supernatant while the post supernatant after gravity filtration with ss appeared mild green surmised to have occurred because of re release of fe ii and fe iii species back into the solution a quick filtration through some media just after ecc would solve the problem of color re entrainment back into the solution though apparent color is removed the true color remains after ecc by about 20 the true color residues can later be removed using impregnated gac columns 3 2 5 electrode dissolution fig 14 a d shows electrode dissolution of al and ss during discrete becc experiments for discrete ets of 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min for an applied cell voltages 12 and 18 v in a bipolar arrangement the first electrode connected to the positive terminal of the dc power supply unit dissolves more compared to the electrodes away from it with four electrodes the fourth electrode away from the positive terminal receives a very low current and therefore contribute poorly to the release of m ions into the solution 3 3 settling svi and csi 3 3 1 settling the slurry obtained after ecc was subject to sedimentation test in a 1 l graduated cylinder fig 15 a and b shows settling behavior of the sludge water interface for 12 18 and 24 v cell voltages using al and ss electrodes generally the rate of settling was quick for ss electrodes compared to al while using ss electrodes for 12 and 18 v the svi values were 212 76 and 320 85 in the case of al electrodes the supernatant appeared colorless giving high svi values of 478 26 and 718 95 for 12 and 18 v respectively al flocs were fragile and therefore showed high svi values compared to ss at the zeroth time in the settling process using al sludge settling is poor in the first 5 min because of fragile flocs and entrapped gases with brownian motion of floc particles followed by a steady state decrease in height of the interface exhibiting hindered type iii settling at the end of the settling time h 30 a good compression settling is obtained for ss electrodes and a much smaller rate of decrease in the interface for al electrodes is obtained fig 15 a 3 3 2 settling patterns of post ecc slurry for discrete et for al and ss electrodes to exercise control on the svi values post ecc water quality and electrode dissolution ed which imply operational cost becc for electrolysis time from 5 to 60 min with 5 10 min intervals were carried out discretely using al and ss electrodes for cell voltages 12 and 18 v fig 16 a and b shows the settling behavior of post ecc slurry using al electrodes for 12 and 18 v in case of al electrodes the interface settling was very slowly for ecc 30 40 min ets fig 16 a compared to the interface for 10 25 min et ss contains fe and therefore good settling patterns were obtained within a short settling time the interface was clear for al slurry with poor settling for ets over 20 min fig 16 b with corresponding cod and color removal of 192 mg l and 74 31 for 12 v fig 17 a and b shows the settling behavior of post ecc slurry of hcfwws for cell voltages 12 and 18 v using ss electrodes for 12 v and up to 20 min discrete et the quantity of flocs were limited and so the flocs showed discrete settling velocities in the column resulting in quick settling fig 17 a for ets 30 min the ed was marginally high with a clear interface in the column with corresponding cod removal of over 90 and color 80 discrete and compression settling were prominent at 18 v ecc fig 17 b at 25 min et with cod residue of 192 mg l in the supernatant 3 4 sludge volume index svi settling characteristics of sludge generated during batch ecc experiments were quantified using sludge volume index svi svi values were calculated using the relation shown in eq 44 44 svi 1000 h 30 h 0 x 0 where h 30 is the height of sludge after 30 min settling in the column h 0 is the initial height of slurry and x 0 is initial solids concentration in slurry 3 4 1 svi for applied cell voltage 6 24 v svi values for al and ss electrodes were seen to increase with increase in applied cell voltage table 4 shows the svi values obtain for 6 12 18 and 24 v for al and ss electrodes high svi values at higher applied voltages are because of more ed and sweep flocculation effects an increase in solution temperature by 8 c led to greater mobility of the formed species 3 4 2 svi values for discrete et for cell voltages 12 and 18 v svi values were also estimated for post ecc slurry for discrete ets 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min using al and ss electrodes for cell voltages 12 and 18 v svi values as low as of 79 36 ml g for 12 v and 159 79 ml g for 18 v were obtained for al electrodes at 10 min et with only few sludge particles and high density it settles quickly in the settling column svi values of 260 8 ml g for 12 v and 314 87 ml g for 18 v using ss electrodes for 10 min et were obtained because of a larger floc matrix 3 5 centrifugal settling index csi sludge settled in the settling column at 30 min was further subject to dewaterability test to evaluate sludge dewaterability parameter csi csi values were calculated using relation shown in eq 45 45 csi c 0 c c c 0 where c 0 is the initial suspended solids after compression settling in the column at 30 min settling c c is the centrate supernatant suspended solids in mg l after centrifugation sludge showing high csi values are indicative of easy dewaterability 3 5 1 csi for becc of hcfwws for cell voltage 6 24 v 6 v of cell voltage could not produce enough sludge and therefore csi values could not be obtained csi values at 12 18 and 24 v using al were 86 75 86 19 and 85 59 similarly csi values obtained using ss were 95 88 5 and 88 04 respectively 3 5 2 csi for discrete et for cell voltage 12 and 18 v fig 18 a shows csi values obtained for post ecc settled sludge for 12 and 18 v using al electrodes csi values were more or less stable for all ets from 30 to 60 min for 12 v at 30 min et and above the floc matrix enters into a maturity state where csi values show a declining trend in case of ss electrodes as seen in for 18 v fig 18 b high csi values of 95 were obtained showing stable values at all discrete ets at 12 v proving the novelty of the ecc process 3 6 filterability filterability of ecc treated slurry was tested using simple gravity filtration as a cross check for clarity filtrate and sturdiness of the sludge and quick filtration plots of Œ¥t Œ¥v versus the total volume v were obtained for scenarios the values of Œ± and r m were then estimated applying the differential equation shown in eq 3 of each straight line slope and intercept derived from the graph of Œ¥t Œ¥v and v 3 6 1 filterability of post ecc slurry for discrete et with 12 and 18 v using al electrodes fig 19 a and b shows plots of Œ¥t Œ¥v as a function of v for filterability of post ecc slurry for 12 v and 18 v for discrete ets using al electrodes quick filtration without any pore blockages in the filter medium was achieved for 12 v at 20 min et fig 19 a the corresponding values of Œ± and r m 1 020 1014 m kg 1 and 7 312 108 m 1 poor filterability was obtained after 30 min et because most of the solids are removed from the solution and the agglomerating flocs go mobile in the ecr bombarding with each other with freely moving m ions tearing apart and disintegrating the agglomerated floc into smaller sized particles these small sized particles during filtration clog the pores of the filter medium and therefore the filtration slows down the values of Œ± and r m obtained for discrete ets using al electrodes for 12 and 18 v are tabulated in table 6 it may be observed from both the plots that a 25 or 30 min et gives trend lines close to x axis proving good filterability for both 12 and 18 v data points away from the abscissa show poor filterability 22 3 6 2 filterability of post ecc slurry for discrete et with 12 and 18 v using ss electrodes fig 20 a and b shows plot of Œ¥t Œ¥v versus v for filterability of post ecc slurry for discrete et for 12 v and 18 v using ss electrodes the sludge generated had good filtration characteristics for 12 v at 25 min et fig 20 a solid triangle and corresponding Œ± and r m were 7 109 1014 m kg 1 and 1 139 107 m 1 the variations in Œ± and r m while applying ecc are ascribed to several important factors viz sources of raw wastewater its characteristics strength operating conditions floc characteristics maturity et cake blinding during filtration initial alkalinity and chloride conditions coagulant aid if any floc integrity time lapse after ecc before filtration and viscosity of the post ecc slurry a larger scatter data points fig 20 b indicate a rather high cell voltage applied during ecc which tend to generate more floc density in the post ecc slurry table 7 shows the values of Œ± and r m obtained at discrete et during becc using ss electrodes it may be observed from fig 20 a that a 5 min et solid squares slurry filterability data away from the abscissa it shows poor filterability and pore blocking in the filter medium and also maturity of flocs generated during ecc et is a control parameter which is neither too small nor too large all optimal et always exist in ecc a novel treatment process it was concluded that a cell voltage of 12 v was optimal for treating raw hcfwws for good settleability filtereability control svi and maximum cod removals smaller electrolysis times gives a developing floc with open ended charges which tend to break or cause pore blockage in filter medium the sequence of the ecc treatment process beginning from reactor setup bipolar electrode arrangement pollutant contaminant removal settling filterability dry sludge generation and water reclamation are shown in plate 1 though 2d ecc treatment process has many ingrained merits it has only few limitations to mention extensive foaming during ecc was observed with the foam occupying 1 3rd the top of the ecr the second limitation was to drive away entrapped gases in floc matrix which requires several swirling of the ecr slurry after ecc before commencing settling the third final limitation is that the electrode and the top portion of ecr after ecc appear physically very dirty but cleaning could be carried out at ease 4 conclusions becc experiments for the treatment of hcfwws were investigated for applied cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v using al and ss two dimensional electrodes for 75 min et an applied cell voltage of 12 v cd 80 a m2 showed good results in removal of cod color nitrates phosphates and sulfates using al electrodes 87 5 removal of cod 46 81 nitrates 91 50 phosphates 42 05 sulfates and 74 color were achieved at 20 25 min et compared to other cell voltages when using ss electrodes for a cell voltage of 12 v 82 03 removal of cod 45 46 nitrates 87 88 phosphates 51 57 sulfates and 70 89 color were achieved at 20 25 min et the sludge generated from ss electrodes during ecc treatment showed good settling properties compared to al electrodes while conducting ecc for discrete ets 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min using al and ss electrodes al electrodes showed 87 5 removal of cod 67 11 nitrates 86 19 phosphates 74 46 sulfates and 74 31 color at 20 min et compared to ss electrodes for 87 23 removal of cod 41 64 nitrates 84 38 phosphates 68 73 sulfates and 71 92 color were achieved respectively both al and ss electrodes showed good removal of organics and improved water quality for a cell voltage of 12 v settling and filterability characteristics of the sludge for ss electrodes were good compared to al electrodes as ss contain high fe and with high density favors the formation of sturdy floc and good bonding poor settling of sludge generated from al electrodes was due to gel like structure of aluminum hydroxide and trapped gases preventing rapid settling of flocs formed and moderate filterability the agar plate count apc values were 10 cfu ml for aluminum electrodes and 5 cfu ml for ss electrodes the results obtained from this work strongly upholds the novelty of using ecc for treatment of toxic recalcitrant hcfwws both al and ss 2d electrodes showed good ability for removal of organics simultaneously exercising control on other water quality parameters the clean water reclaimed was 70 75 of the water treated with ton values 1 colorless and cod levels 250 mg l meeting the

14493,healthcare facility wastewaters hcfwws are highly toxic and refractory not amenable for biological treatment electrochemical coagulation ecc is capable of treating such tough and toxic waste streams offering a shortest treatment time 75 min with good settling and filterability characteristics batch ecc was applied successfully for treatment of real hcfwws two dimensional 2d aluminum al

electrode area to volume sa v of 20 m2 m3 the optimum applied cell voltage using al electrodes was 12 v showing 88 removal of cod 47 nitrate 92 phosphate 42 sulfate 74 color and 70 odor free clear water worth a reclamation ss electrodes removed 82 of cod 46 nitrates 88 phosphate 52 sulfates 71 color and 70 odorless supernatant batch ecc for optimum 12 v were conducted for discrete et using al and ss for 5 min time interval up to 60 min to obtain intricate technical information cod removals of 87 5 and 87 23 were achieved meeting the pollution control limits of 250 mg l using 2d al and ss electrodes within 20 min et in discrete time ecc studies with simultaneous color removal of 74 31 and 71 92 respectively good sludge settling patterns were obtained for ss sludge volume index values of 79 36 were obtained for al and 260 80 for ss at 12 v at 10 min et and centrifugal settleability index values at the same voltages were 86 89 and 96 08 for al and ss ecc sludge obtained using 12 v with ss showed good filterability with Œ± specific cake resistance value of 4 78 1014 m kg 1 and r m resistance of the filter medium value of 5 225 108 m 1 agar plate count values were 10 cfu ml for

global population 2 9 billion live in developing countries with limited professional interest in environmental issues india is yet to adopt safe treatment and waste disposal technologies for healthcare facility wastewaters hcfwws toxic wastewater generation and discharge from healthcare facilities hcf has increased with more inpatients and as a result of scale up in development of medical services and pharmaceuticals products multiple non point source networking of professional practices and healthcare facilities like surgery drug treatment radiology laundry operation room chemical and biological laboratories are the principal sources of toxic organic inorganic pollutants hazardous contaminants in wastewater are discharged into the aquatic and land environment most pollutants contaminants in the wastewater are detergents disinfectants and drug residues 1 in india the ministry of environment and forest and climate change moef cc has superficially formulated a framework for management of hcf wastewater under the bio medical waste management and handling rules in 1998 with an intent to reduce the generation and impact of bio medical wastes the central government has reviewed the existing rules under the environment protection act 1986 improper collection treatment and disposal of healthcare wastewaters pose serious threat to both the public and the environment leading to severe pollution and contamination of water courses hcfwws are loaded with pathogens and toxins causing water borne and vector borne diseases which further have a cumulative effect leading to biological degradation of nutrients in ground water lakes and rivers inducing eutrophication these issues raise prime concern on potential negative externalities on human health viz caused by antibiotics in drinking water transfer and spread of antibiotics resistant genes passing along in different food chains pharmaceutical wastewater contain antibiotics used in healthcare facilities for treatment which finds its way in to the wastewater stream through urine and feces 2 healthcare facility wastewater contain bacteria with acquired resistance to antibiotics over 2 10 times than in domestic wastewater 3 healthcare facilities use large quantities of water 400 1200 l bed d and generate high strength high flow waste streams as a comparison medium strength domestic wastewaters generates 100 l capita per day 4 toxic effluents discharged from hcfs require careful monitoring and a thorough check for population equivalents peq before and after treatment prior to its discharge in the absence of prevention of significant deterioration program psd and peq check in india by pollution control authorities hcf effluents become a source of many toxic elements in the aquatic environment as they are discharged into the urban drainage network rivers and lakes and on land without appropriate treatment hcf effluents in india are now seen as a serious problem for its detrimental effects on the aquatic environment and on human beings in india at present 168 865 healthcare facilities exist of which only 13 2 22 245 healthcare facility have nominal treatment and waste disposal facilities 5 in southern part of india in karnataka state alone there are 26 927 including both government and private healthcare establishments and in mysuru city alone the number of healthcare establishments are 1325 including hcfs clinics primary health center and nursing homes with poor and incomplete wastewater treatment facilities 6 among these 1325 healthcare establishments only four major hcfs have wastewater management systems in india on site treatment of healthcare facility wastewaters is limited still adopting obsolete primary and secondary biological treatment followed by simple chlorination on site biological treatment of healthcare wastewaters hcwws produce poor quality effluent and contaminated sludge containing high concentrations of helminths and disease causing pathogens table 1 shows who 2014 guidelines for discharging healthcare wastewaters after appropriate treatment with much focus on microbiological parameters leaving aside the environmental parameters of great concern in india the wastewater treated in hcf should conform to the limits prescribed by the central pollution control board cpcb under moef cc usepa standards for discharge of treated hcwws into sewers are listed in table 2 considering the said facts it is important to develop quick and novel treatment technologies safe efficient and cost effective with hydraulic retention time hrt kept as low as possible for removal of organic and inorganic compounds with an aim for complete clean up and a goal for water reclamation it is known that wastewaters with bod cod 0 3 or cod bod 3 chemical and biological treatment processes become less effective 9 and inefficient in removing antibiotics and recalcitrant compounds from healthcare wastewaters however few researchers have employed moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr 10 activated sludge 11 membrane bioreactor mbr 12 vacuum ultraviolet vuv and ultraviolet c uv energy in 280 100 nm frequency uvc photoreactors 13 fenton 14 and high rate algal ponds 15 for removal of organics with prolonged treatment time high hrt and uncontrolled sludge generation as major drawbacks other treatment technologies capable of removing recalcitrant compounds in healthcare wastewaters are adsorption 16 ozonation 17 membrane techniques 18 advanced oxidation processes using o3 o3 uv o3 h2o2 uv 19 20 from the past few years electrochemical coagulation ecc is seen as a novel option capable of serving with low hydraulic retention time hrt for treating a variety of contaminated polluted waters and wastewaters of medium

design of the ecr provides effective mass transfer during electrolysis improving floc formation aggregation and flotation of scum atop the ecr electrochemical treatment was carried out in batch mode using four aluminum and stainless steel electrodes of ss 304 grade each of 100 mm 50 mm size and 1 mm thick having a 20 m2 m3 specific electrode area to volume sa v ratio aluminum al and stainless steel ss were chosen because of its low cost and is commercially available having good in situ coagulant generating properties there is limited information in the open literature on the use of comparing al and ss electrodes for the treatment of real hcfwws al and ss plate electrodes were arranged in parallel with the extreme electrodes connected with lead wires to the dc power supply units in bipolar mode the inter electrode distance between the anode and cathode plates were kept constant 10 mm apart in all the becc experiments direct current was supplied using dc regulated power source by means of copper lead wires and crocodile clips all becc experiments were carried out at ambient temperature 25 28 c applying cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v the contents of the ecr were inductively stirred using a magnetic stirrer at a fixed agitation speed of 400 rpm throughout the experiments for the set electrolysis time to accelerate mass transfer all the electrodes were marked for its position in the ecr before conducting batch experiments the location of electrode in the ecr was fixed and was marked to occupy a specific position in the ecr in all the becc experiments each electrode was weighed before and after use in the ecr experiments collecting information on electrode dissolution ed is vital as it provides information on the amount of electrode consumption for every kg of cod removed and also for every cubic meter of wastewater treated information on ed helps to estimate the operating costs 1 5 l of raw hcfwws was poured into the ecr ensuring full submergence of the plate electrodes during ecc small aliquot samples were retrieved at regular time intervals and filtered on whatman 42 filter paper for further analyses and characterization for prime parameters like cod ec chlorides th ph and ta settling of post ecc slurry was performed using a 1000 ml graduated glass cylinder of 1 l without any stirring the settling behavior of ecc treated slurry at the solid liquid interface was recorded over discrete time intervals every 5 min for both al and ss electrodes after ecc for different et the treated wastewater called slurry water and solids generated after each batch experiment was homogenized and used to study the settling and filterability characteristics for determining specific cake resistance Œ± and resistance to the filter

hcfwws for use in the electrochemical experiments was collected as and when required from a major healthcare facility hcf equipped with over 1000 beds for inpatients raw wastewater samples were brought and characterized each time before use in the ecc experiments in accordance with the standard procedures 34 wastewater samples were collected in 20 l polymer containers from the outfall conduit of the hcf the various physico chemical characteristics of raw hcfwws were analyzed in duplicate and are given in table 3 and then used in the becc experiments physico chemical characterization of raw hcfwws provides vital information about the quality of wastewater being treated and the choice of the treatment method to be selected initial information on value parameters like cod bod ratio total hardness th salt content total alkalinity ta cl so4 ratio and ph0 assist in the ecc process or spoil the treatment process for instance sufficient alkalinity 50 mg l in water wastewater in the treatment favor the ecc treatment process else hinder the ecc process 2 2 reactions and mechanisms in becc of hcwws during the ecc process destabilization of suspended and dissolved contaminants pollutants present in wastewater takes place by in situ generation of m ions as electro coagulant by electrolytic oxidation of sacrificial anode as the electrochemical reaction begins metal ions complex with hydroxyl oh groups and gradually form large size flocs scouring off contaminants pollutants and metals entrapping them within the floc matrix in a viscous state which float to the top of the ecr the gas bubbles o2 h2 nh3 cl2 hclo clo2 nh3 n n2 o3 co2 etc generated on the face of the electrodes buoy up and further assist in the sweeping process of cleaning up micro flocs locking it into the viscous gel matrix the major reactions that take place while using al electrodes are described through eqs 4 16 2 2 1 al electrode related reactions oxidation of al electrode at the anode face is given by eq 4 4 al al3 3e at the cathode face in bipolar arrangement the reduction reaction of water occurs resulting in the generation of hydrogen bubbles on the surface of the electrode as shown in eq 5 5 2h2o 2e h2 2oh the al ions so produced then react with water to form hydroxides as shown in eq 6 oh ions produced during the reduction reaction generally attacks the cathode face giving eq 7 6 al3 h2o al oh 3 3h 7 2al 6h2o 2oh 2al oh 4 3h2 al3 and oh ions generated during the electrode reactions at the anode eq 4 and cathode eq 5 react to form monomeric and

binding precipitation and flotation of the pollutants contaminants impurities from the wastewater and some floc settle to the bottom of the ecr the moment power is switched off see plate 1 2 2 2 ss electrode related reactions ferric ions generated by electrochemical oxidation of ss electrodes during the treatment process may form both monomeric and polymeric species the reactions involved are

the anode face are capable of killing a variety of microorganisms and pathogens hypochlorite and hypochloric acid are generated in situ as a result of oxidation of the naturally present chloride ions in the wastewater having disinfection properties as shown through eqs 26 28 species such as cl2 at ph 3 0 hocl at ph 3 8 and clo at ph 8 prevail during ecc of these hocl is the most powerful active chlorine species that provides disinfection 26 2cl cl2 2e 27 cl2 h2o hocl cl h 28 hocl clo h other related reactions that control the water quality parameters when using al and ss electrodes are shown

ratio chloride to sulfate ratio cl so4 is often considered as a corrosion potential parameter used in predicting the effect of treatment changes on water and wastewater corrosivity high total hardness th values in wastewater causes increase in the weight of cathode plates hindering the treatment and also causes a decrease in the current value across the electrodes higher values of cl so4 ratio as observed in raw hcfwws favor the ecc process preventing passivation related issues and deposition of scales on anode material during ecc 3 results and discussion the effect of various operating variables such as cell voltage discrete et and 75 min et etc were carried out treating raw hcwws using batch ecc operated in batch mode in a bipolar electrode arrangement al and ss two dimensional 2d plate electrodes for different applied cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v for 75 min et to determine the optimum operating voltage aiming at maximum removal of contaminants pollutants etc becc experiments were also conducted for discrete et of 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min for the previously set optimum operating cell voltages 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes on separate experimental runs the results of the laboratory scale investigations are described in the following sections 3 1 becc experiments for applied cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v for 75 min et 3 1 1 effect of cell voltage on pho for al and ss electrodes fig 1 a and b shows variations in ph of the bulk solution during becc with et when using al and ss electrode for pre set et of 75 min the ph of the bulk solution was seen to increase for both al and ss electrodes the increase in ph was marginally high when using ss electrodes mainly ascribed to the release of large quantities of oh ions by electrochemical hydrolysis of wastewater near the face of the electrode which aid in floc formation with al3 ions at the appropriate ph following the pourbaix path in the presence of sufficient alkalinity in the wastewater the ph of the bulk solution manifests in the alkaline range at which time most of the contaminants pollutants are removed as a slimy gel which appear floating atop the ecr see plate 1 thus achieving maximum removal of cod tds and color though ph values increase by 1 5 2 units from its initial value during ecc these values recede down from 9 5 to 8 0 in a time lapse of 1 h after ecc well within the discharge standards prescribed by the cpcb moef cc new delhi india 7 3 1 2 effect of applied cell voltage current density on cod removal for al and ss electrodes batch ecc experiments were conducted for applied cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v corresponding to the current densities cds 20 80 140 and 200 a m2 fig 2 a shows cod degradation curves for applied cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v using al electrodes for all the cell voltages applied a little change is observed at 10 min et because of dissolution of metal m ions into the bulk solution contributing to the cod value an applied voltage of 12 v cd 80 a m2 showed maximum cod removal of 96 mg l codo 768 mg l at 20 min et when using al electrodes ascribed to the formation of insoluble amorphous species of aluminum hydroxide as al oh 3 precipitates these precipitates react with organic compounds present in wastewater causing intermittent sweep flocculation at specific ets causing pollutant contaminant removal by flotation soluble al3 cations prevail at ph values 4 and soluble aluminate anions exists at ph 9 5 forming insoluble aluminum hydroxide as observed in this work a greater balance by the insoluble forms of floc are maintained during ecc which finally manifest into insoluble precipitate which turns out as scum sludge the insoluble materials make the floc sturdy and strong making the slurry easy for gravity filtration fig 2 b shows the degradation curves for cod removal using ss electrodes for different cell voltages in ecc experiments ss electrodes showed residual cod of 138 mg l codo 768 mg l at 20 min et due to increased amount of dissolved iron at 12 v leading to the formation of gelatinous iron hydroxide by electrolytic oxidation of electrodes which polymerize resulting in entrapment and pollutant removal the formula used to determine cod is given in eq 35 35 cod mg l a b m 8000 ml of sample where a is ml of ferrous ammonium sulfate fas for blank b is ml of fas for sample and m is the molarity of fas 3 1 3 water quality control during ecc water quality parameters were kept under control to the desired level in ecc by using appropriate electrode material and current 3 1 3 1 chlorides fig 3 a shows reduction in chlorides during becc at applied cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v after 75 min et for al and ss electrodes ineffective removal of chlorides was observed using al and ss electrodes during ecc at the anode though hydroxide ions are less stable than chloride ions the latter has a greater tendency to discharge over hydroxide ion due to its high concentration in the wastewater 35 chloride reduction during ecc is because of the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at the anode face an increase in the chlorides concentration in the bulk solution was observed while using ss electrodes because of the generation of strong oxidants such as hypochlorite chlorine and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 through indirect oxidation 36 also aid in disinfection similar observations were also reported by mamelkina et al 37 where increase in the iron coagulant dosage showed increase in the chloride concentration as chloride is the counter ion of fe 37 al electrode showed better removal of chloride compared to ss electrodes 3 1 3 2 total dissolved solids tds fig 3 b shows tds reductions during becc at voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v after 75 min et when using al and ss electrodes tds removal by 25 36 and 26 94 were achieved at an applied voltage of 24 v for al and ss electrodes due to charge destabilization of the pollutants contaminants resulting in the formation of floc having more specific gravity giving good settling properties with the pollutants tds removal follows a declining trend for al electrodes as the cell voltage increases compared to ss electrodes 3 1 3 3 nitrates phosphates and sulfates removal all the water quality parameters were seen to decrease significantly at 75 min et for cell voltages 12 24 v fig 4 a shows removal of nitrates during becc for cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v after 75 min et using al and ss electrodes removal of nitrates at cell voltages above 12 v occur for ph 8 because of its adsorption onto the particles 38 at higher applied cell voltages anodic dissolution of aluminum and bubble generation increases 39 producing large quantities of al oh 3 which binds nitrates into the precipitate gel matrix and gets removed by flotation as scum sludge the dominating species of solid compounds fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 at alkaline ph serve as adsorbents for removal of the pollutants contaminants by adsorption mechanism fig 4 b shows removal of phosphates during becc at cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v for 75 min et using al and ss electrodes freshly formed amorphous al oh 3 have large surface which provide adsorption sites for soluble organic compounds and trapping phosphates into the floc material removal of phosphates using ss electrodes is linked to the coagulation of po4 3 with fe iii salts by formation of fe hydroxo phosphate complexes which either adsorb onto positively charged fe iii hydrolysis species or act as center of precipitation for the hydrolysed products fig 4 c shows removal of sulfate during becc for cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v for 75 min et using al and ss electrodes an applied cell voltage of 12 v using al and ss electrodes showed maximum sulfate removal the mechanism of removal is the entrapment of sulfate ions so4 2 on porous iron and aluminum hydroxide precipitates 3 1 4 color the color of wastewater is because of the solids turbidity and dissolved metals other inorganic constituents present in it fig 5 a and b shows color removal in during becc experiments using al and ss electrodes for applied cell voltages of 6 24 v it may be observed that at 75 min et the maximum removal of color achieved was 77 15 using al electrodes for 12 v and 75 22 using ss electrodes fig 5 b removal of color showed improvement when using al electrodes compared to ss electrodes the release of poly nuclear hydroxyl aluminum complexes coagulate colloidal solids present in the wastewater thus favoring removal of apparent color 3 1 5 electrode dissolution electrode dissolution ed assist in electro floc formation is an integral part of any treatment process thereby removing contaminant pollutants from the wastewater fig 6 a and b shows ed for different cell voltages 6 12 18 and 24 v used in becc experiments for 1 cm inter electrode distance and electrodes arranged in bipolar mode using al and ss electrodes in bipolar mode ed is strongly influenced by position of the electrodes in the ecr and the applied cell voltage with the corresponding current across the electrodes the extreme electrode 1 connected to the positive terminal showed higher ed compared to electrode 4 away from the positive terminal where ed is least because of low electrical resistance when the electrodes are close to each other it results in the increased oxidation rate causing more coagulant generation because of the larger current between the electrodes an inter electrode distance of 5 mm may cause short circuiting as the electrolysis proceed 3 2 effect of applied cell voltage 12 and 18 v on discrete time electrolysis of raw hcfwws becc experiments were carried out using al and ss electrodes at 12 and 18 v for discrete et of 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min to extract intricate information about the electrode dissolution pattern sludge quantity level of contaminant pollutant removal post ecc water quality settling pattern of sludge and filterability potential 3 2 1 cod fig 7 a and b shows raw cod value and cod removal during becc of raw hcfwws for discrete ets for cell voltages 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes at an applied cell voltage of 12 v both al fig 7a and ss fig 7b electrodes showed cod removal of 192 mg l and 196 mg l codo 1536 mg l at 20 min et due to formation of electro coagulants by anodic dissolution leading to the pollutant contaminant removal by floc formation floc aggregation and sedimentation 50 of cod is removed when using al electrodes and 40 cod is removed when using ss electrodes in the first 5 min et irrespective of the cell voltages applied with progress in the ecc treatment cod removal is maximum at 20 25 min et for both al and ss electrodes the unusual cod removal trends during electrolysis is surmised for the presence of pharmaceutical compounds disinfectants dissolved salts and refractory recalcitrant compounds present in hcfwws hindering ecc 3 2 2 control of water quality parameters during ecc most water quality parameters can be kept under control to the desired level of treatment in ecc by simply controlling the flow of current across the electrodes in the presence of sufficient alkalinity and chlorides electrochemical treatment in aqueous solutions using distilled water is seen not as a wise option because the results are not dependable and quite away from real situation 3 2 2 1 chlorides fig 8 a and b shows chloride reduction for discrete ets for sa v 20 m2 m3 at 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes inefficient removal of chlorides during ecc was ascribed to high solubility during ets where most of the pollutant contaminants are removed from solution 5 25 min et and also high initial values of cl in hcfwws 3 2 2 2 tds fig 9 a and b shows the tds reduction for discrete ets during becc for sa v 20 m2 m3 four electrodes at 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes tds removal was observed to be low as the metal ion dosage had no sufficient strength charge power to destabilize the dissolved colloidal and suspended particles in the absence of colloids particles solids there is grave tendency that the tds values increase as electrolysis progress in certain special cases particularly at higher cell voltages 3 2 2 3 nitrates fig 10 a shows the plot of nitrate removal comparing al and ss electrodes for applied cell voltage of 12 v it may be observed that al electrodes show maximum nitrate removal compared to ss nitrates removal is because of electro reduction where nitrate is converted into nitrogen and ammonia which is readily adsorbed by the electro coagulants produced in situ during ecc and adsorption on the surfaces of hydroxide precipitates 40 the reactions involved in the removal of nitrate using al electrodes are shown in eqs 36 38 36 3no3 3h2o 2al 2al3 3no2 6oh 37 6no3 18h2o 10al 10al3 3n2 6oh 38 3no3 18h2o 8al 8al3 3nh3 27oh nitrates removal was observed to increase progressively at higher cell voltage of 18 v for al compared to ss electrodes fig 11 a because of high rate of metal oxidation resulting in greater amount of precipitate formation 3 2 2 4 phosphates fig 10 b shows phosphate removal from its initial value of 23 03 mg l for 12 v for discrete et using both al and ss electrodes phosphate removal is effected by the formation of fepo4 and fe oh 3 during ecc the solubility of fepo4 increases with increase in ph of the bulk solution enhancing phosphate removal because at higher ph fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 are formed in the dissolved state ss electrodes showed marginally higher removal of phosphate compared to al for 12 v similarly phosphate adsorption with al hydroxide and its precipitation forming alpo4 removes po4 from the wastewater when using al electrodes 41 following the reactions shown in eqs 39 and 40 39 al3 3h2o al oh 3 3h 40 al3 po4 3 alpo4 fig 11 b shows the phosphate removal using al and ss electrodes for 18 v both al and ss showed higher removal of phosphate due to charge neutralization by cationic hydrolysis products and entrapment of pollutants contaminants in the amorphous hydroxide precipitate matrix produced as a result sweep flocculation 3 2 2 5 sulfates fig 10 c shows sulfate removal for applied voltage of 12 v using al and ss electrodes a maximum removal of sulfates was achieved at 20 min et using al electrodes the removal of sulfates was attributed to al oh 3 produced during ecc resulting in precipitation and flotation 42 amorphous iron hydroxide precipitate generated during ecc at neutral and alkaline ph are considered as primary coagulants species fe2so4 resulting in pollutant contaminant removal by adsorption on the particles a quick removal of sulfates was achieved up to 20 min et after which the removal of phosphates was marginal for both al and ss electrodes fig 11 c shows sulfate removal using al and ss electrodes for 18 v removal of sulfate was due to the enmeshment of sulfate ion into the porous metal oxide or hydroxide precipitate 3 2 3 chloride to sulfate ratio chloride to sulfate mass ratio is often considered as corrosion potential parameter used to predict the effect of changes in water quality because of ecc treatment wastewater corrosivity is defined as the concentration of chloride mg l divided by the concentration of sulfate mg l because of high cl so4 ratios in the wastewater lead to higher metal corrosion rates during treatment although it is not known if this ratio determines corrosion 43 fig 12 a and b shows changes in chlorides to sulfates for discrete ets for cell voltages 12 and 18 v using al and ss electrodes the cl so4 show an undulating increase in the trend up to 20 min reaction time for 12 v and up to 30 min for 18 v when using al and ss electrodes after which time the ratio more or less seem to be stabilized the formation of carbonates in the solution during ecc is shown in eqs 41 43 as quoted by kabda≈ülƒ± et al 44 these reactions increase the ohmic resistance by the electrodes in the ecr 41 hco3 oh co3 2 h2o 42 co3 2 ca2 caco3 43 co3 2 mg2 mgco3 during ecc th values were seen to decrease with increase in reaction time the ca and mg salts react with alkalinity in the solution to form caco3 and mgco3 which tend to deposit on the cathode faces causing a very small reduction in the current on keen observation of the electrodes after ecc very thin layers of inorganic scale like deposit were seen to be removed as thin nano sized flakes hcwws contain high cl values which produce chlorine during ecc which also assist in the disinfection requirement and the chlorine demand of fe0 and fe2 in the ecr during treatment the cl so4 showed a decrease after 50 min et for 12 v for both the electrodes because sulfate values decrease with increase in et see fig 11 c low values of so4 in the cl so4 ratio causes increase in the cl so4 ratio as seen in fig 12 3 2 4 color fig 13 a and b shows color removal for discrete ets irrespective of the electrodes cell voltages and current across the electrodes a maximum color removal of 80 was achieved at 25 min et for both cell voltages and both electrodes after which time the color removal was only marginal by 5 al electrodes delivered a crystal clear supernatant while the post supernatant after gravity filtration with ss appeared mild green surmised to have occurred because of re release of fe ii and fe iii species back into the solution a quick filtration through some media just after ecc would solve the problem of color re entrainment back into the solution though apparent color is removed the true color remains after ecc by about 20 the true color residues can later be removed using impregnated gac columns 3 2 5 electrode dissolution fig 14 a d shows electrode dissolution of al and ss during discrete becc experiments for discrete ets of 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min for an applied cell voltages 12 and 18 v in a bipolar arrangement the first electrode connected to the positive terminal of the dc power supply unit dissolves more compared to the electrodes away from it with four electrodes the fourth electrode away from the positive terminal receives a very low current and therefore contribute poorly to the release of m ions into the solution 3 3 settling svi and csi 3 3 1 settling the slurry obtained after ecc was subject to sedimentation test in a 1 l graduated cylinder fig 15 a and b shows settling behavior of the sludge water interface for 12 18 and 24 v cell voltages using al and ss electrodes generally the rate of settling was quick for ss electrodes compared to al while using ss electrodes for 12 and 18 v the svi values were 212 76 and 320 85 in the case of al electrodes the supernatant appeared colorless giving high svi values of 478 26 and 718 95 for 12 and 18 v respectively al flocs were fragile and therefore showed high svi values compared to ss at the zeroth time in the settling process using al sludge settling is poor in the first 5 min because of fragile flocs and entrapped gases with brownian motion of floc particles followed by a steady state decrease in height of the interface exhibiting hindered type iii settling at the end of the settling time h 30 a good compression settling is obtained for ss electrodes and a much smaller rate of decrease in the interface for al electrodes is obtained fig 15 a 3 3 2 settling patterns of post ecc slurry for discrete et for al and ss electrodes to exercise control on the svi values post ecc water quality and electrode dissolution ed which imply operational cost becc for electrolysis time from 5 to 60 min with 5 10 min intervals were carried out discretely using al and ss electrodes for cell voltages 12 and 18 v fig 16 a and b shows the settling behavior of post ecc slurry using al electrodes for 12 and 18 v in case of al electrodes the interface settling was very slowly for ecc 30 40 min ets fig 16 a compared to the interface for 10 25 min et ss contains fe and therefore good settling patterns were obtained within a short settling time the interface was clear for al slurry with poor settling for ets over 20 min fig 16 b with corresponding cod and color removal of 192 mg l and 74 31 for 12 v fig 17 a and b shows the settling behavior of post ecc slurry of hcfwws for cell voltages 12 and 18 v using ss electrodes for 12 v and up to 20 min discrete et the quantity of flocs were limited and so the flocs showed discrete settling velocities in the column resulting in quick settling fig 17 a for ets 30 min the ed was marginally high with a clear interface in the column with corresponding cod removal of over 90 and color 80 discrete and compression settling were prominent at 18 v ecc fig 17 b at 25 min et with cod residue of 192 mg l in the supernatant 3 4 sludge volume index svi settling characteristics of sludge generated during batch ecc experiments were quantified using sludge volume index svi svi values were calculated using the relation shown in eq 44 44 svi 1000 h 30 h 0 x 0 where h 30 is the height of sludge after 30 min settling in the column h 0 is the initial height of slurry and x 0 is initial solids concentration in slurry 3 4 1 svi for applied cell voltage 6 24 v svi values for al and ss electrodes were seen to increase with increase in applied cell voltage table 4 shows the svi values obtain for 6 12 18 and 24 v for al and ss electrodes high svi values at higher applied voltages are because of more ed and sweep flocculation effects an increase in solution temperature by 8 c led to greater mobility of the formed species 3 4 2 svi values for discrete et for cell voltages 12 and 18 v svi values were also estimated for post ecc slurry for discrete ets 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min using al and ss electrodes for cell voltages 12 and 18 v svi values as low as of 79 36 ml g for 12 v and 159 79 ml g for 18 v were obtained for al electrodes at 10 min et with only few sludge particles and high density it settles quickly in the settling column svi values of 260 8 ml g for 12 v and 314 87 ml g for 18 v using ss electrodes for 10 min et were obtained because of a larger floc matrix 3 5 centrifugal settling index csi sludge settled in the settling column at 30 min was further subject to dewaterability test to evaluate sludge dewaterability parameter csi csi values were calculated using relation shown in eq 45 45 csi c 0 c c c 0 where c 0 is the initial suspended solids after compression settling in the column at 30 min settling c c is the centrate supernatant suspended solids in mg l after centrifugation sludge showing high csi values are indicative of easy dewaterability 3 5 1 csi for becc of hcfwws for cell voltage 6 24 v 6 v of cell voltage could not produce enough sludge and therefore csi values could not be obtained csi values at 12 18 and 24 v using al were 86 75 86 19 and 85 59 similarly csi values obtained using ss were 95 88 5 and 88 04 respectively 3 5 2 csi for discrete et for cell voltage 12 and 18 v fig 18 a shows csi values obtained for post ecc settled sludge for 12 and 18 v using al electrodes csi values were more or less stable for all ets from 30 to 60 min for 12 v at 30 min et and above the floc matrix enters into a maturity state where csi values show a declining trend in case of ss electrodes as seen in for 18 v fig 18 b high csi values of 95 were obtained showing stable values at all discrete ets at 12 v proving the novelty of the ecc process 3 6 filterability filterability of ecc treated slurry was tested using simple gravity filtration as a cross check for clarity filtrate and sturdiness of the sludge and quick filtration plots of Œ¥t Œ¥v versus the total volume v were obtained for scenarios the values of Œ± and r m were then estimated applying the differential equation shown in eq 3 of each straight line slope and intercept derived from the graph of Œ¥t Œ¥v and v 3 6 1 filterability of post ecc slurry for discrete et with 12 and 18 v using al electrodes fig 19 a and b shows plots of Œ¥t Œ¥v as a function of v for filterability of post ecc slurry for 12 v and 18 v for discrete ets using al electrodes quick filtration without any pore blockages in the filter medium was achieved for 12 v at 20 min et fig 19 a the corresponding values of Œ± and r m 1 020 1014 m kg 1 and 7 312 108 m 1 poor filterability was obtained after 30 min et because most of the solids are removed from the solution and the agglomerating flocs go mobile in the ecr bombarding with each other with freely moving m ions tearing apart and disintegrating the agglomerated floc into smaller sized particles these small sized particles during filtration clog the pores of the filter medium and therefore the filtration slows down the values of Œ± and r m obtained for discrete ets using al electrodes for 12 and 18 v are tabulated in table 6 it may be observed from both the plots that a 25 or 30 min et gives trend lines close to x axis proving good filterability for both 12 and 18 v data points away from the abscissa show poor filterability 22 3 6 2 filterability of post ecc slurry for discrete et with 12 and 18 v using ss electrodes fig 20 a and b shows plot of Œ¥t Œ¥v versus v for filterability of post ecc slurry for discrete et for 12 v and 18 v using ss electrodes the sludge generated had good filtration characteristics for 12 v at 25 min et fig 20 a solid triangle and corresponding Œ± and r m were 7 109 1014 m kg 1 and 1 139 107 m 1 the variations in Œ± and r m while applying ecc are ascribed to several important factors viz sources of raw wastewater its characteristics strength operating conditions floc characteristics maturity et cake blinding during filtration initial alkalinity and chloride conditions coagulant aid if any floc integrity time lapse after ecc before filtration and viscosity of the post ecc slurry a larger scatter data points fig 20 b indicate a rather high cell voltage applied during ecc which tend to generate more floc density in the post ecc slurry table 7 shows the values of Œ± and r m obtained at discrete et during becc using ss electrodes it may be observed from fig 20 a that a 5 min et solid squares slurry filterability data away from the abscissa it shows poor filterability and pore blocking in the filter medium and also maturity of flocs generated during ecc et is a control parameter which is neither too small nor too large all optimal et always exist in ecc a novel treatment process it was concluded that a cell voltage of 12 v was optimal for treating raw hcfwws for good settleability filtereability control svi and maximum cod removals smaller electrolysis times gives a developing floc with open ended charges which tend to break or cause pore blockage in filter medium the sequence of the ecc treatment process beginning from reactor setup bipolar electrode arrangement pollutant contaminant removal settling filterability dry sludge generation and water reclamation are shown in plate 1 though 2d ecc treatment process has many ingrained merits it has only few limitations to mention extensive foaming during ecc was observed with the foam occupying 1 3rd the top of the ecr the second limitation was to drive away entrapped gases in floc matrix which requires several swirling of the ecr slurry after ecc before commencing settling the third final limitation is that the electrode and the top portion of ecr after ecc appear physically very dirty but cleaning could be carried out at ease 4 conclusions becc experiments for the treatment of hcfwws were investigated for applied cell voltages of 6 12 18 and 24 v using al and ss two dimensional electrodes for 75 min et an applied cell voltage of 12 v cd 80 a m2 showed good results in removal of cod color nitrates phosphates and sulfates using al electrodes 87 5 removal of cod 46 81 nitrates 91 50 phosphates 42 05 sulfates and 74 color were achieved at 20 25 min et compared to other cell voltages when using ss electrodes for a cell voltage of 12 v 82 03 removal of cod 45 46 nitrates 87 88 phosphates 51 57 sulfates and 70 89 color were achieved at 20 25 min et the sludge generated from ss electrodes during ecc treatment showed good settling properties compared to al electrodes while conducting ecc for discrete ets 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 min using al and ss electrodes al electrodes showed 87 5 removal of cod 67 11 nitrates 86 19 phosphates 74 46 sulfates and 74 31 color at 20 min et compared to ss electrodes for 87 23 removal of cod 41 64 nitrates 84 38 phosphates 68 73 sulfates and 71 92 color were achieved respectively both al and ss electrodes showed good removal of organics and improved water quality for a cell voltage of 12 v settling and filterability characteristics of the sludge for ss electrodes were good compared to al electrodes as ss contain high fe and with high density favors the formation of sturdy floc and good bonding poor settling of sludge generated from al electrodes was due to gel like structure of aluminum hydroxide and trapped gases preventing rapid settling of flocs formed and moderate filterability the agar plate count apc values were 10 cfu ml for aluminum electrodes and 5 cfu ml for ss electrodes the results obtained from this work strongly upholds the novelty of using ecc for treatment of toxic recalcitrant hcfwws both al and ss 2d electrodes showed good ability for removal of organics simultaneously exercising control on other water quality parameters the clean water reclaimed was 70 75 of the water treated with ton values 1 colorless and cod levels 250 mg l meeting the

14494,this study evaluated advanced oxidation processes that use germicidal low pressure lp mercury lamps to identify an energy efficient treatment technology that can degrade carbamazepine cbz in drinking water in this context degradation of carbamazepine in deionised water by direct photolysis uvc Œª 254 nm uvc h2o2 and uvc tio2 were investigated using batch and flow through experiments batch experiments were conducted to determine the degradation kinetics of cbz spiked in deionised water under varying uv intensities and chemical doses effect of incidental uv intensity was studied under 0

intensity of 3 4 kw m3 in the presence of 50 mg l of h2o2 the effect of various parameters on degradation of cbz was further described by developing relationships equating operational parameters and kinetic coefficients these relationships were validated with kinetic coefficients estimated from continuous flow through experiments kinetic constants obtained for optimal conditions under flow through experiments were in good agreement with the equation developed and had a marginal deviation of only 6 energy requirements for direct photolysis and uvc tio2 under optimal conditions were 380

wastewater treatment plant hplc high performance liquid chromatography keywords drinking water treatment carbamazepine advanced oxidation processes aops uvc h2o2 uvc tio2 1 introduction in recent decades presence of pharmaceutical compounds in fresh water sources has led to concerns about their potential ecological effects carbamazepine cbz is one such pharmaceutical frequently detected in aquatic environments around the globe 1 4 cbz also known commercially as tegratol and epitol is a prescription drug used to treat epilepsy second most common central nervous system disease after stroke schizophrenia and manic and depressive episodes of bipolar disorder cbz is highly recalcitrant to biodegradation and thus remains mostly unaffected with only a small fraction being removed in conventional wastewater treatment processes 5 8 therefore release of wwtp effluents into receiving waters is considered as the primary route of cbz into aquatic environments cbz has been detected in wwtp effluents in concentrations ranging from ng l to Œºg l 9 11 due to its resistance to natural degradation such as direct photolysis under sunlight it is retained in natural waters for long periods evidence suggest that it is present in many drinking water sources 12 15 average of 6 8 ng l in 19 drinking water treatment plants in u s 16 30 ng l in drinking water in england 17 and 20 ng l in water supply wells in germany 18 due to its ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments cbz has been reported as an anthropogenic marker of urban pollution 19 cbz most likely has chronic rather than acute effects due to its continual presence at low concentrations in aquatic environments however findings on the ecotoxicity of cbz vary widely according to ferrari et al 2003 20 cbz concentration of 13 800 Œºg l over 48 h exposure is found to cause 50 effect ec50 on d magna on the other hand findings by jos et al 2003 21 suggest no immediate acute effect on aquatic biota ec50 4 5 383 5 mg l nonetheless the present european legislation on the classification and labelling of chemicals 92 32 ecc has recognised cbz with potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms and long term adverse effects to the aquatic ecosystem application of advanced oxidation processes aops for treatment of cbz and other pharmaceuticals has attracted significant interest among the choice of emerging treatment options aops using ultraviolet c uvc 254 nm light treatment is one of the commonly adopted method for disinfection of water however uvc irradiation at disinfection doses 40 mj cm2 has been shown ineffective to remove cbz 13 addition of h2o2 combined with uvc has shown enhancement in the rate of degradation of cbz the process includes direct degradation by photolysis as well as indirect photodegradation by oh hydroxyl radicals hydroxyl radicals are powerful oxidants formed from the splitting of h2o2 upon absorption of uv oh are nonspecific in their attack and has been reported to degrade cbz quite effectively 22 25 some of the degradation products of cbz formed during uv photolysis such as acridine and acridone have a higher toxicity than cbz 26 though evidence suggests indirect photodegradation of cbz by oh using uv h2o2 as one of the efficient methods for degradation of cbz relationships describing the effect of operational parameters with relevance to drinking water treatment are not reported in literature this paper aims to investigate the effect of various aops that primarily use germicidal low pressure mercury lamps on degradation of cbz with relevance to drinking water treatment to this end the study compares direct uvc photolysis with uvc h2o2 and uvc tio2 for degradation of cbz experiments were conducted in batch mode by varying the process parameters such as uv h2o2 and tio2 doses degradation kinetics were evaluated for various combinations of operational conditions and relationships were developed by equating operational parameters with kinetics of degradation further bench scale experiments were conducted in a flow through reactor with optimal conditions evaluated previously using batch experiments kinetics estimated from flow through experiments were used to validate the relationships determined using batch experiments these observations were collectively applied to identify energy efficient aop using low pressure disinfection lamps for degradation of cbz in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents analytical grade cbz 99 purity was purchased from sigma aldrich co oakville ontario canada and 30 w w

research inc canada the reactor accommodated a maximum of 10 lamps with 5 on each side of the reactor vessel low pressure germicidal lamps sankyo denki g8t5 8 w with radiation intensities peaking at 254 nm were used for uvc irradiation in order to attain uniform irradiation throughout the experiments the lamps were illuminated and allowed to warm up for 20 min prior to experiments varying uvc intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3 was achieved by using 1 3 and 5 lamps on each side of the reactor vessel the amount of radiation entering the reaction vessel was determined using ferrioxalate

w 254 nm were connected from the input side of the chamber the intensity of radiation in the reaction vessel was evaluated by using ferrioxalate actinometry 2 3 experimental procedure 2 3 1 batch experiments batch experiments were performed in a cylindrical quartz beaker d 7 cm h 13 cm with a working volume of 200 ml the schematic of experimental setup and the configuration of lamps are shown in fig 1 a initial cbz concentration of 5 mg l was used in all experiments it was prepared by spiking 10 ml of a 100 mg l stock solution table 1 shows the dosages of h2o2 and tio2 used to evaluate optimal conditions for degradation of cbz initially the effect of intensity of uvc radiation was evaluated by conducting experiments in the absence of h2o2 and tio2 under varying intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3 optimal h2o2 dose for the degradation of cbz was determined by varying h2o2 doses table 1 while having a constant uvc intensity of 3 4 kw m3 further effect of uv intensity was evaluated by varying the uv intensity while keeping the h2o2 dose constant in all experiments a magnetic stirrer was used to homogenize the solution and 2 ml samples were collected at specified time intervals the experiments were conducted at near neutral ph of 7 0 3 dilute solutions of hcl and naoh of 0 1 m was used dropwise to adjust ph all experiments were conducted in duplicates and average values reported the variation between duplicate samples did not exceed 5 2 3 2 flow through experiments the schematic of reactor setup used for conducting flow through experiments is shown fig 1b the continuous flow uv reactor was fed from a 30 l reservoir and constantly stirred at 100 rpm to maintain uniform concentration in the influent direct uvc photolysis and uvc h2o2 experiments were conducted at flow rates of 1 and 5 2 l min respectively influent cbz concentration of 5 mg l was used in both experiments h2o2 dose of 50 mg l was spiked in the influent for uvc h2o2 experiment one ml samples were withdrawn periodically and analysed in hplc to evaluate degradation of cbz the cbz concentration was monitored at the outlet of the reactor and at the reservoir for uv photolysis and uv h2o2 experiments respectively 2 3 3 sample analysis cbz was analysed using varian prostar 210 high pressure liquid chromatograph hplc with a uv vis detector set at Œª 286 nm isocratic eluent consisting water and methanol 40 and 60 acidified with 10 mm phosphoric acid was pumped at flowrate of 1 ml min a pinnacle db c 18 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 Œºm column maintained at room temperature was used to separate cbz from its by products injection volume of 50 Œºl was maintained for all samples concentrations ranging from 0 25 to 5 mg l was used to prepare a calibration curve peak areas detected for samples corresponding to cbz were linearly regressed against the calibration curve to obtain concentration of cbz in unknown samples all samples were analysed in duplicate and average values are reported here the limit of detection using this method was estimated as 0 1 mg l total organic carbon toc in aqueous samples were analysed shimadzu toc l total organic carbon analyzer fitted with an asi l autosampler 2 3 4 kinetic modeling and estimation of reaction rate coefficients the rate of reaction and corresponding reaction rate coefficients for degradation of carbamazepine under uv photolysis and uv h2o2 was estimated by fitting degradation data with zero order and first order reaction models the best describing reaction model was chosen based on the least root mean squared error rmse estimated for various model fits in comparison with experimental data reaction rates were estimated based on both time and fluence the following equations describe linearized time based zero order eq 1 and first order reaction eq 2 models 1 c c 0 k 0 t 2 ln c c 0 k 1 t where c is the concentration mg l of carbamazepine observed at any instance of time t c0 is the initial concentration of carbamazepine mg l k0 is the zero order reaction rate coefficient mg l min based on time k1 is the first order reaction rate coefficient min 1 based on time the equations describing the reactions based on volumetric fluence are described as 3 c c 0 k 0 f e v t 4 ln c c 0 k 1 f e v t where ev is the volumetric fluence kw m3 representing the irradiance per unit volume k0f is the zero order reaction rate coefficient mg j based on fluence k1f is the first order reaction rate coefficient j 1 based on fluence order of reaction was estimated based on the best fit observed for experimental data with respect to different models the slope of the model fit to experimental data corresponding the best model fits was taken as the kinetic rate coefficient 3 results and discussions 3 1 uvc photolysis the susceptibility of an organic compound for direct photolysis degradation is controlled by two main parameters including the decadic molar absorption coefficient Œµ Œª 254 nm m 1 cm 1 and the quantum yield œï m einstein 1 the molar absorption coefficient expresses the probability of the compound to absorb light at a certain wavelength higher values of Œµ Œª denoted intrinsic property of the compound to absorb more light 25 the molar extinction coefficient for cbz Œµ Œª 254 nm cbz is estimated as 6140 m 1 cm 1 this value is comparable with other reported values by pereira et al 2007 25 of 6070 m 1 cm 1 and vogna et al 2004 23 of 6025 m 1 cm 1 the quantum yield represents the ratio between total number of molecules of the compound degraded to the total number of photons absorbed by the compound the quantum yield for cbz under uvc irradiation was calculated as 0 00167 m einstein 1 based on the expression derived by stefan and bolton 2005 28 pereira et al 2007 25 has estimated quantum yield of 0 0006 m einstein 1 for cbz based in uvc photolysis experiments in synthetic and natural water though cbz has a higher molar absorption coefficient small values of quantum yield denotes that the compound is less susceptible to degradation by direct uvc photolysis fig 2 shows the degradation of cbz with respect to time under various uvc intensities the total uv dose at the end of 8 h irradiation in samples corresponds to 0 3 45 12 67 and 19 58 kj for uvc intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3 under uvc irradiation degradation of cbz followed zero order kinetics for concentrations above 0 5 mg l this indicates that photolysis of cbz by direct photolysis is limited by the intensity of incident radiation and not by concentration of cbz up to a concentration of 0 5 mg l degradation rate coefficients determined from experimental data presented in fig 2 for various intensities with respect to time and fluence are tabulated in table 2 the rate ceoffecients were estimated as 2 5 10 3 8 6 10 3 and 14 10 3 mg l 1 min 1 for uvc intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3respectively the rate of degradation was also directly proportional to incidental uvc intensities with linear dependence with high correlation r2 0 99 3 2 uvc h2o2 primary photolysis of h2o2 under uv radiation using lp lamps with peak intensities at 254 nm leads to efficient generation of oh radicals hydroxyl radicals possess high oxidation potential e0 2 8 ev and are capable of reacting with broad range of compounds due to their non specificity in reaction breakdown of compounds occur through sequential hydroxylation dehydrogenation steps leading to higher degree of mineralisation the effect of h2o2 doses on cbz degradation under a constant uv intensity of 3 4 kw m3 is shown in fig 3 the slope estimated for each degradation profile pertaining to each experiment represents the kinetics of cbz with respect to time the corresponding kinetic rate coefficients with respect to volumetric fluence is listed in table 3 addition of h2o2 even in small amounts significantly enhanced the degradation of cbz under uvc in deionised water more than 99 cbz degraded in 8 4 2 and 1 75 min for doses of 10 25 50 and 100 mg l respectively rate of degradation by uvc h2o2 followed first order kinetics and the rate coefficient calculated for 10 25 50 and 100 mg l of h2o2 dose corresponds to 0 6 1 2 2 2 and 2 5 min 1 under uvc intensity of 3 4 kw m3 half life of cbz was reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude with addition of 50 mg l of h2o2 table 3 kinetic rate coefficient based on volumetric fluence estimated for uvc h2o2 with a dose of 50 mg l was 200 times higher than direct photolysis this present study has illustrated that volumetric fluence kw m3 based rate coefficients hold better validity for different reactor systems as compared to kinetic constants based on area m2 j previous investigations evaluating uv h2o2 process reported in literature well corroborated with area based kinetic constants reported in the literature volumetric fluence based kinetic constants for cbz using uvc h2o2 process has not been reported earlier for a dose of 10 mg l of h2o2 this present study has estimated 2 2 10 3 cm2 mj which is very close to values reported by pereira et al 2007 25 2 7 10 3 cm2 mj for the same dose of h2o2 overall mineralisation of cbz was determined by measuring residual total organic carbon toc in both experiments conducted with and without h2o2 the persistence of toc in solution after removal of cbz has been widely reported as a lacuna for uv h2o2 process 29 however this present study indicates promise of complete mineralization of cbz using uvc h2o2 as significant improvement to toc removal is noted by increase of irradiation period under uvc irradiation of 3 4 kw m3 and with 100 mg l of h2o2 85 of toc was reduced within an irradiation period of 8 h first order rate constants obtained from uvc h2o2 batch experiments are plotted as a function of h2o2 concentration in fig 4 addition of h2o2 significantly improved the degradation rate of cbz for h2o2 doses between 10 to 50 mg l however increase of h2o2 dose from 50 mg l to 100 mg l 100 increase in h2o2 dose resulted in marginal improvement of 13 increase in degradation rate at high h2o2 doses recombination of oh radicals and scavenging of excessive oh radicals by h2o2 are interpreted to be the reason behind lower degradation rates 30 31 the following equations describe the reactions involved in this phenomenon 1 2 o h h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 o h h 2 o h o 2 3 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o h h 2 o o 2 4 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 the effect of uvc intensity on kinetics of degradation of cbz was evaluated to establish the relationship between these parameters fig 5 shows the rate of degradation of cbz spiked with 50 mg l of h2o2 irradiated with uvc intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3 as can be expected increase in light intensity resulted in a faster rate of degradation of cbz first order kinetic rate coefficients for varying light intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kj m3were estimated as 0 51 1 43 and 2 1 min 1 for degradation of cbz in pure water the kinetic rate constants and the intensity of uvc irradiation followed a linear relationship with an r2 of 0 99 as observed in pure photolysis experiments degradation of cbz by uv h2o2 was also limited by incident number of photons time dependent kinetic rate coefficients estimated for various uv intensities increased proportionally with highly linearity r2 of 0 99 however kinetic rate constant based on fluence did not vary with respect to intensity of incident irradiation table 3 as energy estimated for achieving degradation of one order of magnitude was equal to 198 15 kj in all the cases 3 3 uvc tio2 photocatalytic process using uvc tio2 presents the advantage of utilizing multiple highly reactive species other than oh radicals as compared to uv h2o2 32 under irradiation of photons with energy equal to or more than its band gap of 3 2 ev electron donating and electron accepting sites are formed which induces oxidation reduction reactions the strong oxidative potential of the positive holes directly oxidizes organic contaminants or forms oh radicals by oxidation of water which initiates the attack also surface trapped electrons react with dissolved oxygen to form superoxide ions o2 which is a powerful oxidant the collective attack by variety of radical species formed from tio2 photocatalysis is expected to achieve faster degradation and greater degree of mineralisation fig 6 shows the degradation of cbz under various tio2 doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g l irradiated with uvc of intensity 3 4 kw m3 adsorption of cbz on tio2 in the dark was not significant as control experiments conducted in the dark showed only less than 4 decrease in cbz concentration effective degradation of cbz was noticed in the presence of 0 5 g l of tio2 with more than 95 of degradation occurring within 10 min of irradiation increase in tio2 loading above 0 5 g l resulted in slower kinetics table 3 studies with other pharmaceuticals such as amoxicillin and paracetamol have also been reported to degrade efficiently in tio2 doses ranging between 0 2 and 0 8 g l 33 at higher tio2 doses light scattering by surplus tio2 results in inefficient light absorption leading to reduced rate of photodegradation 34 this present study shows that uvc h2o2 process is more efficient for degradation of cbz compared to uvc tio2 fluence based kinetic rates estimated for uvc h2o2 process was 7 times higher that uvc tio2 for a constant uv intensity of 3 4 kw m3 table 3 as performance of uvc tio2 process was lower compared to uvc h2o2 further bench scale investigations using uvc tio2 process were not pursued 3 4 bench scale continuous flow through reactor studies bench scale reactor studies on direct uvc photolysis of cbz were performed in flow through mode with a flow rate of flowrate of 1 l min using ferrioxalate actinometry the uv intensity applied for direct photolysis experiment was determined as 5 93 kw m3 fraction of cbz observed in outlet with respect to the applied volumetric fluence is shown in fig 7 concentration of cbz measured just after breakthrough at 15 min showed degradation less than 6 corresponding to a fluence of 5000 kj m3 the efficiency of degradation further increased by a 5 over 30 min of irradiation with time mainly due to efficiency of the lamps reaching their maximum capacity after startup hence concentration of cbz observed at 45 min was used to estimate the rate of degradation kinetics and profile of cbz before breakthrough was used to analyse the order of kinetics the cbz concentration profile observed for direct uvc photolysis in continuous reactor studies also correlated well with zero order reaction kinetics with an estimated coefficient of 0 026 min 1 the kinetic rate coefficients for continuous flow experiments were estimated by using a plug flow reactor model fig 8 shows the correlation between kinetic coefficients and uv doses estimated in batch and continuous reactors rate coefficient estimated for continuous reactor experiments fitted with expression developed based on the batch experiments with a deviation of only 11 fluence based rate kinetics for bench scale experiments was estimated as 7 5 10 5 mg j which only deviated by 7 as compared to direct photolysis experiments conducted in batch mode table 1 fig 9 shows the fraction of cbz measured in the effluent for continuous bench scale reactor experiments conducted with h2o2 dose of 50 mg l higher flow rate of 5 2 l min allowing a retention time of 2 3 min was employed in this case volumetric uv intensity applied for uvc h2o2 in this experiment was estimated as 3 16 kw m3 concentration of the cbz measured in the outlet of the reactor quickly reached an equilibrium with more than 99 degraded for a residence time of 2 min the order and degradation rate kinetics was estimated by regression analysis of the cbz degradation profile kinetics of cbz degradation in continuous flow through experiments also followed first order the rate coefficient was estimated as 1 98

decades presence of pharmaceutical compounds in fresh water sources has led to concerns about their potential ecological effects carbamazepine cbz is one such pharmaceutical frequently detected in aquatic environments around the globe 1 4 cbz also known commercially as tegratol and epitol is a prescription drug used to treat epilepsy second most common central nervous system disease after stroke schizophrenia and manic and depressive episodes of bipolar disorder cbz is highly recalcitrant to biodegradation and thus remains mostly unaffected with only a small fraction being removed in conventional wastewater treatment processes 5 8 therefore release of wwtp effluents into receiving waters is considered as the primary route of cbz into aquatic environments cbz has been detected in wwtp effluents in concentrations ranging from ng l to Œºg l 9 11 due to its resistance to natural degradation such as direct photolysis under sunlight it is retained in natural waters for long periods evidence suggest that it is present in many drinking water sources 12 15 average of 6 8 ng l in 19 drinking water treatment plants in u s 16 30 ng l in drinking water in england 17 and 20 ng l in water supply wells in germany 18 due to its ubiquitous presence in aquatic environments cbz has been reported as an anthropogenic marker of urban pollution 19 cbz most likely has chronic rather than acute effects due to its continual presence at low concentrations in aquatic environments however findings on the ecotoxicity of cbz vary widely according to ferrari et al 2003 20 cbz concentration of 13 800 Œºg l over 48 h exposure is found to cause 50 effect ec50 on d magna on the other hand findings by jos et al 2003 21 suggest no immediate acute effect on aquatic biota ec50 4 5 383 5 mg l nonetheless the present european legislation on the classification and labelling of chemicals 92 32 ecc has recognised cbz with potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms and long term adverse effects to the aquatic ecosystem application of advanced oxidation processes aops for treatment of cbz and other pharmaceuticals has attracted significant interest among the choice of emerging treatment options aops using ultraviolet c uvc 254 nm light treatment is one of the commonly adopted method for disinfection of water however uvc irradiation at disinfection doses 40 mj cm2 has been shown ineffective to remove cbz 13 addition of h2o2 combined with uvc has shown enhancement in the rate of degradation of cbz the process includes direct degradation by photolysis as well as indirect photodegradation by oh hydroxyl radicals hydroxyl radicals are powerful oxidants formed from the splitting of h2o2 upon absorption of uv oh are nonspecific in their attack and has been reported to degrade cbz quite effectively 22 25 some of the degradation products of cbz formed during uv photolysis such as acridine and acridone have a higher toxicity than cbz 26 though evidence suggests indirect photodegradation of cbz by oh using uv h2o2 as one of the efficient methods for degradation of cbz relationships describing the effect of operational parameters with relevance to drinking water treatment are not reported in literature this paper aims to investigate the effect of various aops that primarily use germicidal low pressure mercury lamps on degradation of cbz with relevance to drinking water treatment to this end the study compares direct uvc photolysis with uvc h2o2 and uvc tio2 for degradation of cbz experiments were conducted in batch mode by varying the process parameters such as uv h2o2 and tio2 doses degradation kinetics were evaluated for various combinations of operational conditions and relationships were developed by equating operational parameters with kinetics of degradation further bench scale experiments were conducted in a flow through reactor with optimal conditions evaluated previously using batch experiments kinetics estimated from flow through experiments were used to validate the relationships determined using batch experiments these observations were collectively applied to identify energy efficient aop using low pressure

in fig 1 a initial cbz concentration of 5 mg l was used in all experiments it was prepared by spiking 10 ml of a 100 mg l stock solution table 1 shows the dosages of h2o2 and tio2 used to evaluate optimal conditions for degradation of cbz initially the effect of intensity of uvc radiation was evaluated by conducting experiments in the absence of h2o2 and tio2 under varying intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3 optimal h2o2 dose for the degradation of cbz was determined by varying h2o2 doses table 1 while having a constant uvc intensity of 3 4 kw m3 further effect of uv intensity was evaluated by varying the uv intensity while keeping the h2o2 dose constant in all experiments a magnetic stirrer was used to homogenize the solution and 2 ml samples were collected at specified time intervals the experiments were conducted at near neutral ph of 7 0 3 dilute solutions of hcl and naoh of 0 1 m was used dropwise to adjust ph all experiments were conducted in duplicates and average

continuous flow uv reactor was fed from a 30 l reservoir and constantly stirred at 100 rpm to maintain uniform concentration in the influent direct uvc photolysis and uvc h2o2 experiments were conducted at flow rates of 1 and 5 2 l min respectively influent cbz concentration of 5 mg l was used in both experiments h2o2 dose of 50 mg l was spiked in the influent for uvc h2o2 experiment one ml samples were withdrawn periodically and analysed in hplc to evaluate degradation of cbz the cbz concentration was monitored at the outlet of the reactor and at the reservoir for uv photolysis and uv

asi l autosampler 2 3 4 kinetic modeling and estimation of reaction rate coefficients the rate of reaction and corresponding reaction rate coefficients for degradation of carbamazepine under uv photolysis and uv h2o2 was estimated by fitting degradation data with zero order and first order reaction models the best describing reaction model was chosen based on the least root mean squared error rmse estimated for various model fits in comparison with experimental data reaction rates were estimated based on both time and fluence the following equations describe linearized time based zero order eq 1 and first order reaction eq 2 models 1 c c 0 k 0 t 2 ln c c 0 k 1 t where c is the concentration mg l of carbamazepine observed at any instance of time t c0 is the initial concentration of carbamazepine mg l k0 is the zero order reaction rate coefficient mg l min based on time k1 is the first order reaction rate coefficient min 1 based on time the equations describing

experimental data with respect to different models the slope of the model fit to experimental data corresponding the best model fits was taken as the kinetic rate coefficient 3 results and discussions 3 1 uvc photolysis the susceptibility of an organic compound for direct photolysis degradation is controlled by two main parameters including the decadic molar absorption coefficient Œµ Œª 254 nm m 1 cm 1 and the quantum yield œï m einstein 1 the molar absorption coefficient expresses the probability of the compound to absorb light at a certain wavelength higher values of Œµ Œª denoted intrinsic property of the compound to absorb more light 25 the molar extinction coefficient for cbz Œµ Œª 254 nm cbz is estimated as 6140 m 1 cm 1 this value is comparable with other reported values by pereira et al 2007 25 of 6070 m 1 cm 1 and vogna et al 2004 23 of 6025 m 1 cm 1 the quantum yield represents the ratio between total number of molecules of the compound degraded to the total number of photons absorbed by the compound the quantum yield for cbz under uvc irradiation was calculated as 0 00167 m einstein 1 based on the expression derived by stefan and bolton 2005 28 pereira et al 2007 25 has estimated quantum yield of 0 0006 m einstein 1 for cbz based in uvc photolysis experiments in synthetic and natural water though cbz has a higher molar absorption coefficient small values of quantum yield denotes that the compound is less susceptible to degradation by direct uvc photolysis fig 2 shows the degradation of cbz with respect to time under various uvc intensities the total uv dose at the end of 8 h irradiation in samples corresponds to 0 3 45 12 67 and 19 58 kj for uvc intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3 under uvc irradiation degradation of cbz followed zero order kinetics for concentrations above 0 5 mg l this indicates that photolysis of cbz by direct photolysis is limited by the intensity of incident radiation and not by concentration of cbz up to a concentration of 0 5 mg l degradation rate coefficients determined from experimental data presented in fig 2 for various intensities with respect to time and fluence are tabulated in table 2 the rate ceoffecients were estimated as 2 5 10 3 8 6 10 3 and 14 10 3 mg l 1 min 1 for uvc intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3respectively the rate of degradation was also directly proportional to incidental uvc intensities with linear dependence with high correlation r2 0 99 3 2 uvc h2o2 primary photolysis of h2o2 under uv radiation using lp lamps with peak intensities at 254 nm leads to efficient generation of oh radicals hydroxyl radicals possess high oxidation potential e0 2 8 ev and are capable of reacting with broad range of compounds due to their non specificity in reaction breakdown of compounds occur through sequential hydroxylation dehydrogenation steps leading to higher degree of mineralisation the effect of h2o2 doses on cbz degradation under a constant uv intensity of 3 4 kw m3 is shown in fig 3 the slope estimated for each degradation profile pertaining to each experiment represents the kinetics of cbz with respect to time the corresponding kinetic rate coefficients with respect to volumetric fluence is listed in table 3 addition of h2o2 even in small amounts significantly enhanced the degradation of cbz under uvc in deionised water more than 99 cbz degraded in 8 4 2 and 1 75 min for doses of 10 25 50 and 100 mg l respectively rate of degradation by uvc h2o2 followed first order kinetics and the rate coefficient calculated for 10 25 50 and 100 mg l of h2o2 dose corresponds to 0 6 1 2 2 2 and 2 5 min 1 under uvc intensity of 3 4 kw m3 half life of cbz was reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude with addition of 50 mg l of h2o2 table 3 kinetic rate coefficient based on volumetric fluence estimated for uvc h2o2 with a dose of 50 mg l was 200 times higher than direct photolysis this present study has illustrated that volumetric fluence kw m3 based rate coefficients hold better validity for different reactor systems as compared to kinetic constants based on area m2 j previous investigations evaluating uv h2o2 process reported in literature well corroborated with area based kinetic constants reported in the literature volumetric fluence based kinetic constants for cbz using uvc h2o2 process has not been reported earlier for a dose of 10 mg l of h2o2 this present study has estimated 2 2 10 3 cm2 mj which is very close to values reported by pereira et al 2007 25 2 7 10 3 cm2 mj for the same dose of h2o2 overall mineralisation of cbz was determined by measuring residual total organic carbon toc in both experiments conducted with and without h2o2 the persistence of toc in solution after removal of cbz has been widely reported as a lacuna for uv h2o2 process 29 however this present study indicates promise of complete mineralization of cbz using uvc h2o2 as significant improvement to toc removal is noted by increase of irradiation period under uvc irradiation of 3 4 kw m3 and with 100 mg l of h2o2 85 of toc was reduced within an irradiation period of 8 h first order rate constants obtained from uvc h2o2 batch experiments are plotted as a function of h2o2 concentration in fig 4 addition of h2o2 significantly improved the degradation rate of cbz for h2o2 doses between 10 to 50 mg l however increase of h2o2 dose from 50 mg l to 100 mg l 100 increase in h2o2 dose resulted in marginal improvement of 13 increase in degradation rate at high h2o2 doses recombination of oh radicals and scavenging of excessive oh radicals by h2o2 are interpreted to be the reason behind lower degradation rates 30 31 the following equations describe the reactions involved in this phenomenon 1 2 o h h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 o h h 2 o h o 2 3 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o h h 2 o o 2 4 h o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 the effect of uvc intensity on kinetics of degradation of cbz was evaluated to establish the relationship between these parameters fig 5 shows the rate of degradation of cbz spiked with 50 mg l of h2o2 irradiated with uvc intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kw m3 as can be expected increase in light intensity resulted in a faster rate of degradation of cbz first order kinetic rate coefficients for varying light intensities of 0 6 2 2 and 3 4 kj m3were estimated as 0 51 1 43 and 2 1 min 1 for degradation of cbz in pure water the kinetic rate constants and the intensity of uvc irradiation followed a linear relationship with an r2 of 0 99 as observed in pure photolysis experiments degradation of cbz by uv h2o2 was also limited by incident number of photons time dependent kinetic rate coefficients estimated for various uv intensities increased proportionally with highly linearity r2 of 0 99 however kinetic rate constant based on fluence did not vary with respect to intensity of incident irradiation table 3 as energy estimated for achieving degradation of one order of magnitude was equal to 198 15 kj in all the cases 3 3 uvc tio2 photocatalytic process using uvc tio2 presents the advantage of utilizing multiple highly reactive species other than oh radicals as compared to uv h2o2 32 under irradiation of photons with energy equal to or more than its band gap of 3 2 ev electron donating and electron accepting sites are formed which induces oxidation reduction reactions the strong oxidative potential of the positive holes directly oxidizes organic contaminants or forms oh radicals by oxidation of water which initiates the attack also surface trapped electrons react with dissolved oxygen to form superoxide ions o2 which is a powerful oxidant the collective attack by variety of radical species formed from tio2 photocatalysis is expected to achieve faster degradation and greater degree of mineralisation fig 6 shows the degradation of cbz under various tio2 doses of 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 g l irradiated with uvc of intensity 3 4 kw m3 adsorption of cbz on tio2 in the dark was not significant as control experiments conducted in the dark showed only less than 4 decrease in cbz concentration effective degradation of cbz was noticed in the presence of 0 5 g l of tio2 with more than 95 of degradation occurring within 10 min of irradiation increase in tio2 loading above 0 5 g l resulted in slower kinetics table 3 studies with other pharmaceuticals such as amoxicillin and paracetamol have also been reported to degrade efficiently in tio2 doses ranging between 0 2 and 0 8 g l 33 at higher tio2 doses light scattering by surplus tio2 results in inefficient light absorption leading to reduced rate of photodegradation 34 this present study shows that uvc h2o2 process is more efficient for degradation of cbz compared to uvc tio2 fluence based kinetic rates estimated for uvc h2o2 process was 7 times higher that uvc tio2 for a constant uv intensity of 3 4 kw m3 table 3 as performance of uvc tio2 process was lower compared to uvc h2o2 further bench scale investigations using uvc tio2 process were not pursued 3 4 bench scale continuous flow through reactor studies bench scale reactor studies on direct uvc photolysis of cbz were performed in flow through mode with a flow rate of flowrate of 1 l min using ferrioxalate actinometry the uv intensity applied for direct photolysis experiment was determined as 5 93 kw m3 fraction of cbz observed in outlet with respect to the applied volumetric fluence is shown in fig 7 concentration of cbz measured just after breakthrough at 15 min showed degradation less than 6 corresponding to a fluence of 5000 kj m3 the efficiency of degradation further increased by a 5 over 30 min of irradiation with time mainly due to efficiency of the lamps reaching their maximum capacity after startup hence concentration of cbz observed at 45 min was used to estimate the rate of degradation kinetics and profile of cbz before breakthrough was used to analyse the order of kinetics the cbz concentration profile observed for direct uvc photolysis in continuous reactor studies also correlated well with zero order reaction kinetics with an estimated coefficient of 0 026 min 1 the kinetic rate coefficients for continuous flow experiments were estimated by using a plug flow reactor model fig 8 shows the correlation between kinetic coefficients and uv doses estimated in batch and continuous reactors rate coefficient estimated for continuous reactor experiments fitted with expression developed based on the batch experiments with a deviation of only 11 fluence based rate kinetics for bench scale experiments was estimated as 7 5 10 5 mg j which only deviated by 7 as compared to direct photolysis experiments conducted in batch mode table 1 fig 9 shows the fraction of cbz measured in the effluent for continuous bench scale reactor experiments conducted with h2o2 dose of 50 mg l higher flow rate of 5 2 l min allowing a retention time of 2 3 min was employed in this case volumetric uv intensity applied for uvc h2o2 in this experiment was estimated as 3 16 kw m3 concentration of the cbz measured in the outlet of the reactor quickly reached an equilibrium with more than 99 degraded for a residence time of 2 min the order and degradation rate kinetics was estimated by regression analysis of the cbz degradation profile kinetics of cbz degradation in continuous flow through experiments also followed first order the rate coefficient was estimated as 1 98 min 1 fig 10 shows the relationship between uv intensity and kinetics developed from observations from batch experiments and its correlation with kinetics estimated in continuous flow through experiment the deviation of kinetic rate coefficient estimated for continuous reactor experiment was less than 1 indicating strong correlation between batch and bench scale experiments this study finds volumetric fluence j m3 as a better way to represent uv dose as compared to area based fluence j m2 these findings well corroborate with previous studies that employed volumetric fluence
