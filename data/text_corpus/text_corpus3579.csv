17895,membrane fouling is posing a critical obstacle limiting the widespread application of ultrafiltration uf among the numerous membrane foulants natural organic matter nom is one of the most problematic since it exists ubiquitously in natural waters and can cause severe membrane fouling this study investigated the removal of nom in surface water and the mitigation of membrane fouling using heat activated peroxydisulfate pds as a pretreatment for uf process the results demonstrated that the nom was efficiently removed with ultraviolet absorbance uv254 and dissolved organic carbon doc decreasing by approximately 71 and 52 respectively at a pds dose of 0 8 mm within 60 min 80 c the chromatograms of high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec indicated that some high molecular weight humic substances with a peak at approximately 10 kda were oxidized to low molecular weight organic matters distributed in the range of 100 da during the pretreatment process moreover three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis parafac indicated that humic like substances were much more easily degraded by heat activated pds pretreatment than protein like substances these results indicated that some unsaturated nom fractions were first degraded and then mineralized to carbon dioxide during pretreatment meanwhile the destroyed structure of humic substances might hinder its binding with high valence cations to reduce the possibility of high valence cations deposited on the membrane surface thereby reducing membrane fouling therefore membrane fouling could be significantly mitigated due to the shifts of nom concentration and structure by heat activated pds pretreatment in the surface water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords heat activated peroxydisulfate pds ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling mitigation natural organic matter nom surface water treatment 1 introduction in recent years the application of ultrafiltration uf membrane in the field of water purification has been developing rapidly and it has already been used in many real drinking water plants guo et al 2018 pressdee et al 2005 however membrane fouling would increase the cost of water purification and remain a major problem to hinder the widespread application of membrane technology jia et al 2019 the factors regarding to membrane fouling were complex and were generally thought to be resulted from organic matters jermann et al 2008 zularisam et al 2011 inorganic substances hao et al 2011 tian et al 2013a and microorganisms shao et al 2018 pretreatment prior to uf has been widely used as one of the effective methods to alleviate membrane fouling typically including pre coagulation tian et al 2010 2013c pre filtration zheng et al 2009 and pre oxidation saquib et al 2010 van geluwe et al 2011 the advanced oxidation process employing activated peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms as oxidant prior to uf has attracted much attention recently tian et al 2018 the pre oxidation using persulfate has its unique advantages over other pretreatment technologies prior to uf especially in terms of removing micro pollutants and controlling membrane fouling it is well documented that the pretreatment with fe ii pms combined with uf showed a more excellent removal performance for atrazine p chloronitrobenzene and sulfamethazine than single uf and the hybrid system of coagulation and uf cheng et al 2017a meanwhile the fe ii pms pretreatment displayed the best performance in reducing both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling in comparison with ozonation and coagulation processes the combined process of pms oxidation and uf reduced both reversible and irreversible fouling caused by different nom fractions more efficiently than the coupling process with powdered activated carbon and uf cheng et al 2019 wan et al 2019 found that the ultraviolet persulfate pretreatment could simultaneously decrease the doc fluorescent components and hydrophobic fractions in feed water due to the oxidation of algal cells and algae derived organic matters thus exhibiting the best performance on uf membrane fouling control among the three pretreatments ultraviolet persulfate ultraviolet chlorine and ultraviolet h2o2 respectively for treating algae laden water multiple ways such as ultraviolet tian et al 2018 ferrous iron cheng et al 2017b powdered activated carbon cheng et al 2019 and heating ike et al 2018 have been applied to activate persulfate for degrading pollutants in contaminated water and mitigating membrane fouling among various activation methods heating activation has its unique advantages for example increasing the activation temperature can locally raise the reaction temperature when heating activation was combined with in situ thermal remediation thereby increasing the reaction rate to shorten the remediation time tsitonaki et al 2010 sustainable advanced oxidation processes may be developed for the production of drinking water by utilizing the large amount of waste heat generated in many industrial processes with the common waste heat discharge temperature between 60 and 120 c garimella 2012 little and garimella 2011 in recent years using waste heat generated in industrial processes to activate persulfate and degrade pollutants in water has attracted researchers attention ike et al 2018 furthermore heat activated persulfate was generally used to investigate the reaction mechanism between pollutants and sulfate radical so 4 due to no requirement of additional chemicals and the simplicity of the system antoniou et al 2010 in this study a pretreatment of songhua river water with heat activated pds prior to uf was employed to alleviate membrane fouling and simultaneously remove the organic contaminants the effects of temperature and dosages of oxidant on the removals of organic pollutants as well as on the membrane fouling behavior were investigated to better understand the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation the purpose of this study is to explore a feasible method to destroy or eliminate contaminants in real surface water and simultaneously alleviate membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the raw water was taken from songhua river in harbin heilongjiang province china prior to experiments the collected water samples were pre filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane shanghai xin ya purification equipment co ltd china to remove particulate matters and then stored under 4 c the ranges of feed water quality during the experiments were listed as follows turbidity 1 17 2 68 ntu concentration of doc 5 74 6 40 mg l ultraviolet absorbance uv254 0 130 0 165 cm 1 and ph 7 3 8 1 2 2 materials and reagents sodium peroxydisulfate na2s2o8 was purchased from aladdin chemicals shanghai china the stock solution of pds was freshly prepared in each experiment due to its slow decomposition commercially available flat sheet polyethersulfone pes membranes microdyn nadir germany with a molecular weight cutoff mwco of 150 kda were employed in the filtration experiments 2 3 experimental setup a generalized schematic diagram

to quench the residual oxidants a stoichiometric amount of na2s2o3 was added to the water samples immediately after sampling the dosage of terminator was equivalent to the concentration of pds added according to the stoichiometric criteria the dead end uf system shown in fig 1 b mainly included a high pressure nitrogen gas bottle two parallel filtration cells amicon 8400 millipore usa and a data

backwash and filtration of 100 ml pure water in addition the water samples were cooled to room temperature after oxidation to ensure that the temperature of the feed water prior to uf was the same when performing uf experiments 2 4 analytical methods the uv254 was determined by an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer t6 puxi china at the wavelength of 254 nm the doc was analyzed by a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany after filtering water samples by a 0 45 μm membrane the fluorescence characteristics of water samples were analyzed with a fluorescence spectrophotometer f7000 hitachi japan in a 1 cm quartz cuvette to identify the fluorescent components in water samples guo et al 2018 the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were generated

matlab r2014a the mathworks inc america to run the given program and samples were treated with split half analysis and random assignment initial value test both of which passed to prove that the model was correct an on line high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec with uv detectors was adopted to examine the distribution of molecular weight of nom in surface water the mobile phase for hpsec was phosphate buffer solution iv et al 2003 0 1 mol l nacl 0 002 mol l k2hpo4 and 0 002 mol l kh2po4 ph 6 85 and the flow rate was controlled at 0 4 ml min moreover the main functional groups of pollutants on the surface of membranes were measured by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy spectrum one perkinelmer usa for each membrane sample 16 scans were performed between 4000 and 600 cm 1 scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectroscope sem edx quanta 650 fei and atomic force microscopy afm dimension fastscan

an area of 5 μm 5 μm the contact angle of the membrane surfaces was measured by a contact angle measurement system jysp 360 beijing united test co ltd china 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of heat activated pds pretreatment on organics removals 3 1 1 removals of doc and uv254 the constant temperature control device was used to control the reaction temperature at 80 c which was below the maximum tolerated temperature 95 c of the uf membrane and fell within the common waste heat discharge temperature range of 120 c garimella 2012 little and garimella 2011 the initial concentrations of doc and uv254 in raw water were 5 76 0 03 mg l and 0 135 0 002 cm 1 respectively the removals of doc and uv254 representing typical indexes of nom in songhua river water were monitored to investigate the performance of heat activated pds pretreatment in removing nom during surface water treatment and the results are displayed in fig 2 the doc and uv254 in the raw water were hardly degraded over the entire experimental duration without pds which implied that heating alone when the temperature was less than 80 c failed to remarkably reduce the amount of nom in the surface water after a 60 min reaction time for heat activated pds pretreatment the removal rates of uv254 and doc were much pronounced and increased with the increase of pds doses for instance final removal rates for uv254 were 41 58 60 and 71 at pds doses of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mm respectively the removal of doc at 60 min increased from 10 to 52 as the pds dose increased from 0 2 mm to 0 8 mm these results were in accordance with the research of tian et al 2018 which indicated that the mechanism for degrading nom in natural surface water by using a method of activating persulfate without additional chemicals might be similar in addition the removal efficiency of uv254 was generally higher than that of doc which indicated that the structure of nom was first destroyed and it was then mineralized to carbon dioxide in the process of heat activated pds pretreatment thus resulting in a faster reduction of uv254 followed by the decrease of doc generally the structural damage of nom was more likely to occur than mineralization due to the more energy required for the latter cheng et al 2017a tian et al 2018 which resulted in a decrease of uv254 that was generally higher than that of doc in fig 2 a the removal of uv254 also increased remarkably with the increase of pds dosage when the dosage was 0 4 mm the uv254 and doc removal could reach 58 0 and 32 0 respectively after a contact time of 60 min however with the dosage of pds increasing from 0 4 to 0 6 mm little improvements of uv254 removal were observed similarly the removal of doc also followed the same pattern in fig 2 b therefore 0 4 mm was the optimized pds dosage and was adopted in the following experiments as can be observed more intuitively from fig 2 c the removals of doc and uv254 elevated simultaneously with the increase of dosage which exhibited a significant positive correlation the slope of the fitted line of uv254 was steeper than that of doc which also suggested that pds pre oxidation conferred higher capacities in reducing uv254 than doc under the same conditions fig 3 illustrates the effects of temperature on uv254 and doc removal when the temperature was 50 c the doc and uv254 in raw water were almost not degraded however the removal rates of doc and uv254 increased slightly at 30 min when the temperature reached 60 c and then increased markedly with the increasing temperature the results revealed that the lowest temperature for removing nom in songhua river by heat activated pds pretreatment was 60 c the higher the temperature was the more thorough the degradation of nom would be similar to fig 2 the removal efficiency of doc was generally lower than that of uv254 which further proved that nom in raw water was oxidized to carbon dioxide in the process of pre oxidation to cause the decrease of doc in fig 3 a the removal of uv254 increased markedly with the increase of both temperature and reaction time and similar variation can also be observed in fig 3 b interestingly the temperature ranging from 60 to 80 c was little effect on the removal of doc at the contact time of 10 min but the removal of uv254 increased with the increasing temperature under the same condition this implied that the heat activated pds pretreatment at a temperature of 60 80 c within 10 min could only destroy the structure of nom and would not mineralize it similar to figs 2 c fig 3 c illustrates that temperature had also a strong positive correlation with both uv254 and doc removal rates 3 1 2 fluorescent organic matter the three dimensional fluorescence spectrums of the samples were analyzed by parafac analysis and three fluorescent organic components were extracted to investigate the removal of fluorescent organic matters by the heated activated pds pre oxidation the parafac analysis was applied to quantitatively interpret the spectrum and the three component model was determined to be the most suitable model fig 4 displays the three fluorescent components obtained by parafac analysis all three components clearly exhibited a bimodal structure including a main peak and a secondary peak component 1 c1 had two maximum excitations at 240 and 310 nm and a wide emission band in the range of 400 and 450 nm which might represent the microbial or marine humic like substances shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 component 2 c2 had a primary and a secondary excitation peak occurring around 270 nm and 360 nm respectively and a single emission peak near 500 nm which represented terrestrially derived humic like matter shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 similar to c1 and c2 component 3 c3 also had double excitation maxima at 225 and 280 nm and a single emission peak at 310 nm which might belong to protein like substances derived from biological production in surface water shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 in previous studies it was found that c1 and c2 may be a class of negatively charged humus ishii and boyer 2012 c3 may be a hydrophobic protein composed of macromolecules shao et al 2014 wu et al 2003 fig 5 illustrates variations in removal rates for fluorescent components by the heated activated pds pretreatment with the increasing temperature interestingly there was almost no degradation of c1 when the temperature was at 50 or 60 c and it was readily degraded when the temperature was above 70 c c2 also exhibited a similar removal performance the trend for the removal curves of c1 and c2 was substantially similar to the results of uv254 and doc removal efficiency in fig 3 however c3 was more sensitive to temperature and its removal reached about 20 even at 50 c the result demonstrated that c1 and c2 may be the same class of substances which were different from c3 combined with the above analysis results it can be further speculated that c1 and c2 both belonged to humic like substances which were more susceptible to degradation by destroying unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures tian et al 2018 and were the main components of nom in songhua river water however c3 may be a class of protein like substances which was vulnerable to temperature changes and occupied a small proportion in surface water as can be seen in fig 5 c c3 removal increased rapidly within the first 10 min at temperatures ranging from 50 to 90 c subsequently the removal of c3 was not apparently enhanced over time it was reported that c3 might belong to protein like substances guo et al 2018 tian et al 2018 and temperature variation easily caused apparent denaturation of protein like substances resulting in the destruction of their internal structure it can be inferred from the results of section 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 that the pre oxidation by heat activated pds destroyed the structures of both humic like and protein like substances resulting in a decrease in uv254 subsequently parts of them were mineralized leading to a decrease in doc 3 2 effects of heat activated pds pretreatment on membrane fouling fig 6 presents flux decline of uf membranes during filtration of the raw and pretreated water by heat activated pds at different temperatures and different pds doses as seen in fig 6 a the specific fluxes of uf membranes were improved significantly by pretreatment and a higher temperature led to a larger specific flux the flux decline caused by raw water was relatively severe with a reduction of approximately 0 31 and 0 25 of the initial flux at the end of the first and second filtration cycle respectively the final specific flux of uf increased from 0 26 to 0 90 with the temperature rose from 50 to 90 c it could be concluded that the heat activated pds pretreatment had a significant effect on mitigating the membrane fouling the flux increased by 4 40 92 152 and 260 respectively compared to the raw water at the temperature of 50 60 70 80 and 90 c respectively fig 6 b displays the effect of pds doses on the specific flux of uf membranes when the temperature was 80 c the specific fluxes with different pds doses declined slowly in the initial filtration stage and then the flux curves became smoothly compared to the control system thus it can be observed that the specific fluxes of membranes were improved apparently with the increase of pds doses the flux curves were nearly overlapped when the pds doses were 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mm respectively however the flux curve with the pds addition of 0 2 mm was apparently lower than the former three curves indicating that the optimum dosage of pds at 80 c for the songhua river water was 0 4 mm consequently it can be inferred that the pre oxidation exerted less influence on improving the permeate flux when the dose of pds exceeded 0 4 mm the specific flux of the membrane was raised by 116 at the end of filtration compared with the control group when the dosage was merely 0 2 mm generally the higher the amount of pds used was the more pronounced improvements the membrane fluxes would gain however the decline rates of membrane fluxes were gentle when the dosage was more than 0 4 mm as shown in fig 2 a the removal of uv254 in raw water was no obvious difference in 30 min when the addition of pds was 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mm respectively this implied that most of the organic substances in raw water had been degraded with the addition of 0 4 mm pds the addition of 0 4 mm pds was the optimum dosage for songhua river water from the point of view of alleviating membrane fouling and removing contaminants 3 3 effects of heat activated pds pretreatment on nom characteristics in order to examine the effect of heat activated pds oxidation on songhua river water hpsec chromatograms of nom in the feed and permeate were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography with the uv absorbance at 254 nm shown in fig 7 the hpsec chromatograms revealed that all samples contained three significant peaks peak a distributed in the range of 1 1 11 kda with a peak at approximately 10 kda peak b distributed in the range of 300 1000 da with a peak at approximately 700 da and peak c distributed in the range of 100 da respectively based on the previous study huber et al 2011 peak a represented humic substances 1 20 kda peak b represented building blocks 300 500 da and peak c represented low molecular weight substances 350 da the intensities of peak a and peak c were slightly reduced by uf alone compared with raw water which was related to the fact that the size of pollutants was smaller than that of membrane pores 150 kda resulting in limited interception of contaminants this was consistent with the limited removals of dissolved organic matter by single uf reported in previous studies cheng et al 2017a shao et al 2017 tang et al 2018 wu et al 2016 the intensity of peak a with the molecular weight in the range of 1 1 11 kda was significantly reduced by pre oxidation and pre oxidation uf compared with raw water in contrast the intensity of peak c with the molecular weight of less than 100 da was markedly increased by pre oxidation and pre oxidation uf the reason for this phenomenon was that heat activated pds oxidation degraded humic substances with large molecular weights into small ones cheng et al 2018 there was little difference for the intensity of peak a compared with pre oxidation and pre oxidation uf while the intensity of the absorption peak c the size was much smaller than membrane pores was obviously decreased by pre oxidation uf treatment the possible reason for this phenomenon was that pre oxidation destroyed the chain structure of humic acid resulting in a decrease of humic substances represented by peak a and an increase of low mw substances represented by peak c however higher or lower concentration could further lead to higher or lower probability of being intercepted through the membrane pores this further implied that even substances with smaller size than the membrane pores could be intercepted by uf due to deposition on the membrane surface or in the membrane pores by adsorption zhang et al 2009 3 4 characterization of fouled uf membranes ftir analysis was performed to examine the functional groups on the surface of the virgin and contaminated uf membranes and the spectra are illustrated in fig 8 the strong absorption peaks at 1080 cm 1 and 1108 cm 1 which can be attributed to the presence of aromatic ring vibrations in the pes membrane wang et al 2015 meanwhile the 1320 1298 cm 1 doublet resulted from antisymmetric oso group and the band at 1151 cm 1 was due to the symmetric oso stretching of sulfone group chang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 both fouled membranes were observed strong absorbance peaks at around 3284 2930 1031 and 915 cm 1 the broad band near 3284 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of hydrogen bonds o h and the weak signal at 2930 cm 1was due to c h stretching vibrations namguk et al 2008 tian et al 2018 the strong absorbance peaks at around 1031 and 915 cm 1 corresponded to the c o c o c or si o bands gamage and shankararaman 2014 the peak at 1031 and 915 cm 1 were likely to be a precipitate of silicon due to the large number of si ions in the songhua river water guo et al 2018 the characteristic peaks for the membrane fouled by raw water and pre oxidation water were observed at the same wavenumber but the peak intensities decreased to some degree with the pretreatment to further investigate the fouling control performance by heat activated pds pre oxidation the surface morphologies of virgin and fouled membranes with and without heat activated pds pretreatment were directly observed using sem and afm shown in fig 9 it was clearly observed that the membrane pores were evenly distributed on the surface of the original membrane in fig 9 a however after filtration of solutions treated with heat activated pds oxidation most of the membrane pores had been blocked the pores of the membrane which was fouled with raw water were almost completely blocked the surfaces of fouled membranes exhibited different fouling characteristics suggesting gentler membrane fouling by pretreated water than raw water the membrane fouled with and without pretreated water both exhibited dense cake layers adhered on the surface of membranes and the size of pollutants on the surface of membranes filtrated with pretreated water was obviously smaller than that of raw water three dimensional afm images were used to determine the surface roughness and topography of virgin and fouled membranes the enormous fluctuations could be found for both control and fouled membranes as visually seen in fig 9 d f bright and dark areas on membrane surface represented peaks and valleys respectively the peaks and valleys on the virgin membrane surface were relatively uniform distribution shown in fig 9 d by contrast the peaks and valleys distribution of contaminated membranes were obviously uneven in fig 9 e and fig 9 f indicating that the surface of contaminated membranes had been covered by pollutants the size of bright and dark areas on the membrane surface was obviously different the size of bright and dark areas on the membrane fouled with pretreated water was smaller than that of raw water which was consistent with the particle size of the pollutants observed in the sem due to the severe agglomeration of the pollutant particles the membrane fouled with raw water displayed a rough and heterogeneous surface with a higher surface roughness ra 25 9 nm than that of membrane fouled with pretreated water ra 20 2 nm and the virgin membrane ra 16 5 nm the sem and afm images indicated that heat activated pds oxidation significantly affected the surface morphologies and topographies of fouled membranes which might further affect membrane fouling various elements including c o s p n si fe al cl na ca and mg had been detected on the fouled membrane after filtration of raw water by edx analysis from table 1 c o and s were identified as major elements on all membranes since the virgin pes membrane does only contain c o and s the presence of nitrogen suggested that organic fouling had occurred on the membrane during filtration of raw water it was notable that fe al ca and mg were not present on the membrane fouled by pretreated water compared to the raw water contaminated membrane indicating the heated activated pds pretreatment could reduce inorganic precipitation on membrane surface which might make a significant contribution to the membrane fouling studies have shown that tian et al 2013b high valence cations such as ca2 could link the humic acid molecules together to form larger molecules that deposited on the membrane surface to exacerbate membrane fouling to our knowledge most of nom in songhua river water was humic substances guo et al 2018 the heated activated pds pre oxidation could destroy the structure of humic substances to inhibit the binding of high valence cations to humic substances thus reducing the possibility of high valence cations deposited on the membrane surface and alleviating membrane fouling in order to further explore effects of heat activated pds oxidation pretreatment on membrane surface fouling contact angles of the virgin and contaminated membranes are listed in table 2 it has been well documented that the water contact angle of the membrane closely related with its surface features including functional groups zeta potential and surface roughness gilron et al 2001 humplik et al 2011 kochkodan and hilal 2015 contaminated membranes were more hydrophilic than the virgin membrane contact angles of wetting were 38 325 4 709 membrane fouled by raw water 54 732 6 784 membrane fouled by pretreated water and 61 679 2 857 virgin membrane respectively these data indicated that contaminants on the membranes surface made the membranes more hydrophilic meanwhile the contact angle of the membrane fouled by raw water was smaller than that of membrane fouled by pretreated water possibly due to pds oxidation pretreatment reduced the amount of contaminants in the water and partly changed the nature of pollutants making them less susceptible to adhere to the membrane on the other hand higher roughness surfaces see section 3 4 of membranes were also favorable for the decrease of their contact angles mary laura et al 2015 4 conclusions in this work heat activated pds pre oxidation was performed prior to uf membranes to investigate its effect on the membrane fouling and nom removal in treating the real surface water the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 heat activated pds pretreatment exhibited excellent removal of nom with uv254 and doc decreasing by 71 and 52 respectively at a pds dose of 0 8 mm within 60 min 80 c the minimum temperature for degradation of nom was 60 c the addition of 0 4 mm pds was the optimum dosage for songhua river water from the points of alleviating membrane fouling and removing contaminants 2 three fluorescent organic components were obtained from parafac analysis for songhua river water the heat activated pds pretreatment showed a similar effect on the removal of humic like substances when the temperature was above 70 c due to the denaturation of protein like substances c3 removal increased rapidly within the first 10 min at temperatures ranging from 50 to 90 c and then was not apparently enhanced over time 3 heat activated pds pre oxidation could affect the surface morphology and hydrophilicity of fouled membrane a less rough and heterogeneous membrane surface after filtration of pretreated water was observed compared to the raw water because of smaller size of pollutants by pre oxidation contaminated membranes became more hydrophilic than the virgin membrane 4 heat activated pds pretreatment could alleviate membrane fouling effectively and the flux increased 4 260 proportionally with the increase of temperature 50 90 c heat activated pds pretreatment could reduce nom concentration and degrade high molecular weight compounds representing humic substances into low molecular weight substances the destroyed structure of humic substances might hinder its binding with high valence cations thereby reducing the possibility of high valence cations deposited on the membrane surface and alleviating membrane fouling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17895,membrane fouling is posing a critical obstacle limiting the widespread application of ultrafiltration uf among the numerous membrane foulants natural organic matter nom is one of the most problematic since it exists ubiquitously in natural waters and can cause severe membrane fouling this study investigated the removal of nom in surface water and the mitigation of membrane fouling using heat activated peroxydisulfate pds as a pretreatment for uf process the results demonstrated that the nom was efficiently removed with ultraviolet absorbance uv254 and dissolved organic carbon doc decreasing by approximately 71 and 52 respectively at a pds dose of 0 8 mm within 60 min 80 c the chromatograms of high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec indicated that some high molecular weight humic substances with a peak at approximately 10 kda were oxidized to low molecular weight organic matters distributed in the range of 100 da during the pretreatment process moreover three dimensional fluorescence parallel factor analysis parafac indicated that humic like substances were much more easily degraded by heat activated pds pretreatment than protein like substances these results indicated that some unsaturated nom fractions were first degraded and then mineralized to carbon dioxide during pretreatment meanwhile the destroyed structure of humic substances might hinder its binding with high valence cations to reduce the possibility of high valence cations deposited on the membrane surface thereby reducing membrane fouling therefore membrane fouling could be significantly mitigated due to the shifts of nom concentration and structure by heat activated pds pretreatment in the surface water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords heat activated peroxydisulfate pds ultrafiltration uf membrane fouling mitigation natural organic matter nom surface water treatment 1 introduction in recent years the application of ultrafiltration uf membrane in the field of water purification has been developing rapidly and it has already been used in many real drinking water plants guo et al 2018 pressdee et al 2005 however membrane fouling would increase the cost of water purification and remain a major problem to hinder the widespread application of membrane technology jia et al 2019 the factors regarding to membrane fouling were complex and were generally thought to be resulted from organic matters jermann et al 2008 zularisam et al 2011 inorganic substances hao et al 2011 tian et al 2013a and microorganisms shao et al 2018 pretreatment prior to uf has been widely used as one of the effective methods to alleviate membrane fouling typically including pre coagulation tian et al 2010 2013c pre filtration zheng et al 2009 and pre oxidation saquib et al 2010 van geluwe et al 2011 the advanced oxidation process employing activated peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms as oxidant prior to uf has attracted much attention recently tian et al 2018 the pre oxidation using persulfate has its unique advantages over other pretreatment technologies prior to uf especially in terms of removing micro pollutants and controlling membrane fouling it is well documented that the pretreatment with fe ii pms combined with uf showed a more excellent removal performance for atrazine p chloronitrobenzene and sulfamethazine than single uf and the hybrid system of coagulation and uf cheng et al 2017a meanwhile the fe ii pms pretreatment displayed the best performance in reducing both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling in comparison with ozonation and coagulation processes the combined process of pms oxidation and uf reduced both reversible and irreversible fouling caused by different nom fractions more efficiently than the coupling process with powdered activated carbon and uf cheng et al 2019 wan et al 2019 found that the ultraviolet persulfate pretreatment could simultaneously decrease the doc fluorescent components and hydrophobic fractions in feed water due to the oxidation of algal cells and algae derived organic matters thus exhibiting the best performance on uf membrane fouling control among the three pretreatments ultraviolet persulfate ultraviolet chlorine and ultraviolet h2o2 respectively for treating algae laden water multiple ways such as ultraviolet tian et al 2018 ferrous iron cheng et al 2017b powdered activated carbon cheng et al 2019 and heating ike et al 2018 have been applied to activate persulfate for degrading pollutants in contaminated water and mitigating membrane fouling among various activation methods heating activation has its unique advantages for example increasing the activation temperature can locally raise the reaction temperature when heating activation was combined with in situ thermal remediation thereby increasing the reaction rate to shorten the remediation time tsitonaki et al 2010 sustainable advanced oxidation processes may be developed for the production of drinking water by utilizing the large amount of waste heat generated in many industrial processes with the common waste heat discharge temperature between 60 and 120 c garimella 2012 little and garimella 2011 in recent years using waste heat generated in industrial processes to activate persulfate and degrade pollutants in water has attracted researchers attention ike et al 2018 furthermore heat activated persulfate was generally used to investigate the reaction mechanism between pollutants and sulfate radical so 4 due to no requirement of additional chemicals and the simplicity of the system antoniou et al 2010 in this study a pretreatment of songhua river water with heat activated pds prior to uf was employed to alleviate membrane fouling and simultaneously remove the organic contaminants the effects of temperature and dosages of oxidant on the removals of organic pollutants as well as on the membrane fouling behavior were investigated to better understand the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation the purpose of this study is to explore a feasible method to destroy or eliminate contaminants in real surface water and simultaneously alleviate membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw water the raw water was taken from songhua river in harbin heilongjiang province china prior to experiments the collected water samples were

heat activated pds pretreatment on organics removals 3 1 1 removals of doc and uv254 the constant temperature control device was used to control the reaction temperature at 80 c which was below the maximum tolerated temperature 95 c of the uf membrane and fell within the common waste heat discharge temperature range of 120 c garimella 2012 little and garimella 2011 the initial concentrations of doc and uv254 in raw water were 5 76 0 03 mg l and 0 135 0 002 cm 1 respectively the removals of doc and uv254 representing typical indexes of nom in songhua river water were monitored to investigate the performance of heat activated pds pretreatment in removing nom during surface water treatment and the results are displayed in fig 2 the doc and uv254 in the raw water were hardly degraded over the entire experimental duration without pds which implied that heating alone when the temperature was less than 80 c failed to remarkably reduce the amount of nom in the surface water after a 60 min reaction time for heat activated pds pretreatment the removal rates of uv254 and doc were much pronounced and increased with the increase of pds doses for instance final removal rates for uv254 were 41 58 60 and 71 at pds doses of 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mm respectively the removal of doc at 60 min increased from 10 to 52 as the pds dose increased from 0 2 mm to 0 8 mm these results were in accordance with the research of tian et al 2018 which indicated that the mechanism for degrading nom in natural surface water by using a method of activating persulfate without additional chemicals might be similar in addition the removal efficiency of uv254 was generally higher than that of doc which indicated that the structure of nom was first destroyed and it was then mineralized to carbon dioxide in the process of heat activated pds pretreatment thus resulting in a faster reduction of uv254 followed by the decrease of doc generally the structural damage of nom was more likely to occur than mineralization due to the more energy required for the latter cheng et al 2017a tian et al 2018 which resulted in a decrease of uv254 that was generally higher than that of doc in fig 2 a the removal of uv254 also increased remarkably with the increase of pds dosage when the dosage was 0 4 mm the uv254 and doc removal could reach 58 0 and 32 0 respectively after a contact time of 60 min however with the dosage of pds increasing from 0 4 to 0 6 mm little improvements of uv254 removal were observed similarly the removal of doc also followed the same pattern in fig 2 b therefore 0 4 mm was the optimized pds dosage and was adopted in the following experiments as can be observed more intuitively from fig 2 c the removals of doc and uv254 elevated simultaneously with the increase of dosage which exhibited a significant positive correlation the slope of the fitted line of uv254 was steeper than that of doc which also suggested that pds pre oxidation conferred higher capacities in reducing uv254 than doc under the same conditions fig 3 illustrates the effects of temperature on uv254 and doc removal when the temperature was 50 c the doc and uv254 in raw water were almost not degraded however the removal rates of doc and uv254 increased slightly at 30 min when the temperature reached 60 c and then increased markedly with the increasing temperature the results revealed that the lowest temperature for removing nom in songhua river by heat activated pds pretreatment was 60 c the higher the temperature was the more thorough the degradation of nom would be similar to fig 2 the removal efficiency of doc was generally lower than that of uv254 which further proved that nom in raw water was oxidized to carbon dioxide in the process of pre oxidation to cause the decrease of doc in fig 3 a the removal of uv254 increased markedly with the increase of both temperature and reaction time and similar variation can also be observed in fig 3 b interestingly the temperature ranging from 60 to 80 c was little effect on the removal of doc at the contact time of 10 min but the removal of uv254 increased with the increasing temperature under the same condition this implied that the heat activated pds pretreatment at a temperature of 60 80 c within 10 min could only destroy the structure of nom and would not mineralize it similar to figs 2 c fig 3 c illustrates that temperature had also a strong positive correlation with both uv254 and doc removal rates 3 1 2 fluorescent organic matter the three dimensional fluorescence spectrums of the samples were analyzed by parafac analysis and three fluorescent organic components were extracted to investigate the removal of fluorescent organic matters by the heated activated pds pre oxidation the parafac analysis was applied to quantitatively interpret the spectrum and the three component model was determined to be the most suitable model fig 4 displays the three fluorescent components obtained by parafac analysis all three components clearly exhibited a bimodal structure including a main peak and a secondary peak component 1 c1 had two maximum excitations at 240 and 310 nm and a wide emission band in the range of 400 and 450 nm which might represent the microbial or marine humic like substances shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 component 2 c2 had a primary and a secondary excitation peak occurring around 270 nm and 360 nm respectively and a single emission peak near 500 nm which represented terrestrially derived humic like matter shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 similar to c1 and c2 component 3 c3 also had double excitation maxima at 225 and 280 nm and a single emission peak at 310 nm which might belong to protein like substances derived from biological production in surface water shao et al 2014 tian et al 2015 in previous studies it was found that c1 and c2 may be a class of negatively charged humus ishii and boyer 2012 c3 may be a hydrophobic protein composed of macromolecules shao et al 2014 wu et al 2003 fig 5 illustrates variations in removal rates for fluorescent components by the heated activated pds pretreatment with the increasing temperature interestingly there was almost no degradation of c1 when the temperature was at 50 or 60 c and it was readily degraded when the temperature was above 70 c c2 also exhibited a similar removal performance the trend for the removal curves of c1 and c2 was substantially similar to the results of uv254 and doc removal efficiency in fig 3 however c3 was more sensitive to temperature and its removal reached about 20 even at 50 c the result demonstrated that c1 and c2 may be the same class of substances which were different from c3 combined with the above analysis results it can be further speculated that c1 and c2 both belonged to humic like substances which were more susceptible to degradation by destroying unsaturated bonds and aromatic structures tian et al 2018 and were the main components of nom in songhua river water however c3 may be a class of protein like substances which was vulnerable to temperature changes and occupied a small proportion in surface water as can be seen in fig 5 c c3 removal increased rapidly within the first 10 min at temperatures ranging from 50 to 90 c subsequently the removal of c3 was not apparently enhanced over time it was reported that c3 might belong to protein like substances guo et al 2018 tian et al 2018 and temperature variation easily caused apparent denaturation of protein like substances resulting in the destruction of their internal structure it can be inferred from the results of section 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 that the pre oxidation by heat activated pds destroyed the structures of both humic like and protein like substances resulting in a decrease in uv254 subsequently parts of them were mineralized leading to a decrease in doc 3 2 effects of heat activated pds pretreatment on membrane fouling fig 6 presents flux decline of uf membranes during filtration of the raw and pretreated water by heat activated pds at different temperatures and different pds doses as seen in fig 6 a the specific fluxes of uf membranes were improved significantly by pretreatment and a higher temperature led to a larger specific flux the flux decline caused by raw water was relatively severe with a reduction of approximately 0 31 and 0 25 of the initial flux at the end of the first and second filtration cycle respectively the final specific flux of uf increased from 0 26 to 0 90 with the temperature rose from 50 to 90 c it could be concluded that the heat activated pds pretreatment had a significant effect on mitigating the membrane fouling the flux increased by 4 40 92 152 and 260 respectively compared to the raw water at the temperature of 50 60 70 80 and 90 c respectively fig 6 b displays the effect of pds doses on the specific flux of uf membranes when the temperature was 80 c the specific fluxes with different pds doses declined slowly in the initial filtration stage and then the flux curves became smoothly compared to the control system thus it can be observed that the specific fluxes of membranes were improved apparently with the increase of pds doses the flux curves were nearly overlapped when the pds doses were 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mm respectively however the flux curve with the pds addition of 0 2 mm was apparently lower than the former three curves indicating that the optimum dosage of pds at 80 c for the songhua river water was 0 4 mm consequently it can be inferred that the pre oxidation exerted less influence on improving the permeate flux when the dose of pds exceeded 0 4 mm the specific flux of the membrane was raised by 116 at the end of filtration compared with the control group when the dosage was merely 0 2 mm generally the higher the amount of pds used was the more pronounced improvements the membrane fluxes would gain however the decline rates of membrane fluxes were gentle when the dosage was more than 0 4 mm as shown in fig 2 a the removal of uv254 in raw water was no obvious difference in 30 min when the addition of pds was 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mm respectively this implied that most of the organic substances in raw water had been degraded with the addition of 0 4 mm pds the addition of 0 4 mm pds was the optimum dosage for songhua river water from the point of view of alleviating membrane fouling and removing contaminants 3 3 effects of heat activated pds pretreatment on nom characteristics in order to examine the effect of heat activated pds oxidation on songhua river water hpsec chromatograms of nom in the feed and permeate were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography with the uv absorbance at 254 nm shown in fig 7 the hpsec chromatograms revealed that all samples contained three significant peaks peak a distributed in the range of 1 1 11 kda with a peak at approximately 10 kda peak b distributed in the range of 300 1000 da with a peak at approximately 700 da and peak c distributed in the range of 100 da respectively based on the previous study huber et al 2011 peak a represented humic substances 1 20 kda peak b represented building blocks 300 500 da and peak c represented low molecular weight substances 350 da the intensities of peak a and peak c were slightly reduced by uf alone compared with raw water which was related to the fact that the size of pollutants was smaller than that of membrane pores 150 kda resulting in limited interception of contaminants this was consistent with the limited removals of dissolved organic matter by single uf reported in previous studies cheng et al 2017a shao et al 2017 tang et al 2018 wu et al 2016 the intensity of peak a with the molecular weight in the range of 1 1 11 kda was significantly reduced by pre oxidation and pre oxidation uf compared with raw water in contrast the intensity of peak c with the molecular weight of less than 100 da was markedly increased by pre oxidation and pre oxidation uf the reason for this phenomenon was that heat activated pds oxidation degraded humic substances with large molecular weights into small ones cheng et al 2018 there was little difference for the intensity of peak a compared with pre oxidation and pre oxidation uf while the intensity of the absorption peak c the size was much smaller than membrane pores was obviously decreased by pre oxidation uf treatment the possible reason for this phenomenon was that pre oxidation destroyed the chain structure of humic acid resulting in a decrease of humic substances represented by peak a and an increase of low mw substances represented by peak c however higher or lower concentration could further lead to higher or lower probability of being intercepted through the membrane pores this further implied that even substances with smaller size than the membrane pores could be intercepted by uf due to deposition on the membrane surface or in the membrane pores by adsorption zhang et al 2009 3 4 characterization of fouled uf membranes ftir analysis was performed to examine the functional groups on the surface of the virgin and contaminated uf membranes and the spectra are illustrated in fig 8 the strong absorption peaks at 1080 cm 1 and 1108 cm 1 which can be attributed to the presence of aromatic ring vibrations in the pes membrane wang et al 2015 meanwhile the 1320 1298 cm 1 doublet resulted from antisymmetric oso group and the band at 1151 cm 1 was due to the symmetric oso stretching of sulfone group chang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 both fouled membranes were observed strong absorbance peaks at around 3284 2930 1031 and 915 cm 1 the broad band near 3284 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibration of hydrogen bonds o h and the weak signal at 2930 cm 1was due to c h stretching vibrations namguk et al 2008 tian et al 2018 the strong absorbance peaks at around 1031 and 915 cm 1 corresponded to the c o c o c or si o bands gamage and shankararaman 2014 the peak at 1031 and 915 cm 1 were likely to be a precipitate of silicon due to the large number of si ions in the songhua river water guo et al 2018 the characteristic peaks for the membrane fouled by raw water and pre oxidation water were observed at the same wavenumber but the peak intensities decreased to some degree with the pretreatment to further investigate the fouling control performance by heat activated pds pre oxidation the surface morphologies of virgin and fouled membranes with and without heat activated pds pretreatment were directly observed using sem and afm shown in fig 9 it was clearly observed that the membrane pores were evenly distributed on the surface of the original membrane in fig 9 a however after filtration of solutions treated with heat activated pds oxidation most of the membrane pores had been blocked the pores of the membrane which was fouled with raw water were almost completely blocked the surfaces of fouled membranes exhibited different fouling characteristics suggesting gentler membrane fouling by pretreated water than raw water the membrane fouled with and without pretreated water both exhibited dense cake layers adhered on the surface of membranes and the size of pollutants on the surface of membranes filtrated with pretreated water was obviously smaller than that of raw water three dimensional afm images were used to determine the surface roughness and topography of virgin and fouled membranes the enormous fluctuations could be found for both control and fouled membranes as visually seen in fig 9 d f bright and dark areas on membrane surface represented peaks and valleys respectively the peaks and valleys on the virgin membrane surface were relatively uniform distribution shown in fig 9 d by contrast the peaks and valleys distribution of contaminated membranes were obviously uneven in fig 9 e and fig 9 f indicating that the surface of contaminated membranes had been covered by pollutants the size of bright and dark areas on the membrane surface was obviously different the size of bright and dark areas on the membrane fouled with pretreated water was smaller than that of raw water which was consistent with the particle size of the pollutants observed in the sem due to the severe agglomeration of the pollutant particles the membrane fouled with raw water displayed a rough and heterogeneous surface with a higher surface roughness ra 25 9 nm than that of membrane fouled with pretreated water ra 20 2 nm and the virgin membrane ra 16 5 nm the sem and afm images indicated that heat activated pds oxidation significantly affected the surface morphologies and topographies of fouled membranes which might further affect membrane fouling various elements including c o s p n si fe al cl na ca and mg had been detected on the fouled membrane after filtration of raw water by edx analysis from table 1 c o and s were identified as major elements on all membranes since the virgin pes membrane does only contain c o and s the presence of nitrogen suggested that organic fouling had occurred on the membrane during filtration of raw water it was notable that fe al ca and mg were not present on the membrane fouled by pretreated water compared to the raw water contaminated membrane indicating the heated activated pds pretreatment could reduce inorganic precipitation on membrane surface which might make a significant contribution to the membrane fouling studies have shown that tian et al 2013b high valence cations such as ca2 could link the humic acid molecules together to form larger molecules that deposited on the membrane surface to exacerbate membrane fouling to our knowledge most of nom in songhua river water was humic substances guo et al 2018 the heated activated pds pre oxidation could destroy the structure of humic substances to inhibit the binding of high valence cations to humic substances thus reducing the possibility of high valence cations deposited on the membrane surface and alleviating membrane fouling in order to further explore effects of heat activated pds oxidation pretreatment on membrane surface fouling contact angles of the virgin and contaminated membranes are listed in table 2 it has been well documented that the water contact angle of the membrane closely related with its surface features including functional groups zeta potential and surface roughness gilron et al 2001 humplik et al 2011 kochkodan and hilal 2015 contaminated membranes were more hydrophilic than the virgin membrane contact angles of wetting were 38 325 4 709 membrane fouled by raw water 54 732 6 784 membrane fouled by pretreated water and 61 679 2 857 virgin membrane respectively these data indicated that contaminants on the membranes surface made the membranes more hydrophilic meanwhile the contact angle of the membrane fouled by raw water was smaller than that of membrane fouled by pretreated water possibly due to pds oxidation pretreatment reduced the amount of contaminants in the water and partly changed the nature of pollutants making them less susceptible to adhere to the membrane on the other hand higher roughness surfaces see section 3 4 of membranes were also favorable for the decrease of their contact angles mary laura et al 2015 4 conclusions in this work heat activated pds pre oxidation was performed prior to uf membranes to investigate its effect on the membrane fouling and nom removal in treating the real surface water the conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 heat activated pds pretreatment exhibited excellent removal of nom with uv254 and doc decreasing by 71 and 52 respectively at a pds dose of 0 8 mm within 60 min 80 c the minimum temperature for degradation of nom was 60 c the addition of 0 4 mm pds was the optimum dosage for songhua river water from the points of alleviating membrane fouling and removing contaminants 2 three fluorescent organic components were obtained from parafac analysis for songhua river water the heat activated pds pretreatment showed a similar effect on the removal of humic like substances when the temperature was above 70 c due to the denaturation of protein like substances c3 removal increased rapidly within the first 10 min at temperatures ranging from 50 to 90 c and then was not apparently enhanced over time 3 heat activated pds pre oxidation could affect the surface morphology and hydrophilicity of fouled membrane a less rough and heterogeneous membrane surface after filtration of pretreated water was observed compared to the raw water because of smaller size of pollutants by pre oxidation contaminated membranes became more hydrophilic than the virgin membrane 4 heat activated pds pretreatment could alleviate membrane fouling effectively and the flux increased 4 260 proportionally with the increase of temperature 50 90 c heat activated pds pretreatment could reduce nom concentration and degrade high molecular weight compounds representing humic substances into low molecular weight substances the destroyed structure of humic substances might hinder its binding with high valence cations thereby reducing the possibility of high valence cations deposited on the membrane surface and alleviating membrane fouling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17896,in the adsorption studies the accurate estimation of the model parameters contributes to getting insights into adsorption behaviors and optimizing adsorber design after reading the research work of pap et al 2020 carefully it was found that the fitting results were questionable thus this comment tried to address the following aspects i correction of the fitting results for the kinetic and isotherm models ii correct form of the bohart adams model iii usage of the clark model and iv effects of the partial or complete experimental data on the model parameters this work is expected to help readers better understand the adsorption models and estimate the model parameters graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption kinetics isotherm bohart adams model curve characteristics 1 introduction pap et al 2020 investigated the phosphate removal from aqueous solutions and wastewater effluents by the chitosan calcite adsorbent in the batch and fixed bed adsorption experiments the authors used kinetic pseudo first order and pseudo second order isotherm langmuir and freundlich and breakthrough models bohart adams thomas and clark to analyze the phosphate adsorption behaviors however there were some controversial problems to be addressed in this paper the detail analyses were as follows 2 correction of fitting results to correct the questionable fitting results the kinetic and equilibrium data are extracted by engauge digitizer 11 1 software and the model parameters are obtained by origin 9 software using the levenberg marquardt method as shown in fig 1 after the correction all of the model curves become smooth at different temperatures especially the langmuir and pseudo second order models the freundlich curves are not too steep the fitting quality of the pseudo first order model is improved significantly these results indicated that the research work of pap et al 2020 did not provide the correct fitting curves probably leading to the inaccurate estimation of the model parameters and error statistics the langmuir constant k l reflected the affinity of the adsorbent for the adsorbates after the correction the values of k l become larger table 1 which are consistent with high adsorption capacities at different temperatures 22 mg g the freundlich curve was divergent and it may provide a poor fit for the experimental data approaching or reaching the adsorption equilibrium i e at high concentration thus compared with the langmuir model it has small r 2 and large χ 2 rmse values the fitting curves provided by the pseudo first order model reached the adsorption equilibrium in the research work of pap et al 2020 but the adsorption capacities were very small 1 59 mg g at 22 c and 0 94 mg g at 42 c and much less than the experimental values 16 05 mg g at 22 c and 18 16 mg g at 42 c in fact the pseudo first order model approached a constant value q e with the increase in time t hu et al 2018 after the correction the predicted adsorption capacities are 15 65 mg g at 22 c and 17 92 mg g at 42 c respectively the significance of this work was to improve the fitting results including the fitting curves model parameters and error statistics 3 bohart adams model the correct form of the bohart adams model is expressed as bohart and adams 1920 1 c c 0 exp k ba c 0 t exp k ba n 0 z u exp k ba c 0 t 1 however pap et al 2020 used the oversimplified bohart adams model to correlate with the experimental data which is given as 2 c c 0 exp k ba c 0 t k ba n 0 z u it is worth noting that eq 1 and eq 2 represent the logistic and exponential functions in mathematical nature respectively this simplification is unreasonable because it actually changes the curve characteristics of the bohart adams model eq 2 may provide a very poor fit for a complete breakthrough curve consequently the model parameters k ba and n 0 obtained from eq 2 are insufficient to describe the dynamic adsorption behaviors of phosphate on the chitosan calcite adsorbent 4 usage of clark model the clark model is expressed as clark 1987 3 c c 0 1 1 a exp r t 1 n 1 it should be noted that a precondition to use the clark model is that an adsorption system must follow the freundlich model the adsorption of phosphate on the chitosan calcite adsorbent did not conform to the freundlich model but follow the langmuir model thus it was improper when pap et al 2020 directly used n to estimate a and r besides what happened if an adsorption system followed the freucdlich model the adsorption of cu ii on purolite c100 mb cation exchange resin followed the freundlich model n 1 281 hamdaoui 2009 which was used to validate the applicability of the clark model as depicted in fig 2 a the clark model provides a poor fit at different flow rates when the parameter n is directly used to estimate a and r in contrast an excellent fit occurs for the unfixed n values and high r 2 and low χ 2 rmse values are obtained see table 2 the intrinsic differences between fixed bed and batch adsorption systems such as mass transfer driving force and flow regime made the batch results difficult to apply to the corresponding fixed bed adsorption system worch 2012 consequently it is better to correlate with the experimental data by the clark model as a three parameter empirical model whether an adsorption system followed the freundlich model in this way the clark model provides better fitting curves than the bohart adams model because an extra adjustable parameter n makes the curve fitting more flexible fig 2b 5 partial and complete data in the research work of pap et al 2020 the bohart adams thomas and clark models were employed to correlate with the experimental data covering the partial breakthrough curve it is observed that the fitting curves agree well with the experimental data and that high r 2 and low χ 2 rmse values are obtained in all cases however the model parameters are questionable to account for this problem the clark model was fitted to the partial experimental data c c 0 0 8 and c c 0 0 4 obtained from cu ii adsorption on purolite c100 mb cation exchange resin as shown in fig 2 the partial experimental data can be well described by the clark model and the fitting results may be better due to the reduced number of the data points see table 2 but the distinct differences occur between the model parameters obtained from both partial and complete experimental data the partial experimental data were usually insufficient to describe the real dynamic adsorption behaviors in a fixed bed column because they did not identify the vital properties of the complete breakthrough curve such as the symmetry astringency and curvature the use of the complete experimental data was the best way to estimate the model parameters accurately 6 conclusions this work corrected the fitting results of the kinetic and isotherm models and gave the correct form of the bohart adams model the clark model was directly correlated with the experimental data to obtain a better fitting accuracy the complete experimental data were recommended to obtain the model parameters declaration of competing interest the authors

17896,in the adsorption studies the accurate estimation of the model parameters contributes to getting insights into adsorption behaviors and optimizing adsorber design after reading the research work of pap et al 2020 carefully it was found that the fitting results were questionable thus this comment tried to address the following aspects i correction of the fitting results for the kinetic and isotherm models ii correct form of the bohart adams model iii usage of the clark model and iv effects of the partial or complete experimental data on the model parameters this work is expected to help readers better understand the adsorption models and estimate the model parameters graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorption kinetics isotherm bohart adams model curve characteristics 1 introduction pap et al 2020 investigated the phosphate removal from aqueous solutions and wastewater effluents by the chitosan calcite adsorbent in the batch and fixed bed adsorption experiments the authors used kinetic pseudo first order and pseudo second order isotherm langmuir and freundlich and breakthrough models bohart adams thomas and clark to analyze the phosphate adsorption behaviors however there were some controversial problems to be addressed in this paper the detail analyses were as follows 2 correction of fitting results to correct the questionable fitting results the kinetic and equilibrium data are extracted by engauge digitizer 11 1 software and the model parameters are obtained by origin 9 software using the levenberg marquardt method as shown in fig 1 after the correction all of the model curves become smooth at different temperatures especially the langmuir and pseudo second order models the freundlich curves are not too steep the fitting quality of the pseudo first order model is improved significantly these results indicated that the research work of pap et al 2020 did not provide the correct fitting curves probably leading to the inaccurate estimation of the model parameters and error statistics the langmuir constant k l reflected the affinity of the adsorbent for the adsorbates after the correction the values of k l become larger table 1 which are consistent with high adsorption capacities at different temperatures 22 mg g the freundlich curve was divergent and it may provide a poor fit for the experimental data approaching or reaching the adsorption equilibrium i e at high concentration thus compared with the langmuir model it has small r 2 and large χ 2 rmse values the fitting curves provided by the pseudo first order model reached the adsorption equilibrium in the research work of pap et al 2020 but the adsorption capacities were very small 1 59 mg g at 22 c and 0 94 mg g at 42 c and much less than the experimental values 16 05 mg g at 22 c and 18 16 mg g at 42 c in fact the pseudo first order model approached a constant value q e with the increase in time t hu et al 2018 after the correction the predicted adsorption capacities are 15 65 mg g at 22 c and 17 92 mg g at 42 c respectively the significance of this work was to improve the fitting results including the fitting curves model parameters and error statistics 3 bohart adams model the correct form of the bohart adams model is expressed as bohart and adams 1920 1 c c 0 exp k ba c 0 t exp k ba n 0 z u exp k ba c 0 t 1 however pap et al 2020 used the oversimplified bohart adams model to correlate with the experimental data which is given as 2 c c 0 exp k ba c 0 t k ba n 0 z u it is worth noting that eq 1 and eq 2 represent the logistic and exponential functions in mathematical nature respectively this simplification is unreasonable because it actually changes the curve characteristics of the bohart adams model eq 2 may provide a very poor fit for a complete breakthrough curve consequently the model parameters k ba and n 0 obtained from eq 2 are insufficient to describe the dynamic adsorption behaviors of phosphate on the chitosan calcite adsorbent 4 usage of clark model the clark model is expressed as clark 1987 3 c c 0 1 1 a exp r t 1 n 1 it should be noted that a precondition to use the clark model is that an adsorption system must follow the freundlich model the adsorption of phosphate on the chitosan calcite adsorbent did not conform to the freundlich model but follow the langmuir model thus it was improper when pap et al 2020 directly used n to estimate a and r besides what happened if an adsorption system followed the freucdlich model the adsorption of cu ii on purolite c100 mb cation exchange resin followed the freundlich model n 1 281 hamdaoui 2009 which was used to validate the applicability of the clark model as depicted in fig 2 a the clark model provides a poor fit at different flow rates when the parameter n is directly used to estimate a and r in contrast an excellent fit occurs for the unfixed n values and high r 2 and low χ 2 rmse values are obtained see table 2 the intrinsic differences between fixed bed and batch adsorption systems such as mass transfer driving force and flow regime made the batch results difficult to apply to the corresponding fixed bed adsorption system worch 2012 consequently it is better to correlate with the experimental data by the clark model as a three parameter empirical model whether an adsorption system followed the freundlich model in this way the clark model provides better fitting curves than the bohart adams model because an extra adjustable parameter n makes the curve fitting more flexible fig 2b 5 partial and complete data in the research work of pap et al 2020 the bohart adams thomas and clark models were employed to correlate with the experimental data covering the partial breakthrough curve it is observed that the fitting curves agree well with the experimental data and that high r 2 and low χ 2 rmse values are obtained in all cases however the model parameters are questionable to account for this problem the clark model was fitted to the partial experimental data c c 0 0 8 and c c 0 0 4 obtained from cu ii adsorption on purolite c100 mb cation exchange resin as shown in fig 2 the partial experimental data can be well described by the clark model and the fitting results may be better due to the reduced number of the data points see table 2 but the distinct differences occur between the model parameters obtained from both partial and complete experimental data the partial experimental data were usually insufficient to describe the real dynamic adsorption behaviors in a fixed bed column because they did not identify the vital properties of the complete breakthrough curve such as the symmetry astringency and curvature the use of the complete experimental data was the best way to estimate the model parameters accurately 6 conclusions this work corrected the fitting results of the kinetic and isotherm models and gave the correct form of the bohart adams model the clark model was directly correlated with the experimental data to obtain a better fitting accuracy the complete experimental data were recommended to obtain the model parameters declaration of competing interest the authors

neatly categorized into objectively defined discrete groups this assumption has played a central role in human history from the philosophies of plato and aristotle all the way to modern science governance computing and communication but the erosion of this broadly shared assumption about nature has been the subtext to many of the major scientific advances of the last several hundred years in biology charles darwin and alfred russel wallace rejected the assumption that all organisms belong to discrete unrelated species in his famous theory of relativity albert einstein powerfully demonstrated that time and space are not discrete further arguing that physical reality must be described in terms of continuous functions einstein 1979 in social psychology judith butler radically disrupted the binary view of sex gender and sexuality butler 1990 over the course of the 20th century and especially since the rapid growth of human genome sequencing we ve learned that standard racial categories do not reflect actual genetic structure in humans yudell et al 2016 these key advances demonstrate that rethinking this fundamental assumption that nature is discrete can promote inspiring scientific progress rethinking the assumption that nature can be neatly categorized into discrete groups has also led to major scientific advances specifically in limnology the study of inland waters limnology was founded on the premise that waterbodies lakes in particular are distinct from the terrestrial ecosystems around them lake ecosystems were considered superb habitats for ecological experiments because their biological chemical and physical processes were considered isolated in 1887 stephen forbes a founder of limnology went so far as to doubt whether annihilating all terrestrial animals would have any important effect on lake ecosystems at all forbes 1925 but we know today that lake ecosystems are intricately connected to surrounding ecosystems and vice versa the boundary where lake ecosystems end and the next ecosystem begins has become increasingly blurred in recent decades during the research boom on ecosystem subsidies beginning in the 2000 s limnologists showed that a large proportion of lake ecosystem carbon can be derived from terrestrial production pace et al 2004 we recognize today that lakes emit greenhouse gases that have widespread effects beyond their boundaries raymond et al 2013 the emergent recognition that lake ecosystems are not discrete or isolated has been a substantial limnological advance tranvik et al 2018 limnologists have begun to critically reflect on many other aspects of discretization leading to a variety of limnological advances for example in recognition of the subjectivity of defining discrete mixed layers some argue that an idealised concept of a well defined mixed layer does not necessarily reflect the reality of aquatic physics gray et al 2019 in recognition of the substantial amount of subsurface flow across catchments discrete hydrogeological units are increasingly recognized as having no real boundaries to water movement fan 2019 by moving beyond research focused on single discrete waterbody types we have also begun to find the remarkable commonalities among seemingly disparate aquatic ecosystems leading to more general theories for how waterbodies function for instance waterbodies across size and flow gradients have been shown to have similar controls on their nutrient limitation elser et al 2007 metabolism yvon durocher et al 2012 trophic cascades shurin et al 2002 and responses to human activity king et al 2019 1 2 why do we discretize yet the ubiquity of limnological discretization today is testament to its enduring broadscale appeal and usefulness we classify waterbodies based on their size pond lake great lake or ocean flow rates creek stream river or large river trophic status oligotrophic mesotrophic or eutrophic mixing stratified or unstratified salinity freshwater or saline latitude tropical temperate or arctic and human hydrological influence lake or reservoir we also divide waterbodies into different zones according to their mixing epilimnion metalimnion or hypolimnion light climate photic or aphotic distance from shore littoral or limnetic and distance from the bottom benthic or pelagic the publications which codify these waterbody discretizations are often very well cited e g lewis jr 1983 in addition to waterbody discretization limnologists rely on discretization in many contexts because it offers extraordinarily useful shortcuts that can facilitate limnological progress management and communication in a hypothetical research context a limnologist could collect total phosphorus samples across depth every millimetre or even finer to detect small scale variation that best reflects the continuous variation in nature however such costly high resolution sampling might be impractical and unnecessary especially if a more discrete approximation with one sample each from the epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion would suffice to answer the research question at hand in a management context the ecological integrity of a waterbody could be painstakingly described using the complete nucleotide sequences for all organisms that occupy it but simply classifying the waterbody s ecological integrity as good or bad based on the presence of a few indicator species may be adequate depending on the management goal discretization can also simplify communication with the public in the case of public swimming advisories a dichotomous safe or not safe advisory may facilitate swimmer decisions about whether or not to get in the water alternatively an advisory stating the exact quantitative probabilities of exposure to all toxins may overburden swimmer decision making thus limnologists intuitively know that the appropriateness of any specific discretization scheme depends on the objectives and the resources at hand to meet those objectives 1 3 discretization amid an information explosion our objectives and our resources in limnology are changing rapidly compared to previous satellite missions recently deployed remote sensing platforms have higher resolutions that capture more waterbodies at higher frequencies palmer et al 2015 continuously profiling cameras can collect underwater images of microscopic organisms process those images using artificial intelligence and generate real time biodiversity profiles luo et al 2018 while further improvements are still needed automated dissolved nutrient sensors are becoming more accurate and less expensive every day beaton et al 2012 nightingale et al 2019 these and other developments in automated sensor technology are inspiring new questions about the drivers of fine scale variability crawford et al 2015 numerous computing resources are putting advanced statistical tools at our finger tips for free read et al 2011 winslow et al 2016 woolway et al 2015 national international and global databases containing data from many thousands of waterbodies are inspiring new questions and becoming an increasingly important tool to understand aquatic ecosystems king et al 2019 u s environmental protection agency 2009 global networks e g global lake ecological observatory network are making substantial progress in sharing and interpreting high resolution sensor data from a broad spectrum of waterbodies to understand their role in and response to environmental change hanson et al 2016 mobile technologies social media citizen science and open access philosophies are reshaping the ways limnologists communicate with each other and with the public hampton et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2017 these rapid changes will have consequences for how and when limnologists find certain discretizations appropriate just as modern genomics has strengthened calls to reconsider the biological concept of race as a scientific categorization yudell et al 2016 limnological modernity may also require rethinking limnological discretizations the burgeoning availability of data and research tools is likely to lead to new discussions and reinvigorate ongoing arguments about the appropriateness of various discretization schemes in aggregate resolving these arguments could substantially influence whether the ongoing information deluge improves our science here i summarise some of the advantages and disadvantages of discretization so that it may inform our arguments about discretization amid the current information explosion to help us resolve these arguments i offer a framework that can be used to assess the relative usefulness of various discretization approaches and compare them to the alternatives 2 advantages and disadvantages of discretization 2 1 waterbody discretization the division of waterbodies into types and zones like pixelating an image waterbody discretization partially masks variability within groups causing a loss of signal in the gradient gray et al 2019 for instance limnologists often divide the continuous gradient of human influence on waterbody hydrology into the categories lake and reservoir but these terms mask the variety of waterbodies that fall along the continuous gradient that underlies them the term reservoir can be used to describe a wide range of waterbodies from those that have been created by humans de novo to those that have slight modifications in their water levels due to a dam discretization errors associated with the term reservoir are partly reduced by adding more classes e g run of river reservoir adding enough classes to sufficiently reduce discretization errors can take the limnological lexicon down a path toward overbearing complexity e g semi lacustrine oligotrophic tropical run of river reservoir that impedes communication rather than enhancing it biber and gray 2010 waterbody discretization is widespread in part because it can facilitate communication among experts by offering useful linguistic shortcuts jargon single words of limnological jargon can stand for whole paragraphs of text in plain english so jargon can save time and lead to the development of a unifying scholarly identity but just as the jargon associated with discretization can facilitate communication among experts it can also hamper communication with non experts jargon is widely denounced in the public sphere by scientific communication specialists who view it as a key boundary to public understanding of science venhuizen et al 2019 jargon associated with waterbody discretization can even hamper communication among experts from closely related fields as different experts can have different definitions for the same jargon chaloner and wotton 2011 for example the littoral zone refers to the shallow illuminated zone in freshwater ecology but to the intertidal zone in marine ecology due to the subjectivity of defining jargon the number of definitions often proliferate for example there are over 20 different definitions of the mixed depth in use today in aquatic science gray et al 2019 kara et al 2000 thus waterbody discretization and its associated jargon can be profoundly useful by expediting communication among experts but it can hamper communication with non experts and experts from closely related fields discretizing waterbodies can benefit limnology by guiding expectations for how waterbodies function leading to greater focus in our research and collaborations for instance many limnologists inherently expect discrete classes and zones to behave in distinct ways reservoirs are thought to function in fundamentally different ways compared to lakes hayes et al 2017 some limnologists encourage developing a unique limnology for very small ponds hoverman and johnson 2012 and large rivers it is argued should be modelled separately from other rivers puckridge et al 1998 these expectations can lead limnologists to form discrete collaborative teams focused on illuminating exceptionally important research topics even if they are predominantly relevant only for specific waterbody types and zones as a result ponds lakes wetlands streams rivers and oceans are typically studied in isolation at both fine and broad scales due to their perceived differences chaloner and wotton 2011 king et al 2019 but expectations that waterbody classes and zones represent real structure in nature can also be a disadvantage the compartmentalization of waterbodies is problematic because it counteracts the formulation of general ecological theory and hypotheses founded on waterbody relatedness it has been argued that this isolation has slowed the development of a common mechanistic understanding of the drivers of carbon hotchkiss et al 2018 nutrient elser et al 2007 and energy chaloner and wotton 2011 dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when limnologists study different waterbody types and zones concurrently along continuous gradients the basic commonalities among all waterbodies can be more apparent which promotes synthesis and general theory formulation chaloner and wotton 2011 hotchkiss et al 2018 trans disciplinarity is widely touted in the scientific literature chaloner and wotton 2011 and may be key to merging the understanding generated from studying specific waterbody types and zones 2 2 discretization in water management discretization in limnology goes far beyond waterbody classification and zonation discretization is also widely relied on by limnologists when promoting certain resource management targets for example discrete pollution limits are promoted as a waterbody management tool which allows polluters to pollute up to a specific threshold without having to pay liu et al 2015 threshold based management is widely encouraged in the scientific literature liu et al 2015 and adopted by local national and international management authorities for instance the environmental protection agency in the united states uses total maximum daily loads the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody is allowed to receive to enforce discrete pollution standards in europe the water framework directive requires that waterbody status be classified as high good moderate poor and bad with the goal of achieving at least good status for all european waterbodies by discrete deadlines so discrete management targets have been relied on for decades to control waterbody stressors with some success carvalho et al 2019 reckhow 2001 but in some contexts management approaches based on discrete management targets can be suboptimal the effectiveness of discrete management targets partially depends on whether waterbodies have a predictable well defined discrete capacity to withstand stress there is an abundant limnological literature on thresholds in stressor response relationships but this literature shows that strong thresholds in these relationships are rare uncertain and difficult to predict groffman et al 2006 gsell et al 2016 furthermore potential thresholds may be dynamic through time making them an unrealistic management target even with multitudinous data from a specific system discrete stressor targets can also cause defeatism the thinking that stressor reductions are valuable only if they take stressors below a threshold defeatism may prevent incremental stressor reductions which are beneficial but don t meet the threshold conversely discrete stressor targets can cause complacency the thinking that stressor reductions that occur below a threshold are worthless when further reductions would still elicit resource benefits 2 3 discretization in sampling and data analysis all data collection is inherently discrete because scientists cannot continuously measure all of nature as a result all limnological measurements even high frequency measurements inevitably reflect limnological processes at discrete points in space and in time higher frequency sampling is typically more expensive but can be more representative of the continuous variation in nature meinson et al 2015 this trade off between cost and realism is widely documented and approaches have been developed for optimizing sampling frequency anttila et al 2012 recent technological developments such as automated in situ sensors have substantially altered the acceptability of lower frequency monitoring as a result of these changes occasional spot samples are often not an acceptable standalone monitoring approach for many aquatic variables nõges et al 2010 except when collected across many spatially distributed waterbodies similarly due to advances in remote sensing of inland waters measurements taken from the center of waterbodies are no longer considered to be reflective of individual waterbodies as a whole mason et al 2016 woolway and merchant 2018 furthermore limnologists discretized approach to designing experiments and analysing data has also been the core of limnological progress for decades limnologists design experiments using discrete replicated treatments johnson et al 2009 test for statistical significance using discrete p values cluster data using k means and other clustering approaches maberly et al 2020 savoy et al 2019 and use classification trees to explain variability in data by dividing it into classes based on discrete cut offs in predictor variables o reilly et al 2015 these discretizations can save time resources and can simplify the interpretation of complex statistical findings despite the widespread dependence of limnological progress on analysis using discretization some approaches rely more on discretization than others overdependence on discretization can lead limnologists to design limnological studies with less statistical power that are more difficult to incorporate into ecological theory for instance analysis of variance anova a widely used statistical technique in limnology has less statistical power than linear regressions when both tests assumptions are met yet we often design experiments with a discrete replicated anova design cottingham et al 2005 kreyling et al 2018 furthermore linear regression can provide quantitative output with fewer parameters that can be more effectively incorporated into ecological models than anova output cottingham et al 2005 kreyling et al 2018 simple classification tree analysis is also commonly used in limnology but its discretized simplicity belies its many disadvantages simple classification trees make highly approximated representations of continuous functions their output can be extremely unstable when fit with new data and other methods vastly outperform them according to widely ranging performance metrics prasad et al 2006 furthermore statisticians have made widespread calls to end dichotomous significance testing because the practice often leads to misunderstandings and misinterpretation of results amrhein et al 2019 johnson 2007 just as dichotomous significance testing has been widely criticized so too have the various statistical clustering approaches commonly used in limnology for easily finding discrete structure in un structured data cormack 1971 3 discretization evaluation framework when limnologists have a choice about the extent to which they rely on discretization i suggest that they carefully examine the relative value of specific discretization approaches and compare them to the alternatives using the discretization evaluation framework fig 1 the value of any discretization system should be judged based on the extent to which it satisfies three criteria objectivity independent researchers make the same conclusion about the number and definitions of discrete boundaries predictivity performs well when predicting other variables and stability doesn t change when new observations contribute to the system the objectivity predictivity and stability of discretizations should always be compared to alternatives such as analogous continuous gradients when they are available to demonstrate the discretization evaluation framework here i use a data driven example from the 2007 national lakes assessment nla to assess the objectivity predictivity and stability of various lake depth classifications fig 2 there is no broadly accepted and objective lake depth classification in use today so i created an ad hoc set of discretized gradients by iteratively dividing the lakes from the nla into evenly sized groups from a total of 2 groups binary classification up to a maximum of 562 groups given 1124 lakes in the dataset 562 was the largest number of groups such that each group had at least 2 lakes i evaluated these discretized lake depth classifications for their capacity to predict variation in chl a concentrations using ordinary least squares regression fig 2 i compared the performance of the model based on discretized gradients computationally equivalent to anova to that using the full continuous gradient of depth in the original dataset according to the models root mean squared error rmse i evaluated the stability of the results through model cross validation with a random selection of 50 of the data used for model training and the remaining 50 of the data used for testing the model with 10 000 repetitions the stability was characterized by the mean rmse from the test dataset in cross validation across all 10 000 repetitions i found that the discretized gradients with the most groups achieved the highest model predictivity lowest rmse although this could be interpreted as a result of model overfitting fig 2 however the continuous gradient outperformed the discretized gradients with 9 or fewer groups and the continuous gradient was consistently the most stable in cross validation lowest rmse in cross validation holistically the higher objectivity and stability but partially lower predictivity of the continuous depth gradient could justify using the continuous depth gradient when predicting chl a concentrations instead of a discretized depth gradient many other analyses similar to those presented here could be used to assess continuous versus discrete gradients in other contexts for example the hydrolakes database containing information on 1 4 million lakes worldwide now includes data on the proportion of the waterbody s volume which has been impounded continuous gradient in addition to the discretized categories lake and reservoir messager et al 2016 tests of the relative objectivity predictivity and stability of these two variables could be illuminating in a management context the discretization evaluation framework could also be used to rigorously compare the management outcomes when using discrete pollution targets versus per unit pollution taxes or pollution trading that affect all levels of pollution regardless of whether it is above or below a discrete threshold pollution taxes and trading may lead to more optimal outcomes in resource management in some contexts muller and mendelsohn 2009 but the relative objectivity predictivity and stability of these two management approaches needs to be tested for waterbodies at broad scales rigorous testing of discretization schemes according to the discretization evaluation framework may even lead us toward objective scientifically testable discretizations that avoid potentially unproductive arguments about the appropriate number and definitions of boundaries between groups 4 the bottom line regardless of a discretized gradient s performance in the discretization evaluation framework any calls for rejecting waterbody discretization schemes are likely to be met with fierce resistance because limnological progress to date has relied heavily on them for instance early in limnology s history lakes were divided into low medium and high trophic classes based on their productivity carlson 1977 so called trophic state classifications expanded rapidly following this early work with new limnologists frequently reinventing the scale but in the 1970 s limnologists began to find the contradictions among trophic state classification systems problematic because the class boundaries were scientifically un testable preventing the development of a single general classification system carlson 1977 robert e carlson argued for replacing a classification based system with a less arbitrary continuous gradient from 0 to 100 called the trophic state index carlson 1977 while carlson s paper receives many citations the discretized classification based systems are still widely used in limnology today similar calls for replacing other waterbody classifications or zonations are likely to be met with similar resistance just as darwin and wallace did not eliminate the species concept with their theory of evolution limnologists will continue to rely on waterbody discretizations for the foreseeable future because of the useful shortcuts that they offer more fundamentally discretization is partially unassailable because it is essential to science language and modern computing after all science itself advances through discrete datasets analyses and publications publications are written using language which is constructed with discrete letters and words moreover computers are essentially discretization machines turning precise information into 1 s and 0 s so that it can be represented by on off transistors in the computer s hardware thus discretization is perpetually engrained in limnology as it is in virtually all human pursuits aside from our general human reliance on discretization for science language and computing discretization may simply be unavoidable in specific contexts our data may have been pre discretized we may lack sufficient funds sampling power or computational power to fully capture continuous gradients and implement regression based experimental designs or we may be temporarily required by law to discretize e g section 314 of the united states clean water act requires that lakes be classified according to their eutrophic character nevertheless in cases where limnologists do have a choice rigorously questioning the extent to which we must rely on discretization is appropriate and timely especially given the ongoing changes to the research questions we ask and the resources we have at hand to address them 5 the future of limnological discretization more than 100 years since stephen forbes publication of the lake as a microcosm we have moved beyond the idea that lake ecosystems are discrete limnologists may be poised to further transform their reliance on discretization in the next 100 years radical innovations in sensing technology could largely supplant the need for discrete water samples unforeseen technical statistical and data visualization approaches could allow us to better capture and communicate the full signal in continuous gradients and quantum computing could even move us one big step past binary computing s limitations arute et al 2019 the extent to which we benefit from these future changes will depend on our mindfulness of discretization and the role it plays in our research management and communication selectively rethinking discretization and applying the discretization evaluation framework could open up new interactions new questions and could even lead to the next major advance so for now let s carefully weigh the advantages against the disadvantages and compare to the alternatives when they are available doing so will improve our science 6 conclusions discretization has profoundly benefitted the way we study understand manage and communicate about aquatic ecosystems but limnologists sometimes have a choice over the extent to which they rely on discretization in these cases discretization s advantages should be carefully weighed against their disadvantages the core advantage of discretization is that it can provide extraordinarily useful shortcuts especially when faced with limited resources these shortcuts can facilitate data collection data analysis data interpretation communication decision making and management while guiding expectations for how ecosystems function but discretization also has several key disadvantages in specific contexts which are sometimes overlooked discretization can inhibit communication distract from general theory formation introduce unnecessary subjectivity mask the relatedness between discrete groups mask the variability within discrete groups and lead to suboptimal management approaches and research designs discretization is partially unassailable because it is the foundation of modern science language and computing but recent changes to the field of limnology including big data and high resolution sensors have challenged specific aspects of the way we discretize leading to substantial limnological advances in light of the rapid and ongoing changes to the field of limnology i encourage the careful and selective examination of limnological discretization in terms of its objectivity

argue that an idealised concept of a well defined mixed layer does not necessarily reflect the reality of aquatic physics gray et al 2019 in recognition of the substantial amount of subsurface flow across catchments discrete hydrogeological units are increasingly recognized as having no real boundaries to water movement fan 2019 by moving beyond research focused on single discrete waterbody types we have also begun to find the remarkable commonalities among seemingly disparate aquatic ecosystems leading to more general theories for how waterbodies function for instance waterbodies across size and flow gradients have been shown to have similar controls on their nutrient limitation elser et al 2007 metabolism yvon durocher et al 2012 trophic cascades shurin et al 2002 and responses to human activity king et al 2019 1 2 why do we discretize yet the ubiquity of limnological discretization today is testament to its enduring broadscale appeal and usefulness we classify waterbodies based on their size pond lake great lake or ocean flow rates creek stream river or large river trophic status oligotrophic mesotrophic or eutrophic mixing stratified or unstratified salinity freshwater or saline latitude tropical temperate or arctic and human hydrological influence lake or reservoir we also divide waterbodies into different zones according to their mixing epilimnion metalimnion or hypolimnion light climate photic or aphotic distance from shore littoral or limnetic and distance from the bottom benthic or pelagic the publications which codify these waterbody discretizations are often very well cited e g lewis jr 1983 in addition to waterbody discretization limnologists rely on discretization in many contexts because it offers extraordinarily useful shortcuts that can facilitate limnological progress management and communication in a hypothetical research context a limnologist could collect total phosphorus samples across depth every millimetre or even finer to detect small scale variation that best reflects the continuous variation in nature however such costly high resolution sampling might be impractical and unnecessary especially if a more discrete approximation with one sample each from the epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion would suffice to answer the research question at hand in a management context the ecological integrity of a waterbody could be painstakingly described using the complete nucleotide sequences for all organisms that occupy it but simply classifying the waterbody s ecological integrity as good or bad based on the presence of a few indicator species may be adequate depending on the management goal discretization can also simplify communication with the public in the case of public swimming advisories a dichotomous safe or not safe advisory may facilitate swimmer decisions about whether or not to get in the water alternatively an advisory stating the exact quantitative probabilities of exposure to all toxins may overburden swimmer decision making thus limnologists intuitively know that the appropriateness of any specific discretization scheme depends on the objectives and the resources at hand to meet those objectives 1 3 discretization amid an information explosion our objectives and our resources in limnology are changing rapidly compared to previous satellite missions recently deployed remote sensing platforms have higher resolutions that capture more waterbodies at higher frequencies palmer et al 2015 continuously profiling cameras can collect underwater images of microscopic organisms process those images using artificial intelligence and generate real time biodiversity profiles luo et al 2018 while further improvements are still needed automated dissolved nutrient sensors are becoming more accurate and less expensive every day beaton et al 2012 nightingale et al 2019 these and other developments in automated sensor technology are inspiring new questions about the drivers of fine scale variability crawford et al 2015 numerous computing resources are putting advanced statistical tools at our finger tips for free read et al 2011 winslow et al 2016 woolway et al 2015 national international and global databases containing data from many thousands of waterbodies are inspiring new questions and becoming an increasingly important tool to understand aquatic ecosystems king et al 2019 u s environmental protection agency 2009 global networks e g global lake ecological observatory network are making substantial progress in sharing and interpreting high resolution sensor data from a broad spectrum of waterbodies to understand their role in and response to environmental change hanson et al 2016 mobile technologies social media citizen science and open access philosophies are reshaping the ways limnologists communicate with each other and with the public hampton et al 2013 weyhenmeyer et al 2017 these rapid changes will have consequences for how and when limnologists find certain discretizations appropriate just as modern genomics has strengthened calls to reconsider the biological concept of race as a scientific categorization yudell et al 2016 limnological modernity may also require rethinking limnological discretizations the burgeoning availability of data and research tools is likely to lead to new discussions and reinvigorate ongoing arguments about the appropriateness of various discretization schemes in aggregate resolving these arguments could substantially influence whether the ongoing information deluge improves our science here i summarise some of the advantages and disadvantages of discretization so that it may inform our arguments about discretization amid the current information explosion to help us resolve these arguments i offer a framework that can be used to assess the relative usefulness of various discretization approaches and compare them to the alternatives 2 advantages and disadvantages of discretization 2 1 waterbody discretization the division of waterbodies into types and zones like pixelating an image waterbody discretization partially masks variability within groups causing a loss of signal in the gradient gray et al 2019 for instance limnologists often divide the continuous gradient of human influence on waterbody hydrology into the categories lake and reservoir but these terms mask the variety of waterbodies that fall along the continuous gradient that underlies them the term reservoir can be used to describe a wide range of waterbodies from those that have been created by humans de novo to those that have slight modifications in their water levels due to a dam discretization errors associated with the term reservoir are partly reduced by adding more classes e g run of river reservoir adding enough classes to sufficiently reduce discretization errors can take the limnological lexicon down a path toward overbearing complexity e g semi lacustrine oligotrophic tropical run of river reservoir that impedes communication rather than enhancing it biber and gray 2010 waterbody discretization is widespread in part because it can facilitate communication among experts by offering useful linguistic shortcuts jargon single words of limnological jargon can stand for whole paragraphs of text in plain english so jargon can save time and lead to the development of a unifying scholarly identity but just as the jargon associated with discretization can facilitate communication among experts it can also hamper communication with non experts jargon is widely denounced in the public sphere by scientific communication specialists who view it as a key boundary to public understanding of science venhuizen et al 2019 jargon associated with waterbody discretization can even hamper communication among experts from closely related fields as different experts can have different definitions for the same jargon chaloner and wotton 2011 for example the littoral zone refers to the shallow illuminated zone in freshwater ecology but to the intertidal zone in marine ecology due to the subjectivity of defining jargon the number of definitions often proliferate for example there are over 20 different definitions of the mixed depth in use today in aquatic science gray et al 2019 kara et al 2000 thus waterbody discretization and its associated jargon can be profoundly useful by expediting communication among experts but it can hamper communication with non experts and experts from closely related fields discretizing waterbodies can benefit limnology by guiding expectations for how waterbodies function leading to greater focus in our research and collaborations for instance many limnologists inherently expect discrete classes and zones to behave in distinct ways reservoirs are thought to function in fundamentally different ways compared to lakes hayes et al 2017 some limnologists encourage developing a unique limnology for very small ponds hoverman and johnson 2012 and large rivers it is argued should be modelled separately from other rivers puckridge et al 1998 these expectations can lead limnologists to form discrete collaborative teams focused on illuminating exceptionally important research topics even if they are predominantly relevant only for specific waterbody types and zones as a result ponds lakes wetlands streams rivers and oceans are typically studied in isolation at both fine and broad scales due to their perceived differences chaloner and wotton 2011 king et al 2019 but expectations that waterbody classes and zones represent real structure in nature can also be a disadvantage the compartmentalization of waterbodies is problematic because it counteracts the formulation of general ecological theory and hypotheses founded on waterbody relatedness it has been argued that this isolation has slowed the development of a common mechanistic understanding of the drivers of carbon hotchkiss et al 2018 nutrient elser et al 2007 and energy chaloner and wotton 2011 dynamics in aquatic ecosystems when limnologists study different waterbody types and zones concurrently along continuous gradients the basic commonalities among all waterbodies can be more apparent which promotes synthesis and general theory formulation chaloner and wotton 2011 hotchkiss et al 2018 trans disciplinarity is widely touted in the scientific literature chaloner and wotton 2011 and may be key to merging the understanding generated from studying specific waterbody types and zones 2 2 discretization in water management discretization in limnology goes far beyond waterbody classification and zonation discretization is also widely relied on by limnologists when promoting certain resource management targets for example discrete pollution limits are promoted as a waterbody management tool which allows polluters to pollute up to a specific threshold without having to pay liu et al 2015 threshold based management is widely encouraged in the scientific literature liu et al 2015 and adopted by local national and international management authorities for instance the environmental protection agency in the united states uses total maximum daily loads the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody is allowed to receive to enforce discrete pollution standards in europe the water framework directive requires that waterbody status be classified as high good moderate poor and bad with the goal of achieving at least good status for all european waterbodies by discrete deadlines so discrete management targets have been relied on for decades to control waterbody stressors with some success carvalho et al 2019 reckhow 2001 but in some contexts management approaches based on discrete management targets can be suboptimal the effectiveness of discrete management targets partially depends on whether waterbodies have a predictable well defined discrete capacity to withstand stress there is an abundant limnological literature on thresholds in stressor response relationships but this literature shows that strong thresholds in these relationships are rare uncertain and difficult to predict groffman et al 2006 gsell et al 2016 furthermore potential thresholds may be dynamic through time making them an unrealistic management target even with multitudinous data from a specific system discrete stressor targets can also cause defeatism the thinking that stressor reductions are valuable only if they take stressors below a threshold defeatism may prevent incremental stressor reductions which are beneficial but don t meet the threshold conversely discrete stressor targets can cause complacency the thinking that stressor reductions that occur below a threshold are worthless when further reductions would still elicit resource benefits 2 3 discretization in sampling and data analysis all data collection is inherently discrete because scientists cannot continuously measure all of nature as a result all limnological measurements even high frequency measurements inevitably reflect limnological processes at discrete points in space and in time higher frequency sampling is typically more expensive but can be more representative of the continuous variation in nature meinson et al 2015 this trade off between cost and realism is widely documented and approaches have been developed for optimizing sampling frequency anttila et al 2012 recent technological developments such as automated in situ sensors have substantially altered the acceptability of lower frequency monitoring as a result of these changes occasional spot samples are often not an acceptable standalone monitoring approach for many aquatic variables nõges et al 2010 except when collected across many spatially distributed waterbodies similarly due to advances in remote sensing of inland waters measurements taken from the center of waterbodies are no longer considered to be reflective of individual waterbodies as a whole mason et al 2016 woolway and merchant 2018 furthermore limnologists discretized approach to designing experiments and analysing data has also been the core of limnological progress for decades limnologists design experiments using discrete replicated treatments johnson et al 2009 test for statistical significance using discrete p values cluster data using k means and other clustering approaches maberly et al 2020 savoy et al 2019 and use classification trees to explain variability in data by dividing it into classes based on discrete cut offs in predictor variables o reilly et al 2015 these discretizations can save time resources and can simplify the interpretation of complex statistical findings despite the widespread dependence of limnological progress on analysis using discretization some approaches rely more on discretization than others overdependence on discretization can lead limnologists to design limnological studies with less statistical power that are more difficult to incorporate into ecological theory for instance analysis of variance anova a widely used statistical technique in limnology has less statistical power than linear regressions when both tests assumptions are met yet we often design experiments with a discrete replicated anova design cottingham et al 2005 kreyling et al 2018 furthermore linear regression can provide quantitative output with fewer parameters that can be more effectively incorporated into ecological models than anova output cottingham et al 2005 kreyling et al 2018 simple classification tree analysis is also commonly used in limnology but its discretized simplicity belies its many disadvantages simple classification trees make highly approximated representations of continuous functions their output can be extremely unstable when fit with new data and other methods vastly outperform them according to widely ranging performance metrics prasad et al 2006 furthermore statisticians have made widespread calls to end dichotomous significance testing because the practice often leads to misunderstandings and misinterpretation of results amrhein et al 2019 johnson 2007 just as dichotomous significance testing has been widely criticized so too have the various statistical clustering approaches commonly used in limnology for easily finding discrete structure in un structured data cormack 1971 3 discretization evaluation framework when limnologists have a choice about the extent to which they rely on discretization i suggest that they carefully examine the relative value of specific discretization approaches and compare them to the alternatives using the discretization evaluation framework fig 1 the value of any discretization system should be judged based on the extent to which it satisfies three criteria objectivity independent researchers make the same conclusion about the number and definitions of discrete boundaries predictivity performs well when predicting other variables and stability doesn t change when new observations contribute to the system the objectivity predictivity and stability of discretizations should always be compared to alternatives such as analogous continuous gradients when they are available to demonstrate the discretization evaluation framework here i use a data driven example from the 2007 national lakes assessment nla to assess the objectivity predictivity and stability of various lake depth classifications fig 2 there is no broadly accepted and objective lake depth classification in use today so i created an ad hoc set of discretized gradients by iteratively dividing the lakes from the nla into evenly sized groups from a total of 2 groups binary classification up to a maximum of 562 groups given 1124 lakes in the dataset 562 was the largest number of groups such that each group had at least 2 lakes i evaluated these discretized lake depth classifications for their capacity to predict variation in chl a concentrations using ordinary least squares regression fig 2 i compared the performance of the model based on discretized gradients computationally equivalent to anova to that using the full continuous gradient of depth in the original dataset according to the models root mean squared error rmse i evaluated the stability of the results through model cross validation with a random selection of 50 of the data used for model training and the remaining 50 of the data used for testing the model with 10 000 repetitions the stability was characterized by the mean rmse from the test dataset in cross validation across all 10 000 repetitions i found that the discretized gradients with the most groups achieved the highest model predictivity lowest rmse although this could be interpreted as a result of model overfitting fig 2 however the continuous gradient outperformed the discretized gradients with 9 or fewer groups and the continuous gradient was consistently the most stable in cross validation lowest rmse in cross validation holistically the higher objectivity and stability but partially lower predictivity of the continuous depth gradient could justify using the continuous depth gradient when predicting chl a concentrations instead of a discretized depth gradient many other analyses similar to those presented here could be used to assess continuous versus discrete gradients in other contexts for example the hydrolakes database containing information on 1 4 million lakes worldwide now includes data on the proportion of the waterbody s volume which has been impounded continuous gradient in addition to the discretized categories lake and reservoir messager et al 2016 tests of the relative objectivity predictivity and stability of these two variables could be illuminating in a management context the discretization evaluation framework could also be used to rigorously compare the management outcomes when using discrete pollution targets versus per unit pollution taxes or pollution trading that affect all levels of pollution regardless of whether it is above or below a discrete threshold pollution taxes and trading may lead to more optimal outcomes in resource management in some contexts muller and mendelsohn 2009 but the relative objectivity predictivity and stability of these two management approaches needs to be tested for waterbodies at broad scales rigorous testing of discretization schemes according to the discretization evaluation framework may even lead us toward objective scientifically testable discretizations that avoid potentially unproductive arguments about the appropriate number and definitions of boundaries between groups 4 the bottom line regardless of a discretized gradient s performance in the discretization evaluation framework any calls for rejecting waterbody discretization schemes are likely to be met with fierce resistance because limnological progress to date has relied heavily on them for instance early in limnology s history lakes were divided into low medium and high trophic classes based on their productivity carlson 1977 so called trophic state classifications expanded rapidly following this early work with new limnologists frequently reinventing the scale but in the 1970 s limnologists began to find the contradictions among trophic state classification systems problematic because the class boundaries were scientifically un testable preventing the development of a single general classification system carlson 1977 robert e carlson argued for replacing a classification based system with a less arbitrary continuous gradient from 0 to 100 called the trophic state index carlson 1977 while carlson s paper receives many citations the discretized classification based systems are still widely used in limnology today similar calls for replacing other waterbody classifications or zonations are likely to be met with similar resistance just as darwin and wallace did not eliminate the species concept with their theory of evolution limnologists will continue to rely on waterbody discretizations for the foreseeable future because of the useful shortcuts that they offer more fundamentally discretization is partially unassailable because it is essential to science language and modern computing after all science itself advances through discrete datasets analyses and publications publications are written using language which is constructed with discrete letters and words moreover computers are essentially discretization machines turning precise information into 1 s and 0 s so that it can be represented by on off transistors in the computer s hardware thus discretization is perpetually engrained in limnology as it is in virtually all human pursuits aside from our general human reliance on discretization for science language and computing discretization may simply be unavoidable in specific contexts our data may have been pre discretized we may lack sufficient funds sampling power or computational power to fully capture continuous gradients and implement regression based experimental designs or we may be temporarily required by law to discretize e g section 314 of the united states clean water act requires that lakes be classified according to their eutrophic character nevertheless in cases where limnologists do have a choice rigorously questioning the extent to which we must rely on discretization is appropriate and timely especially given the ongoing changes to the research questions we ask and the resources we have at hand to address them 5 the future of limnological discretization more than 100 years since stephen forbes publication of the lake as a microcosm we have moved beyond the idea that lake ecosystems are discrete limnologists may be poised to further transform their reliance on discretization in the next 100 years radical innovations in sensing technology could largely supplant the need for discrete water samples unforeseen technical statistical and data visualization approaches could allow us to better capture and communicate the full signal in continuous gradients and quantum computing could even move us one big step past binary computing s limitations arute et al 2019 the extent to which we benefit from these future changes will depend on our mindfulness of discretization and the role it plays in our research management and communication selectively rethinking discretization and applying the discretization evaluation framework could open up new interactions new questions and could even lead to the next major advance so for now let s carefully weigh the advantages against the disadvantages and compare to the alternatives when they are available doing so will improve our science 6 conclusions discretization has profoundly benefitted the way we study understand manage and communicate about aquatic ecosystems but limnologists sometimes have a choice over the extent to which they rely on discretization in these cases discretization s advantages should be carefully weighed against their disadvantages the core advantage of discretization is that it can provide extraordinarily useful shortcuts especially when faced with limited resources these shortcuts can facilitate data collection data analysis data interpretation communication decision making and management while guiding expectations for how ecosystems function but discretization also has several key disadvantages in specific contexts which are sometimes overlooked discretization can inhibit communication distract from general theory formation introduce unnecessary subjectivity mask the relatedness between discrete groups mask the variability within discrete groups and lead to suboptimal management approaches and research designs discretization is partially unassailable because it is the foundation of modern science language and computing but recent changes to the field of limnology including big data and high resolution sensors have challenged specific aspects of the way we discretize leading to substantial limnological advances in light of the rapid and ongoing changes to the field of limnology i encourage the careful and selective examination of limnological discretization in terms of its objectivity predictivity and stability following the discretization evaluation framework this examination may help limnology stay relevant amid the ongoing information explosion author contribution statement bmk

17898,drinking water supply wells can be contaminated by a broad range of waterborne pathogens however groundwater assessments frequently measure microbial indicators or a single pathogen type which provides a limited characterization of potential health risk this study assessed contamination of wells by testing for viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens and fecal markers wells supplying groundwater to community and noncommunity public water systems in minnesota usa n 145 were sampled every other month over one or two years and tested using 23 qpcr assays eighteen genetic targets were detected at least once and microbiological contamination was widespread 96 of 145 wells 58 of 964 samples the sewage associated microbial indicators hf183 and pepper mild mottle virus were detected frequently human or zoonotic pathogens were detected in 70 of wells and 21 of samples by qpcr with salmonella and cryptosporidium detected more often than viruses samples positive by qpcr for adenovirus hadv enterovirus or salmonella were analyzed by culture and for genotype or serotype qpcr positive giardia and cryptosporidium samples were analyzed by immunofluorescent assay ifa and ifa and qpcr concentrations were correlated comparisons of indicator and pathogen occurrence at the time of sampling showed that total coliforms hf183 and bacteroidales like humm2 had high specificity and negative predictive values but generally low sensitivity and positive predictive values pathogen hf183 ratios in sewage have been used to estimate health risks from hf183 concentrations in surface water but in our groundwater samples cryptosporidium oocyst hf183 and hadv hf183 ratios were approximately 10 000 times higher than ratios reported for sewage qpcr measurements provided a robust characterization of microbiological water quality but interpretation of qpcr data in a regulatory context is challenging because few studies link qpcr measurements to health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater pathogens hf183 b acteroides pepper mild mottle virus microbial indicators pathogen indicator ratios 1 introduction public water systems regulated under the united states environmental protection agency s usepa ground water rule are monitored by analysis of total coliforms following the revised total coliform rule usepa 2006a the strong association between total coliform absence and enteric pathogenic virus absence provides a reasonable assurance that health risk is low when total coliform tests are consistently negative fout et al 2017 when total coliform is detected follow up tests aim to identify the sanitary defect causing contamination usepa 2013 however the implications of total coliform positive samples are ambiguous in terms of pathogen presence fout et al 2017 though practical within the find and fix approach of the revised total coliform rule total coliform analysis provides a limited characterization of groundwater quality in terms of the presence and types of pathogens that threaten public health the body of scientific literature demonstrates groundwater vulnerability to various pathogens hynds et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 but many studies have focused on human enteric viruses leaving nonviral groundwater pathogens relatively understudied hynds et al 2014 reported that 54 of pathogen records for studies conducted in the usa included viruses while only 20 and 15 included bacterial and protozoan pathogens respectively likewise murphy et al 2017 identified 56 virus occurrence studies worldwide compared to 26 studies that included bacterial pathogens and 10 studies that included protozoan pathogens while less frequently measured in groundwater bacteria and protozoa represent a public health concern craun et al 2010 for example escherichia coli o157 h7 and campylobacter jejuni caused groundwater borne outbreaks in canada new zealand and nebraska bartholomew et al 2014 o connor 2002 pedati et al 2019 understanding the range of pathogens capable of contaminating groundwater is important for assessing risk murphy et al 2017 pathogen presence is of special concern for the 80 of noncommunity public water systems in the united states that distribute nondisinfected water usepa 2006c but studies more commonly focus on municipal or community wells hynds et al 2014 noncommunity public water systems which are systems that provide water to locations outside consumers residences e g schools restaurants are subject to less stringent monitoring than community systems and have more exemptions available usepa 2006a 2013 for example the revised total coliform rule requires noncommunity groundwater systems serving 1 000 or fewer people to sample less frequently than similarly sized community systems usepa 2013 though noncommunity systems may serve a small or changing population they are an important potential exposure route to groundwater borne pathogens for example noncommunity groundwater systems in the united states are associated with many outbreaks craun et al 2010 wallender et al 2014 moreover the etiological agent is unknown for a large proportion of these outbreaks craun et al 2010 wallender et al 2014 assessments of groundwater quality that identify pathogens can inform strategies that reduce contamination or exposure craun et al 2006 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr provides a means to efficiently test for pathogens but the fundamental approach of detecting genetic material rather than living organisms remains a stumbling block to its use and interpretation e g stelma and wymer 2012 relationships between molecular data and illness demonstrate the importance and relevance of qpcr measurements for example teunis et al 2008 developed a relationship between qpcr measurements and probability of norovirus infection using experimental data and thebault et al 2013 linked qpcr measurements to infection and illness using observational data from foodborne norovirus outbreaks likewise studies underlying the recreational water quality criteria established a relationship between qpcr measurements of enterococci and illness usepa 2012a and an epidemiological study of public water systems linked qpcr virus measurements to acute gastrointestinal illness borchardt et al 2012 analysis of groundwater by qpcr is therefore an effective way to characterize risk and assess the microbiological quality of public water the primary objective of this study was to assess microbiological contamination of public water supply wells in minnesota usa community and noncommunity wells across the state were repeatedly sampled over one or two years and tested for viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens using qpcr we used pathogen data to assess the performance of conventional and emerging microbial indicators and we examined groundwater contamination relative to geology and system type finally we compared qpcr measurements to results from other microbiological

fifty seven percent of the study wells draw from quaternary glacial sand and gravel deposits other aquifers include sandstone fractured crystalline rock carbonate rock and mixed sandstone carbonate rocks and shale table s2 geologic sensitivity represents estimates for the vertical time of travel for water or contaminants from the land surface to reach the aquifer and the estimates are based on the permeability and thickness of the overlying material geologic sensitivity project workgroup 1991 for example aquifers that lack low permeability cover have geologic sensitivity ratings of very high or high while those protected by clay or shale rich sediments have geologic sensitivity ratings of low or very low the distribution of study wells was similar to wells statewide in terms of

setting well construction and past monitoring were prioritized including 29 wells from phase one typically sampled six times per phase for a total of 12 the two phase selection process produced a

also analyzed by ifa 2 9 comparison of qpcr and ifa for cryptosporidium and giardia linear regressions of ifa and qpcr concentrations for giardia were completed using microsoft excel 2016 two giardia detections lacked concentrations due to unknown sample volume and were therefore excluded from the regressions so 18 samples were included separate regressions were completed using only those samples positive by both methods n 12 linear regressions of ifa and qpcr concentrations for cryptosporidium are reported in stokdyk et al 2019 2 10 total coliform and e coli analysis samples for total coliform and e coli were analyzed within 30 h of sample collection following standard method 9223 rice et al 2012 2 11 microbial indicator performance sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive value were derived from logistic regression models for the hf183 bacr287 assay for human bacteroides hereafter hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and total coliforms relative to pathogen detections on a sample level and well level following fout et al 2017 for the sample level analyses mixed logistic regression models with random intercepts for well and a spatial correlation structure for the samples within a well were fit to address the non independent nature of the data chavance and escolano 2016 morel et al 2003 for the well level analyses the data were considered independent population averaged logistic regression models were fit with adjustment for number of times the well was sampled categorized as 1 5 6 or 7 12 times since this could affect the corresponding probability of pathogen detection for the well because no wells sampled 7 12 times were negative for hf183 the adjustment for hf183 combined wells sampled 7 12 times with wells sampled 6 times the strength of the indicator pathogen association was also quantified by calculating the pathogen detection ratio positive predictive value 1 negative predictive value the pathogen detection ratio is identical to the risk ratio calculated in fout et al 2017 where values greater than 1 0 the null represent the relative elevation in the pathogen detection rate if the indicator is detected versus when the indicator is not detected for example a pathogen detection ratio of 1 5 indicates that detection of a pathogen was 50 more likely when the indicator was detected compared to when the indicator was not detected indicator performance was assessed for any human or zoonotic pathogen detection and the taxonomic subgroups therein viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens analyses were performed using sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc 3 results 3 1 qpcr overall 18 of the 23 qpcr genetic targets were detected in one or more samples table 1 and 558 samples 58 were positive for at least one genetic target 230 samples were positive for multiple genetic targets adenovirus group b hepatitis a virus norovirus genogroup i enteropathogenic e coli and shiga toxin 1 producing bacteria were not detected hf183 was detected most frequently table 1 and often alone 23 of samples bacteria other than hf183 were detected in 18 of samples more frequently than protozoa and viruses human or zoonotic pathogens all pathogens listed in table 1 excluding bovine polyomavirus were detected in 207 samples 21 viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens were detected in 55 6 62 6 and 121 13 samples respectively thirty nine samples 4 were positive for multiple pathogens concentrations were generally low but eight genetic targets including six pathogens had a maximum concentration greater than 100 gene copies l 1 table 1 wells were typically sampled six times each range 1 12 see table s3 of the 139 wells positive for a genetic target table 2 most n 121 had more than one positive sample table s7 while hf183 was the only genetic target in many samples most wells positive for hf183 all but six were positive for another genetic target during the study human or zoonotic pathogens were detected in 102 wells 70 including 46 32 50 34 and 59 41 wells with viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens respectively an examination of detections by well depth showed no apparent trends table s8 genetic targets were detected in 98 of wells from community systems and 93 of wells from noncommunity systems the 29 wells included in both study phases were sampled 7 12 times each and 192 of the 333 samples from these wells were positive for one or more genetic targets all 29 of these wells had two or more samples positive for a genetic target individual targets were detected in these 29 wells at frequencies similar to the overall results reported in table 1 more samples were positive from these 29 wells in phase 2 n 120 positive samples than phase 1 n 72 samples collected in phase two of the study were positive for one or more genetic targets at a higher rate than samples collected in phase one 75 and 41 respectively largely driven by the bacteria hf183 66 and 23 positive respectively the proportion of wells positive for phase two 100 was greater than for phase one 91 and the difference was driven primarily by hf183 100 and 80 positive respectively genetic targets specific to human fecal waste were detected in 47 of samples and 94 of wells and included hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and the human viruses adenovirus enterovirus polyomavirus and norovirus gii genetic targets specific to ruminant bovine fecal waste including ruminant bacteroides bacteroidales like cow m3 and bovine polyomavirus were detected in 6 of samples and 34 of wells human specific fecal microbes were detected in 95 of community wells and 91 of noncommunity wells ruminant bovine specific microbes were detected in 33 of community wells and 35 of noncommunity wells eighty three percent of wells in phase one and 100 of wells in phase two were positive for human specific microbes while 30 of wells in phase one and 32 of wells in phase two were positive for bovine ruminant specific microbes 3 2 virus cultures and genotyping human adenovirus culture was attempted with the 24 samples positive for hadv by qpcr one cultured sample exhibited cytopathic effect and five samples were positive by icc qpcr sequencing revealed that 17 of the qpcr positive samples were hadv 41 three were hadv 5 three were hadv 31 and one was hadv 6 human enterovirus culture of the nine qpcr positive samples showed all were negative by cytopathic effect and icc qpcr genotyping was successful for six of the nine enterovirus samples three were coxsackievirus a6 one each was coxsackievirus b5 echovirus 18 and echovirus 30 3 3 salmonella cultures and subtyping of the 59 samples positive for salmonella by qpcr seven were positive on both xld and bga with an additional four positive on xld agar alone of the 11 culture positive samples subtyping identified ten that were serovar typhimurium and one serovar montevideo 3 4 giardia and cryptosporidium immunofluorescent assay fourteen of 20 samples positive for giardia by qpcr were positive by ifa at concentrations from 1 to 3 7 cysts l 1 two detections were qualitative due to missing sample volume all seven samples with qpcr concentrations 0 7 gene copies l 1 were positive by ifa while only 5 of 11 below that level were positive by ifa regression revealed a significant relationship between the methods r2 0 94 and a ratio of 4 5 gene copies cyst based on the slope though the regression included only 18 samples over a limited range fig 2 regression restricted to samples positive by both methods n 12 produced similar results r2 0 93 slope 4 6 sixty seven of 107 samples positive for cryptosporidium by qpcr were positive by ifa with consistent ifa detections at qpcr concentrations 0 7 gene copies l 1 results for cryptosporidium including qpcr ifa regression and species identification and subtyping are described in stokdyk et al 2019 thirty of 30 randomly selected qpcr negative samples were negative by ifa for cryptosporidium and giardia 3 5 indicator performance total coliforms were detected in 53 of 925 samples and 36 of 145 wells hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and pmmov were detected in 133 57 and 40 wells respectively all wells positive for bacteroidales like humm2 or pmmov were also positive for hf183 sample level detection frequencies are reported in table 1 57 and 30 samples positive for bacteroidales like humm2 and pmmov respectively were also hf183 positive metrics for indicator performance relative to any human or zoonotic pathogen are reported in table 3 pathogen indicator associations at the sample level were significantly elevated for hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and coliforms but at the well level these associations were not significantly elevated for any indicators restricting the assessment to viral bacterial or protozoan pathogens resulted in the same overall trend as observed for the all pathogens analysis table s9 e coli was detected in three samples and performance metrics were not calculated 4 discussion 4 1 incidence of pathogens and microbial indicators we completed a large systematic study of community and noncommunity public wells n 145 across the geographic extent of minnesota usa study wells represented diverse geologies and the two year sampling campaign encompassed meteorological conditions of all four seasons whereas previous groundwater studies typically focused on microbial indicators or a single class of pathogens we included viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens and fecal markers we observed widespread groundwater contamination 96 of wells and 58 of samples by a broad range of microorganisms pathogens were detected in our study more frequently than studies reviewed by hynds et al 2014 which reported 15 of samples and 16 of wells positive but the reviewed studies typically included fewer tested pathogens an average of two to three and fewer samples per well an average of 1 4 we sampled wells typically six times and while 102 wells 70 were positive for human or zoonotic pathogens only 49 wells 34 were pathogen positive more than once likewise of 207 pathogen positive samples only 39 19 were positive for more than one pathogen while contamination was widespread the intermittence of well contamination and variation in pathogens we observed are consistent with the transient nature of groundwater contamination e g bradbury et al 2013 among pathogens bacteria and protozoa are included in groundwater studies less frequently than viruses hynds et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 but salmonella and cryptosporidium were detected more frequently in our wells in fact salmonella and cryptosporidium were detected in 33 and 40 of wells respectively and they were the only pathogens present in 131 of the 207 pathogen positive samples groundwater studies in developed countries rarely include salmonella outside of outbreak investigations levantesi et al 2012 murphy et al 2017 likewise cryptosporidium is not considered a contaminant of groundwater unless surface water is entering wells however cryptosporidium was not associated with assessments of surface water influence in our study wells stokdyk et al 2019 inclusion of nonviral pathogens is therefore important for characterizing groundwater related health risk the fecal markers hf183 and pmmov were among the most frequently detected organisms in our study wells but their significance is difficult to assess because context for their incidence concentrations and association with pathogens in groundwater is scarce two studies reported incidence of hf183 in groundwater allevi et al 2013 murphy et al 2020 and reports of pmmov in wells are limited malla et al 2019 murphy et al 2020 symonds et al 2018 moreover pathogens were rarely measured in conjunction with hf183 or pmmov in groundwater murphy et al 2020 symonds et al 2018 while hf183 and pmmov suggest fecal contamination of these public wells the implications for well management and public health are unclear 4 2 contamination by system type geology precipitation and study phase despite potential differences in fecal sources contaminant transport factors and water system characteristics we observed generally similar proportions of pathogens and fecal markers among community and noncommunity wells noncommunity wells were however pathogen positive at a slightly higher rate which is of special concern because the majority in minnesota 98 and the united states 80 distribute nondisinfected water minnesota department of health drinking water information system database usepa 2006c noncommunity systems are linked to a large proportion of waterborne disease outbreaks and report high rates of total coliform positive samples compared to community systems craun et al 2010 wallender et al 2014 usepa 2006c however the elevated risk apparently associated with noncommunity groundwater systems is poorly defined most groundwater outbreaks in noncommunity systems have undetermined etiology craun et al 2010 usepa 2006c wallender et al 2014 and total coliforms provide a limited characterization of water quality using qpcr we observed a broad range of microbiological contaminants in both noncommunity and community wells geology is among the factors related to microbiological contamination of groundwater murphy et al 2017 and studies report groundwater vulnerability based on aquifer type allen et al 2017 hynds et al 2014 however a high percentage of wells 89 100 in all five major aquifer types in minnesota showed microbiological contamination and differences among aquifer types appeared minor when viruses bacteria and protozoa were considered as groups table 4 likewise geologic sensitivity table 5 which reflects the travel time for contaminants from the surface to reach groundwater did not appear to follow microbiological contamination comparisons among aquifer type are tentative because three of five types had relatively few wells rainfall influences groundwater contamination murphy et al 2017 because it is a driver of microbial transport allen et al 2017 bradbury et al 2013 and its low ionic strength facilitates microbe detachment from sediment particles hunt and johnson 2017 precipitation during both study phases exceeded minnesota s historical average annual and included the wettest month on record noaa 2019 so elevated precipitation may have contributed to the widespread contamination of study wells to the extent that precipitation was a factor contamination associated with above average rainfall may become less anomalous as the trend of increasing precipitation in minnesota is expected to continue runkle et al 2017 the proportion of samples positive for a genetic target was larger for phase two than phase one which may reflect the targeted selection of vulnerable wells for phase two however well selection is confounded by temporal variation in factors related to microbial source and transport like precipitation and pathogen prevalence in host populations in fact the 29 wells sampled in both phases were also more often positive in phase two than one suggesting that variation over time rather than well selection contributed to differences between study phases 4 3 microbial indicators of pathogen presence testing for total coliforms under the revised total coliform rule forms the basis of microbial monitoring for public water systems usepa 2006a and we used pathogen measurements to evaluate its performance as a microbial indicator consistent with fout et al 2017 at the sample level total coliform analysis was a good predictor of pathogen absence but a poor predictor of pathogen presence as demonstrated by high negative predictive value and specificity but poor positive predictive value and sensitivity for example 98 of pathogen negative samples were also negative for total coliforms specificity but 95 of pathogen positive samples lacked the indicator i e 5 sensitivity at the well level the association between coliforms and pathogens was not statistically significant and the performance metrics were ambiguous based on these findings a negative coliform test gives water managers confidence that pathogens were also likely absent at the time of sampling however the well could be pathogen contaminated later which is particularly problematic for small public water systems required to test their wells only once per year better indicators of pathogen presence are continually sought to address the limitations of conventional ones human associated bacteroides and pmmov are becoming common indicators of human fecal pollution in water harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 but as with other microbial indicators their association with pathogens and health risk is a source of uncertainty boehm et al 2015 harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 our assessment demonstrated that hf183 and pmmov performed similar to total coliforms table 3 and other indicators fout et al 2017 the sample level sensitivity of hf183 57 appears to suggest a better relationship with pathogens however its low positive predictive value 26 is consistent with other indicators while its specificity 61 is much worse showing that its elevated sensitivity is driven by ubiquitous incidence rather than a stronger association with pathogens compared to sample level performance well level sensitivity and positive predictive value increased at the expense of specificity and negative predictive value for all indicators which is consistent with trends described by fout et al 2017 evaluation of indicator performance by pathogen detection ratios showed that ratios for hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and total coliform were significantly greater than 1 0 the null value at the sample level samples were 1 7 1 9 times more likely to have a pathogen when these indicators were detected however only 26 36 of samples positive for these indicators were positive for a pathogen i e positive predictive value so the false positive rate was high pathogen risk ratios were not significantly greater than 1 0 for well level analyses signifying that indicator positive and indicator negative wells had similar risks of being positive for a pathogen viral and bacterial indicators may more closely represent the transport and survival of viral and bacterial pathogens respectively e g korajkic et al 2018 however the evaluation of indicators relative to viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens showed that hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and pmmov were not better indicators of their analogous pathogens than of other pathogen types table s9 instead the trends we observed in indicator performance were generally consistent across indicators and pathogen types only one groundwater study reports the incidence of hf183 with pathogens murphy et al 2020 and the performance of pmmov as an indicator varied among the few studies in which it was paired with pathogen measurements symonds et al 2018 we report the first robust assessment of hf183 and pmmov performance as indicators in groundwater and demonstrate that like other indicators fout et al 2017 they reliably identify pathogen absence but not presence 4 4 qpcr microbial indicators and associated health risk health risks associated with hf183 and other fecal markers in recreational water have been estimated by assuming the measured concentration ratio between pathogens and indicators in sewage is identical to the ratio in water ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2015 2018 for example if the average concentration of hf183 in sewage is ten times that of cryptosporidium then the unmeasured cryptosporidium concentration in recreational water is assumed to be one tenth of that measured for hf183 health risk is then estimated by quantitative microbial risk assessment using the extrapolated cryptosporidium concentration improvements to the ratio approach for estimating health risk from indicators account for the differential decay of indicators and pathogens in the environment boehm et al 2018 underscoring that sewage ratios may not represent ratios in the environment i e where exposure occurs which a recent review demonstrates korajkic et al 2018 in our study the pathogen indicator concentrations measured in public water system wells suggest even more caution is warranted in extending the pathogen indicator ratios in sewage to estimate the health risk of indicator concentrations measured in groundwater for example mean pathogen indicator ratios for cryptosporidium and hadv 40 41 relative to hf183 in raw sewage were 5 10 5 and 5 10 4 respectively and were used to estimate exposure to these pathogens in recreational water ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2018 see supplemental material for ratio calculations in contrast mean ratios for our groundwater samples were approximately 10 000 times higher 0 32 oocysts hf183 based on ifa analysis for cryptosporidium and 8 8 hadv 40 41 hf183 based on samples identified as hadv 41 by genotyping moreover our mean ratios include hf183 positive samples that were negative for these pathogens i e ratio 0 and ratios varied significantly among samples coefficient of variation 1000 we cannot estimate the health risk associated with hf183 in groundwater by extrapolation of sewage based ratios because they do not accurately reflect exposure to groundwater borne pathogens our data suggest that these microbial indicators are useful for identifying groundwater contamination in general though not necessarily pathogen presence or health risk while the health risk indicated by hf183 and pmmov is uncertain the detection of pathogens in public wells represents a potential health concern to generally estimate the potential risk associated with pathogen detections in our wells we compared our results to the relationship established by borchardt et al 2012 for exposure to viruses in non disinfected tap water supplied by public wells in the communities studied by borchardt et al 2012 the relative risk of acute gastrointestinal illness among adults and children increased 23 when the maximum concentration of viruses measured in the communities tap water exceeded 31 gene copies l 1 nonviral pathogens were not considered and if present would have likely increased risk further ten of our study wells had maximum virus concentrations greater than 31 gene copies l 1 and water supplied by all ten wells was not disinfected suggesting the populations served had higher relative risk of illness however none of these ten wells had indications of increased risk based on hf183 or pmmov for example the number of hf183 and pmmov positive samples for these wells was similar to other wells and the mean concentration of samples positive for hf183 1 2 gene copies l 1 and pmmov 7 9 gene copies l 1 in these wells was not exceptional compared to samples overall table 1 in addition to crudely estimating risk this cursory comparison is consistent with the low positive predictive values of hf183 and pmmov and shows the advantage of pathogen testing by qpcr 4 5 pathogen analysis by qpcr culture and ifa to provide additional context for qpcr data we analyzed five pathogens by culture or ifa samples were positive by culture or ifa across the range of qpcr concentrations for three of them adenovirus giardia cryptosporidium and giardia and cryptosporidium concentrations measured by ifa correlated well with qpcr concentrations fig 2 stokdyk et al 2019 however samples for all five of these organisms were less often culture or ifa positive at low qpcr measured concentrations table s10 consistent with our results previous studies comparing measurements by qpcr and other methods of the same environmental water samples show that qpcr is more analytically sensitive borchardt et al 2012 corsi et al 2016 stokdyk et al 2019 our data do not allow us to differentiate the effects of false negatives due to viable but not culturable organisms and qpcr detection of nonviable genetic material nonetheless the comparison shows concordance among methods and offers context for interpreting molecular data including for dose response relationships in quantitative microbial risk assessments 4 6 qpcr in regulatory settings we observed widespread transient contamination of wells by diverse microorganisms as well as disparities between pathogen and indicator detections which illustrate challenges that groundwater regulators face with advantages over microbial indicators and other detection methods qpcr pathogen analysis is a tool for addressing these challenges however current groundwater regulations in the united states lack a framework enabling regulators to readily apply such data and the use of pathogen measurements by qpcr is often opposed or dismissed e g allen et al 2000 edberg et al 2000 stelma and wymer 2012 despite the challenges with applying qpcr technology and pathogen specific measurements to groundwater management both are increasingly incorporated into federal regulation pathogen specific criteria are defined in long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule usepa 2006b and qpcr is included in the recreational water quality criteria usepa 2012a the unregulated contaminant monitoring regulation usepa 2012b and usepa methods 1615 fout et al 2012 and 1696 usepa 2019 more generally studies that report the incidence of specific pathogens are used to inform regulatory development e g usepa 2006c with growing ease of application to water testing qpcr offers a tool for groundwater research and management however with few studies linking qpcr measured concentrations to health risk regulators presented with pcr data for their public water systems will continue to find interpretation challenging 5 conclusions we completed a large systematic study of microbiological contamination of a state s groundwater resources with repeated sampling of public wells we observed widespread but sporadic fecal contamination using a comprehensive suite of pathogens and fecal markers and there were no obvious differences in contamination by system type or geology hf183 bacteroides was detected frequently but we cannot directly assess health risk from the hf183 data however we report the first assessment of its performance as an indicator of pathogen presence in groundwater and show that it performed similar to other microbial indicators analysis of many microorganisms by qpcr provided a comprehensive characterization of microbiological groundwater quality but interpretation and application of such data remain a challenge for regulators because the analytical capability has outpaced

17898,drinking water supply wells can be contaminated by a broad range of waterborne pathogens however groundwater assessments frequently measure microbial indicators or a single pathogen type which provides a limited characterization of potential health risk this study assessed contamination of wells by testing for viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens and fecal markers wells supplying groundwater to community and noncommunity public water systems in minnesota usa n 145 were sampled every other month over one or two years and tested using 23 qpcr assays eighteen genetic targets were detected at least once and microbiological contamination was widespread 96 of 145 wells 58 of 964 samples the sewage associated microbial indicators hf183 and pepper mild mottle virus were detected frequently human or zoonotic pathogens were detected in 70 of wells and 21 of samples by qpcr with salmonella and cryptosporidium detected more often than viruses samples positive by qpcr for adenovirus hadv enterovirus or salmonella were analyzed by culture and for genotype or serotype qpcr positive giardia and cryptosporidium samples were analyzed by immunofluorescent assay ifa and ifa and qpcr concentrations were correlated comparisons of indicator and pathogen occurrence at the time of sampling showed that total coliforms hf183 and bacteroidales like humm2 had high specificity and negative predictive values but generally low sensitivity and positive predictive values pathogen hf183 ratios in sewage have been used to estimate health risks from hf183 concentrations in surface water but in our groundwater samples cryptosporidium oocyst hf183 and hadv hf183 ratios were approximately 10 000 times higher than ratios reported for sewage qpcr measurements provided a robust characterization of microbiological water quality but interpretation of qpcr data in a regulatory context is challenging because few studies link qpcr measurements to health risk graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater pathogens hf183 b acteroides pepper mild mottle virus microbial indicators pathogen indicator ratios 1 introduction public water systems regulated under the united states environmental protection agency s usepa ground water rule are monitored by analysis of total coliforms following the revised total coliform rule usepa 2006a the strong association between total coliform absence and enteric pathogenic virus absence provides a reasonable assurance that health risk is low when total coliform tests are consistently negative fout et al 2017 when total coliform is detected follow up tests aim to identify the sanitary defect causing contamination usepa 2013 however the implications of total coliform positive samples are ambiguous in terms of pathogen presence fout et al 2017 though practical within the find and fix approach of the revised total coliform rule total coliform analysis provides a limited characterization of groundwater quality in terms of the presence and types of pathogens that threaten public health the body of scientific literature demonstrates groundwater vulnerability to various pathogens hynds et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 but many studies have focused on human enteric viruses leaving nonviral groundwater pathogens relatively understudied hynds et al 2014 reported that 54 of pathogen records for studies conducted in the usa included viruses while only 20 and 15 included bacterial and protozoan pathogens respectively likewise murphy et al 2017 identified 56 virus occurrence studies worldwide compared to 26 studies that included bacterial pathogens and 10 studies that included protozoan pathogens while less frequently measured in groundwater bacteria and protozoa represent a public health concern craun et al 2010 for example escherichia coli o157 h7 and campylobacter jejuni caused groundwater borne outbreaks in canada new zealand and nebraska bartholomew et al 2014 o connor 2002 pedati et al 2019 understanding the range of pathogens capable of contaminating groundwater is important for assessing risk murphy et al 2017 pathogen presence is of special concern for the 80 of noncommunity public water systems in the united states that distribute nondisinfected water usepa 2006c but studies more commonly focus on municipal or community wells hynds et al 2014 noncommunity public water systems which are systems that provide water to locations outside consumers residences e g schools restaurants are subject to less stringent monitoring than community systems and have more exemptions available usepa 2006a 2013 for example the revised total coliform rule requires noncommunity groundwater systems serving 1 000 or fewer people to sample less frequently than similarly sized community systems usepa 2013 though noncommunity systems may serve a small or changing population they are an important potential exposure route to groundwater borne pathogens for example noncommunity groundwater systems in the united states are associated with many outbreaks craun et al 2010 wallender et al 2014 moreover the etiological agent is unknown for a large proportion of these outbreaks craun et al 2010 wallender et al 2014 assessments of groundwater quality that identify pathogens can inform strategies that reduce contamination or exposure craun et al 2006 quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr provides a means to efficiently test for pathogens but the fundamental approach of detecting genetic material rather than living organisms remains a stumbling block to its use and interpretation e g stelma and wymer 2012 relationships between molecular data and illness demonstrate the importance and relevance of qpcr measurements for example teunis et al 2008 developed a relationship between qpcr measurements and probability of norovirus infection using experimental data and thebault et al 2013 linked qpcr measurements to infection and illness using observational data from foodborne norovirus outbreaks likewise studies underlying the recreational water quality criteria established a relationship between qpcr measurements of enterococci and illness usepa 2012a and an epidemiological study of public water systems linked qpcr virus measurements to acute gastrointestinal illness borchardt et al 2012 analysis of groundwater by qpcr is therefore an effective way to characterize risk and assess the microbiological quality of public water the primary objective of this study was to assess microbiological contamination of public water supply wells in minnesota usa community and noncommunity wells across the state were repeatedly sampled over one or two years and tested for viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens using qpcr we used pathogen data to assess the performance of conventional and emerging microbial indicators and we examined groundwater contamination relative to geology and system type finally we compared qpcr measurements to results from other microbiological detection methods 2 methods 2 1 study area and public water systems minnesota is located in north central usa and has a population of 5 6 million climate is continental with statewide average annual

department of health minnesota drinking water information system database 2 2 study well descriptions well depth ranged from 6 to 192 m and age casing length and open interval length varied table s1 fifty seven percent of the study wells draw from quaternary glacial sand and gravel deposits other aquifers include sandstone fractured crystalline rock carbonate rock and mixed sandstone carbonate rocks and shale table s2 geologic sensitivity represents estimates for the vertical time of travel for water or contaminants from the land surface to reach the aquifer and the estimates are based on the permeability and thickness of the overlying material geologic sensitivity project workgroup 1991 for example aquifers that lack low permeability cover have geologic sensitivity ratings of very high or high while those protected by clay or shale rich sediments have geologic sensitivity ratings of low or very low the distribution of study wells was similar to wells statewide in terms of geologic sensitivity and aquifer type table s2 2 3 study design and well selection one hundred forty five wells in minnesota usa were sampled every other month for one of two study phases typically six samples per well table s3 wells n 89 for the first phase may 2014 through april 2015 were randomly selected from among the nondisinfecting year round community and nontransient noncommunity systems in minnesota for the second phase may 2015 through may 2016 wells n 85 were selected without regard to disinfection status and those potentially vulnerable to contamination based on geologic setting well construction and past monitoring were prioritized including 29 wells from phase one typically sampled six times per phase for a total of 12 the two phase selection process produced a sample of wells that represented the aquifers and geology of wells statewide table s2 overall 88 community wells and 57 noncommunity wells from 123 public water systems were sampled fig 1 2 4 sample collection samples for pathogens and fecal markers n 964 were collected by dead end ultrafiltration smith and hill 2009 using hemodialyzer rexeed 25s filters asahi kasei medical mt corp oita japan

developed by the us centers for disease control and prevention swaminathan et al 2001 salmonella culture serotyping and molecular subtyping are further described in supplementary material 2 8 direct immunofluorescent assay ifa for giardia and cryptosporidium samples positive by qpcr for giardia or cryptosporidium were microscopically examined for cysts and oocysts by ifa secondary concentrate 100 μl was treated with the merifluor cryptosporidium giardia detection kit meridian biosciences inc cincinnati oh as described in stokdyk et al 2019 thirty randomly selected qpcr negative samples were also analyzed by ifa 2 9 comparison of qpcr and ifa for cryptosporidium and giardia linear regressions of ifa and qpcr concentrations for giardia were completed using microsoft excel 2016 two giardia detections lacked concentrations due to unknown sample volume and were therefore excluded from the regressions so 18 samples were included separate regressions were completed using only those samples positive by both methods n 12 linear regressions of ifa and qpcr concentrations for cryptosporidium are reported in stokdyk et al 2019 2 10 total coliform and e coli analysis samples for total coliform and e coli were analyzed within 30 h of sample collection following standard method 9223 rice et al 2012 2 11 microbial indicator performance sensitivity specificity and positive and negative predictive value were derived from logistic regression models for the hf183 bacr287 assay for human bacteroides hereafter hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and total coliforms relative to pathogen detections on a sample level and well level following fout et al 2017 for the sample level analyses mixed logistic regression models with random intercepts for well and a spatial correlation structure for the samples within a well were fit to address the non independent nature of the data chavance and escolano 2016 morel et al 2003 for the well level analyses the data were considered independent population averaged logistic regression models were fit with adjustment for number of times the well was sampled categorized as 1 5 6 or 7 12 times since this could affect the corresponding probability of pathogen detection for the well because no wells sampled 7 12 times were negative for hf183 the adjustment for hf183 combined wells sampled 7 12 times with wells sampled 6 times the strength of the indicator pathogen association was also quantified by calculating the pathogen detection ratio positive predictive value 1 negative predictive value the pathogen detection ratio is identical to the risk ratio calculated in fout et al 2017 where values greater than 1 0 the null represent the relative elevation in the pathogen detection rate if the indicator is detected versus when the indicator is not detected for example a pathogen detection ratio of 1 5 indicates that detection of a pathogen was 50 more likely when the indicator was detected compared to when the indicator was not detected indicator performance was assessed for any human or zoonotic pathogen detection and the taxonomic subgroups therein viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens analyses were performed using sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc 3 results 3 1 qpcr overall 18 of the 23 qpcr genetic targets were detected in one or more samples table 1 and 558 samples 58 were positive for at least one genetic target 230 samples were positive for multiple genetic targets adenovirus group b hepatitis a virus norovirus genogroup i enteropathogenic e coli and shiga toxin 1 producing bacteria were not detected hf183 was detected most frequently table 1 and often alone 23 of samples bacteria other than hf183 were detected in 18 of samples more frequently than protozoa and viruses human or zoonotic pathogens all pathogens listed in table 1 excluding bovine polyomavirus were detected in 207 samples 21 viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens were detected in 55 6 62 6 and 121 13 samples respectively thirty nine samples 4 were positive for multiple pathogens concentrations were generally low but eight genetic targets including six pathogens had a maximum concentration greater than 100 gene copies l 1 table 1 wells were typically sampled six times each range 1 12 see table s3 of the 139 wells positive for a genetic target table 2 most n 121 had more than one positive sample table s7 while hf183 was the only genetic target in many samples most wells positive for hf183 all but six were positive for another genetic target during the study human or zoonotic pathogens were detected in 102 wells 70 including 46 32 50 34 and 59 41 wells with viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens respectively an examination of detections by well depth showed no apparent trends table s8 genetic targets were detected in 98 of wells from community systems and 93 of wells from noncommunity systems the 29 wells included in both study phases were sampled 7 12 times each and 192 of the 333 samples from these wells were positive for one or more genetic targets all 29 of these wells had two or more samples positive for a genetic target individual targets were detected in these 29 wells at frequencies similar to the overall results reported in table 1 more samples were positive from these 29 wells in phase 2 n 120 positive samples than phase 1 n 72 samples collected in phase two of the study were positive for one or more genetic targets at a higher rate than samples collected in phase one 75 and 41 respectively largely driven by the bacteria hf183 66 and 23 positive respectively the proportion of wells positive for phase two 100 was greater than for phase one 91 and the difference was driven primarily by hf183 100 and 80 positive respectively genetic targets specific to human fecal waste were detected in 47 of samples and 94 of wells and included hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and the human viruses adenovirus enterovirus polyomavirus and norovirus gii genetic targets specific to ruminant bovine fecal waste including ruminant bacteroides bacteroidales like cow m3 and bovine polyomavirus were detected in 6 of samples and 34 of wells human specific fecal microbes were detected in 95 of community wells and 91 of noncommunity wells ruminant bovine specific microbes were detected in 33 of community wells and 35 of noncommunity wells eighty three percent of wells in phase one and 100 of wells in phase two were positive for human specific microbes while 30 of wells in phase one and 32 of wells in phase two were positive for bovine ruminant specific microbes 3 2 virus cultures and genotyping human adenovirus culture was attempted with the 24 samples positive for hadv by qpcr one cultured sample exhibited cytopathic effect and five samples were positive by icc qpcr sequencing revealed that 17 of the qpcr positive samples were hadv 41 three were hadv 5 three were hadv 31 and one was hadv 6 human enterovirus culture of the nine qpcr positive samples showed all were negative by cytopathic effect and icc qpcr genotyping was successful for six of the nine enterovirus samples three were coxsackievirus a6 one each was coxsackievirus b5 echovirus 18 and echovirus 30 3 3 salmonella cultures and subtyping of the 59 samples positive for salmonella by qpcr seven were positive on both xld and bga with an additional four positive on xld agar alone of the 11 culture positive samples subtyping identified ten that were serovar typhimurium and one serovar montevideo 3 4 giardia and cryptosporidium immunofluorescent assay fourteen of 20 samples positive for giardia by qpcr were positive by ifa at concentrations from 1 to 3 7 cysts l 1 two detections were qualitative due to missing sample volume all seven samples with qpcr concentrations 0 7 gene copies l 1 were positive by ifa while only 5 of 11 below that level were positive by ifa regression revealed a significant relationship between the methods r2 0 94 and a ratio of 4 5 gene copies cyst based on the slope though the regression included only 18 samples over a limited range fig 2 regression restricted to samples positive by both methods n 12 produced similar results r2 0 93 slope 4 6 sixty seven of 107 samples positive for cryptosporidium by qpcr were positive by ifa with consistent ifa detections at qpcr concentrations 0 7 gene copies l 1 results for cryptosporidium including qpcr ifa regression and species identification and subtyping are described in stokdyk et al 2019 thirty of 30 randomly selected qpcr negative samples were negative by ifa for cryptosporidium and giardia 3 5 indicator performance total coliforms were detected in 53 of 925 samples and 36 of 145 wells hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and pmmov were detected in 133 57 and 40 wells respectively all wells positive for bacteroidales like humm2 or pmmov were also positive for hf183 sample level detection frequencies are reported in table 1 57 and 30 samples positive for bacteroidales like humm2 and pmmov respectively were also hf183 positive metrics for indicator performance relative to any human or zoonotic pathogen are reported in table 3 pathogen indicator associations at the sample level were significantly elevated for hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and coliforms but at the well level these associations were not significantly elevated for any indicators restricting the assessment to viral bacterial or protozoan pathogens resulted in the same overall trend as observed for the all pathogens analysis table s9 e coli was detected in three samples and performance metrics were not calculated 4 discussion 4 1 incidence of pathogens and microbial indicators we completed a large systematic study of community and noncommunity public wells n 145 across the geographic extent of minnesota usa study wells represented diverse geologies and the two year sampling campaign encompassed meteorological conditions of all four seasons whereas previous groundwater studies typically focused on microbial indicators or a single class of pathogens we included viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens and fecal markers we observed widespread groundwater contamination 96 of wells and 58 of samples by a broad range of microorganisms pathogens were detected in our study more frequently than studies reviewed by hynds et al 2014 which reported 15 of samples and 16 of wells positive but the reviewed studies typically included fewer tested pathogens an average of two to three and fewer samples per well an average of 1 4 we sampled wells typically six times and while 102 wells 70 were positive for human or zoonotic pathogens only 49 wells 34 were pathogen positive more than once likewise of 207 pathogen positive samples only 39 19 were positive for more than one pathogen while contamination was widespread the intermittence of well contamination and variation in pathogens we observed are consistent with the transient nature of groundwater contamination e g bradbury et al 2013 among pathogens bacteria and protozoa are included in groundwater studies less frequently than viruses hynds et al 2014 murphy et al 2017 but salmonella and cryptosporidium were detected more frequently in our wells in fact salmonella and cryptosporidium were detected in 33 and 40 of wells respectively and they were the only pathogens present in 131 of the 207 pathogen positive samples groundwater studies in developed countries rarely include salmonella outside of outbreak investigations levantesi et al 2012 murphy et al 2017 likewise cryptosporidium is not considered a contaminant of groundwater unless surface water is entering wells however cryptosporidium was not associated with assessments of surface water influence in our study wells stokdyk et al 2019 inclusion of nonviral pathogens is therefore important for characterizing groundwater related health risk the fecal markers hf183 and pmmov were among the most frequently detected organisms in our study wells but their significance is difficult to assess because context for their incidence concentrations and association with pathogens in groundwater is scarce two studies reported incidence of hf183 in groundwater allevi et al 2013 murphy et al 2020 and reports of pmmov in wells are limited malla et al 2019 murphy et al 2020 symonds et al 2018 moreover pathogens were rarely measured in conjunction with hf183 or pmmov in groundwater murphy et al 2020 symonds et al 2018 while hf183 and pmmov suggest fecal contamination of these public wells the implications for well management and public health are unclear 4 2 contamination by system type geology precipitation and study phase despite potential differences in fecal sources contaminant transport factors and water system characteristics we observed generally similar proportions of pathogens and fecal markers among community and noncommunity wells noncommunity wells were however pathogen positive at a slightly higher rate which is of special concern because the majority in minnesota 98 and the united states 80 distribute nondisinfected water minnesota department of health drinking water information system database usepa 2006c noncommunity systems are linked to a large proportion of waterborne disease outbreaks and report high rates of total coliform positive samples compared to community systems craun et al 2010 wallender et al 2014 usepa 2006c however the elevated risk apparently associated with noncommunity groundwater systems is poorly defined most groundwater outbreaks in noncommunity systems have undetermined etiology craun et al 2010 usepa 2006c wallender et al 2014 and total coliforms provide a limited characterization of water quality using qpcr we observed a broad range of microbiological contaminants in both noncommunity and community wells geology is among the factors related to microbiological contamination of groundwater murphy et al 2017 and studies report groundwater vulnerability based on aquifer type allen et al 2017 hynds et al 2014 however a high percentage of wells 89 100 in all five major aquifer types in minnesota showed microbiological contamination and differences among aquifer types appeared minor when viruses bacteria and protozoa were considered as groups table 4 likewise geologic sensitivity table 5 which reflects the travel time for contaminants from the surface to reach groundwater did not appear to follow microbiological contamination comparisons among aquifer type are tentative because three of five types had relatively few wells rainfall influences groundwater contamination murphy et al 2017 because it is a driver of microbial transport allen et al 2017 bradbury et al 2013 and its low ionic strength facilitates microbe detachment from sediment particles hunt and johnson 2017 precipitation during both study phases exceeded minnesota s historical average annual and included the wettest month on record noaa 2019 so elevated precipitation may have contributed to the widespread contamination of study wells to the extent that precipitation was a factor contamination associated with above average rainfall may become less anomalous as the trend of increasing precipitation in minnesota is expected to continue runkle et al 2017 the proportion of samples positive for a genetic target was larger for phase two than phase one which may reflect the targeted selection of vulnerable wells for phase two however well selection is confounded by temporal variation in factors related to microbial source and transport like precipitation and pathogen prevalence in host populations in fact the 29 wells sampled in both phases were also more often positive in phase two than one suggesting that variation over time rather than well selection contributed to differences between study phases 4 3 microbial indicators of pathogen presence testing for total coliforms under the revised total coliform rule forms the basis of microbial monitoring for public water systems usepa 2006a and we used pathogen measurements to evaluate its performance as a microbial indicator consistent with fout et al 2017 at the sample level total coliform analysis was a good predictor of pathogen absence but a poor predictor of pathogen presence as demonstrated by high negative predictive value and specificity but poor positive predictive value and sensitivity for example 98 of pathogen negative samples were also negative for total coliforms specificity but 95 of pathogen positive samples lacked the indicator i e 5 sensitivity at the well level the association between coliforms and pathogens was not statistically significant and the performance metrics were ambiguous based on these findings a negative coliform test gives water managers confidence that pathogens were also likely absent at the time of sampling however the well could be pathogen contaminated later which is particularly problematic for small public water systems required to test their wells only once per year better indicators of pathogen presence are continually sought to address the limitations of conventional ones human associated bacteroides and pmmov are becoming common indicators of human fecal pollution in water harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 symonds et al 2018 but as with other microbial indicators their association with pathogens and health risk is a source of uncertainty boehm et al 2015 harwood et al 2014 korajkic et al 2018 our assessment demonstrated that hf183 and pmmov performed similar to total coliforms table 3 and other indicators fout et al 2017 the sample level sensitivity of hf183 57 appears to suggest a better relationship with pathogens however its low positive predictive value 26 is consistent with other indicators while its specificity 61 is much worse showing that its elevated sensitivity is driven by ubiquitous incidence rather than a stronger association with pathogens compared to sample level performance well level sensitivity and positive predictive value increased at the expense of specificity and negative predictive value for all indicators which is consistent with trends described by fout et al 2017 evaluation of indicator performance by pathogen detection ratios showed that ratios for hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and total coliform were significantly greater than 1 0 the null value at the sample level samples were 1 7 1 9 times more likely to have a pathogen when these indicators were detected however only 26 36 of samples positive for these indicators were positive for a pathogen i e positive predictive value so the false positive rate was high pathogen risk ratios were not significantly greater than 1 0 for well level analyses signifying that indicator positive and indicator negative wells had similar risks of being positive for a pathogen viral and bacterial indicators may more closely represent the transport and survival of viral and bacterial pathogens respectively e g korajkic et al 2018 however the evaluation of indicators relative to viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens showed that hf183 bacteroidales like humm2 and pmmov were not better indicators of their analogous pathogens than of other pathogen types table s9 instead the trends we observed in indicator performance were generally consistent across indicators and pathogen types only one groundwater study reports the incidence of hf183 with pathogens murphy et al 2020 and the performance of pmmov as an indicator varied among the few studies in which it was paired with pathogen measurements symonds et al 2018 we report the first robust assessment of hf183 and pmmov performance as indicators in groundwater and demonstrate that like other indicators fout et al 2017 they reliably identify pathogen absence but not presence 4 4 qpcr microbial indicators and associated health risk health risks associated with hf183 and other fecal markers in recreational water have been estimated by assuming the measured concentration ratio between pathogens and indicators in sewage is identical to the ratio in water ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2015 2018 for example if the average concentration of hf183 in sewage is ten times that of cryptosporidium then the unmeasured cryptosporidium concentration in recreational water is assumed to be one tenth of that measured for hf183 health risk is then estimated by quantitative microbial risk assessment using the extrapolated cryptosporidium concentration improvements to the ratio approach for estimating health risk from indicators account for the differential decay of indicators and pathogens in the environment boehm et al 2018 underscoring that sewage ratios may not represent ratios in the environment i e where exposure occurs which a recent review demonstrates korajkic et al 2018 in our study the pathogen indicator concentrations measured in public water system wells suggest even more caution is warranted in extending the pathogen indicator ratios in sewage to estimate the health risk of indicator concentrations measured in groundwater for example mean pathogen indicator ratios for cryptosporidium and hadv 40 41 relative to hf183 in raw sewage were 5 10 5 and 5 10 4 respectively and were used to estimate exposure to these pathogens in recreational water ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2018 see supplemental material for ratio calculations in contrast mean ratios for our groundwater samples were approximately 10 000 times higher 0 32 oocysts hf183 based on ifa analysis for cryptosporidium and 8 8 hadv 40 41 hf183 based on samples identified as hadv 41 by genotyping moreover our mean ratios include hf183 positive samples that were negative for these pathogens i e ratio 0 and ratios varied significantly among samples coefficient of variation 1000 we cannot estimate the health risk associated with hf183 in groundwater by extrapolation of sewage based ratios because they do not accurately reflect exposure to groundwater borne pathogens our data suggest that these microbial indicators are useful for identifying groundwater contamination in general though not necessarily pathogen presence or health risk while the health risk indicated by hf183 and pmmov is uncertain the detection of pathogens in public wells represents a potential health concern to generally estimate the potential risk associated with pathogen detections in our wells we compared our results to the relationship established by borchardt et al 2012 for exposure to viruses in non disinfected tap water supplied by public wells in the communities studied by borchardt et al 2012 the relative risk of acute gastrointestinal illness among adults and children increased 23 when the maximum concentration of viruses measured in the communities tap water exceeded 31 gene copies l 1 nonviral pathogens were not considered and if present would have likely increased risk further ten of our study wells had maximum virus concentrations greater than 31 gene copies l 1 and water supplied by all ten wells was not disinfected suggesting the populations served had higher relative risk of illness however none of these ten wells had indications of increased risk based on hf183 or pmmov for example the number of hf183 and pmmov positive samples for these wells was similar to other wells and the mean concentration of samples positive for hf183 1 2 gene copies l 1 and pmmov 7 9 gene copies l 1 in these wells was not exceptional compared to samples overall table 1 in addition to crudely estimating risk this cursory comparison is consistent with the low positive predictive values of hf183 and pmmov and shows the advantage of pathogen testing by qpcr 4 5 pathogen analysis by qpcr culture and ifa to provide additional context for qpcr data we analyzed five pathogens by culture or ifa samples were positive by culture or ifa across the range of qpcr concentrations for three of them adenovirus giardia cryptosporidium and giardia and cryptosporidium concentrations measured by ifa correlated well with qpcr concentrations fig 2 stokdyk et al 2019 however samples for all five of these organisms were less often culture or ifa positive at low qpcr measured concentrations table s10 consistent with our results previous studies comparing measurements by qpcr and other methods of the same environmental water samples show that qpcr is more analytically sensitive borchardt et al 2012 corsi et al 2016 stokdyk et al 2019 our data do not allow us to differentiate the effects of false negatives due to viable but not culturable organisms and qpcr detection of nonviable genetic material nonetheless the comparison shows concordance among methods and offers context for interpreting molecular data including for dose response relationships in quantitative microbial risk assessments 4 6 qpcr in regulatory settings we observed widespread transient contamination of wells by diverse microorganisms as well as disparities between pathogen and indicator detections which illustrate challenges that groundwater regulators face with advantages over microbial indicators and other detection methods qpcr pathogen analysis is a tool for addressing these challenges however current groundwater regulations in the united states lack a framework enabling regulators to readily apply such data and the use of pathogen measurements by qpcr is often opposed or dismissed e g allen et al 2000 edberg et al 2000 stelma and wymer 2012 despite the challenges with applying qpcr technology and pathogen specific measurements to groundwater management both are increasingly incorporated into federal regulation pathogen specific criteria are defined in long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule usepa 2006b and qpcr is included in the recreational water quality criteria usepa 2012a the unregulated contaminant monitoring regulation usepa 2012b and usepa methods 1615 fout et al 2012 and 1696 usepa 2019 more generally studies that report the incidence of specific pathogens are used to inform regulatory development e g usepa 2006c with growing ease of application to water testing qpcr offers a tool for groundwater research and management however with few studies linking qpcr measured concentrations to health risk regulators presented with pcr data for their public water systems will continue to find interpretation challenging 5 conclusions we completed a large systematic study of microbiological contamination of a state s groundwater resources with repeated sampling of public wells we observed widespread but sporadic fecal contamination using a comprehensive suite of pathogens and fecal markers and there were no obvious differences in contamination by system type or geology hf183 bacteroides was detected frequently but we cannot directly assess health risk from the hf183 data however we report the first assessment of its performance as an indicator of pathogen presence in groundwater and show that it performed similar to other microbial indicators analysis of many microorganisms by qpcr provided a comprehensive characterization of microbiological groundwater quality but interpretation and application of such data remain a challenge for regulators because the analytical capability has outpaced

17899,non target screening of water samples from the nidda river basin in central germany was conducted with the goal to identify previously unknown chemical contaminants and their emission sources the focus was on organic water borne contaminants which were not typical to municipal wastewater grab samples of river water from 13 locations on the nidda and 15 of its tributaries in sum 112 samples were analysed with high resolution lc qtof ms ms to facilitate the identification of substances features originating from the same compound such as adducts and isotopologues as well as in source fragments and species with multiple charge states were registered and grouped by a componentization step utilizing both retention times and peak shapes of the features to combine them in a single component this led to a reduction of the number of features by an average of 1235 per sample 46 these grouped features were prioritized if these were detected only in specific tributaries or specific river sections reducing the number of components by an average of 913 per sample 78 in addition grouped features were labelled as typically found in municipal wastewater by combining data from 16 wastewater treatment plants located across germany and switzerland and comparing this to components detected in the nidda basin these were removed leading to a further reduction of components by an average of 72 per sample 30 for an average total reduction of 2536 per sample 93 finally nine compounds with emission sources in three specific tributaries were identified including the textile additive nylostab s eed which was previously not known to be an environmental contaminant as well as naturally occurring compounds such as highly toxic microcystins graphical abstract image 1 keywords non target screening unknown compounds surface water componentization prioritization lc qtof ms 1 introduction contamination of the aquatic environment with organic micropollutants has become a central environmental challenge the sources of these compounds are diverse but can be attributed in many regions and in many cases to point sources through wastewater treatment plants wwtp singer et al 2016 luo et al 2014 gago ferrero et al 2015 various types of chemical products such as pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals pesticides personal care products household chemicals or biocides enter rivers via treatment plants worldwide matamoros et al 2012 vanderford et al 2006 barber et al 2013 in addition to the original pharmaceuticals their human metabolites have been detected in treated wastewater ibáñez et al 2017 as well as in the aquatic environment writer et al 2013 another class of chemicals that has received increasing attention in recent years are educts and intermediates used in the chemical industry howard and muir 2013 for example pharmaceuticals and their educts were detected in gorjak creek near zagreb by terzic and ahel 2011 schlüsener et al 2015 and brand et al 2018 reported the detection of quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds in the rivers rhine and elbe about 100 000 substances are listed in the european inventory of existing commercial chemical substances echa 2020 although many are potential environmental pollutants only a small proportion of these have been included in environmental monitoring studies and even fewer are part of routine monitoring programs schäfer et al 2011 these compounds can be screened and identified via non target analysis krauss et al 2010 using hplc coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry full scan hrms the m z values of all substances amenable to the applied method are recorded this enables the analysis of environmental samples without defining the analytes to be measured before this is a useful approach for detecting unforeseen organic contaminants furthermore it is possible to archive the acquired data to retrospectively screen historical data for spatial and temporal occurrence of recently identified pollutants alygizakis et al 2018 since a multitude of signals are aquired by full scan hrms analysis a considerable amount of filtering and data processing is required to extract the relevant signals using non target analysis with ionization by electrospray ionization esi in addition to m h adduct ions also signals of adducts such as m na m nh4 m k occur keller et al 2008 in addition isotopologues e g containing 13c or 37cl or species with different charges are detected as individual signals to group the features belonging to a single component the so called componentization is an essential step in many workflows schymanski et al 2014 a component represents the set of all features that originate from the same compound the adduct and isotopologue information provided by this step can also be essential for the subsequent identification of an unknown compound many current methods use known mass differences δm z between the individual adducts or isotopologues a similar retention time and in the case of isotopologues the intensity ratio between features as criteria for componentization pluskal et al 2010 however not all adduct types are known and in source fragmentation of compounds during ionization can lead to many additional features with unpredictable δm z another possible approach for the componentization is based on the similarity of retention time and peak shape used for example by camera kuhl et al 2012 this generic approach of componentization using retention time and peak shape should be able to capture in source fragments and uncommon adducts after this step the design of tailored research hypothethsis adapted to the research question is of central importance to further reduce the large amount of data in non target analysis one possibility for prioritization is the ranking of features taking into account frequency of detection and signal intensity park et al 2018 statistical approaches such as the combination of the f ratio method and apex detection are also used for the prioritization of unique features samanipour et al 2017 several studies include focusing on specific groups of substances such as chlorinated pesticides in food garcia reyes et al 2005 or the investigation of unknown transformation products li et al 2014 2017 there are also approaches to determine specific discharges by the evaluation of the non target data under temporal or spatial aspects by the investigation of influent samples from the wwtp of athens compounds like the industrial chemical n n n n tetrakis 2 hydroxyethyl hexanediamide was prioritized and identified by high variations of their concentration over several samples using the multivariate empirical bayes approach giving a score hotelling t2 coefficient for ranking compounds alygizakis et al 2019 an approach for the evaluation of a spatially resolved sampling at the river saale and mulde was provided by krauss et al 2019 by prioritizing site specific contaminants based on calculated rarity scores in addition the clustering of micropollutants data carpenter and helbling 2018 and the principle component analysis pca are used to prioritize possible contaminants with regard to temporal or spatial trends or based on chemical characteristics lopez doval et al 2017 dabrowski et al 2014 these studies have reported strategies to identify unknown contaminants using extensive temporal data evaluation or located sources of previously unknown compounds using spatially resolved sampling strategies as reported in the literature many statistical prioritization approaches rely on very large sample sets which are not always available krauss et al 2019 however instead of the proposed scoring approach grouping and comparing the spatial distribution of components within a river basin might provide a different prioritization focusing in particular on localized sources in addition to examining spatial variation of intensities to prioritize features further strategies can be envisaged to de prioritize features one option could be to look at municipal wastewater since this contains many contaminants whose occurrence in the aquatic environment is already well documented gomez et al 2010 kolpin et al 2002 features also ubiquitously detected in municipal wastewater could be labelled as such procedures and de prioritized bobeldijk et al 2001 the goal of this study was to combine the prioritization by grouping and comparing the spatial distribution of components and the de prioritization of components ubiquitously detected in municipal wastewater these steps were applied in a non target workflow for the identification of unknown organic water borne compounds with localized emission sources within a single river

the sampling took place on 4 days over a 10 day period due to the size of the area and sampling point distribution it was impossible to stagger the sampling points such as to account for all residence times between sampling points the samples were filtered 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose spartan whatman usa transported and stored at 4 c and measured by direct injection within 48 h after sampling for the collection and storage of samples and blanks polypropylene bottles were used for the labelling of wastewater typical compounds 42 daily composite samples were used from the effluents of 16 municipal wwtps in germany and switzerland from these wwtps nine are located in the nidda river basin itself fig 1 bad vilbel was not included this high number of samples from different wwtps

about sampling sites wwtps sampling and characteristics are described in the supplementary data table s2 s3 2 2 2 data acquisition for data acquisition a system was used consisting of a hplc 1260 agilent waldbronn germany connected to a tripletof 6600 hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtofms ms sciex darmstadt germany ionization was achieved in positive mode via an esi source

at a flow of 300 μl min the sample was transferred by direct injection of 100 μl and the channel was automatically rinsed after each measurement in addition ultrapure water was injected after every 5th sample the solvents ultrapure water with 0 1 v v formic acid phase a and acetonitrile with 0 1 v v formic acid phase b were used with the following gradient percent for acetonitrile from 0 to 1 min 2 2 min 20 16 5 22 min 100 22 1 min 2 27 min 2 before 2 min and after 20 min the eluent was diverted to the waste to protect the instrument the acquisition of full scan experiments ranged from 100 to 1200 da via information dependent acquisition ida ms2 spectra of the eight most intense peaks were made with a collision energy ce set with potential 40 v and a collision energy spread ces set with potential 15 v the acquisition time of the full scan and the ida experiments were 150 ms and 30 ms respectively resulting in a cycle time of 440 ms a reduction of false positives was achieved by measuring examined samples as triplicates analogous to nürenberg et al 2015 more information on the parameters used can be found in schlüsener et al 2015 the instrument control software analyst tf 1 7 was used for data acquisition based on the described lc ms method parameters subsequently the measured data were transferred from the sciex format wiff to the open data format mzxml with proteowizard 3 0 kessner et al 2008 in order to be able to perform all the following steps of the workflow in r 3 5 0 r core team 2018 fig 2 this conversion leads to a significant change in the scale of the signal intensity approximately 14 000 in wiff to 10 in mzxml an assessment of the data acquisition and processing workflow is provided in the supplementary data table s4 2 3 data pre processing 2 3 1 peak picking the peak picking was performed by an algorithm written in r the eics were extracted with the r package xcms smith et al 2006 in consecutive bins of 20 mda and the maxima of intensities determined by the zero values in the first derivative the noise level was determined separately for each peak and was calculated in a range of ten times the peak width before and after the individual peak a detailed description of the peak picking algorithm can be found in dietrich et al the parameters used were min intensity counts 10 s n 3 peak width s 5 to 60 in addition to m z retention time and intensity the retention time of the two points at half peak intensity full width at half maximum were determined and used for the componentization step section 2 3 3 the m z the retention time t r intensity and when acquired an ms2 spectrum were combined to a consolidated data point referred to as a feature to provide a clear distinction from chromatographic or mass spectrometric peaks the peak picking resulted in a list of features for each sample 2 3 2 removing false positives false positives were reduced by only keeping those features which were found in all three replicate injections of a sample with a maximum deviation of m z of 5 ppm or max 5 mda and δt r of 3 s if more than one feature matched during this step those features showing the least difference in intensity were considered as matching to prevent split peaks or incorrectly picked peaks from remaining in the data 2 3 3 componentization by componentization adducts isotopologues in source fragments and features of different charge states of a compound are grouped to one component this was carried out under the condition of similar retention time and peak shape between features i e the extracted eics within a component should be identical in their retention time at the apex and at half intensity fig 3 exceptions might be weak signals with an intensity close to the noise level which might have a smaller peak width an algorithm written in r calculates this similarity using the retention time of the peak at the apex at the two points at half maximum intensity ½ intensity left ½ intensity right and the sum of the deviation of these three retention times the algorithm starts from the most intense entry of the feature list and other features are determined that can be linked to this feature to form a component this is achieved by comparing the two features the most intense and the candidate regarding the four mentioned values and matching the deviation against predefined tolerances if the deviations of the four values are within the tolerance the features are considered to belong together and are assigned to the same component until the end of the feature list the process is repeated with the next most intense ungrouped feature suitable tolerances for the similarity calculation using the three retention time points were determined for the chromatographic method used in this study an analyte mix of 30 substances was screened consisting of pharmaceuticals metabolites industrial chemicals and pesticides featuring a range of different retention times from 4 6 to 14 8 min table s5 substances were measured once in purified water 10 μg l and once spiked to a surface water sample 1 μg l rhine near koblenz to simulate real conditions for optimization steps the data was processed and isotopologues and adducts such as m na m nh4 and m k were determined manually by the mass and retention time differences intensity ratios and peak shape of the features based on the annotated features thresholds for t r at the apex ½ intensity left and ½ intensity right were determined which provided the best ratio of false positives and false negatives the false positives represent features incorrectly grouped into a component while the false negatives are expected but missing features in a component the obtained tolerances for retention time differences δt r between peaks were δt r ½ intensity left 0 5 s δt r ½ intensity right 1 s and δt r apex 1 5 s the higher value for δt r ½ intensity right could be explained by frequently occurring minor tailing fig 3 the forth threshold for the sum of all three values was set to δt r sum 2 5 s by optimizing the four thresholds the false positive and false negative ratios the ratio of incorrect componentized features to the total of all componentized features for the 30 reference standards was 10 and 6 respectively table s6 for a defined set of 30 compounds both values can be different because a misgrouping does not automatically fulfill both conditions for a complete feature list both values should be equal the determined tolerances were used for the componentization of sample data table 1 shows an example of the grouping of nine detected features into one component 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid compare table 2 during the identification stage these grouped features were annotated based on the mass differences and intensity ratios table s7 for further processing components in the samples not in the blanks which consist of only one feature were excluded 2 3 4 blank correction for blank correction three samples of ultra pure water treated in the same way as environmental samples both in preparation and storage were used as system blanks prior to blank correction all sample data were aligned with the three blanks to link the same features across the different lists the alignment parameters were m z tolerance 5 ppm t r tolerance 3 s an algorithm in r was used to take the first non aligned feature of the first sample and examine all other samples for features which fulfil the alignment parameters defined of all these candidate features the most intense one was chosen and subsequently the first step was repeated using this feature as a starting point since it is assumed that the most intense feature most accurately represents the correct m z and t r the final results were recorded in a separate alignment table the algorithm was continued until all features were added to the alignment table it was then determined which features were detected in the samples as well as in any of the three blanks the maximum intensity of the blanks was taken into account however features with much lower intensity in the blanks were not removed an intensity threshold had to be chosen above which the feature was considered to be authentic i e different from the background based on the observed maximum difference of intensities of blank features between samples a maximum of factor four a conservative value of factor 10 was chosen meaning that the intensity of the sample feature should be at least ten times the intensity of the most intense feature in the blank to be further considered in addition for each sample it was determined whether features also detected in the blank were the most intense features in their respective components in the samples if this was true the entire component in the sample was removed this step addresses the issue that some features in the blank are lower in their intensity than in samples and therefore complementary signals such as adducts and isotopologues may be below the applied intensity threshold and would remain in the sample data as orphans if only individual features are removed table s8 2 4 prioritizing 2 4 1 prioritization of compounds with the goal of examining spatial variation of intensities for prioritizing non target features it was decided to prioritize compounds i e components which can be detected specifically in a certain river section such as a tributary or the upper part of the nidda n1 n3 grouping and comparing the spatial distribution of components was chosen for prioritization for this purpose a script was written which first aligns the data under consideration of the temporal sampling and further carries out the spatial prioritization to obtain a temporal scope over the 10 day sampling period the components from four grab samples previously filtered by the removal of false positives and blanks from each sampling site were combined the corresponding samples were aligned m z tolerance 5 ppm max 5 mda t r tolerance 3 s to determine the most intense component of the four samples which was transferred to a new list to prioritize spatially specific components the combined list from the first step was aligned m z tolerance 5 ppm max 5 mda tr tolerance 3 s with all samples defined as upstream samples table s9 upstream includes a all samples of the nidda upstream the confluence of the considered tributary and b in the case of tributaries with multiple sampling sites all samples upstream of the considered sampling site in contrast to the previous alignment step for blank correction the starting point of comparison is not given by the most intense component but always by the sample under consideration which is compared with the upstream samples using this results table components in the considered sample with an intensity at least four times higher than in all upstream samples were determined and prioritized components not fulfilling these conditions were removed from the sample under consideration for example components in the list of sample u3 were prioritized if they were not found or found with intensity at least four times lower in u1 u2 and the nidda samples n1 to n5 fig 1 marked area 2 4 2 prioritization of compounds not ubiquitously found in municipal wastewater to further facilitate the extraction of non municipal micropollutants a so called wwtp filter step was included where compounds found commonly in wwtp effluents were removed from consideration for this purpose 42 effluent samples of 16 wwtps were analysed with the workflow described above and the frequency of detection of all components was determined section 2 2 1 an occurrence of at least 80 34 out of 42 samples was set as a limit to classify components as common for wastewater if this condition applied the entire component was included into a new feature list used for comparison to the sample feature lists 2 5 identification the 20 most intense prioritized components per river section were selected for manual identification and the m h features were determined by using the mass differences of adducts and isotopologues within the component in addition the intensity ratios of the features within the investigated component were used to identify the presence of chlorine bromine or sulfur in the compound the identification procedure was based on the use of the in silico fragmentation tool metfrag similar to the procedures outlined in schymanski et al 2014 and gago ferrero et al 2015 with the monoisotopic mass and the ms and ms2 spectra metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 was used to search matching substances in the database tool for ident letzel et al 2016 and pubchem kim et al 2015 as a first step the monoisotopic mass with a tolerance of 5 ppm was used for searching in the databases mentioned all substances were filtered by matching them with the isotopic pattern subsequently the measured ms2 spectra were compared with theoretical in silico fragmentations of the database compounds with a maximum deviation of 5 ppm and 2 mda the agreement of the compared spectra was given by the metfrag matching factor between 0 and 1 and all candidate substances were sorted in this way finally the plausibility of the calculated in silico fragmentation was assessed and the availability of the candidate substances at various vendors was taken into account if available comparative ms2 spectra of the mzcloud database raab et al 2016 were considered for the final confirmation the candidate compounds were ordered as reference standards measured with the same acquisition method and confirmed by comparing the sample data with the reference data to estimate the environmental concentrations the substances were semi quantified one point calibration using the reference standard 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the componentization for componentization a generic method was used based on retention time and peak shape similarity instead of a typical method based on selected mass differences and retention time similarity pluskal et al 2010 similar to approaches such as camera kuhl et al 2012 this algorithm uses retention time and peak shape as componentization criteria different here is the use of three retention times at full and half intensity as a distinguishing element in contrast to the calculated retention time window and graphical peak shape similarity determination the method specific thresholds for the three retention times at the peak apex and half maximum were determined for this measurement series using analytical standards compare section 2 3 3 for the prioritization the most intense feature in each component was considered as representative for that component for example in sample h3 horloff instead of 4767 features 2999 components represented by the most intense feature were further processed this is illustrated by the transition from fig 4 a and b a much higher reduction of signals was expected but a high number of components consisted of only one feature 1291 of 2999 for h3 a reduction of the intensity threshold could lead to the detection of more related features but would possibly increase the detection of false positives in the range of noise since the determination of the neutral monoisotopic mass is the key for the further identification process and cannot be unambiguously defined for components with just one feature these one feature components were filtered out leading to a feature reduction of up to 56 fig 5 white bars for example in the case of the sample h3 the number of components was considerably reduced from 2999 to 1708 with at least two features fig 4c from these the 400 most intense components are shown in fig 4d 3 2 prioritization of compounds entering the different tributaries and the upper reaches of the nidda analysis of spatial differences in compound occurrence between river sections was tested as an approach for the detection of contaminants with localized emission sources in addition to account for the possibility of discontinuous discharges samples were taken at four time points spread over ten days and the peaklists were combined prior to the prioritization step 2 4 1 due to the sampling at four time points at each sampling site emissions which may have occurred only at the start or end of the sampling period could also be detected components were prioritized which were characteristic for each river section within the complete list of detected features i e they were not detected in any upstream samples or the intensity was at least 4 fold higher the reduction in the number of components associated with this prioritization step was 76 on average the urselbach with 44 and the wetter with 97 representing the minimum and maximum data reduction for example at the nidda 288 components were registered at sampling point n2 but not upstream at the reference site n1 which indicates they were discharged between the two sampling sites similarly 266 other components were detected at n3 but neither at n1 nor n2 at n3 the 288 components presumably discharged upstream and registered at n2 were classified as already detected upstream if they were still detected at n3 fig 5 gray bars the ratio of components detected at a specific sampling site to components already present in upstream samples was highest at the sampling point ur urselbach this was not initially expected as the ur sampling site with all upstream nidda samples n1 n10 has the largest number of upstream reference samples of all investigated sites although there was no reference sample in the upper reaches of the urselbach itself this means that 56 of the components detected there approx 670 could not be detected or were only found in less than 4 fold concentration in the nidda reference samples upstream of the confluence of the urselbach one possible explanation are local characteristic discharges into the river from four surrounding industrial zones with companies from different branches among them are textile printing automotive and machine building industries a municipal wwtp is located in the city of oberursel 2020 a second river section characterized by a high proportion of prioritized components is the tributary horloff and there especially the sampling point h3 about 52 of the components detected there approx 700 were apparently discharged between h2 and h3 and were also not present in the nidda upstream of the confluence of the horloff n1 n3 the high number of newly detected components could be most likely be attributed to the city of hungen which is located between h2 and h3 the industry in hungen is characterized by mid sized companies processing textiles paper and dairy products a wwtp is also located in the city of hungen 2020 3 3 prioritization of compounds uncommon for wastewater the limitation of the procedure described above for the prioritization of specific contaminants is that the newly detected components can be dominated by typical municipal wastewater borne contaminants if sampling locations with a high wastewater fraction are compared with those in the upper reaches featuring no or a considerably lower wastewater content such contaminants are already known to be emitted into the nidda river basin therefore the aim of this further processing step was to remove compounds commonly found in municipal wastewater from the dataset according to the method described in section 2 4 2 the list of typical wastewater borne contaminants contains 3087 features of 917 components these include compounds such as 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid personal care product carbamazepine pharmaceutical or valsartanic acid pharmaceutical metabolite the dark gray bars in fig 5 illustrate that this led to a considerable reduction of data by 18 47 depending on the river section and an average reduction over all samples of 30 the low data reduction of 18 could be an indication for low human impact in that river section or a higher proportion of industrial or agricultural wastewater as compounds from these sources are less common for the effluent of municipal wwtps this small reduction occurs for example at sampling point h3 of the tributary horloff from 708 prioritized components in this sample 582 are considered as uncommon for municipal wastewater this is consistent with the possible emission of industrial wastewater including dairy wastewater and wastewater from textile finishing or other branches upstream of h3 a second river section with a low data reduction of 18 is the urselbach this tributary was identified as the source of a particularly high number of new compounds entering the nidda the low data reduction for this river section could also be due to contaminants from non municipal sources entering the river basin upstream of sampling site ur in contrast in erlenbach e2 and eschbach es a much higher reduction up to 38 can be observed therefore local discharges in these tributaries are more likely to be rated as typical for municipal wastewater for the usa wetter it could be observed that the data of sample u3 shows also a low reduction of 18 while for samples upstream and downstream of u3 a reduction by the wastewater filter of at least 25 was observed located upstream and downstream of the sampling point u3 are the wastewater treatment plants usingen upstream of u2 and bad nauheim upstream of u4 hessian state agency for nature conservation 2019 for the usa river between u2 and u3 the low reduction observed could indicate the discharge of more compounds which are less common to wastewater final considerations of the prioritization within certain river sections and the prioritization of compounds uncommon for wastewater led to the conclusion that especially the horloff and the urselbach discharged a large number of specific contaminants into the nidda fig 5 this can be demonstrated by the high number of remaining components with 697 sum of h1 h3 and 549 ur respectively after a the prioritization of compounds exclusively detected in certain river sections fig 5 gray bars and b the filtering out of compounds typical for the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants fig 5 dark gray bars looking at the whole evaluation of the data the samples h3 and ur show the lowest data reduction with about 19 of components remaining the remaining components in the other river sections nidda usa erlenbach eschbach represent on average 7 of the original component number down to 0 5 wetter nidder 3 4 identification of unknown compounds since the prioritization revealed that the horloff and urselbach discharged the highest number of specific and wastewater uncommon compounds the 20 most intense components tables s10 and s11 exclusively detected in these tributaries were selected for manual identification due to the low feature reduction by the wwtp filter indicating locally characteristic discharges the 20 most intense components originating from the usa were also selected table s12 compounds that could not be identified in this study are listed in the si with suggested molecular formulas as well as comparative spectra and fragmentation pathways of the identified compounds for these 60 components the m h features were determined by the adduct and isotopologue pattern and used for searching with metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 based on the selected monoisotopic masses metfrag proposed for each component between 0 and 8 possible compounds for the database for ident and between 8 and 7402 for pubchem respectively subsequently the selected components were manually evaluated for the plausibility of the in silico fragmentation and authentic reference standards were purchased to validate the results if more than 20 possible compounds were found in the databases the 20 best results with the highest matching factors were selected for identification out of 60 components examined nine were identified and verified by comparison to the reference standard table 2 s13 for the horloff tributary three compounds were identified which were only detected downstream of h2 for the seventh ranked component of the horloff with the most intense feature m z 222 1728 it was apparent from the component data and the ms1 spectrum that it was a double charged species the monoisotopic mass of the single charged molecule 443 3384 da could be determined according to the componentization and the mass spectra this mass rather than the measured one was used for searching in pubchem and 618 possible compounds were found in the subsequent in silico fragmentation the results obtained were filtered based on the occurrence of the five most intense fragments yielding six possible substances with the empirical formula c26h42n4o2 due to its availability from multiple chemical vendors and the listing at the european chemical agency echa 2019d n1 n3 bis 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidin 4 yl isophthalamide was considered as most plausible and could be verified with a purchased reference standard the annotation of the fragments from the ms2 spectrum is shown in fig 6 this compound also known as nylostab s eed is used for industrial application in the field of textile finishing and serves as a uv and process stabilizer for polyamide fibres yearly more than 1000 tons are manufactured and or imported into the european economic area eea the semi quantification using the reference standard in the horloff data indicated a concentration of approximately 0 4 μg l lc50 values of 250 mg l for short term and long term toxicity for fish as well as aquatic microorganisms have been reported webster et al 1997 echa 2019d nevertheless to the best of our knowledge it has not been analysed in environmental samples so far two further horloff specific components with the features m z 192 1235 and 387 1797 first and 20th most intense which were only detected downstream of h2 were identified as 1 o tolyl biguanide and 1 3 2 4 di p methylbenzylidene sorbitol respectively 1 3 2 4 di p methylbenzylidene sorbitol is used as a nucleating agent with production volumes of over 100 t a in the eea echa 2019a and 1 o tolyl biguanide is used as vulcanization accelerator and 10 to 100 t a are manufactured and or imported into the eea echa 2019b these two substances as well as nylostab s eed are likely used in the textile industry or the production of polymer products and dyes and it can be assumed that they are emitted from the same source into the horloff river in addition both substances are listed in the reach database as potentially harmful or toxic to aquatic life while 1 3 2 4 di p methylbenzylidene sorbitol was semi quantified with 3 μg l ecotoxicological studies reported a short term lc50 value for fish of 100 μg l and a predicted no effect concentration pnec of 3 μg l echa 2019a for 1 o tolyl biguanide the lc50 for fish was reported to be about 1500 fold higher echa 2019b with an estimated concentration of 0 3 μg l in the horloff for the sampling point ur the most intense component with the representative feature m z 199 0176 could be identified as 1h benzimidazole sulfonic acid whereby the position of the sulfonic acid group could not be verified even after measuring the reference standards for 1h benzimidazole 2 sulfonic acid and 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid it was impossible to differentiate between these isomers as both the retention time and the ms2 spectra matched due to the ambiguous position of the sulfonic acid group it is difficult to make a statement about applications source or ecotoxicological impacts of the compound however sulfonated benzimidazoles in particular are used in the textile industry as wetting agents emulsifiers foaming agents or as dispersing agents for use in dyeing shahnaz et al 2018 furthermore the sulfonyl group is a good nucleophile therefore these compounds are used in the synthesis of other derivatives such as 2 aminobenzimidazole or 2 alkoxybenzimidazole divaeva et al 2006 the concentration of the substance was semi quantified based on the reference standard with 5 μg l however for an ecotoxicological classification of this compound an unambiguous identification would be necessary in addition in the urselbach the compounds 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid m z 179 0904 and 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid m z 223 1159 were identified these substances known as oligoether carboxylates or monofunctional pegs are used as ionic liquids klein et al 2011 lubricants hjalmarsson et al 2013 surfactants harris et al 1995 or could occur as oxidation products of non functionalized pegs steber and wierich 1985 the 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid is manufactured or imported in the eea at a volume of 1 10 t a the semi quantification resulted in concentrations of 3 μg l for 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid and 0 8 μg l for 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid ecotoxicological studies showed a 48 h ec50 of daphnia magna of 100 mg l and 72 h ec50 of green algae of 100 mg l based on these results 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid is neither classified as short term acute aquatic hazard nor classified as long term chronic aquatic hazard echa 2019c for the 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid no ecotoxicological data were available in the tributary usa detected initially at the sampling point u3 components were prioritized whose highest features m z of 498 2812 519 7916 and 523 2713 respectively were identified as double charged species by the search for these monoisotopic masses in the database mzcloud the cyanotoxins microcystin rr lr and yr were postulated as possible compounds however by comparing the measured to the database ms2 spectra only a few fragments matched this may be because the mzcloud database uses data solely from orbitrap ms analysis whereas in this study a qtof instrument was used however purchased reference standards of these naturally occurring compounds confirmed their identity these are cyclic toxic peptides formed by cyanobacteria and emitted into the environment by cell death de figueiredo et al 2004 for these three toxins concentrations of 2 μg l for microcystin lr 5 μg l for microcystin rr and 1 μg l for microcystin yr were determined a guideline value of 0 1 μg l and a ld50 of 5 mg kg is published for microcystin lr chorus and bartram 1999 it is noteworthy that the usa is a relatively fast flowing stream and therefore not expected to harbor microcystin producing cyanobacteria however a pond in the town of bad nauheim between the samples u2 and u3 offers good conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria which might have been the source of these identified toxins 4 conclusion an nts workflow for the prioritization and subsequent identification of unknown organic water borne contaminants with localized emission sources was successfully applied to grab samples from the nidda river basin in addition to the blank correction the workflow comprises three main steps for data reduction and component prioritization i a generic method for the componentization of features based on both retention time and peak shape was successfully used to register and merge known adducts and isotopologues as well as unknown adducts in source fragments and multiple charge species this allowed for a considerable data reduction and facilitated the determination of the neutral monoisotopic mass for further compound identification ii a focus on components exclusively detected in certain river sections was achieved by selecting only those specific components i which were exclusively detected downstream of a sampling point and ii detected in a tributary but not in the receiving river upstream of the confluence iii a components filter for selecting those contaminants not ubiquitously present in conventionally treated municipal wastewater was a valuable tool to focus on compounds with regionally localized emission sources a similar approach can also be used to remove other components such as ubiquitously present constituents of the natural organic matter provided one has a representative dataset on which to compare to while three of the nine compounds identified in this study were ascertained as microcystins from cyanobacteria six compounds most likely derive from industrial processes underscoring the successful prioritization of contaminants specific to river sections through the evaluation of grab samples in order to confirm specific discharges a sampling strategy with higher temporal resolution is required which can also be used for the quantification of the emitted contaminants to the best of our knowledge for all of the six industrial chemicals no monitoring data in the aquatic environment is available so far nevertheless further studies would be needed to elucidate their fate in the environment and improve the assessment of their ecotoxicological effects the high number of prioritized components indicates the discharge of many more unknown compounds used or formed in industrial processes which could not been identified so far it is likely that also in other river basins especially

17899,non target screening of water samples from the nidda river basin in central germany was conducted with the goal to identify previously unknown chemical contaminants and their emission sources the focus was on organic water borne contaminants which were not typical to municipal wastewater grab samples of river water from 13 locations on the nidda and 15 of its tributaries in sum 112 samples were analysed with high resolution lc qtof ms ms to facilitate the identification of substances features originating from the same compound such as adducts and isotopologues as well as in source fragments and species with multiple charge states were registered and grouped by a componentization step utilizing both retention times and peak shapes of the features to combine them in a single component this led to a reduction of the number of features by an average of 1235 per sample 46 these grouped features were prioritized if these were detected only in specific tributaries or specific river sections reducing the number of components by an average of 913 per sample 78 in addition grouped features were labelled as typically found in municipal wastewater by combining data from 16 wastewater treatment plants located across germany and switzerland and comparing this to components detected in the nidda basin these were removed leading to a further reduction of components by an average of 72 per sample 30 for an average total reduction of 2536 per sample 93 finally nine compounds with emission sources in three specific tributaries were identified including the textile additive nylostab s eed which was previously not known to be an environmental contaminant as well as naturally occurring compounds such as highly toxic microcystins graphical abstract image 1 keywords non target screening unknown compounds surface water componentization prioritization lc qtof ms 1 introduction contamination of the aquatic environment with organic micropollutants has become a central environmental challenge the sources of these compounds are diverse but can be attributed in many regions and in many cases to point sources through wastewater treatment plants wwtp singer et al 2016 luo et al 2014 gago ferrero et al 2015 various types of chemical products such as pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals pesticides personal care products household chemicals or biocides enter rivers via treatment plants worldwide matamoros et al 2012 vanderford et al 2006 barber et al 2013 in addition to the original pharmaceuticals their human metabolites have been detected in treated wastewater ibáñez et al 2017 as well as in the aquatic environment writer et al 2013 another class of chemicals that has received increasing attention in recent years are educts and intermediates used in the chemical industry howard and muir 2013 for example pharmaceuticals and their educts were detected in gorjak creek near zagreb by terzic and ahel 2011 schlüsener et al 2015 and brand et al 2018 reported the detection of quaternary triphenylphosphonium compounds in the rivers rhine and elbe about 100 000 substances are listed in the european inventory of existing commercial chemical substances echa 2020 although many are potential environmental pollutants only a small proportion of these have been included in environmental monitoring studies and even fewer are part of routine monitoring programs schäfer et al 2011 these compounds can be screened and identified via non target analysis krauss et al 2010 using hplc coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry full scan hrms the m z values of all substances amenable to the applied method are recorded this enables the analysis of environmental samples without defining the analytes to be measured before this is a useful approach for detecting unforeseen organic contaminants furthermore it is possible to archive the acquired data to retrospectively screen historical data for spatial and temporal occurrence of recently identified pollutants alygizakis et al 2018 since a multitude of signals are aquired by full scan hrms analysis a considerable amount of filtering and data processing is required to extract the relevant signals using non target analysis with ionization by electrospray ionization esi in addition to m h adduct ions also signals of adducts such as m na m nh4 m k occur keller et al 2008 in addition isotopologues e g containing 13c or 37cl or species with different charges are detected as individual signals to group the features belonging to a single component the so called componentization is an essential step in many workflows schymanski et al 2014 a component represents the set of all features that originate from the same compound the adduct and isotopologue information provided by this step can also be essential for the subsequent identification of an unknown compound many current methods use known mass differences δm z between the individual adducts or isotopologues a similar retention time and in the case of isotopologues the intensity ratio between features as criteria for componentization pluskal et al 2010 however not all adduct types are known and in source fragmentation of compounds during ionization can lead to many additional features with unpredictable δm z another possible approach for the componentization is based on the similarity of retention time and peak shape used for example by camera kuhl et al 2012 this generic approach of componentization using retention time and peak shape should be able to capture in source fragments and uncommon adducts after this step the design of tailored research hypothethsis adapted to the research question is of central importance to further reduce the large amount of data in non target analysis one possibility for prioritization is the ranking of features taking into account frequency of detection and signal intensity park et al 2018 statistical approaches such as the combination of the f ratio method and apex detection are also used for the prioritization of unique features samanipour et al 2017 several studies include focusing on specific groups of substances such as chlorinated pesticides in food garcia reyes et al 2005 or the investigation of unknown transformation products li et al 2014 2017 there are also approaches to determine specific discharges by the evaluation of the non target data under temporal or spatial aspects by the investigation of influent samples from the wwtp of athens compounds like the industrial chemical n n n n tetrakis 2 hydroxyethyl hexanediamide was prioritized and identified by high variations of their concentration over several samples using the multivariate empirical bayes approach giving a score hotelling t2 coefficient for ranking compounds alygizakis et al 2019 an approach for the evaluation of a spatially resolved sampling at the river saale and mulde was provided by krauss et al 2019 by prioritizing site specific contaminants based on calculated rarity scores in addition the clustering of micropollutants data carpenter and helbling 2018 and the principle component analysis pca are used to prioritize possible contaminants with regard to temporal or spatial trends or based on chemical characteristics lopez doval et al 2017 dabrowski et al 2014 these studies have reported strategies to identify unknown contaminants using extensive temporal data evaluation or located sources of previously unknown compounds using spatially resolved sampling strategies as reported in the literature many statistical prioritization approaches rely on very large sample sets which are not always available krauss et al 2019 however instead of the proposed scoring approach grouping and comparing the spatial distribution of components within a river basin might provide a different prioritization focusing in particular on localized sources in addition to examining spatial variation of intensities to prioritize features further strategies can be envisaged to de prioritize features one option could be to look at municipal wastewater since this contains many contaminants whose occurrence in the aquatic environment is already well documented gomez et al 2010 kolpin et al 2002 features also ubiquitously detected in municipal wastewater could be labelled as such procedures and de prioritized bobeldijk et al 2001 the goal of this study was to combine the prioritization by grouping and comparing the spatial distribution of components and the de prioritization of components ubiquitously detected in municipal wastewater these steps were applied in a non target workflow for the identification of unknown organic water borne compounds with localized emission sources within a single river basin the method was applied to the nidda river basin a region stretching across an area of 1942 km2 in central germany the upper basin is characterized by the rural mountainous region of the

small urban centres southwest of karben ka is the urbanized area of frankfurt am main the mean discharge at the sampling site bad vilbel is 6 1 m³ s and covers 83 4 of the river basin löns hanna 2019 the sampling took place on 4 days over a 10 day period due to the size of the area and sampling point distribution it was impossible to stagger the sampling points such as to account for all residence times between sampling points the samples were filtered 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose spartan whatman usa transported and stored at 4 c and measured by direct injection within 48 h after sampling for the collection and storage of samples and blanks polypropylene bottles were used for the labelling of wastewater typical compounds 42 daily composite samples were used from the effluents of 16 municipal wwtps in germany and switzerland from these wwtps nine are located in the nidda river basin itself fig 1 bad vilbel was not included this high number of samples from different wwtps

about sampling sites wwtps sampling and characteristics are described in the supplementary data table s2 s3 2 2 2 data acquisition for data acquisition a system was used consisting of a hplc 1260 agilent waldbronn germany connected to a tripletof 6600 hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer qtofms ms sciex darmstadt germany ionization was achieved in positive mode via an esi source iondrive chromatographic separation was performed on a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 mm 150 mm 3 5 μm agilent protected with a security guard 2 0 mm 4 0 mm aq c18 phenomenex aschaffenburg germany at a flow of 300 μl min the sample was transferred by direct injection of 100 μl and the channel was automatically rinsed after each measurement in addition ultrapure water was injected after every 5th sample the solvents ultrapure water with 0 1 v v formic acid phase a and acetonitrile with 0 1 v v formic acid phase b were used with the following gradient percent for acetonitrile from 0 to 1 min 2 2 min 20 16 5 22 min 100 22 1 min 2 27 min 2 before 2 min and after 20 min the eluent was diverted to the waste to protect the instrument the acquisition of full scan experiments ranged from 100 to 1200 da via information dependent acquisition ida ms2 spectra of the eight most intense peaks were made with a collision energy ce set with potential 40 v and a collision energy spread ces set with potential 15 v the acquisition time of the full scan and the ida experiments were 150 ms and 30 ms respectively resulting in a cycle time of 440 ms a reduction of false positives was achieved by measuring examined samples as triplicates analogous to nürenberg et al 2015 more information on the parameters used can be found in schlüsener et al 2015 the instrument control software analyst tf 1 7 was used for data acquisition based on the described lc ms method parameters subsequently the measured data were transferred from the sciex format wiff to the open data format mzxml with proteowizard 3 0 kessner et al 2008 in order to be able to perform all the following steps of the workflow in r 3 5 0 r core team 2018 fig 2 this conversion leads to a significant change in the scale of the signal intensity approximately 14 000 in wiff to 10 in mzxml an assessment of the data acquisition and processing workflow is provided in the supplementary data table s4 2 3 data pre processing 2 3 1 peak picking the peak picking was performed by an algorithm written in r the eics were extracted with the r package xcms smith et al 2006 in consecutive bins of 20 mda and the maxima of intensities determined by the zero values in the first derivative the noise level was determined separately for each peak and was calculated in a range of ten times the peak width before and after the individual peak a detailed description of the peak picking algorithm can be found in dietrich et al the parameters used were min intensity counts 10 s n 3 peak width s 5 to 60 in addition to m z retention time and intensity the retention time of the two points at half peak intensity full width at half maximum were determined and used for the componentization step section 2 3 3 the m z the retention time t r intensity and when acquired an ms2 spectrum were combined to a consolidated data point referred to as a feature to provide a clear distinction from chromatographic or mass spectrometric peaks the peak picking resulted in a list of features for each sample 2 3 2 removing false positives false positives were reduced by only keeping those features which were found in all three replicate injections of a sample with a maximum deviation of m z of 5 ppm or max 5 mda and δt r of 3 s if more than one feature matched during this step those features showing the least difference in intensity were considered as matching to prevent split peaks or incorrectly picked peaks from remaining in the data 2 3 3 componentization by componentization adducts isotopologues in source fragments and features of different charge states of a compound are grouped to one component this was carried out under the condition of similar retention time and peak shape between features i e the extracted eics within a component should be identical in their retention time at the apex and at half intensity fig 3 exceptions might be weak signals with an intensity close to the noise level which might have a smaller peak width an algorithm written in r calculates this similarity using the retention time of the peak at the apex at the two points at half maximum intensity ½ intensity left ½ intensity right and the sum of the deviation of these three retention times the algorithm starts from the most intense entry of the feature list and other features are determined that can be linked to this feature to form a component this is achieved by comparing the two features the most intense and the candidate regarding the four mentioned values and matching the deviation against predefined tolerances if the deviations of the four values are within the tolerance the features are considered to belong together and are assigned to the same component until the end of the feature list the process is repeated with the next most intense ungrouped feature suitable tolerances for the similarity calculation using the three retention time points were determined for the chromatographic method used in this study an analyte mix of 30 substances was screened consisting of pharmaceuticals metabolites industrial chemicals and pesticides featuring a range of different retention times from 4 6 to 14 8 min table s5 substances were measured once in purified water 10 μg l and once spiked to a surface water sample 1 μg l rhine near koblenz to simulate real conditions for optimization steps the data was processed and isotopologues and adducts such as m na m nh4 and m k were determined manually by the mass and retention time differences intensity ratios and peak shape of the features based on the annotated features thresholds for t r at the apex ½ intensity left and ½ intensity right were determined which provided the best ratio of false positives and false negatives the false positives represent features incorrectly grouped into a component while the false negatives are expected but missing features in a component the obtained tolerances for retention time differences δt r between peaks were δt r ½ intensity left 0 5 s δt r ½ intensity right 1 s and δt r apex 1 5 s the higher value for δt r ½ intensity right could be explained by frequently occurring minor tailing fig 3 the forth threshold for the sum of all three values was set to δt r sum 2 5 s by optimizing the four thresholds the false positive and false negative ratios the ratio of incorrect componentized features to the total of all componentized features for the 30 reference standards was 10 and 6 respectively table s6 for a defined set of 30 compounds both values can be different because a misgrouping does not automatically fulfill both conditions for a complete feature list both values should be equal the determined tolerances were used for the componentization of sample data table 1 shows an example of the grouping of nine detected features into one component 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid compare table 2 during the identification stage these grouped features were annotated based on the mass differences and intensity ratios table s7 for further processing components in the samples not in the blanks which consist of only one feature were excluded 2 3 4 blank correction for blank correction three samples of ultra pure water treated in the same way as environmental samples both in preparation and storage were used as system blanks prior to blank correction all sample data were aligned with the three blanks to link the same features across the different lists the alignment parameters were m z tolerance 5 ppm t r tolerance 3 s an algorithm in r was used to take the first non aligned feature of the first sample and examine all other samples for features which fulfil the alignment parameters defined of all these candidate features the most intense one was chosen and subsequently the first step was repeated using this feature as a starting point since it is assumed that the most intense feature most accurately represents the correct m z and t r the final results were recorded in a separate alignment table the algorithm was continued until all features were added to the alignment table it was then determined which features were detected in the samples as well as in any of the three blanks the maximum intensity of the blanks was taken into account however features with much lower intensity in the blanks were not removed an intensity threshold had to be chosen above which the feature was considered to be authentic i e different from the background based on the observed maximum difference of intensities of blank features between samples a maximum of factor four a conservative value of factor 10 was chosen meaning that the intensity of the sample feature should be at least ten times the intensity of the most intense feature in the blank to be further considered in addition for each sample it was determined whether features also detected in the blank were the most intense features in their respective components in the samples if this was true the entire component in the sample was removed this step addresses the issue that some features in the blank are lower in their intensity than in samples and therefore complementary signals such as adducts and isotopologues may be below the applied intensity threshold and would remain in the sample data as orphans if only individual features are removed table s8 2 4 prioritizing 2 4 1 prioritization of compounds with the goal of examining spatial variation of intensities for prioritizing non target features it was decided to prioritize compounds i e components which can be detected specifically in a certain river section such as a tributary or the upper part of the nidda n1 n3 grouping and comparing the spatial distribution of components was chosen for prioritization for this purpose a script was written which first aligns the data under consideration of the temporal sampling and further carries out the spatial prioritization to obtain a temporal scope over the 10 day sampling period the components from four grab samples previously filtered by the removal of false positives and blanks from each sampling site were combined the corresponding samples were aligned m z tolerance 5 ppm max 5 mda t r tolerance 3 s to determine the most intense component of the four samples which was transferred to a new list to prioritize spatially specific components the combined list from the first step was aligned m z tolerance 5 ppm max 5 mda tr tolerance 3 s with all samples defined as upstream samples table s9 upstream includes a all samples of the nidda upstream the confluence of the considered tributary and b in the case of tributaries with multiple sampling sites all samples upstream of the considered sampling site in contrast to the previous alignment step for blank correction the starting point of comparison is not given by the most intense component but always by the sample under consideration which is compared with the upstream samples using this results table components in the considered sample with an intensity at least four times higher than in all upstream samples were determined and prioritized components not fulfilling these conditions were removed from the sample under consideration for example components in the list of sample u3 were prioritized if they were not found or found with intensity at least four times lower in u1 u2 and the nidda samples n1 to n5 fig 1 marked area 2 4 2 prioritization of compounds not ubiquitously found in municipal wastewater to further facilitate the extraction of non municipal micropollutants a so called wwtp filter step was included where compounds found commonly in wwtp effluents were removed from consideration for this purpose 42 effluent samples of 16 wwtps were analysed with the workflow described above and the frequency of detection of all components was determined section 2 2 1 an occurrence of at least 80 34 out of 42 samples was set as a limit to classify components as common for wastewater if this condition applied the entire component was included into a new feature list used for comparison to the sample feature lists 2 5 identification the 20 most intense prioritized components per river section were selected for manual identification and the m h features were determined by using the mass differences of adducts and isotopologues within the component in addition the intensity ratios of the features within the investigated component were used to identify the presence of chlorine bromine or sulfur in the compound the identification procedure was based on the use of the in silico fragmentation tool metfrag similar to the procedures outlined in schymanski et al 2014 and gago ferrero et al 2015 with the monoisotopic mass and the ms and ms2 spectra metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 was used to search matching substances in the database tool for ident letzel et al 2016 and pubchem kim et al 2015 as a first step the monoisotopic mass with a tolerance of 5 ppm was used for searching in the databases mentioned all substances were filtered by matching them with the isotopic pattern subsequently the measured ms2 spectra were compared with theoretical in silico fragmentations of the database compounds with a maximum deviation of 5 ppm and 2 mda the agreement of the compared spectra was given by the metfrag matching factor between 0 and 1 and all candidate substances were sorted in this way finally the plausibility of the calculated in silico fragmentation was assessed and the availability of the candidate substances at various vendors was taken into account if available comparative ms2 spectra of the mzcloud database raab et al 2016 were considered for the final confirmation the candidate compounds were ordered as reference standards measured with the same acquisition method and confirmed by comparing the sample data with the reference data to estimate the environmental concentrations the substances were semi quantified one point calibration using the reference standard 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the componentization for componentization a generic method was used based on retention time and peak shape similarity instead of a typical method based on selected mass differences and retention time similarity pluskal et al 2010 similar to approaches such as camera kuhl et al 2012 this algorithm uses retention time and peak shape as componentization criteria different here is the use of three retention times at full and half intensity as a distinguishing element in contrast to the calculated retention time window and graphical peak shape similarity determination the method specific thresholds for the three retention times at the peak apex and half maximum were determined for this measurement series using analytical standards compare section 2 3 3 for the prioritization the most intense feature in each component was considered as representative for that component for example in sample h3 horloff instead of 4767 features 2999 components represented by the most intense feature were further processed this is illustrated by the transition from fig 4 a and b a much higher reduction of signals was expected but a high number of components consisted of only one feature 1291 of 2999 for h3 a reduction of the intensity threshold could lead to the detection of more related features but would possibly increase the detection of false positives in the range of noise since the determination of the neutral monoisotopic mass is the key for the further identification process and cannot be unambiguously defined for components with just one feature these one feature components were filtered out leading to a feature reduction of up to 56 fig 5 white bars for example in the case of the sample h3 the number of components was considerably reduced from 2999 to 1708 with at least two features fig 4c from these the 400 most intense components are shown in fig 4d 3 2 prioritization of compounds entering the different tributaries and the upper reaches of the nidda analysis of spatial differences in compound occurrence between river sections was tested as an approach for the detection of contaminants with localized emission sources in addition to account for the possibility of discontinuous discharges samples were taken at four time points spread over ten days and the peaklists were combined prior to the prioritization step 2 4 1 due to the sampling at four time points at each sampling site emissions which may have occurred only at the start or end of the sampling period could also be detected components were prioritized which were characteristic for each river section within the complete list of detected features i e they were not detected in any upstream samples or the intensity was at least 4 fold higher the reduction in the number of components associated with this prioritization step was 76 on average the urselbach with 44 and the wetter with 97 representing the minimum and maximum data reduction for example at the nidda 288 components were registered at sampling point n2 but not upstream at the reference site n1 which indicates they were discharged between the two sampling sites similarly 266 other components were detected at n3 but neither at n1 nor n2 at n3 the 288 components presumably discharged upstream and registered at n2 were classified as already detected upstream if they were still detected at n3 fig 5 gray bars the ratio of components detected at a specific sampling site to components already present in upstream samples was highest at the sampling point ur urselbach this was not initially expected as the ur sampling site with all upstream nidda samples n1 n10 has the largest number of upstream reference samples of all investigated sites although there was no reference sample in the upper reaches of the urselbach itself this means that 56 of the components detected there approx 670 could not be detected or were only found in less than 4 fold concentration in the nidda reference samples upstream of the confluence of the urselbach one possible explanation are local characteristic discharges into the river from four surrounding industrial zones with companies from different branches among them are textile printing automotive and machine building industries a municipal wwtp is located in the city of oberursel 2020 a second river section characterized by a high proportion of prioritized components is the tributary horloff and there especially the sampling point h3 about 52 of the components detected there approx 700 were apparently discharged between h2 and h3 and were also not present in the nidda upstream of the confluence of the horloff n1 n3 the high number of newly detected components could be most likely be attributed to the city of hungen which is located between h2 and h3 the industry in hungen is characterized by mid sized companies processing textiles paper and dairy products a wwtp is also located in the city of hungen 2020 3 3 prioritization of compounds uncommon for wastewater the limitation of the procedure described above for the prioritization of specific contaminants is that the newly detected components can be dominated by typical municipal wastewater borne contaminants if sampling locations with a high wastewater fraction are compared with those in the upper reaches featuring no or a considerably lower wastewater content such contaminants are already known to be emitted into the nidda river basin therefore the aim of this further processing step was to remove compounds commonly found in municipal wastewater from the dataset according to the method described in section 2 4 2 the list of typical wastewater borne contaminants contains 3087 features of 917 components these include compounds such as 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid personal care product carbamazepine pharmaceutical or valsartanic acid pharmaceutical metabolite the dark gray bars in fig 5 illustrate that this led to a considerable reduction of data by 18 47 depending on the river section and an average reduction over all samples of 30 the low data reduction of 18 could be an indication for low human impact in that river section or a higher proportion of industrial or agricultural wastewater as compounds from these sources are less common for the effluent of municipal wwtps this small reduction occurs for example at sampling point h3 of the tributary horloff from 708 prioritized components in this sample 582 are considered as uncommon for municipal wastewater this is consistent with the possible emission of industrial wastewater including dairy wastewater and wastewater from textile finishing or other branches upstream of h3 a second river section with a low data reduction of 18 is the urselbach this tributary was identified as the source of a particularly high number of new compounds entering the nidda the low data reduction for this river section could also be due to contaminants from non municipal sources entering the river basin upstream of sampling site ur in contrast in erlenbach e2 and eschbach es a much higher reduction up to 38 can be observed therefore local discharges in these tributaries are more likely to be rated as typical for municipal wastewater for the usa wetter it could be observed that the data of sample u3 shows also a low reduction of 18 while for samples upstream and downstream of u3 a reduction by the wastewater filter of at least 25 was observed located upstream and downstream of the sampling point u3 are the wastewater treatment plants usingen upstream of u2 and bad nauheim upstream of u4 hessian state agency for nature conservation 2019 for the usa river between u2 and u3 the low reduction observed could indicate the discharge of more compounds which are less common to wastewater final considerations of the prioritization within certain river sections and the prioritization of compounds uncommon for wastewater led to the conclusion that especially the horloff and the urselbach discharged a large number of specific contaminants into the nidda fig 5 this can be demonstrated by the high number of remaining components with 697 sum of h1 h3 and 549 ur respectively after a the prioritization of compounds exclusively detected in certain river sections fig 5 gray bars and b the filtering out of compounds typical for the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants fig 5 dark gray bars looking at the whole evaluation of the data the samples h3 and ur show the lowest data reduction with about 19 of components remaining the remaining components in the other river sections nidda usa erlenbach eschbach represent on average 7 of the original component number down to 0 5 wetter nidder 3 4 identification of unknown compounds since the prioritization revealed that the horloff and urselbach discharged the highest number of specific and wastewater uncommon compounds the 20 most intense components tables s10 and s11 exclusively detected in these tributaries were selected for manual identification due to the low feature reduction by the wwtp filter indicating locally characteristic discharges the 20 most intense components originating from the usa were also selected table s12 compounds that could not be identified in this study are listed in the si with suggested molecular formulas as well as comparative spectra and fragmentation pathways of the identified compounds for these 60 components the m h features were determined by the adduct and isotopologue pattern and used for searching with metfrag ruttkies et al 2016 based on the selected monoisotopic masses metfrag proposed for each component between 0 and 8 possible compounds for the database for ident and between 8 and 7402 for pubchem respectively subsequently the selected components were manually evaluated for the plausibility of the in silico fragmentation and authentic reference standards were purchased to validate the results if more than 20 possible compounds were found in the databases the 20 best results with the highest matching factors were selected for identification out of 60 components examined nine were identified and verified by comparison to the reference standard table 2 s13 for the horloff tributary three compounds were identified which were only detected downstream of h2 for the seventh ranked component of the horloff with the most intense feature m z 222 1728 it was apparent from the component data and the ms1 spectrum that it was a double charged species the monoisotopic mass of the single charged molecule 443 3384 da could be determined according to the componentization and the mass spectra this mass rather than the measured one was used for searching in pubchem and 618 possible compounds were found in the subsequent in silico fragmentation the results obtained were filtered based on the occurrence of the five most intense fragments yielding six possible substances with the empirical formula c26h42n4o2 due to its availability from multiple chemical vendors and the listing at the european chemical agency echa 2019d n1 n3 bis 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidin 4 yl isophthalamide was considered as most plausible and could be verified with a purchased reference standard the annotation of the fragments from the ms2 spectrum is shown in fig 6 this compound also known as nylostab s eed is used for industrial application in the field of textile finishing and serves as a uv and process stabilizer for polyamide fibres yearly more than 1000 tons are manufactured and or imported into the european economic area eea the semi quantification using the reference standard in the horloff data indicated a concentration of approximately 0 4 μg l lc50 values of 250 mg l for short term and long term toxicity for fish as well as aquatic microorganisms have been reported webster et al 1997 echa 2019d nevertheless to the best of our knowledge it has not been analysed in environmental samples so far two further horloff specific components with the features m z 192 1235 and 387 1797 first and 20th most intense which were only detected downstream of h2 were identified as 1 o tolyl biguanide and 1 3 2 4 di p methylbenzylidene sorbitol respectively 1 3 2 4 di p methylbenzylidene sorbitol is used as a nucleating agent with production volumes of over 100 t a in the eea echa 2019a and 1 o tolyl biguanide is used as vulcanization accelerator and 10 to 100 t a are manufactured and or imported into the eea echa 2019b these two substances as well as nylostab s eed are likely used in the textile industry or the production of polymer products and dyes and it can be assumed that they are emitted from the same source into the horloff river in addition both substances are listed in the reach database as potentially harmful or toxic to aquatic life while 1 3 2 4 di p methylbenzylidene sorbitol was semi quantified with 3 μg l ecotoxicological studies reported a short term lc50 value for fish of 100 μg l and a predicted no effect concentration pnec of 3 μg l echa 2019a for 1 o tolyl biguanide the lc50 for fish was reported to be about 1500 fold higher echa 2019b with an estimated concentration of 0 3 μg l in the horloff for the sampling point ur the most intense component with the representative feature m z 199 0176 could be identified as 1h benzimidazole sulfonic acid whereby the position of the sulfonic acid group could not be verified even after measuring the reference standards for 1h benzimidazole 2 sulfonic acid and 1h benzimidazole 5 sulfonic acid it was impossible to differentiate between these isomers as both the retention time and the ms2 spectra matched due to the ambiguous position of the sulfonic acid group it is difficult to make a statement about applications source or ecotoxicological impacts of the compound however sulfonated benzimidazoles in particular are used in the textile industry as wetting agents emulsifiers foaming agents or as dispersing agents for use in dyeing shahnaz et al 2018 furthermore the sulfonyl group is a good nucleophile therefore these compounds are used in the synthesis of other derivatives such as 2 aminobenzimidazole or 2 alkoxybenzimidazole divaeva et al 2006 the concentration of the substance was semi quantified based on the reference standard with 5 μg l however for an ecotoxicological classification of this compound an unambiguous identification would be necessary in addition in the urselbach the compounds 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid m z 179 0904 and 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid m z 223 1159 were identified these substances known as oligoether carboxylates or monofunctional pegs are used as ionic liquids klein et al 2011 lubricants hjalmarsson et al 2013 surfactants harris et al 1995 or could occur as oxidation products of non functionalized pegs steber and wierich 1985 the 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid is manufactured or imported in the eea at a volume of 1 10 t a the semi quantification resulted in concentrations of 3 μg l for 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid and 0 8 μg l for 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid ecotoxicological studies showed a 48 h ec50 of daphnia magna of 100 mg l and 72 h ec50 of green algae of 100 mg l based on these results 3 6 9 trioxadecanoic acid is neither classified as short term acute aquatic hazard nor classified as long term chronic aquatic hazard echa 2019c for the 3 6 9 12 tetraoxatridecanoic acid no ecotoxicological data were available in the tributary usa detected initially at the sampling point u3 components were prioritized whose highest features m z of 498 2812 519 7916 and 523 2713 respectively were identified as double charged species by the search for these monoisotopic masses in the database mzcloud the cyanotoxins microcystin rr lr and yr were postulated as possible compounds however by comparing the measured to the database ms2 spectra only a few fragments matched this may be because the mzcloud database uses data solely from orbitrap ms analysis whereas in this study a qtof instrument was used however purchased reference standards of these naturally occurring compounds confirmed their identity these are cyclic toxic peptides formed by cyanobacteria and emitted into the environment by cell death de figueiredo et al 2004 for these three toxins concentrations of 2 μg l for microcystin lr 5 μg l for microcystin rr and 1 μg l for microcystin yr were determined a guideline value of 0 1 μg l and a ld50 of 5 mg kg is published for microcystin lr chorus and bartram 1999 it is noteworthy that the usa is a relatively fast flowing stream and therefore not expected to harbor microcystin producing cyanobacteria however a pond in the town of bad nauheim between the samples u2 and u3 offers good conditions for the growth of cyanobacteria which might have been the source of these identified toxins 4 conclusion an nts workflow for the prioritization and subsequent identification of unknown organic water borne contaminants with localized emission sources was successfully applied to grab samples from the nidda river basin in addition to the blank correction the workflow comprises three main steps for data reduction and component prioritization i a generic method for the componentization of features based on both retention time and peak shape was successfully used to register and merge known adducts and isotopologues as well as unknown adducts in source fragments and multiple charge species this allowed for a considerable data reduction and facilitated the determination of the neutral monoisotopic mass for further compound identification ii a focus on components exclusively detected in certain river sections was achieved by selecting only those specific components i which were exclusively detected downstream of a sampling point and ii detected in a tributary but not in the receiving river upstream of the confluence iii a components filter for selecting those contaminants not ubiquitously present in conventionally treated municipal wastewater was a valuable tool to focus on compounds with regionally localized emission sources a similar approach can also be used to remove other components such as ubiquitously present constituents of the natural organic matter provided one has a representative dataset on which to compare to while three of the nine compounds identified in this study were ascertained as microcystins from cyanobacteria six compounds most likely derive from industrial processes underscoring the successful prioritization of contaminants specific to river sections through the evaluation of grab samples in order to confirm specific discharges a sampling strategy with higher temporal resolution is required which can also be used for the quantification of the emitted contaminants to the best of our knowledge for all of the six industrial chemicals no monitoring data in the aquatic environment is available so far nevertheless further studies would be needed to elucidate their fate in the environment and improve the assessment of their ecotoxicological effects the high number of prioritized components indicates the discharge of many more unknown compounds used or formed in industrial processes which could not been identified so far it is likely that also in other river basins especially in urban areas many compounds of industrial origin are present which are mostly unknown or at least undocumented declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
