4795,planted forests and management operation method can potentially alter the soil properties as a consequence of changes in the characteristics of tree and plant species however the effects of planted forest species with different root systems on the soil detachment capacity dc have not well been quantified this study investigates the effects of plantation practice on the soil detachment capacity of soil with six vegetal species quercus castaneifolia alnus glutinosa and zelkova carpinifolia as planted forest species and carpinus betulus parrotia persica and pinus taeda as natural forest species based on a comparison between natural and planted forests in forestland of the saqalaksar park northern iran to this aim the soil detachment capacity on samples collected under trees of the studied species was measured in an experimental flume at five slopes 0 26 0 35 0 46 0 57 and 0 69 m m 1 and flow rates 0 037 0 086 0 185 0 285 and 0 376 l m 1 s 1 moreover simple prediction equations are suggested to evaluate the soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility kr for studied species the soils of natural forestland showed the lower soil detachment capacity compared to soils of the planted forestland due to the different influence of plant root systems moreover the inappropriate management practices in planted forestland could have worsened the soil properties and thus increased the soil detachment rate the unit stream power was better predictor of dc compared to other hydraulic parameters in both natural and planted forestlands the rill erodibility of soils was higher in planted forestland than in natural forestland according to the results the natural forestland is able to show higher resistance against soil erosion in comparison with the planted forestland these findings indicate that for sustainable management of forest ecosystems the maintenance of natural vegetal species can be an effective practice to reduce the soil erosion keywords reforestation

accelerated by inappropriate human activities rodrigo comino et al 2018 soil detachment describes the separation of soil particles from the soil matrix over the terrain surface due to both raindrop impact in inter rill erosion and the overland flow in rill erosion govers et al 1990 zhang et al 2003 jiang et al 2020 as regards the latter mechanism soil detachment capacity by overland flow is the maximum value of the soil detachment rate in the clear water without sediment foster 1982 nearing et al 1991 liu et al 2019 and is an important parameter for estimating rill erosion rate shen et al 2019 therefore an exact understanding of factors affecting soil detachment capacity is necessary to limit soil erosion by appropriate management practices such as the increase of the plant coverage and the improvement of soil properties novara et al 2011 cerdà et al 2016 due to various impacts the evaluation of soil detachment capacity is relatively complicated understanding a specific combination of the influence of physical chemical and biological factors on soil detachment capacity by rill flow under different conditions is required for hydrological predictions using soil erosion models laflen et al 1991 gan et al 2020 forestlands often cover the great extent of terrestrial ecosystems chandra et al 2016 in particular in the north of iran parhizkar et al 2020 in this context differences between natural and planted forestland soils are often highlighted wall and hytönen 2005 freier et al 2010 liao et al 2012 hoogmoed et al 2014 the physical properties of soils in natural forestland which are covered by a large variety of species differing in root characteristics are the results of the long term impacts of permanent vegetation cover and different species kooch et al 2016 however some management operations such as harvesting and other natural or human impacts such as the changes in tree species composition and fires can modify these properties particularly in planted forestland osman 2013 these differences differently drive soil properties and thus may influence the soil detachment capacity and soil resistance to erosion plant root system is considered as a key factor in slope stability and soil erosion control since it influences some physical properties of the soil gyssels et al 2005 much of these effects are due to the plant root system since plant roots influence the soil physico chemical properties which in turn change the sediment detachment rates for example amezketa 1999 stated the positive impacts of plant roots on soil aggregation by bringing particles closer together and releasing polyvalent cations for aggregate stability according to tisdall and oades 1982 the increase of the organic matter content of the soil is significantly relevant to the decomposition of roots and the contribution of vegetative cover in the surface soils also root action is important particularly on hillslopes where soil is vulnerable to soil erosion and it is exposed to moving water studies have shown that roots reinforce the soil by soil root matrix simon and collison 2001 abdi 2014 observed that plant roots can be very effective in reducing water erosion by raising soil shear strength and reinforcing its mass this result is in accordance with other studies herbrich et al 2018 wang et al 2018a however the degree of effectiveness of plant roots on soils is highly plant specific and depends on the root since the effects of roots are largely variable with the different plant species and the size distribution and density of the roots the analysis of changes in the soil properties and the related effects on soil detachment can explain how and to what extent each analyzed species natural or planted influence the detachment rate the proper selection of plant species for reducing the soil detachment capacity depends on information about root characteristics such as the distribution diameter and density in the soil surface pollen 2007 among the above mentioned characteristics root diameter and root weight density have been very used by many authors as important root properties in reducing rill erosion de baets and poesen 2010 burylo et al 2012 wang et al 2014b parhizkar et al 2020a specifically the weight density has been found as the most representative of the actions played by plant roots on soil detachability e g li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 parhizkar et al 2020b for example wang et al 2014a and wang et al 2014b found that weight density is the root property that most influences the soil detachment capacity by binding soil particles zhang et al 2013 while de baets et al 2007 showed that root density is heavy correlated to soil detachment rate by a non linear relation many studies have showed the importance of plant root systems in reducing rill erosion wang et al 2018b found that the detachment rate in soils with fibrous root systems is reduced compared to soils with taproot root systems gyssels and poesen 2003 used field experiments to study the relationship between rill erosion and root characteristics with different root densities of plants their results showed that rill erosion decreases exponentially with increasing root densities mamo and bubenzer 2001a and mamo and bubenzer 2001b found that rill erodibility decreased with root length densities in both laboratory and field experiments according to wang et al 2014a root weight density has the largest effect on soil resistance to rill erosion by binding soil particles into stable aggregates de baets et al 2006 moreover vegetation is commonly used to control surface erosion on hillslopes reducing the soil erodibility and an extensive vegetal cover of planted trees helps reducing runoff volume and discharge thanks to increased water infiltration and reduced flow velocity fiener and auerswald 2003 li et al 2013 therefore it is important to evaluate how each of the studied planted species contributes to decrease soil detachment through its root system on the basis of the characteristics of the root system the most suitable plant species for erosion control can be properly selected to achieve a reduction in soil erosion pollen 2007 although previous studies have demonstrated that the plant species differently influences the soil detachment capacity zhang et al 2013 mamo and bubenzer 2001a 2001b little attention has been paid to tree species and especially to planted trees in forest restoration activities therefore more research is needed to understand how a given forest tree species with a specific root system drives the soil detachment process to fill these gaps the general purposes of this study is to analyze the effects of root system on the soil properties and thus on soil detachment can explain how and to what extent each analyzed species natural or planted influence the detachment rate in addition this research tries to establish equations for evaluating soil detachment capacity using flow hydraulic parameters at low flow rates on soils sampled under tree vegetal species to these purposes a case study in the saqalaksar forestland park has been chosen northern iran more specifically this investigation aimed to develop the results of our previous study parhizkar et al 2020a which has shown that the soil detachment capacity was the lowest compared to the other land uses due to the presence of developed vegetation cover in forestlands the unit stream power was also the best predictor of dc thus the specific objectives of this study are 1 to investigate soil resistance to rill erosion from native forest vegetal species with different characteristics 2 to assess the performance of equation derived from the unit stream power for predicting dc in a new forestland of northern iran and 3 to study the changes in dc induced by management practices in soils of the planted forestland compared to the natural forestland of northern iran we hypothesize that some dominant species and their root structure in natural forestlands are able to reduce the soil detachment capacity compared to the planted forestlands and the unit stream power again is a reliable hydraulic parameters for predicting soil detachment capacity in the studied forestland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in the northern part of iran guilan province is situated in the south of the caspian sea mostly covered with abundant forestlands and dense vegetation bazdid vahdati et al 2014 amoopour et al 2016 beside the natural forestlands forest plantation is the main method for rehabilitation of degraded forests in this region kooch et al 2016 this area was covered by forest trees and plants with high density before an intense deforestation activity was carried out about ten to twenty years ago to install high voltage power towers parhizkar et al 2020a in some of the areas reforestation works started to limit the intense soil erosion recorded since the date of deforestation according to parhizkar et al 2020a and parhizkar et al 2020b the protection of forestlands is an important issue in this province in order to mitigate soil erosion and reduce its hazards the study area is located in the saqalaksar forestland park which is one of numerous forestlands in guilan province with massive tall trees outlet coordinates 37 09 23 98 n 49 31 49 48 e the park located 15 km south of rasht city at elevation 64 m above the mean sea level fig 1 according to the köppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 the climate of the study area is typically mediterranean csa type the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 1360 mm and 16 3 c respectively irimo 2016 based on field investigation the saqalaksar forestland has the variety of tree and plant species in this forestland the main species are zelkova carpinifolia hereinafter indicated as zc quercus castaneifolia qc alnus glutinosa ag parrotia persica pp pinus taeda pt and carpinus betulus cb covering more than 80 of the total study area the area was dominated by natural forestland other shrub and herbaceous species in the area are artemisia annua l cynodon dactylon l pers hedera helix l hedera pastuchovii woron ex grossh hypericum androsaemum l hypericum perforatum l juncus bufonius l juncus glaucus ehrh mentha pulegium l morus alba l primula heterochoroma starf prunus domestica l scutelaria albida l and solanum dulcamara l however some parts of the forestland were predominantly composed of plants and trees established through planting due to different management operations zc qc and ag were considered as species planted and the representative natural species of the forestland were pp pt and cb these species in areas with the same slope gradients abedi and pourbabaei 2011 amoopour et al 2016 were selected in order to compare the differences of soil detachment capacity dc under soils of the investigated species the group of natural vegetal species shows fibrous root systems with diameters lower than one mm and horizontal root growth while the group of planted forest species has deep taproot systems with diameters larger than one mm and vertical root growth more specifically among the investigated species qc shows the largest and deepest root system with the thickest root diameter while pp shows the thinnest root diameter 2 2 soil collection and analyses in order to measure soil properties and soil detachment capacity dc the soil of the six vegetal species was randomly sampled in an extra set of 150 soil samples 25 samples 6 vegetal species in the same locations in july and august 2020 more specifically five samples were collected for five trees of each vegetal species two quadrats the first measuring 1 1 m and the second 2 2 m were placed on soil around each tree collecting two soil samples in the vertices of the diagonal of the first quadrat and two other samples in the opposite diagonal of the second quadrat the fifth sample was collected very close to the trunk therefore the soil was sampled in different positions and at three distances 0 0 7 and 1 4 m from the tree this sampling procedure was in accordance to zhang et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 and parhizkar et al 2020a where more detail can be found shortly first rocks weeds and litter weer removed from the soil surface then we extracted the samples from soil by a steel ring 0 1 m in diameter and 0 05 m high finally the ring was removed and the samples were transported to the laboratory soil content of organic matter omc and root weight density rwd were determined by the potassium dichromate colorimetric method and the washing method over a 1 mm sieve and subsequent oven drying at 65 c respectively aggregate stability in water of soil as was measured by the wet sieving method moreover oven drying method was used to measure soil bulk density bd 2 3 measurement of dc the soil detachment capacity measurement was performed in a hydraulic flume length of 3 5 m and width of 0 2 m with rectangular cross section asadi et al 2011 raei et al 2015 parhizkar et al 2020a fig 2 for each soil sampled under the six vegetal species zc qc ag pp pt and cb the dc was measured in five water flow rates 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 and five slope gradients 3 7 8 6 18 5 28 5 and 37 6 with five replicates in the flume overall 750 soil samples 6 plant species 5 water flow rates 5 slope gradients 5 replications were subjected to the experiments before the experiment the values of q and v were measured five and ten times by the collection of water into a graduated plastic cylinder and the fluorescent dye technique respectively in order to calculate water viscosity the water temperature t was recorded according to abrahams et al 1985 v was obtained reducing v by 0 6 0 7 or 0 8 when the flow was laminar transitional or turbulent respectively moreover the water depth was measured using a level probe with accuracy of 1 mm as the mean value of six measurements the undisturbed soil sample for each species was installed in a hole of the flume bed close to the downstream outlet of the flume then the dc measurement was started over a 5 300 s period when the depth of the eroded soil sample in the steel ring reached 0 015 m the experimental test ended after completing each test the wet soil sample was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine its final dry weight dc was calculated as the mean value of five replicates using equation 1 1 d c δ m a δ t the hydraulic parameters of the water flow were calculated based on the equations reported in the previous work parhizkar et al 2020a such as τ foster 1982 ω bagnold 1966 ω yang 1972 and e wang et al 2016 zhao and he 2010 using the hydraulic radius r mean velocity v and mean flow depth h the values of the calculated hydraulic parameters are presented in table 1 soil resistance to rill erosion is reflected by rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc wang et al 2014b based on the wepp model nearing et al 1989 kr and τc were estimated as the slope and intercept of equation 2 2 d c k r τ τ c 2 4 statistical analysis first t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance p 0 01 of the soil properties among the vegetal species the normality of sample distribution was checked using qq plots after that considering flow rate and slope and vegetal species as factors the analysis of covariance ancova was performed for dc as dependent variable in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in dc among the natural and planted forest species the pairwise comparison by tukey s test at p 0 05 was used at a p 0 05 level of significance to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical tests equality of variance and normal distribution variables were square root transformed when necessary then to group soil samples according to the studied vegetal species and also explain most of the variance in data set the principal component analysis pca was used based on the pearson s matrix among the soil properties rodgers and nicewander 1988 in order to analyze the relationship between soil detachment capacity and hydraulic parameters the non linear regression method was used based on power equations according to the previous study parhizkar et al 2020a the goodness of these equations was evaluated by the coefficients of determination r2 vieira et al 2018 root mean square error rmse singh et al 2004 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 all data were analyzed using xlstat 9 0 software addinsoft paris france 3 results 3 1 soil properties and dc among the natural and panted vegetal species the silty clay loamy texture of the studied soils was the same under all investigated vegetal species according to the usda classification and there was no significant difference among the natural and planted forest species in addition to the three soil texture fractions sand silt and clay the differences in bd were not significant among these species table 2 however the other soil properties were significantly different among the studied vegetal species in more detail omc was higher 1 98 0 09 in pp and lower 1 36 0 18 in qc the latter species as a species planted showed the lowest rwd 0 40 0 09 kg m 3 while the maximum of rwd 0 879 0 05 kg m 3 was observed in pp as a species of natural forestland as was 0 32 0 09 in qc 0 35 0 09 in zc 0 46 0 05 in ag 0 84 0 07 in pp 0 71 0 05 in pt and 0 58 0 09 in cb the differences of omc rwd and as were significant among all the studied species except between qc and zc table 2 result showed that dc was significantly different between the natural and planted forest species in the forestland p 0 05 on average the value of dc was the highest in qc soil 0 02549 kg m 2 s 1 and the lowest in pp soil 0 00656 kg m 2 s 1 and the ratio between the maximum and minimum dc was 3 89 the dc of qc was 1 2 fold 1 6 fold 2 1 fold 2 9 fold and 3 9 fold greater than in zc ag cb pt and pp respectively dc of zc and qt was close together among studied vegetal species 0 02118 and 0 02549 kg m 2 s 1 respectively moreover the variability of dc was different among the natural and planted forest species as standard deviation ranged from 0 00674 kg m 2 s 1 pp to 0 02467 kg m 2 s 1 qc fig 3 based on the analysis of pearson s matrix a significant negative correlation was detected between dc and omc r 0 323 rwd r 0 318 and as r 0 362 conversely a significant positive correlation was detected only between dc and bd r 0 330 on the other hand the other significant correlations were observed among the soil properties for example omc was correlated with bd r 0 707 rwd r 0 814 and as r 0 804 also a negative correlation at the significance level was indicated between the bd content of soil and the rwd and as r 0 754 and r 0 714 moreover the correlation between rwd and as of soil was high and significant r 0 849 as regards the three particle size fractions sac was significantly correlated with sic r 0 764 and cc r 0 290 also sic showed a significant correlation with cc r 0 394 table 3 the application of pca to the scores of the soil samples obtained from the different species of natural and planted forestlands provided four principal components pcs which explained in total about 66 of the total variance of the soil properties in more detail pc1 and pc2 explained 44 and 22 of this variance respectively also pc3 and pc4 explained together about 11 of the variance of the soil properties omc bd rwd and as had significant loadings on pc1 over 0 73 while sand and silt significantly influenced the second pc with high loadings over 0 81 however clay content related to soil texture heavily weighed on pc3 loading of 0 958 table 4 moreover dc had significant loadings on pc4 over 0 7 in other words dc was associated with high value of bulk density and low values of organic matter root weight density and aggregate stability of soil indicated in pc1 while there was no relationship between dc and the three soil texture fractions table 4 and fig 4 a based on the plot of the sample scores on the first four pcs obvious differences were observed in soil properties among the species of studied natural and planted forestlands in total six well differentiated groups are indicated for the species of natural and planted forestlands with obvious overlapping of scores for the species planted ag qc and zc fig 4b 3 2 relationships between the dc and hydraulic parameters and estimation of kr tables 5 and 6 show power regression results between soil detachment capacity and hydraulic parameters associated with rill flow for plant species in the natural and planted forestlands in general all the equations were not suitable for simulating dc as shown by the values of the indexes evaluating the prediction capacity of these equations the comparative performance of these equations suggested that unit stream power collectively provides a better prediction for dc compared to the other hydraulic parameters tables 5 and 6 also among the hydraulic parameters unit energy is a poorer predictor of dc our data indicated that the best predictor of dc was the unit stream power for pp as a natural species and qc as a planted species when considering the rmse r2 and nse values the comparison of observed and predicted dc for pp and qc species indicates the soil detacment capacity in this study is well predicted by power unit stream power models figs 5 and 6 for all the studied species a linear relationship was found between shear stress and soil detachment capacity fig 7 according to the wepp model formulation the rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc were also estimated using the simple linear regression table 7 and they are considered as two of the most important parameters in rill erosion process by overland flow reflecting soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 it can be seen that there were clear differences in the rill erodibility and critical shear stress among various vegetal species in the forestland with the former values ranging from 0 0012 s m 1 to 0 0045 s m 1 and the latter values from 1 22 pa to 1 83 pa always significant at p 0 05 table 7 and fig 7 qc and pp showed the maximum and minimum values of kr respectively also the lowest and highest values of τc were observed in qc and cb soils respectively the rill erodibility of the soil with qc soil was 1 18 1 55 1 96 2 81 and 3 75 times greater than zc ag cb pt and pp soils while the critical shear stress of soils under cb was 1 50 1 33 1 22 1 11 and 1 06 times the values of qc zc pt ag and pp respectively the differences in kr values were significantly lower in species of natural forestland compared to the three other species of planted forestland table 7 4 discussion 4 1 the variations of soil detachment capacity and soil properties under the vegetal species it is well known how vegetal species of a given forestland affect soil properties and soil detachment capacity in various ways and at different rates e g mamo and bubenzer 2001a 2001b gyssels and poesen 2003 gyssels et al 2005 keller and håkansson 2010 zhang et al 2013 sroka et al 2018 wang et al 2018b shabanpour et al 2020 the change of the soil properties and hydrological characteristics under the different vegetal species is demonstrated by different authors working in iran kooch et al 2016 parhizkar et al 2020a sanji et al 2020 in this context the results of this study are consistent with these findings more specifically because all of the soils studied had similar soil texture silty clay loam class the present study provided deeper insights for clarifying the differences in soil detachment capacity among soils under the six species of natural and planted forestlands given this soil homogeneity the ecological differences among the investigated species combined with plantation management practices for zc qc and ag species in this forestland such as tillage timber harvesting and prescribed burning may play an important role in modifying the soil detachment capacity the differences in the type of species especially those that influence soil plant interactions affect the structure and functioning of ecosystems particularly for delicate forestland ecosystems lucas borja et al 2018 the distinctions in plant structures which vary between natural forest and planted forest can lead to the variability of soil properties our results revealed a significantly lower organic matter content in the species of planted forest qc zc ag than the species of natural forest pp pt cb according to wang et al 2018a the soil organic matter can be affected by the quantity of root weight density so the higher rwd in soils under natural forest and the increase of soil om could be expected compared to planted forest the observed increase in root weight density with considerable surface roughness and structure viles 1990 gyssels et al 2005 as well as soil organic matter in natural forest compared to planted forest can explain the lower bulk density values and the higher aggregate stability of the natural forest soil parhizkar et al 2020a this is also confirmed by the correlation analysis showing that rwd was positively correlated with om and as and negatively correlated with bd of soil furthermore the latter property in soils of natural forest was found to be lower because of the creation of continuous pores in soil by roots gyssels et al 2005 shinohara et al 2016 moreover it is considered that fine roots less than 1 mm in diameter can significantly decrease the bulk density of the soil li et al 1993 this agreed with meek et al 1992 who found that alfalfa roots with diameter of less than 1 mm increased the soil infiltration rate and decreased the bulk density the presence of plant root with different characteristics among plant species can improve the physical properties of soil and hence affect the process of soil detachment zhang et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2018b the calculated soil detachment capacity in this study for the studied forest species went in this direction in other words in this study the soil properties induced by the species of natural and planted forestlands and dc were significantly different among the six plant species under investigation the value of soil detachment capacity was significantly higher in the planted forest compared to the values measured in the natural forest likely some epochal incidents such as fire cycles technological development landslides and the effects of population density on vegetal species in the natural forest were lower than in the planted forest furthermore some improper management activities e g prescribed burning thinning and deforestation may have contributed to increasing the rill erosion in soils of planted forest this is consistent with the previous reports of parhizkar et al 2020a which showed that in delicate environment ecosystems such as the forestlands of northern iran surface soil disturbance and land use change by farming operations can increase the potential for water erosion these findings are consistent with numerous results in iran e g emadodin 2008 bahrami et al 2010 gholami et al 2016 shabanpour et al 2020 in qc and zc soils root weight density was the lowest and this shows the lowest soil resistance against concentrated flow conversely the lowest value of soil detachment capacity observed in pp soils the lower dc in the natural forest was most likely attributed to the higher root weight density this is consistent with the conclusions of many authors e g li et al 1991a li 1995 wang et al 2015 who concluded that plant roots play an essential role in decreasing soil detachment specifically in reducing rill erosion gyssels et al 2005 abdi et al 2010 stated that the resistance of a soil against shallow landslides can be enhanced by the characteristics of the root system of pp selected as one of species of natural forestland in our study the relationships between some key soil properties and dc also are confirmed by the correlation analysis here the dc was found to have a negative correlation with the root weight density and aggregate stability of sampled soils with the increase of om rwd and as soil mass became more stable which made the soil hard to be detached by concentrated flow and thus reduced the soil detachment capacity wang et al 2018b moreover soil properties improved by fibrous root systems with fine roots in the species of natural forest have powerful potential in reducing soil detachment capacity compared to the soils under the species of planted forest in other words this type of root system makes the soil more stable and less susceptible to rill erosion vannoppen et al 2017 wang et al 2018b therefore when developing robust plans for sustainable management of forest ecosystems we should select species that can improve soil properties to protect and conserve the soil to minimize soil erosion caused by water in this research using of pca analysis obviously set apart differences of soil properties in four significant pcs among studied species pc1 synthesized the properties of soil except for the textural characteristics among the three soil texture fractions sand and silt contents were associated with pc2 while the clay content showed a strong loading on pc3 however the soil detachment capacity had a strong loading on pc4 also according to the relationships between the properties of soil and soil detachment three vegetal species qc zc and ag were discriminated from pp pt and cb species as shown by the evident clusters arranged along a clear gradient on the first pc these observations provide evidence that soils with different properties grouped in distinct clusters among various vegetal species and their smaller spatial scales as suggested in the study by parhizkar et al 2020a and shabanpour et al 2020 4 2 the effects of hydraulic parameters on the soil detachment capacity and the variations of soil resistance to rill erosion beside the root characteristics and the soil properties the hydraulic parameters of the overland flow influence soil detachment capacity greatly nearing et al 1991 zhang et al 2002 in this study the regression analysis between dc and the hydraulic characteristics showed that similar to the power equations set in the previous study for another forestland in this province parhizkar et al 2020a the unit stream power had high accuracy to estimate the soil detachment capacity in both natural and planted forestlands this may be due to the fact that this hydraulic parameter simultaneously takes into account the soil slope and flow velocity both influencing the soil detachability due to the overland flow parhizkar et al 2020a some previous studies have also indicated that the flow characteristics can be used to estimate the soil detachment capacity by overland flow nearing et al 1991 zhang et al 2002 xiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2018b stated that the soil detachment capacity could be expressed as a series of power functions of unit stream power and other flow hydraulic factors of flowing water however some studies suggested that soil detachment capacity was better estimated using stream power with a power function nearing et al 1999 zhang et al 2002 the rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc reflect soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 and are very sensitive input parameters of some process based erosion models wang et al 2016 such as the water erosion prediction project wepp laflen et al 1991 the rill detachment capacity of a soil due to the overland flow is strictly linked to these two parameters in this context it is important to compare the effects of the studied species in natural and planted forestlands on these parameters therefore in this study kr and τc were calculated though the linear regression between the measured dc and flow shear stress for the six vegetal species however these models showed the low coefficients of determination in the linear regression fitting dc to τ this result is different from the conclusions of zhang et al 2008 and parhizkar et al 2020a who stated that the regressions between dc and τ can be used to fit the observed data with high accuracy in the prediction of dc the higher values of kr in the planted forestland compared to the natural forestland again show the effects of forest management and type of plant species on soil erosion zhu et al 2019 it has been shown above that the lower rill erodibility detected in natural species compared to the other planted species in the forestland this result can be explained by roots with diameter lower than 1 mm known as effective roots in species of natural forestland this is similar as other studies li et al 1991b 1992 li 1995 provides corroborating evidence that concentrated flow erosion can be reduced by the effects of plant root on soil physical properties soil permeability and the resistance of the soil also among the species of natural forestland pp showed the lowest rill erodibility may be due to the improvement of soil properties by the roots of this species on the other hand the highest root density of pp species provided the highest resistance of the soil to rill erosion among all the studied species 5 conclusions the study showed that the soil properties and dc were strongly influenced by the six studied vegetal species the mean dc in soils under species of planted forestland was greater than that in soils under species of natural forestland moreover dc was also affected by some soil management operations in the planted forestland soil detachment capacity was negatively related to soil organic matter root weight density and water stable aggregate while it was positively related to soil bulk density these correlations can explain the differences in the dc induced by the different impacts of the plant root systems soil detachment capacity by overland flow could be well estimated by the unit stream power using power equations in both natural and planted forestlands in general this study is helpful to understanding the soil detachment rate in slopes under different species and suggests that some inappropriate soil management operations such as harvesting operations changes in tree species composition and forest fires may lead to soil disturbance and increase soil erosion by destroying some the characteristics of plant and

4795,planted forests and management operation method can potentially alter the soil properties as a consequence of changes in the characteristics of tree and plant species however the effects of planted forest species with different root systems on the soil detachment capacity dc have not well been quantified this study investigates the effects of plantation practice on the soil detachment capacity of soil with six vegetal species quercus castaneifolia alnus glutinosa and zelkova carpinifolia as planted forest species and carpinus betulus parrotia persica and pinus taeda as natural forest species based on a comparison between natural and planted forests in forestland of the saqalaksar park northern iran to this aim the soil detachment capacity on samples collected under trees of the studied species was measured in an experimental flume at five slopes 0 26 0 35 0 46 0 57 and 0 69 m m 1 and flow rates 0 037 0 086 0 185 0 285 and 0 376 l m 1 s 1 moreover simple prediction equations are suggested to evaluate the soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility kr for studied species the soils of natural forestland showed the lower soil detachment capacity compared to soils of the planted forestland due to the different influence of plant root systems moreover the inappropriate management practices in planted forestland could have worsened the soil properties and thus increased the soil detachment rate the unit stream power was better predictor of dc compared to other hydraulic parameters in both natural and planted forestlands the rill erodibility of soils was higher in planted forestland than in natural forestland according to the results the natural forestland is able to show higher resistance against soil erosion in comparison with the planted forestland these findings indicate that for sustainable management of forest ecosystems the maintenance of natural vegetal species can be an effective practice to reduce the soil erosion keywords reforestation

accelerated by inappropriate human activities rodrigo comino et al 2018 soil detachment describes the separation of soil particles from the soil matrix over the terrain surface due to both raindrop impact in inter rill erosion and the overland flow in rill erosion govers et al 1990 zhang et al 2003 jiang et al 2020 as regards the latter mechanism soil detachment capacity by overland flow is the maximum value of the soil detachment rate in the clear water without sediment foster 1982 nearing et al 1991 liu et al 2019 and is an important parameter for estimating rill erosion rate shen et al 2019 therefore an exact understanding of factors affecting soil detachment capacity is necessary to limit soil erosion by appropriate management practices such as the increase of the plant coverage and the improvement of soil properties novara et al 2011 cerdà et al 2016 due to various impacts the evaluation of soil detachment capacity is relatively complicated understanding a specific combination of the influence of physical chemical and biological factors on soil detachment capacity by rill flow under different conditions is required for hydrological predictions using soil erosion models laflen et al 1991 gan et al 2020 forestlands often cover the great extent of terrestrial ecosystems chandra et al 2016 in particular in the north of iran parhizkar et al 2020 in this context differences between natural and planted forestland soils are often highlighted wall and hytönen 2005 freier et al 2010 liao et al 2012 hoogmoed et al 2014 the physical properties of soils in natural forestland which are covered by a large variety of species differing in root characteristics are the results of the long term impacts of permanent vegetation cover and different species kooch et al 2016 however some management operations such as harvesting and other natural or human impacts such as the changes in tree species composition and fires can modify these properties particularly in planted forestland osman 2013 these differences differently drive soil properties and thus may influence the soil detachment capacity and soil resistance to erosion plant root system is considered as a key factor in slope stability and soil erosion control since it influences some physical properties of the soil gyssels et al 2005 much of these effects are due to the plant root system since plant roots influence the soil physico chemical properties which in turn change the sediment detachment rates for example amezketa 1999 stated the positive impacts of plant roots on soil aggregation by bringing particles closer together and releasing polyvalent cations for aggregate stability according to tisdall and oades 1982 the increase of the organic matter content of the soil is significantly relevant to the decomposition of roots and the contribution of vegetative cover in the surface soils also root action is important particularly on hillslopes where soil is vulnerable to soil erosion and it is exposed to moving water studies have shown that roots reinforce the soil by soil root matrix simon and collison 2001 abdi 2014 observed that plant roots can be very effective in reducing water erosion by raising soil shear strength and reinforcing its mass this result is in accordance with other studies herbrich et al 2018 wang et al 2018a however the degree of effectiveness of plant roots on soils is highly plant specific and depends on the root since the effects of roots are largely variable with the different plant species and the size distribution and density of the roots the analysis of changes in the soil properties and the related effects on soil detachment can explain how and to what extent each analyzed species natural or planted influence the detachment rate the proper selection of plant species for reducing the soil detachment capacity depends on information about root characteristics such as the distribution diameter and density in the soil surface pollen 2007 among the above mentioned characteristics root diameter and root weight density have been very used by many authors as important root properties in reducing rill erosion de baets and poesen 2010 burylo et al 2012 wang et al 2014b parhizkar et al 2020a specifically the weight density has been found as the most representative of the actions played by plant roots on soil detachability e g li et al 2015 wang et al 2018 parhizkar et al 2020b for example wang et al 2014a and wang et al 2014b found that weight density is the root property that most influences the soil detachment capacity by binding soil particles zhang et al 2013 while de baets et al 2007 showed that root density is heavy correlated to soil detachment rate by a non linear relation many studies have showed the importance of plant root systems in reducing rill erosion wang et al 2018b found that the detachment rate in soils with fibrous root systems is reduced compared to soils with taproot root systems gyssels and poesen 2003 used field experiments to study the relationship between rill erosion and root characteristics with different root densities of plants their results showed that rill erosion decreases exponentially with increasing root densities mamo and bubenzer 2001a and mamo and bubenzer 2001b found that rill erodibility decreased with root length densities in both laboratory and field experiments according to wang et al 2014a root weight density has the largest effect on soil resistance to rill erosion by binding soil particles into stable aggregates de baets et al 2006 moreover vegetation is commonly used to control surface erosion on hillslopes reducing the soil erodibility and an extensive vegetal cover of planted trees helps reducing runoff volume and discharge thanks to increased water infiltration and reduced flow velocity fiener and auerswald 2003 li et al 2013 therefore it is important to evaluate how each of the studied planted species contributes to decrease soil detachment through its root system on the basis of the characteristics of the root system the most suitable plant species for erosion control can be properly selected to achieve a reduction in soil erosion pollen 2007 although previous studies have demonstrated that the plant species differently influences the soil detachment capacity zhang et al 2013 mamo and bubenzer 2001a 2001b little attention has been paid to tree species and especially to planted trees in forest restoration activities therefore more research is needed to understand how a given forest tree species with a specific root system drives the soil detachment process to fill these gaps the general purposes of this study is to analyze the effects of root system on the soil properties and thus on soil detachment can explain how and to what extent each analyzed species natural or planted influence the detachment rate in addition this research tries to establish equations for evaluating soil detachment capacity using flow hydraulic parameters at low flow rates on soils sampled under tree vegetal species to these purposes a case study in the saqalaksar forestland park has been chosen northern iran more specifically this investigation aimed to develop the results of our previous study parhizkar et al 2020a which has shown that the soil detachment capacity was the lowest compared to the other land uses due to the presence of developed vegetation cover in forestlands the unit stream power was also the best predictor of dc thus the specific objectives of this study are 1 to investigate soil resistance to rill erosion from native forest vegetal species with different characteristics 2 to assess the performance of equation derived from the unit stream power for predicting dc in a new forestland of northern iran and 3 to study the changes in dc induced by management practices in soils of the planted forestland compared to the natural forestland of northern iran we hypothesize that some dominant species and their root structure in natural forestlands are able to reduce the soil detachment capacity compared to the planted forestlands and the unit stream power again is a reliable hydraulic parameters for predicting soil detachment capacity in the studied forestland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in the northern part of iran guilan province is situated in the south of the caspian sea mostly covered with abundant forestlands and dense vegetation bazdid vahdati et al 2014 amoopour et al 2016 beside the natural forestlands forest plantation is the main method for rehabilitation of degraded forests in this region kooch et al 2016 this area was covered by forest trees and plants with high density before an intense deforestation activity was carried out about ten to twenty years ago to install high voltage power towers parhizkar et al 2020a in some of the areas reforestation works started to limit the intense soil erosion recorded since the date of deforestation according to parhizkar et al 2020a and parhizkar et al 2020b the protection of forestlands is an important issue in this province in order to mitigate soil erosion and reduce its hazards the study area is located in the saqalaksar forestland park which is one of numerous forestlands in guilan province with massive tall trees outlet coordinates 37 09 23 98 n 49 31 49 48 e the park located 15 km south of rasht city at elevation 64 m above the mean sea level fig 1 according to the köppen geiger classification kottek et al 2006 the climate of the study area is typically mediterranean csa type the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 1360 mm and 16 3 c respectively irimo 2016 based on field investigation the saqalaksar forestland has the variety of tree and plant species in this forestland the main species are zelkova carpinifolia hereinafter indicated as zc quercus castaneifolia qc alnus glutinosa ag parrotia persica pp pinus taeda pt and carpinus betulus cb covering more than 80 of the total study area the area was dominated by natural forestland other shrub and herbaceous species in the area are artemisia annua l cynodon dactylon l pers hedera helix l hedera pastuchovii woron ex grossh hypericum androsaemum l hypericum perforatum l juncus bufonius l juncus glaucus ehrh mentha pulegium l morus alba l primula heterochoroma starf prunus domestica l scutelaria albida l and solanum dulcamara l however some parts of the forestland were predominantly composed of plants and trees established through planting due to different management operations zc qc and ag were considered as species planted and the representative natural species of the forestland were pp pt and cb these species in areas with the same slope gradients abedi and pourbabaei 2011 amoopour et al 2016 were selected in order to compare the differences of soil detachment capacity dc under soils of the investigated species the group of natural vegetal species shows fibrous root systems with diameters lower than one mm and horizontal root growth while the group of planted forest species has deep taproot systems with diameters larger than one mm and vertical root growth more specifically among the investigated species qc shows the largest and deepest root system with the thickest root diameter while pp shows the thinnest root diameter 2 2 soil collection and analyses in order to measure soil properties and soil detachment capacity dc the soil of the six vegetal species was randomly sampled in an extra set of 150 soil samples 25 samples 6 vegetal species in the same locations in july and august 2020 more specifically five samples were collected for five trees of each vegetal species two quadrats the first measuring 1 1 m and the second 2 2 m were placed on soil around each tree collecting two soil samples in the vertices of the diagonal of the first quadrat and two other samples in the opposite diagonal of the second quadrat the fifth sample was collected very close to the trunk therefore the soil was sampled in different positions and at three distances 0 0 7 and 1 4 m from the tree this sampling procedure was in accordance to zhang et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 and parhizkar et al 2020a where more detail can be found shortly first rocks weeds and litter weer removed from the soil surface then we extracted the samples from soil by a steel ring 0 1 m in diameter and 0 05 m high finally the ring was removed and the samples were transported to the laboratory soil content of organic matter omc and root weight density rwd were determined by the potassium dichromate colorimetric method and the washing method over a 1 mm sieve and subsequent oven drying at 65 c respectively aggregate stability in water of soil as was measured by the wet sieving method moreover oven drying method was used to measure soil bulk density bd 2 3 measurement of dc the soil detachment capacity measurement was performed in a hydraulic flume length of 3 5 m and width of 0 2 m with rectangular cross section asadi et al 2011 raei et al 2015 parhizkar et al 2020a fig 2 for each soil sampled under the six vegetal species zc qc ag pp pt and cb the dc was measured in five water flow rates 0 26 0 35 0 45 0 56 and 0 67 l m 1 s 1 and five slope gradients 3 7 8 6 18 5 28 5 and 37 6 with five replicates in the flume overall 750 soil samples 6 plant species 5 water flow rates 5 slope gradients 5 replications were subjected to the experiments before the experiment the values of q and v were measured five and ten times by the collection of water into a graduated plastic cylinder and the fluorescent dye technique respectively in order to calculate water viscosity the water temperature t was recorded according to abrahams et al 1985 v was obtained reducing v by 0 6 0 7 or 0 8 when the flow was laminar transitional or turbulent respectively moreover the water depth was measured using a level probe with accuracy of 1 mm as the mean value of six measurements the undisturbed soil sample for each species was installed in a hole of the flume bed close to the downstream outlet of the flume then the dc measurement was started over a 5 300 s period when the depth of the eroded soil sample in the steel ring reached 0 015 m the experimental test ended after completing each test the wet soil sample was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine its final dry weight dc was calculated as the mean value of five replicates using equation 1 1 d c δ m a δ t the hydraulic parameters of the water flow were calculated based on the equations reported in the previous work parhizkar et al 2020a such as τ foster 1982 ω bagnold 1966 ω yang 1972 and e wang et al 2016 zhao and he 2010 using the hydraulic radius r mean velocity v and mean flow depth h the values of the calculated hydraulic parameters are presented in table 1 soil resistance to rill erosion is reflected by rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc wang et al 2014b based on the wepp model nearing et al 1989 kr and τc were estimated as the slope and intercept of equation 2 2 d c k r τ τ c 2 4 statistical analysis first t test was used to evaluate the statistical significance p 0 01 of the soil properties among the vegetal species the normality of sample distribution was checked using qq plots after that considering flow rate and slope and vegetal species as factors the analysis of covariance ancova was performed for dc as dependent variable in order to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in dc among the natural and planted forest species the pairwise comparison by tukey s test at p 0 05 was used at a p 0 05 level of significance to satisfy the assumptions of the statistical tests equality of variance and normal distribution variables were square root transformed when necessary then to group soil samples according to the studied vegetal species and also explain most of the variance in data set the principal component analysis pca was used based on the pearson s matrix among the soil properties rodgers and nicewander 1988 in order to analyze the relationship between soil detachment capacity and hydraulic parameters the non linear regression method was used based on power equations according to the previous study parhizkar et al 2020a the goodness of these equations was evaluated by the coefficients of determination r2 vieira et al 2018 root mean square error rmse singh et al 2004 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 all data were analyzed using xlstat 9 0 software addinsoft paris france 3 results 3 1 soil properties and dc among the natural and panted vegetal species the silty clay loamy texture of the studied soils was the same under all investigated vegetal species according to the usda classification and there was no significant difference among the natural and planted forest species in addition to the three soil texture fractions sand silt and clay the differences in bd were not significant among these species table 2 however the other soil properties were significantly different among the studied vegetal species in more detail omc was higher 1 98 0 09 in pp and lower 1 36 0 18 in qc the latter species as a species planted showed the lowest rwd 0 40 0 09 kg m 3 while the maximum of rwd 0 879 0 05 kg m 3 was observed in pp as a species of natural forestland as was 0 32 0 09 in qc 0 35 0 09 in zc 0 46 0 05 in ag 0 84 0 07 in pp 0 71 0 05 in pt and 0 58 0 09 in cb the differences of omc rwd and as were significant among all the studied species except between qc and zc table 2 result showed that dc was significantly different between the natural and planted forest species in the forestland p 0 05 on average the value of dc was the highest in qc soil 0 02549 kg m 2 s 1 and the lowest in pp soil 0 00656 kg m 2 s 1 and the ratio between the maximum and minimum dc was 3 89 the dc of qc was 1 2 fold 1 6 fold 2 1 fold 2 9 fold and 3 9 fold greater than in zc ag cb pt and pp respectively dc of zc and qt was close together among studied vegetal species 0 02118 and 0 02549 kg m 2 s 1 respectively moreover the variability of dc was different among the natural and planted forest species as standard deviation ranged from 0 00674 kg m 2 s 1 pp to 0 02467 kg m 2 s 1 qc fig 3 based on the analysis of pearson s matrix a significant negative correlation was detected between dc and omc r 0 323 rwd r 0 318 and as r 0 362 conversely a significant positive correlation was detected only between dc and bd r 0 330 on the other hand the other significant correlations were observed among the soil properties for example omc was correlated with bd r 0 707 rwd r 0 814 and as r 0 804 also a negative correlation at the significance level was indicated between the bd content of soil and the rwd and as r 0 754 and r 0 714 moreover the correlation between rwd and as of soil was high and significant r 0 849 as regards the three particle size fractions sac was significantly correlated with sic r 0 764 and cc r 0 290 also sic showed a significant correlation with cc r 0 394 table 3 the application of pca to the scores of the soil samples obtained from the different species of natural and planted forestlands provided four principal components pcs which explained in total about 66 of the total variance of the soil properties in more detail pc1 and pc2 explained 44 and 22 of this variance respectively also pc3 and pc4 explained together about 11 of the variance of the soil properties omc bd rwd and as had significant loadings on pc1 over 0 73 while sand and silt significantly influenced the second pc with high loadings over 0 81 however clay content related to soil texture heavily weighed on pc3 loading of 0 958 table 4 moreover dc had significant loadings on pc4 over 0 7 in other words dc was associated with high value of bulk density and low values of organic matter root weight density and aggregate stability of soil indicated in pc1 while there was no relationship between dc and the three soil texture fractions table 4 and fig 4 a based on the plot of the sample scores on the first four pcs obvious differences were observed in soil properties among the species of studied natural and planted forestlands in total six well differentiated groups are indicated for the species of natural and planted forestlands with obvious overlapping of scores for the species planted ag qc and zc fig 4b 3 2 relationships between the dc and hydraulic parameters and estimation of kr tables 5 and 6 show power regression results between soil detachment capacity and hydraulic parameters associated with rill flow for plant species in the natural and planted forestlands in general all the equations were not suitable for simulating dc as shown by the values of the indexes evaluating the prediction capacity of these equations the comparative performance of these equations suggested that unit stream power collectively provides a better prediction for dc compared to the other hydraulic parameters tables 5 and 6 also among the hydraulic parameters unit energy is a poorer predictor of dc our data indicated that the best predictor of dc was the unit stream power for pp as a natural species and qc as a planted species when considering the rmse r2 and nse values the comparison of observed and predicted dc for pp and qc species indicates the soil detacment capacity in this study is well predicted by power unit stream power models figs 5 and 6 for all the studied species a linear relationship was found between shear stress and soil detachment capacity fig 7 according to the wepp model formulation the rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc were also estimated using the simple linear regression table 7 and they are considered as two of the most important parameters in rill erosion process by overland flow reflecting soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 it can be seen that there were clear differences in the rill erodibility and critical shear stress among various vegetal species in the forestland with the former values ranging from 0 0012 s m 1 to 0 0045 s m 1 and the latter values from 1 22 pa to 1 83 pa always significant at p 0 05 table 7 and fig 7 qc and pp showed the maximum and minimum values of kr respectively also the lowest and highest values of τc were observed in qc and cb soils respectively the rill erodibility of the soil with qc soil was 1 18 1 55 1 96 2 81 and 3 75 times greater than zc ag cb pt and pp soils while the critical shear stress of soils under cb was 1 50 1 33 1 22 1 11 and 1 06 times the values of qc zc pt ag and pp respectively the differences in kr values were significantly lower in species of natural forestland compared to the three other species of planted forestland table 7 4 discussion 4 1 the variations of soil detachment capacity and soil properties under the vegetal species it is well known how vegetal species of a given forestland affect soil properties and soil detachment capacity in various ways and at different rates e g mamo and bubenzer 2001a 2001b gyssels and poesen 2003 gyssels et al 2005 keller and håkansson 2010 zhang et al 2013 sroka et al 2018 wang et al 2018b shabanpour et al 2020 the change of the soil properties and hydrological characteristics under the different vegetal species is demonstrated by different authors working in iran kooch et al 2016 parhizkar et al 2020a sanji et al 2020 in this context the results of this study are consistent with these findings more specifically because all of the soils studied had similar soil texture silty clay loam class the present study provided deeper insights for clarifying the differences in soil detachment capacity among soils under the six species of natural and planted forestlands given this soil homogeneity the ecological differences among the investigated species combined with plantation management practices for zc qc and ag species in this forestland such as tillage timber harvesting and prescribed burning may play an important role in modifying the soil detachment capacity the differences in the type of species especially those that influence soil plant interactions affect the structure and functioning of ecosystems particularly for delicate forestland ecosystems lucas borja et al 2018 the distinctions in plant structures which vary between natural forest and planted forest can lead to the variability of soil properties our results revealed a significantly lower organic matter content in the species of planted forest qc zc ag than the species of natural forest pp pt cb according to wang et al 2018a the soil organic matter can be affected by the quantity of root weight density so the higher rwd in soils under natural forest and the increase of soil om could be expected compared to planted forest the observed increase in root weight density with considerable surface roughness and structure viles 1990 gyssels et al 2005 as well as soil organic matter in natural forest compared to planted forest can explain the lower bulk density values and the higher aggregate stability of the natural forest soil parhizkar et al 2020a this is also confirmed by the correlation analysis showing that rwd was positively correlated with om and as and negatively correlated with bd of soil furthermore the latter property in soils of natural forest was found to be lower because of the creation of continuous pores in soil by roots gyssels et al 2005 shinohara et al 2016 moreover it is considered that fine roots less than 1 mm in diameter can significantly decrease the bulk density of the soil li et al 1993 this agreed with meek et al 1992 who found that alfalfa roots with diameter of less than 1 mm increased the soil infiltration rate and decreased the bulk density the presence of plant root with different characteristics among plant species can improve the physical properties of soil and hence affect the process of soil detachment zhang et al 2013 li et al 2015 wang et al 2018b the calculated soil detachment capacity in this study for the studied forest species went in this direction in other words in this study the soil properties induced by the species of natural and planted forestlands and dc were significantly different among the six plant species under investigation the value of soil detachment capacity was significantly higher in the planted forest compared to the values measured in the natural forest likely some epochal incidents such as fire cycles technological development landslides and the effects of population density on vegetal species in the natural forest were lower than in the planted forest furthermore some improper management activities e g prescribed burning thinning and deforestation may have contributed to increasing the rill erosion in soils of planted forest this is consistent with the previous reports of parhizkar et al 2020a which showed that in delicate environment ecosystems such as the forestlands of northern iran surface soil disturbance and land use change by farming operations can increase the potential for water erosion these findings are consistent with numerous results in iran e g emadodin 2008 bahrami et al 2010 gholami et al 2016 shabanpour et al 2020 in qc and zc soils root weight density was the lowest and this shows the lowest soil resistance against concentrated flow conversely the lowest value of soil detachment capacity observed in pp soils the lower dc in the natural forest was most likely attributed to the higher root weight density this is consistent with the conclusions of many authors e g li et al 1991a li 1995 wang et al 2015 who concluded that plant roots play an essential role in decreasing soil detachment specifically in reducing rill erosion gyssels et al 2005 abdi et al 2010 stated that the resistance of a soil against shallow landslides can be enhanced by the characteristics of the root system of pp selected as one of species of natural forestland in our study the relationships between some key soil properties and dc also are confirmed by the correlation analysis here the dc was found to have a negative correlation with the root weight density and aggregate stability of sampled soils with the increase of om rwd and as soil mass became more stable which made the soil hard to be detached by concentrated flow and thus reduced the soil detachment capacity wang et al 2018b moreover soil properties improved by fibrous root systems with fine roots in the species of natural forest have powerful potential in reducing soil detachment capacity compared to the soils under the species of planted forest in other words this type of root system makes the soil more stable and less susceptible to rill erosion vannoppen et al 2017 wang et al 2018b therefore when developing robust plans for sustainable management of forest ecosystems we should select species that can improve soil properties to protect and conserve the soil to minimize soil erosion caused by water in this research using of pca analysis obviously set apart differences of soil properties in four significant pcs among studied species pc1 synthesized the properties of soil except for the textural characteristics among the three soil texture fractions sand and silt contents were associated with pc2 while the clay content showed a strong loading on pc3 however the soil detachment capacity had a strong loading on pc4 also according to the relationships between the properties of soil and soil detachment three vegetal species qc zc and ag were discriminated from pp pt and cb species as shown by the evident clusters arranged along a clear gradient on the first pc these observations provide evidence that soils with different properties grouped in distinct clusters among various vegetal species and their smaller spatial scales as suggested in the study by parhizkar et al 2020a and shabanpour et al 2020 4 2 the effects of hydraulic parameters on the soil detachment capacity and the variations of soil resistance to rill erosion beside the root characteristics and the soil properties the hydraulic parameters of the overland flow influence soil detachment capacity greatly nearing et al 1991 zhang et al 2002 in this study the regression analysis between dc and the hydraulic characteristics showed that similar to the power equations set in the previous study for another forestland in this province parhizkar et al 2020a the unit stream power had high accuracy to estimate the soil detachment capacity in both natural and planted forestlands this may be due to the fact that this hydraulic parameter simultaneously takes into account the soil slope and flow velocity both influencing the soil detachability due to the overland flow parhizkar et al 2020a some previous studies have also indicated that the flow characteristics can be used to estimate the soil detachment capacity by overland flow nearing et al 1991 zhang et al 2002 xiao et al 2017 li et al 2019 wu et al 2019 wang et al 2018b stated that the soil detachment capacity could be expressed as a series of power functions of unit stream power and other flow hydraulic factors of flowing water however some studies suggested that soil detachment capacity was better estimated using stream power with a power function nearing et al 1999 zhang et al 2002 the rill erodibility kr and critical shear stress τc reflect soil resistance to rill erosion nearing et al 1989 and are very sensitive input parameters of some process based erosion models wang et al 2016 such as the water erosion prediction project wepp laflen et al 1991 the rill detachment capacity of a soil due to the overland flow is strictly linked to these two parameters in this context it is important to compare the effects of the studied species in natural and planted forestlands on these parameters therefore in this study kr and τc were calculated though the linear regression between the measured dc and flow shear stress for the six vegetal species however these models showed the low coefficients of determination in the linear regression fitting dc to τ this result is different from the conclusions of zhang et al 2008 and parhizkar et al 2020a who stated that the regressions between dc and τ can be used to fit the observed data with high accuracy in the prediction of dc the higher values of kr in the planted forestland compared to the natural forestland again show the effects of forest management and type of plant species on soil erosion zhu et al 2019 it has been shown above that the lower rill erodibility detected in natural species compared to the other planted species in the forestland this result can be explained by roots with diameter lower than 1 mm known as effective roots in species of natural forestland this is similar as other studies li et al 1991b 1992 li 1995 provides corroborating evidence that concentrated flow erosion can be reduced by the effects of plant root on soil physical properties soil permeability and the resistance of the soil also among the species of natural forestland pp showed the lowest rill erodibility may be due to the improvement of soil properties by the roots of this species on the other hand the highest root density of pp species provided the highest resistance of the soil to rill erosion among all the studied species 5 conclusions the study showed that the soil properties and dc were strongly influenced by the six studied vegetal species the mean dc in soils under species of planted forestland was greater than that in soils under species of natural forestland moreover dc was also affected by some soil management operations in the planted forestland soil detachment capacity was negatively related to soil organic matter root weight density and water stable aggregate while it was positively related to soil bulk density these correlations can explain the differences in the dc induced by the different impacts of the plant root systems soil detachment capacity by overland flow could be well estimated by the unit stream power using power equations in both natural and planted forestlands in general this study is helpful to understanding the soil detachment rate in slopes under different species and suggests that some inappropriate soil management operations such as harvesting operations changes in tree species composition and forest fires may lead to soil disturbance and increase soil erosion by destroying some the characteristics of plant and

4796,it remains a great challenge to represent field scale e g meters to tens of meters heterogeneity in the ecohydrological modeling of large river basins due to the tradeoff between spatial resolution and computational cost this study improved an existing ecohydrological model heiflow by introducing the subgrid structure of land cover multilayer soil water simulation and accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid these improvements enable the model to provide reliable simulations over a wide spectrum of spatial scales from the field scale to the large basin scale i e 104 to 105 km2 the new model was implemented in the heihe river basin the second largest endorheic river basin in china with a grid size of 1 km by 1 km for a modeling domain of approximately 90 589 km2 the major study findings include the following first in arid areas with sparse vegetation ignoring the subgrid characteristics of land surfaces will lead to significant errors that may be further propagated when the modeling results are used to support management or scaled up for larger scale climate modeling second the multilayer soil structure can improve ecohydrological simulations in terms of temporal variations and it is necessary to separate a thin surface layer from the soil zone in arid areas in the case study a single layer soil structure would introduce greater than 10 error in simulating the annual maximum leaf area index lai third considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid cell is critical for successful simulations of ecohydrological processes in arid areas in the case study accurate spatial coverage would lead to 31 46 and 13 changes in the simulated average soil evaporation transpiration and lai respectively over the entire area with irrigation overall this study provides a unique perspective to address the scale issue in ecohydrological modeling and reveals the importance of field scale heterogeneity to the management of water resources and ecosystems based on ecohydrological modeling keywords ecohydrological modeling heiflow endorheic river basin arid region irrigation spatial heterogeneity 1 introduction arid and semiarid regions cover approximately 31 of the global land area nicholson 2011 ecosystems in these regions are under pressure due to intensive human competition for limited water resources foley et al 2011 pang et al 2018 reynolds et al 2007 and water scarcity food security and ecological degradation are common issues in these regions heinke et al 2011 huang et al 2015 kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 these issues commonly involve multiple resource systems e g water food and ecosystems that are inextricably linked nexus approaches are particularly useful for addressing these interconnected issues and achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs united nations 2015 nexus approaches originally focused on clarifying the links among physical resource systems and have been increasingly used to address interlinked environmental social and economic issues albrecht et al 2018 azmi et al 2011 ecosystem conservation is a hotspot of nexus research and some recent studies have addressed the complex water energy ecosystem nexus using a system modeling approach for example kuriqi et al 2020 studied the interlinkage between hydropower production and fish habitat conservation at a run of river hydropower plant in eastern portugal and chen et al 2020 analyzed the transboundary interrelationship among hydropower production agricultural irrigation and nutrient transport under the operation of cascade reservoirs in the mekong river basin the goals of the nexus approach include evaluating trade offs maximizing synergy improving efficiency and seeking co optimization liu et al 2015 ecohydrological models that can simulate hydrological processes e g streamflow evapotranspiration and groundwater flow vegetation dynamics e g the leaf area index crop yield and biomass and their interactions levison et al 2014 liu et al 2014 pribulick et al 2016 are particularly helpful in a quantitative nexus approach cai et al 2018 endo et al 2020 a number of ecohydrological models have been developed for different purposes including the soil and water assessment tool swat piniewski et al 2019 parflow community land model clm kollet and maxwell 2008 the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 mike she butts et al 2004 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 and awra l frost et al 2018 among others coupling ecological modules with hydrological models is a typical approach to developing ecohydrological models for example parflow clm provides the ability to simulate vegetation dynamics by coupling parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 with the widely used land surface model clm dai et al 2003 heiflow hydrological ecological integrated watershed scale flow model the model used in this study was also developed in this way tian et al 2018 however the existing ecohydrological models may have one or more of the following limitations first groundwater flow is often simplified resulting in the inaccurate simulation of surface water groundwater interactions which are critical in arid river basins for instance groundwater in swat is treated as tank storage and groundwater flow dynamics are also not explicitly simulated in vic second the ecological components of several models are relatively simple and they are coupled with the hydrological processes in a one way manner this approach limits the capability of the models to simulate dynamic feedback among ecohydrological processes for example both vic and mike she require the leaf area index lai as a model input to simulate the influence of vegetation on the local hydrological conditions but the effects of hydrology on vegetation are not considered third many models do not explicitly account for human activities such as diversion and irrigation processes which are critical in arid and semiarid regions effectively addressing these limitations of ecohydrological models is an important step in supporting human nature nexus approaches in heiflow the above limitations have been properly addressed tian et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 however the previous version of heiflow has its own limitations an important limitation is that the soil zone is treated as a single layer water storage unit which affects the simulation of soil water dynamics and its interaction with the ecological processes addressing this limitation is one of the major tasks in this study spatial heterogeneity is an important issue when modeling ecological and hydrological processes using grid based distributed models such as parflow clm mike she hydrogeosphere and heiflow in these models the grid cell is usually the basic computational unit and the physical properties of a grid cell such as topography soil texture and vegetation cover are usually assumed to be homogeneous however topography and soil properties e g soil hydraulic parameters are heterogeneous in nature and their heterogeneity across different scales has been investigated vereecken et al 2019 in arid areas vegetation can be sparse and represented by patches separated by bare land areas this heterogeneity is also called sparse vegetation heterogeneity were et al 2008 which can exist at a very small scale several to tens of meters in theory such small scale heterogeneity could be addressed by further reducing the grid size but the finer discretization would dramatically increase the computational burden and difficulty of model parameterization in large river basins an alternative is to account for subgrid variations of key land surface features for example each grid cell in clm is classified into a series of land response units lrus by considering the distributions of elevation and vegetation ke et al 2013 however this subgrid strategy is usually practiced in macroscale modeling with a grid size 1 km hamman et al 2018 ke et al 2012 lawrence et al 2019 the grid size for basin scale ecohydrological modeling is generally smaller e g 1 km how and whether it is necessary to implement the subgrid strategy to account for field scale heterogeneity particularly sparse vegetation heterogeneity in arid river basins is worthy of further study human activities also lead to field scale spatial heterogeneity agricultural activities such as cultivation and irrigation can vary from field to field within a small area where the agriculture is decentralized and not highly mechanized for example within an area of 1 km2 a typical size of a model grid different farmers may not irrigate their croplands on the same day in other words on a particular day with irrigation the irrigation water may reach only part of the croplands within the area however as ecohydrological modeling for large river basins usually considers a grid size much larger than the field scale such within grid variation is largely overlooked and an even coverage of irrigation water over the croplands would be assumed the strategies and relevance of accounting for such human induced heterogeneity remain an important issue to further explore this study improved the ecohydrological model heiflow tian et al 2018 to allow subgrid modeling and account for heterogeneity related to irrigation the new heiflow model was applied to the heihe river basin hrb which is the second largest endorheic river basin in china there exists a keen water conflict between the intensively irrigated agriculture in the middle hrb and vulnerable ecosystems in the lower hrb cheng et al 2014 a common challenge encountered in arid endorheic river basins globally dehghanipour et al 2020 yang et al 2020 yapiyev et al 2017 the main objectives of the study are 1 to develop an advanced ecohydrological model with high simulation accuracy over a wide spectrum of spatial scales from the field scale e g meters to tens of meters to the large basin scale i e 104 to 105 km2 and 2 to systematically evaluate the impact of field scale heterogeneities on simulations of soil moisture evapotranspiration et and lai across different spatial and temporal scales overall this study provides a unique perspective to address the scale issue in ecohydrological modeling and reveals the importance of field scale heterogeneity to the management of water resources and ecosystems based on ecohydrological modeling 2 the heiflow model 2 1 previous versions and new features heiflow tian et al 2018 is a physically based distributed three dimensional ecohydrological model that was developed by improving a representative integrated hydrological model gsflow coupled ground water and surface water flow model markstrom et al 2008 and coupling it with new ecological modules gsflow itself couples a surface water model prms precipitation runoff modeling system leavesley et al 1983 with a classic groundwater model modflow modular ground water flow model 2005 harbaugh 2005 prms simulates surface water processes such as canopy interception snowpack accumulation runoff infiltration evapotranspiration et and soil water flow and modflow simulates groundwater flow and the dynamics of surface water bodies i e streams and lakes to determine the water exchange between the soil zone and groundwater zone gsflow applies an iterative computing approach to solve the interdependent equations that govern surface water and groundwater flows the development of heiflow began with improving gsflow by enhancing its capability to simulate highly engineered flow systems tian et al 2015a sun et al 2018 developed a general ecohydrological module gehm and coupled it with the improved version of gsflow to create an ecohydrological model called gsflow gehm gehm adopts heat unity theory to regulate the growth cycle of vegetation and can simulate the dynamics of a series of basic ecological indicators including the vegetation biomass lai canopy height and root depth tian et al 2018 further expanded this ecohydrological model to accept time varying land use input and the improved model was first named heiflow as a graphical data processing and modeling system visual heiflow was then developed to prepare the input files run the model and visualize the model outputs with this visualization tool the difficulty in building and using the heiflow model was greatly reduced tian et al 2018 while heiflow enables the representation of irrigation systems with both surface water diversion and groundwater pumping it still requires daily diversion and pumping data as external model inputs recently zheng et al 2020 developed a water resource allocation module wra to internally simulate demand based diversion and pumping rates driven by meteorological conditions subject to ecological constraints in this study the heiflow model is further developed with the following new features first in addition to gehm a populus eco module pem li et al 2017 specifically designed for populus euphratica p euphratica is coupled with heiflow the coupling method of pem and heiflow is the same as that used in gsflow gehm sun et al 2018 populus euphratica is a rare ancient and endangered phreatophytic species that is mainly distributed in arid and semiarid regions of central and western asia north africa and southern europe this species plays an important role in maintaining ecological services in arid areas as it can adjust its stomatal activity to adapt to different groundwater depths and control its water use and photosynthesis behaviors under drought stress pem includes a coupled gas exchange submodel to simulate photosynthesis and transpiration rates based on stomatal activity in the new version of heiflow the hydrological model and gehm operate with a daily time step and pem adopts an hourly time step water exchange between the hydrological model and the two ecological modules is calculated on a daily basis therefore in addition to daily meteorological data hourly data should also be prepared for the pem second the soil zone module is modified to allow subgrid scale multilayer soil water simulation in the original version of gsflow and the previous version of heiflow each grid can be either completely covered by vegetation or completely bare and the soil zone of each grid is treated as a single layer water storage unit in this study the soil zone of each grid is horizontally divided into two parts the vegetated area part and the bare area part to represent the finer scale heterogeneity within the grid and the soil zone is vertically discretized into multiple layers to simulate the soil moisture profile details of the modifications are described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 third the new heiflow model improves the soil water simulation by accurately representing the spatial coverage of irrigation activities in the previous model version when a grid is irrigated in one time step the water is assumed to be evenly supplied to the entire vegetated area in the grid however in real world settings the irrigation water may be irrigated to only part of the vegetated area in one time step as the grid size for basin scale modeling is usually no less than 1 km details of the method are given in section 2 3 2 2 finer scale spatiotemporal discretization in heiflow the surface domain ranging from the vegetation canopy to the bottom of the soil zone is horizontally divided into a series of uniform grids and each surface grid is called a hydrological research unit hru the hrus should be numbered in a particular order for example from top left to bottom right as illustrated in fig 1 the subsurface domain i e the aquifer system beneath the surface domain is discretized with a finite difference grid and the finite difference cells also referred to as groundwater cells are numbered with a row index a column index and a layer index fig 1 for a groundwater cell active means that the cell is in the modeling domain and the groundwater head and flow will be calculated inactive means that the cell will be ignored during the simulation horizontally the groundwater cells have the same rectangular shapes as the hrus above them there are two types of hrus land and lake hrus in the new heiflow model for land hrus the soil zone is vertically discretized into multiple layers and horizontally divided into two parts i e the vegetated part and the bare part a parameter the vegetation coverage ratio denoted by vcr is assigned to each hru to specify the area of the vegetated part as illustrated by the gradient color in fig 1 as heiflow accepts changing land use vcr can have different values in different modeling periods the lake hrus are assumed to be completely covered by water with no soil water dynamics or vegetation growth involved in heiflow streams including rivers canals and ditches are divided into a combination of segments based on the relevant geometry connectivity and boundary conditions then each segment is discretized into a group of reaches a reach is a section of a stream that is associated with a groundwater cell or an hru the reaches of a segment should be numbered sequentially from upstream to downstream 2 3 refined soil water simulation in the original gsflow model the soil zone of each hru is treated as a single layer water storage unit and conceptualized as three reservoirs the capillary reservoir cpr the gravity reservoir gvr and the preferential flow reservoir pfr fig 2 a these reservoirs occupy the same physical space and refer to storages between specific soil water content thresholds i e the wilting point the field capacity the moisture content at saturation and a user specified pfr threshold the cpr is the thin film around the soil particles the gvr is the pore water next to the cpr films and the pfr is distributed in the central areas of pore water fig 2b the total water storage in the soil zone can be obtained by adding the cpr gvr and pfr storages these reservoirs are separated to represent different soil water processes water in the cpr cannot flow downward or laterally and can be removed only by evaporation and transpiration water in the gvr and pfr can flow but cannot be evaporated or transpired directly the gvr can provide drainage to the groundwater aquifer below and receive groundwater discharge water in the gvr can also flow laterally within the soil zone water in the pfr cannot drain downward to groundwater and is available only for lateral flow because the lateral flow from the pfr through relatively large soil pores is much faster than that from the gvr the lateral flows from the pfr and gvr are referred to herein as fast interflow and slow interflow respectively additional details on the functions of the reservoirs were given by markstrom et al 2008 the soil zone in the modified heiflow can be discretized into multiple layers and the thickness of different layers can be different e g 3 layers in fig 2c horizontally the soil zone is divided into a vegetated part and a bare part as described in section 2 2 the three reservoirs cpr gvr and pfr are now conceptualized for each soil layer in the vegetated part and the bare part fig 2c water storage in different layers of the vegetated part or the bare part can be calculated by adding the storage volumes of the corresponding cpr gvr and pfr with this new discretization the original code for soil water simulation has been completely rewritten in the modified soil zone module soil water processes in the vegetated part and the bare part are simulated separately first the vegetated part and then the bare part the simulation process for each part in one time step can be divided into three main stages fig 3 adding groundwater discharge to the soil zone stage 1 adding infiltration and inflows from upslope hrus stage 2 and computing et and replenishing the cprs stage 3 this computational sequence is similar to that in gsflow fig 3 illustrates how water is routed within the soil profile in stage 1 fig 3a the discharged groundwater if it occurs first enters the gvr of the lowest soil layer if the cpr in the same layer is not fully filled it is replenished by the gvr after replenishment excess water in gvr if any is added to the pfr in the same layer similarly excess water in pfr if any goes to the upper layer this calculation is repeated toward the top layer or is stopped when no excess water is available for the next layer excess water in the top layer becomes surface runoff i e dunnian runoff in stage 2 infiltration is first calculated and added to the gvr of the top layer and hortonian runoff due to excess infiltration is estimated then the cpr in the same layer is replenished if it is not fully filled next slow interflow and gravity drainage from the gvr are calculated and the drainage volume is added to the lower layer if the gvr still has excess water the excess water moves to the pfr in the same layer which generates fast interflow any excess water in the pfr after the generation of fast interflow becomes dunnian runoff the same calculation is performed for the lower layers the interflows slow and fast and gravity drainage calculated in this stage are passed to downslope hrus and the underlying groundwater cell because the gravity drainage also depends on the conditions of the groundwater cell all or part of the drainage may be rejected and readded following stage 1 to the soil zone it should be noted that if irrigation occurs in a given time step the vegetated part is further divided into an irrigated area and a nonirrigated area and the irrigation water is added only to the irrigated area in this case the calculation illustrated in fig 3b is performed separately for the irrigated and nonirrigated areas first and the results are then averaged over irrigated and nonirrigated areas to obtain the results for the entire vegetated part in stage 3 fig 3c evaporation e and transpiration t are computed separately for the vegetated part and only e is computed for the bare part after removing the water for e and t the cprs are replenished by the gvrs and pfrs in the same layer after the calculation of et in the soil zone the unused potential t is available to the underlying unsaturated and saturated zones if the root depth of the vegetation is beneath the soil zone similar to the approach in gsflow transpiration from the unsaturated zone is calculated using a kinematic wave approximation of richards equation and transpiration from the saturated zone is calculated by using the method employed in the modflow evapotranspiration package as stated above the vegetated part of an hru is further divided into an irrigated area and a nonirrigated area on irrigation days to account for the irrigation induced heterogeneity the irrigated area is estimated by specifying the irrigation depth for each hru as follows 1 air r i t v i r r i t h i r r i where air r i t is the irrigated area of the ith hru on day t vir r i t is the amount of irrigation water for the ith hru on day t and the irrigation depth hir r i is the amount of water applied to the irrigated area at one time in the ith hru in length if the calculated air r i t value is larger than the vegetated area it is set equal to the vegetated area unlike the vegetated part and bare part which have fixed areas the irrigated area varies with the amount of irrigation water supplied each day if there is no irrigation on a given day the irrigated area will be 0 full details of the soil water simulation are provided in the supplementary materials 3 data and methods 3 1 the study area the study area is the hrb which is the second largest endorheic river basin in china located in the arid region of northwestern china fig 4 the heihe river originates from the qilian mountains in the southern part of the basin and flows northward for more than 900 km to two terminal lakes west and east juyan lakes the main river diverges into the east river and the west river at langxin mountain fig 4a the hrb can be naturally divided into upstream midstream and downstream areas where yingluoxia on the mainstream is the divide between the upstream area and the midstream area and zhengyixia is the divide between the midstream and downstream areas in this study the modeling domain covers the midstream and downstream areas of the hrb and a portion of the badain jaran desert fig 4c which is the same as the domains used in tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 the total modeling area is 90 589 km2 there is a large area of farmland in the midstream area accounting for more than 95 of the farmland in the whole basin agricultural areas are mainly distributed in the oases along rivers the farmland area has increased notably in recent decades the farmland area was 5 526 1 km2 in 2000 accounting for approximately 20 4 of the midstream area by 2011 the farmland area had increased to 6006 7 km2 23 5 with a growth rate of approximately 14 9 fig 4d shows the expansion of farmland from 2000 to 2011 most of which occurred in the marginal areas of existing farmland the rest of the midstream area consists of grassland wetland forest urban and desert zones the area of each land use type and the changes in these areas are summarized in table 1 based on three land use maps for the years 2000 2007 and 2011 liu et al 2002 hu et al 2015 the average annual precipitation in the midstream area is approximately 153 4 mm year due to the dry climate the farmland in this area is intensively irrigated via a complicated irrigation system that includes a main intake structure and different levels of canals reservoirs and wells li et al 2018 the downstream area is dominated by desert greater than 90 and there are some natural and artificial oases along the river fig 4a the climate in the downstream area is extremely dry and the annual precipitation is only 58 2 mm year the limited water resources discharged from the midstream area are critical to sustain the riparian ecosystem 3 2 model setup and data sources the heiflow model of the hrb established in this study is developed on the basis of the gsflow model and the gsflow gehm model previously developed by tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 respectively both the surface and subsurface domains were delineated into 90 589 uniform 1 km 1 km grids horizontally the subsurface domain was further divided into five layers including one shallow unconfined aquifer two confined aquifers and two aquitards the soil zone of each hru was discretized into four layers including a very thin surface layer 25 4 mm i e 1 in and three lower layers of the same thickness the parameters of physical soil properties such as the field capacity saturation moisture level and thickness of the soil zone were determined based on a soil database of china for land surface modeling shangguan et al 2013 the subgrid structure of hrus i e the vegetated part and the bare part was determined based on land use maps to reflect the land use changes the entire simulation period from 2000 to 2015 was divided into three periods corresponding to three land use maps for the years 2000 2007 and 2011 the three periods were 2000 2003 2004 2009 and 2010 2015 there were 24 205 26 163 and 26 227 hrus with vegetated parts for the years 2000 2007 and 2011 respectively the other hrus were completely bare two parameters vcr and vegetation type were determined for each hru it should be noted that heiflow assumes only one vegetation type for each hru if there are multiple vegetation types in an hru the type with the largest area will be selected there are 612 hrus covered by p euphratica forest and these hrus were simulated by the pem the remaining hrus were simulated by the gehm in this study there were 16 vegetation types simulated by gehm including three types of trees three types of shrubs four grass plants two wetland plants and four types of crops most of the vegetation parameters for the gehm and the pem adopted the values in sun et al 2018 and li et al 2017 respectively with respect to agricultural irrigation the total irrigation area of the hrb was divided into 46 irrigation districts fig 4c tian et al 2015b and each irrigation district contained a number of hrus the hrus in the same irrigation district adopted the same water management operations the irrigation activities i e daily stream diversions and groundwater pumping rates for each irrigation district were simulated by the recently developed wra module zheng et al 2020 to address the heterogeneity caused by irrigation the irrigation depth i e hirri in eq 1 was determined by dividing the average annual irrigation amount by the irrigation frequency according to the investigations of local water resource authorities the irrigation frequency was approximately 6 times per year the irrigation depths for different irrigation districts ranged from 50 mm to 100 mm with an average of 67 4 mm the data used to establish the heiflow model in this study are the same as those in tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 table s2 in the supplementary materials table 2 lists the data used to calibrate validate and cross verify the model to calibrate and validate the hydrological part of the model we collected streamflow observations at four gaging stations gao ai zhengyixia shaomaying and langxin mountain in fig 4a and water level observations at 66 monitoring wells fig 4c for the ecological part the simulated lai was calibrated and validated against the remote sensing data product lai yuan to cross verify the model performance the simulated et was compared with etwatch data remote sensing data product and field observations obtained at 10 stations stations 1 10 in figs 4a and 4d and the simulated soil moisture was compared with the remote sensing data product esa cci sm and observations obtained at 2 stations stations a and b in figs 4a and 4d station b for the soil moisture measurements and station 8 for the et observations are in the same location 3 3 numerical experiments the model introduced in the above section is the baseline model hereafter labeled as p2 l4 i1 where p2 represents the subgrid structure of the soil zone i e 2 parts l4 indicates the 4 layer soil zone and i1 indicates that the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation is considered when calibrating p2 l4 i1 the first year i e 2000 is used as the warm up period and 2001 2008 8 years and 2009 2015 7 years are used as the calibration and validation periods respectively most of the model parameters are set to the same values used by tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 these parameters include surface runoff parameters streamflow parameters and groundwater parameters only the soil zone parameters e g the interflow parameters and some vegetation parameters are calibrated manually in a trial and error manner the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are used to evaluate the modeling results in addition to p2 l4 i1 we also established three models in parallel namely p1 l1 i0 p2 l1 i0 and p2 l4 i0 to evaluate the relevance of the model modifications introduced in section 2 of these three models p1 l1 i0 does not apply the subgrid structure indicated by p1 the soil zones in p1 l1 i0 and p2 l1 i0 are not discretized indicated by l1 and none of these models considers the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation indicated by i0 in the setup of p1 l1 i0 hrus with vcr values greater than the predefined thresholds are assumed to be fully covered by vegetation and other hrus are considered entirely bare hrus the thresholds for the midstream area downstream area and badain jaran desert fig 4c are set to 0 4 0 3 and 0 3 respectively the impact of subgrid scale modeling can be evaluated by comparing the simulation results of p1 l1 i0 and p2 l1 i0 similarly the simulation results of p2 l1 i0 and p2 l4 i0 are compared to investigate the performance of the multilayer soil zone structure the simulation results of p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 are compared to evaluate the effect on ecohydrological modeling when considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation as stated above p2 l4 i1 i e the baseline model was calibrated manually in a trial and error manner after calibration the nses at the four gaging stations in both the calibration period and validation period were all above 0 8 in particular for the two stations in the midstream area gao ai and zhengyixia the nses were close to 0 9 table s1 in the supplementary materials the rmses of the four stations were relatively small at approximately 8 0 m3 s table s1 this finding indicates that the calibrated model generally reproduces the streamflow of the heihe river as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the simulated groundwater levels at 66 monitoring wells were also compared to the corresponding observations during the calibration and validation periods the results showed that the groundwater simulation results agree well with the observations as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials overall the model performance is slightly better than that of the previous modeling results sun et al 2018 in the calibration period the simulated lai was compared with the remote sensing based lai product lai yuan the calibration results show that the model successfully reproduced the vegetation growth in both midstream and downstream areas where the nses are all approximately 0 90 in both the calibration and validation periods fig s2 in the supplementary materials the spatial distributions of the simulated lai and the remote sensing based data were also compared and the spatial patterns are very similar fig s3 in the supplementary materials et is usually the dominant component of the hydrological cycle in endorheic basins and can also be used as an ecological indicator for vegetation growth to cross verify the model the simulated et is compared with the remote sensing based et product etwatch the results show that the spatial distribution of and temporal variations in the simulated et are basically consistent with the etwatch data figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary materials the consistency is generally the same as but overall slightly better than that achieved by sun et al 2018 overall the ecological modeling part of heiflow was effectively calibrated as well 4 2 relevance of subgrid heterogeneity in land cover subgrid modeling is particularly important for areas with sparse vegetation fig 5 illustrates the spatial distributions of simulated lai and et based on p2 l4 i1 in two sample regions the model renders fine scale i e resolution of the land use map spatial variations in lai and et which enables the model to effectively support management of water resources and ecosystems while basin scale ecohydrological modeling with a grid size of 1 km already represents a high resolution it is still too coarse to guide real world management efforts such as precision irrigation revegetation and restricted grazing it should also be noted that our strategy to handle the subgrid structure does not require a significant increase in computational cost in contrast to reach the spatial resolution in fig 5 by using a finer model grid the computational cost would be prohibitive the main difference between models with and without a subgrid structure the et of p2 l1 i0 minus the et of p1 l1 i0 is further illustrated in fig 6 taking et as an example fig 6a shows the distribution of the differences between the simulated et at the original 1 km 1 km scale and each grid corresponds to one dot in the first column of fig 6d as shown the difference is significant and in some hrus this difference can be as high as 150 the red areas are mainly distributed in the downstream area and the northwestern part of the midstream area because the vegetation in these areas is sparse if the subgrid structure is not applied the vegetation in these areas will be ignored by the model p1 l1 i0 in theory when the simulation results are upscaled i e aggregating data to a coarser resolution the spatial differences will decrease to determine the scale at which the models with and without a subgrid structure behave similarly the simulated et values were aggregated from the 1 km 1 km resolution to the resolution of 50 km 50 km with a resolution increment of 1 km figs 6b and 6c show the distribution of et differences at the 20 km 20 km and 50 km 50 km scales respectively compared with those in the left graph the colors in the right two graphs are lighter indicating that the spatial differences in et are smaller fig 6d shows the percentages of et differences at all 50 scales it is obvious that as the scale increases the differences in et diminish the rate of diminishment is fast before 10 km and becomes gradual thereafter when the grid size increases to 20 km the et differences range from 11 6 to 12 7 and when it increases to 50 km the range is reduced to 7 4 6 9 however the basin wide et obtained with p1 l1 i0 and p2 l1 i0 is 143 02 mm year and 141 99 mm year respectively where the relative change is only 0 7 although the results in fig 6 are case dependent the results indicate that considering the subgrid structure will lead to significant simulation differences in areas with sparse vegetation and such differences can remain significant when the simulation results are scaled up within a certain range of scale this issue is important when coupling ecohydrological models or lsms with climate models regional or global scale ecohydrological models or lsms typically use fine scales e g 1 km 20 km compared with those of climate models e g 10 km 60 km for regional climate models and 100 km 250 km for global climate models and their inputs and outputs need to be scaled up to match those of climate models therefore in areas with sparse vegetation ignoring the subgrid characteristics of land surfaces can lead to significant errors in ecohydrological modeling that may consequently impact large scale climate modeling 4 3 model performance enhanced by soil stratification soil stratification is another major improvement of the new heiflow model to assess the multilayer structure the soil moisture simulated by the single layer model i e p2 l1 i0 and the multilayer model i e p2 l4 i0 was compared with the remote sensing based soil moisture product esa cci sm the esa cci sm product is representative of the first few centimeters of the soil 0 5 cm dorigo et al 2017 therefore the soil moisture in the first layer is used for comparison the first layer in the multilayer models is 25 4 mm i e 1 in and the first layer in the single layer model is the entire soil zone fig 7 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean soil moisture over time obtained from the remote sensing product and heiflow in general the two heiflow models lead to results with a similar spatial pattern as the remote sensing product the high soil moisture values are concentrated in the piedmont areas i e the south and west of the basin and the riparian areas and the soil in the badain jaran desert is relatively dry the soil moisture level simulated by the multilayer model is slightly lower than the remote sensing based value but the difference is not significant as shown in the corresponding scatter plots fig s6 in the supplementary materials the r2 value of the multilayer model for this comparison of the spatial distribution is 0 81 and the r2 value of the single layer model is only 0 70 the relative change in soil moisture is used to reflect the temporal variance the relative change is calculated by subtracting the multiyear mean soil moisture from the original monthly soil moisture as shown in fig 7b the multilayer model produces more similar time series compared with the remote sensing product than the single layer model especially when the soil moisture begins to decrease after a peak value is reached the soil moisture simulated by the multilayer model decreases rapidly and the rate of decline of the single layer model is much slower this effect occurs because water evaporates preferentially from the thin first soil layer the r2 value of the multilayer model is 0 69 and the r2 value of the single layer model is only 0 46 fig s6 in the supplementary materials overall the simulation results of the multilayer model are closer to the remote sensing product which reflects the importance of the multilayer structure especially the separation of a thin first layer fig 8 further examines the impact of the discretization of the soil zone on ecohydrological modeling fig 8a shows the time series of average soil water storage in the soil zone simulated by models p2 l1 i0 i e single layer model and p2 l4 i0 i e multilayer model the results show that the two models predicted notably different soil water storages on some days the difference excluding the effect of different initial values was as high as 10 mm which is equivalent to 9 06 108 m3 of water this difference is due to the different et processes predicted by the two models as shown in fig s7 in the supplementary materials fig 8b compares the basin wide average et simulated by the two models with each point corresponding to one day in the simulation period the scatter plot shows that the daily et predicted by the two models is significantly different the et difference was strongly correlated with precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0 70 fig 8c shows the dynamics of et and soil moisture simulated by the single layer model and the multilayer model when precipitation occurs although the soil moisture of the entire soil zone simulated by the multilayer model red solid line in the lower graph in fig 8c is lower than that simulated by the single layer model the et red solid line in the upper graph in fig 8c is much higher than that of the single layer model specifically the soil in the hrb is usually dry due to the arid climate conditions therefore in the multilayer model the precipitation is mostly trapped in the upper part of the soil zone which results in a rapid increase in the soil moisture in the upper layers especially in the thin surface layer purple dashed line in the lower graph in fig 8c the high soil moisture level leads to rapid evaporation and transpiration however in the single layer model precipitation is evenly added to the soil zone and soil moisture increases slowly therefore et does not increase significantly this effect has been reported in other studies such as that of xu and xie 2001 it should be noted that in arid regions the effect of a thin surface layer on et is greater than in humid regions therefore it is necessary to apply the multilayer structure to effectively represent the et and soil water processes in these regions fig 8d also compares the average et e and t obtained with the single layer and multilayer models the average et values of the single layer and the multilayer models are very close at 141 99 mm year and 141 07 mm year respectively however the e estimated by the multilayer model is higher 4 75 mm year and the t is lower 5 67 mm year this difference is also reflected in the ecological simulation as shown in fig 8e the annual maximum lai simulated by the single layer model is approximately 11 higher than that obtained by the multilayer model it is worth pointing out that figs 8d and 8e present basin wide results and the differences between the two models are larger in farmland approximately 13 where intensive irrigation signifies the necessity of soil stratification overall figs 7 and 8 indicate that the multilayer structure can better simulate the dynamics of soil water and ecological processes than the single layer model due to the fine scale description of physical processes 4 4 impact of the spatial coverage of irrigation compared to p2 l4 i0 i e irrigation water evenly distributed over the entire vegetated area in a grid cell with irrigation p2 l4 i1 i e irrigation water distributed over the vegetated area that is actually irrigated in a given time step led to 31 46 and 13 changes in the simulated average e t and lai respectively over the entire area with irrigation fig 9 compares the daily irrigation area irrigation depth and soil water storage in the midstream area simulated by heiflow with i e p2 l4 i1 and without i e p2 l4 i0 considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation fig 9a shows the daily irrigation water volume simulated by the wra module zheng et al 2020 for the first four years of the simulation period to provide a clear illustration this volume is approximately 2 27 109 m3 year with a maximum irrigation rate of 2 31 107 m3 day in p2 l4 i0 the irrigation water is evenly distributed to all vegetated areas of the irrigated hrus therefore the corresponding irrigation area red area in fig 9b corresponding to the left axis is very large with a maximum of 5396 km2 this approach results in a very low average irrigation depth blue line in fig 9b corresponding to the right axis with a maximum of 7 mm as a result most of the irrigation water is trapped in the upper soil layers and the lower layers cannot be effectively irrigated fig 9c shows the daily irrigation area red areas and average irrigation depth blue line simulated by p2 l4 i1 which considers the specific spatial coverage of irrigation the daily irrigation area is relatively small and the maximum is less than 315 km2 but the water depth on the irrigated areas is much higher fig 9c represents a more realistic situation in which the time schedule of irrigation varies across farms in reality it is rare that all farmlands over the large basin are irrigated simultaneously on a particular day as a result in p2 l4 i1 the irrigation water is more likely to flow into lower layers in the estimated irrigation areas the soil water storage simulated by the two models figs 9d and 9e confirmed this effect the soil water storage in the lower layers i e layer 3 and layer 4 simulated by p2 l4 i1 is significantly greater than that simulated by p2 l4 i0 the soil moisture simulated by the two models was further compared with the soil moisture measurements at two stations station a and station b in fig 4 because soil moisture is directly influenced by irrigation activities the time series of in situ observations at the field scale can be quite different from the simulated average soil moisture at the subgrid scale fig s8 in the supplementary materials thus the comparison considers time averaged values of soil moisture and focuses on the variation in soil moisture across different soil layers as illustrated in fig 10 station a is located in a farmland hru in the midstream area and station b is located in a forest hru in the downstream area both hrus are irrigated when considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation the baseline model i e p2 l4 i1 produces the same trend as the measurements and the lower the soil layer is the higher the soil moisture level however p2 l4 i0 led to the opposite soil moisture profile because most irrigation water was trapped in the upper soil layers this result indicates that it is important to consider the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation activities to produce reliable simulation results of the soil moisture levels in irrigated lands of arid basins we also compared the et simulated by p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 with the observations at 10 stations fig 4 in this case the time series of simulated and observed et were directly compared fig 11 a shows the nse values for each station based on the two models the first 6 stations are located in vegetated areas and the other 4 stations are located in bare areas with the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation considered the nses of the first 6 stations increased significantly this finding indicates that the et simulations in irrigation areas improved due to the enhanced simulation of soil water the time series of the simulations obtained by p2 l4 i1 and the observed values at all the 10 stations are shown in fig s9 in the supplementary materials as an example figs 11b and 11c show the et and its partitioning at station 8 i e station b for the soil moisture measurements simulated by p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 respectively because the irrigation water is trapped in the upper layers especially the first layer in p2 l4 i0 fig 10b soil evaporation was overestimated and the contribution of t to et was only 23 this influence will inevitably affect the simulation of vegetation growth however in p2 l4 i1 the irrigation water can flow to the lower layers fig 10b the evaporation loss is comparatively small and more irrigation water uptake by plants occurs the t et simulated by p2 l4 i1 is 64 this value agrees well with the results reported by liu et al 2018 where the average t et for a forest ecosystem in the downstream area of the hrb was estimated to be 60 in addition the temporal variation in et simulated by p2 l4 i1 is generally consistent with the observations the lai simulations at this station obtained by p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 were also compared fig s10 in the supplementary materials the average lai simulated by p2 l4 i1 was 27 higher than that simulated by p2 l4 i0 in conclusion the results indicate that the accurate description of irrigation induced soil water processes is important for the simulation of vegetation processes in arid areas 5 conclusions in this study the previously built ecohydrological model heiflow was improved by introducing the subgrid structure of land cover multilayer soil water simulation and accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid cell heiflow is now able to model ecohydrological processes over a wide spectrum of spatial scales from the field scale e g meters to tens of meters to the large basin scale i e 104 to 105 km2 which is an important advance because few existing models can maintain field scale accuracy when applied in large basins the improved heiflow was then implemented in the hrb the second largest endorheic river basin in china with a grid size of 1 km by 1 km this study represents one of the few attempts to evaluate the impact of field scale heterogeneity on basin scale management of water resources and ecosystems using an integrated modeling approach the major study findings include the following first accounting for subgrid heterogeneities can significantly improve the spatial accuracy of the model simulations in areas with sparse vegetation ignoring the subgrid characteristics of land surfaces will lead to significant errors that may be further propagated when the modeling results are used to support management or scaled up for larger scale climate modeling e g 10 60 km for regional climate models and 100 250 km for global climate models second the multilayer soil structure can improve ecohydrological simulations in terms of temporal variations in arid areas it is necessary to separate a thin surface layer from the soil zone to simulate rapid evaporation after water input events for example in the case study a single layer soil structure would introduce more than 10 error in simulating the annual maximum lai third considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid is critical for successful simulations of soil water et and vegetation growth processes in arid areas in the case study the accurate spatial coverage led to 31 46 and 13 changes in the simulated average e t and lai respectively over the entire area with irrigation overall this study presents a unique perspective on the scale issue in ecohydrological modeling the findings have important implications for developing continental or global models of water and energy cycling from groundwater into the atmosphere keune et al 2016 a major challenge for the hydrological community at present as the study results indicate the appropriate resolutions for discretizing both horizontally and vertically the modeling domain which balances computation burden and simulation error largely depend on local conditions of vegetation soil and human activities thus a spatially varying discretizing scheme may be preferable in future modeling efforts in addition some limitations of heiflow need to be addressed by future studies for example nutrient cycling has not been explicitly accounted for by heiflow and therefore the model simulation under nutrient limited situations may involve additional errors moreover although the simple two part subgrid structure works well for the sparse vegetation landscape in the hrb a more complex landscape may require a more sophisticated subgrid structure credit authorship contribution statement feng han data curation methodology formal analysis funding acquisition writing original draft yi zheng conceptualization

4796,it remains a great challenge to represent field scale e g meters to tens of meters heterogeneity in the ecohydrological modeling of large river basins due to the tradeoff between spatial resolution and computational cost this study improved an existing ecohydrological model heiflow by introducing the subgrid structure of land cover multilayer soil water simulation and accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid these improvements enable the model to provide reliable simulations over a wide spectrum of spatial scales from the field scale to the large basin scale i e 104 to 105 km2 the new model was implemented in the heihe river basin the second largest endorheic river basin in china with a grid size of 1 km by 1 km for a modeling domain of approximately 90 589 km2 the major study findings include the following first in arid areas with sparse vegetation ignoring the subgrid characteristics of land surfaces will lead to significant errors that may be further propagated when the modeling results are used to support management or scaled up for larger scale climate modeling second the multilayer soil structure can improve ecohydrological simulations in terms of temporal variations and it is necessary to separate a thin surface layer from the soil zone in arid areas in the case study a single layer soil structure would introduce greater than 10 error in simulating the annual maximum leaf area index lai third considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid cell is critical for successful simulations of ecohydrological processes in arid areas in the case study accurate spatial coverage would lead to 31 46 and 13 changes in the simulated average soil evaporation transpiration and lai respectively over the entire area with irrigation overall this study provides a unique perspective to address the scale issue in ecohydrological modeling and reveals the importance of field scale heterogeneity to the management of water resources and ecosystems based on ecohydrological modeling keywords ecohydrological modeling heiflow endorheic river basin arid region irrigation spatial heterogeneity 1 introduction arid and semiarid regions cover approximately 31 of the global land area nicholson 2011 ecosystems in these regions are under pressure due to intensive human competition for limited water resources foley et al 2011 pang et al 2018 reynolds et al 2007 and water scarcity food security and ecological degradation are common issues in these regions heinke et al 2011 huang et al 2015 kim et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 these issues commonly involve multiple resource systems e g water food and ecosystems that are inextricably linked nexus approaches are particularly useful for addressing these interconnected issues and achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs united nations 2015 nexus approaches originally focused on clarifying the links among physical resource systems and have been increasingly used to address interlinked environmental social and economic issues albrecht et al 2018 azmi et al 2011 ecosystem conservation is a hotspot of nexus research and some recent studies have addressed the complex water energy ecosystem nexus using a system modeling approach for example kuriqi et al 2020 studied the interlinkage between hydropower production and fish habitat conservation at a run of river hydropower plant in eastern portugal and chen et al 2020 analyzed the transboundary interrelationship among hydropower production agricultural irrigation and nutrient transport under the operation of cascade reservoirs in the mekong river basin the goals of the nexus approach include evaluating trade offs maximizing synergy improving efficiency and seeking co optimization liu et al 2015 ecohydrological models that can simulate hydrological processes e g streamflow evapotranspiration and groundwater flow vegetation dynamics e g the leaf area index crop yield and biomass and their interactions levison et al 2014 liu et al 2014 pribulick et al 2016 are particularly helpful in a quantitative nexus approach cai et al 2018 endo et al 2020 a number of ecohydrological models have been developed for different purposes including the soil and water assessment tool swat piniewski et al 2019 parflow community land model clm kollet and maxwell 2008 the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 mike she butts et al 2004 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 and awra l frost et al 2018 among others coupling ecological modules with hydrological models is a typical approach to developing ecohydrological models for example parflow clm provides the ability to simulate vegetation dynamics by coupling parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 with the widely used land surface model clm dai et al 2003 heiflow hydrological ecological integrated watershed scale flow model the model used in this study was also developed in this way tian et al 2018 however the existing ecohydrological models may have one or more of the following limitations first groundwater flow is often simplified resulting in the inaccurate simulation of surface water groundwater interactions which are critical in arid river basins for instance groundwater in swat is treated as tank storage and groundwater flow dynamics are also not explicitly simulated in vic second the ecological components of several models are relatively simple and they are coupled with the hydrological processes in a one way manner this approach limits the capability of the models to simulate dynamic feedback among ecohydrological processes for example both vic and mike she require the leaf area index lai as a model input to simulate the influence of vegetation on the local hydrological conditions but the effects of hydrology on vegetation are not considered third many models do not explicitly account for human activities such as diversion and irrigation processes which are critical in arid and semiarid regions effectively addressing these limitations of ecohydrological models is an important step in supporting human nature nexus approaches in heiflow the above limitations have been properly addressed tian et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 however the previous version of heiflow has its own limitations an important limitation is that the soil zone is treated as a single layer water storage unit which affects the simulation of soil water dynamics and its interaction with the ecological processes addressing this limitation is one of the major tasks in this study spatial heterogeneity is an important issue when modeling ecological and hydrological processes using grid based distributed models such as parflow clm mike she hydrogeosphere and heiflow in these models the grid cell is usually the basic computational unit and the physical properties of a grid cell such as topography soil texture and vegetation cover are usually assumed to be homogeneous however topography and soil properties e g soil hydraulic parameters are heterogeneous in nature and their heterogeneity across different scales has been investigated vereecken et al 2019 in arid areas vegetation can be sparse and represented by patches separated by bare land areas this heterogeneity is also called sparse vegetation heterogeneity were et al 2008 which can exist at a very small scale several to tens of meters in theory such small scale heterogeneity could be addressed by further reducing the grid size but the finer discretization would dramatically increase the computational burden and difficulty of model parameterization in large river basins an alternative is to account for subgrid variations of key land surface features for example each grid cell in clm is classified into a series of land response units lrus by considering the distributions of elevation and vegetation ke et al 2013 however this subgrid strategy is usually practiced in macroscale modeling with a grid size 1 km hamman et al 2018 ke et al 2012 lawrence et al 2019 the grid size for basin scale ecohydrological modeling is generally smaller e g 1 km how and whether it is necessary to implement the subgrid strategy to account for field scale heterogeneity particularly sparse vegetation heterogeneity in arid river basins is worthy of further study human activities also lead to field scale spatial heterogeneity agricultural activities such as cultivation and irrigation can vary from field to field within a small area where the agriculture is decentralized and not highly mechanized for example within an area of 1 km2 a typical size of a model grid different farmers may not irrigate their croplands on the same day in other words on a particular day with irrigation the irrigation water may reach only part of the croplands within the area however as ecohydrological modeling for large river basins usually considers a grid size much larger than the field scale such within grid variation is largely overlooked and an even coverage of irrigation water over the croplands would be assumed the strategies and relevance of accounting for such human induced heterogeneity remain an important issue to further explore this study improved the ecohydrological model heiflow tian et al 2018 to allow subgrid modeling and account for heterogeneity related to irrigation the new heiflow model was applied to the heihe river basin hrb which is the second largest endorheic river basin in china there exists a keen water conflict between the intensively irrigated agriculture in the middle hrb and vulnerable ecosystems in the lower hrb cheng et al 2014 a common challenge encountered in arid endorheic river basins globally dehghanipour et al 2020 yang et al 2020 yapiyev et al 2017 the main objectives of the study are 1 to develop an advanced ecohydrological model with high simulation accuracy over a wide spectrum of spatial scales from the field scale e g meters to tens of meters to the large basin scale i e 104 to 105 km2 and 2 to systematically evaluate the impact of field scale heterogeneities on simulations of soil moisture evapotranspiration et and lai across different spatial and temporal scales overall this study provides a unique perspective to address the scale issue in ecohydrological modeling and reveals the importance of field scale heterogeneity to the management of water resources and ecosystems based on ecohydrological modeling 2 the heiflow model 2 1 previous versions and new features heiflow tian et al 2018 is a physically based distributed three dimensional ecohydrological model that was developed by improving a representative integrated hydrological model gsflow coupled ground water and surface water flow model markstrom et al 2008 and coupling it with new ecological modules gsflow itself couples a surface water model prms precipitation runoff modeling system leavesley et al 1983 with a classic groundwater model modflow modular ground water flow model 2005 harbaugh 2005 prms simulates surface water processes such as canopy interception snowpack accumulation runoff infiltration evapotranspiration et and soil water flow and modflow simulates groundwater flow and the dynamics of surface water bodies i e streams and lakes to determine the water exchange between the soil zone and groundwater zone gsflow applies an iterative computing approach to solve the interdependent equations that govern surface water and groundwater flows the development of heiflow began with improving gsflow by enhancing its capability to simulate highly engineered flow systems tian et al 2015a sun et al 2018 developed a general ecohydrological module gehm and coupled it with the improved version of gsflow to create an ecohydrological model called gsflow gehm gehm adopts heat unity theory to regulate the growth cycle of vegetation and can simulate the dynamics of a series of basic ecological indicators including the vegetation biomass lai canopy height and root depth tian et al 2018 further expanded this ecohydrological model to accept time varying land use input and the improved model was first named heiflow as a graphical data processing and modeling system visual heiflow was then developed to prepare the input files run the model and visualize the model outputs with this visualization tool the difficulty in building and using the heiflow model was greatly reduced tian et al 2018 while heiflow enables the representation of irrigation systems with both surface water diversion and groundwater pumping it still requires daily diversion and pumping data as external model inputs recently zheng et al 2020 developed a water resource allocation module wra to internally simulate demand based diversion and pumping rates driven by meteorological conditions subject to ecological constraints in this study the heiflow model is further developed with the following new features first in addition to gehm a populus eco module pem li et al 2017 specifically designed for populus euphratica p euphratica is coupled with heiflow the coupling method of pem and heiflow is the same as that used in gsflow gehm sun et al 2018 populus euphratica is a rare ancient and endangered phreatophytic species that is mainly distributed in arid and semiarid regions of central and western asia north africa and southern europe this species plays an important role in maintaining ecological services in arid areas as it can adjust its stomatal activity to adapt to different groundwater depths and control its water use and photosynthesis behaviors under drought stress pem includes a coupled gas exchange submodel to simulate photosynthesis and transpiration rates based on stomatal activity in the new version of heiflow the hydrological model and gehm operate with a daily time step and pem adopts an hourly time step water exchange between the hydrological model and the two ecological modules is calculated on a daily basis therefore in addition to daily meteorological data hourly data should also be prepared for the pem second the soil zone module is modified to allow subgrid scale multilayer soil water simulation in the original version of gsflow and the previous version of heiflow each grid can be either completely covered by vegetation or completely bare and the soil zone of each grid is treated as a single layer water storage unit in this study the soil zone of each grid is horizontally divided into two parts the vegetated area part and the bare area part to represent the finer scale heterogeneity within the grid and the soil zone is vertically discretized into multiple layers to simulate the soil moisture profile details of the modifications are described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 third the new heiflow model improves the soil water simulation by accurately representing the spatial coverage of irrigation activities in the previous model version when a grid is irrigated in one time step the water is assumed to be evenly supplied to the entire vegetated area in the grid however in real world settings the irrigation water may be irrigated to only part of the vegetated area in one time step as the grid size for basin scale modeling is usually no less than 1 km details of the method are given in section 2 3 2 2 finer scale spatiotemporal discretization in heiflow the surface domain ranging from the vegetation canopy to the bottom of the soil zone is horizontally divided into a series of uniform grids and each surface grid is called a hydrological research unit hru the hrus should be numbered in a particular order for example from top left to bottom right as illustrated in fig 1 the subsurface domain i e the aquifer system beneath the surface domain is discretized with a finite difference grid and the finite difference cells also referred to as groundwater cells are numbered with a row index a column index and a layer index fig 1 for a groundwater cell active means that the cell is in the modeling domain and the groundwater head and flow will be calculated inactive means that the cell will be ignored during the simulation horizontally the groundwater cells have the same rectangular shapes as the hrus above them there are two types of hrus land and lake hrus in the new heiflow model for land hrus the soil zone is vertically discretized into multiple layers and horizontally divided into two parts i e the vegetated part and the bare part a parameter the vegetation coverage ratio denoted by vcr is assigned to each hru to specify the area of the vegetated part as illustrated by the gradient color in fig 1 as heiflow accepts changing land use vcr can have different values in different modeling periods the lake hrus are assumed to be completely covered by water with no soil water dynamics or vegetation growth involved in heiflow streams including rivers canals and ditches are divided into a combination of segments based on the relevant geometry connectivity and boundary conditions then each segment is discretized into a group of reaches a reach is a section of a stream that is associated with a groundwater cell or an hru the reaches of a segment should be numbered sequentially from upstream to downstream 2 3 refined soil water simulation in the original gsflow model the soil zone of each hru is treated as a single layer water storage unit and conceptualized as three reservoirs the capillary reservoir cpr the gravity reservoir gvr and the preferential flow reservoir pfr fig 2 a these reservoirs occupy the same physical space and refer to storages between specific soil water content thresholds i e the wilting point the field capacity the moisture content at saturation and a user specified pfr threshold the cpr is the thin film around the soil particles the gvr is the pore water next to the cpr films and the pfr is distributed in the central areas of pore water fig 2b the total water storage in the soil zone can be obtained by adding the cpr gvr and pfr storages these reservoirs are separated to represent different soil water processes water in the cpr cannot flow downward or laterally and can be removed only by evaporation and transpiration water in the gvr and pfr can flow but cannot be evaporated or transpired directly the gvr can provide drainage to the groundwater aquifer below and receive groundwater discharge water in the gvr can also flow laterally within the soil zone water in the pfr cannot drain downward to groundwater and is available only for lateral flow because the lateral flow from the pfr through relatively large soil pores is much faster than that from the gvr the lateral flows from the pfr and gvr are referred to herein as fast interflow and slow interflow respectively additional details on the functions of the reservoirs were given by markstrom et al 2008 the soil zone in the modified heiflow can be discretized into multiple layers and the thickness of different layers can be different e g 3 layers in fig 2c horizontally the soil zone is divided into a vegetated part and a bare part as described in section 2 2 the three reservoirs cpr gvr and pfr are now conceptualized for each soil layer in the vegetated part and the bare part fig 2c water storage in different layers of the vegetated part or the bare part can be calculated by adding the storage volumes of the corresponding cpr gvr and pfr with this new discretization the original code for soil water simulation has been completely rewritten in the modified soil zone module soil water processes in the vegetated part and the bare part are simulated separately first the vegetated part and then the bare part the simulation process for each part in one time step can be divided into three main stages fig 3 adding groundwater discharge to the soil zone stage 1 adding infiltration and inflows from upslope hrus stage 2 and computing et and replenishing the cprs stage 3 this computational sequence is similar to that in gsflow fig 3 illustrates how water is routed within the soil profile in stage 1 fig 3a the discharged groundwater if it occurs first enters the gvr of the lowest soil layer if the cpr in the same layer is not fully filled it is replenished by the gvr after replenishment excess water in gvr if any is added to the pfr in the same layer similarly excess water in pfr if any goes to the upper layer this calculation is repeated toward the top layer or is stopped when no excess water is available for the next layer excess water in the top layer becomes surface runoff i e dunnian runoff in stage 2 infiltration is first calculated and added to the gvr of the top layer and hortonian runoff due to excess infiltration is estimated then the cpr in the same layer is replenished if it is not fully filled next slow interflow and gravity drainage from the gvr are calculated and the drainage volume is added to the lower layer if the gvr still has excess water the excess water moves to the pfr in the same layer which generates fast interflow any excess water in the pfr after the generation of fast interflow becomes dunnian runoff the same calculation is performed for the lower layers the interflows slow and fast and gravity drainage calculated in this stage are passed to downslope hrus and the underlying groundwater cell because the gravity drainage also depends on the conditions of the groundwater cell all or part of the drainage may be rejected and readded following stage 1 to the soil zone it should be noted that if irrigation occurs in a given time step the vegetated part is further divided into an irrigated area and a nonirrigated area and the irrigation water is added only to the irrigated area in this case the calculation illustrated in fig 3b is performed separately for the irrigated and nonirrigated areas first and the results are then averaged over irrigated and nonirrigated areas to obtain the results for the entire vegetated part in stage 3 fig 3c evaporation e and transpiration t are computed separately for the vegetated part and only e is computed for the bare part after removing the water for e and t the cprs are replenished by the gvrs and pfrs in the same layer after the calculation of et in the soil zone the unused potential t is available to the underlying unsaturated and saturated zones if the root depth of the vegetation is beneath the soil zone similar to the approach in gsflow transpiration from the unsaturated zone is calculated using a kinematic wave approximation of richards equation and transpiration from the saturated zone is calculated by using the method employed in the modflow evapotranspiration package as stated above the vegetated part of an hru is further divided into an irrigated area and a nonirrigated area on irrigation days to account for the irrigation induced heterogeneity the irrigated area is estimated by specifying the irrigation depth for each hru as follows 1 air r i t v i r r i t h i r r i where air r i t is the irrigated area of the ith hru on day t vir r i t is the amount of irrigation water for the ith hru on day t and the irrigation depth hir r i is the amount of water applied to the irrigated area at one time in the ith hru in length if the calculated air r i t value is larger than the vegetated area it is set equal to the vegetated area unlike the vegetated part and bare part which have fixed areas the irrigated area varies with the amount of irrigation water supplied each day if there is no irrigation on a given day the irrigated area will be 0 full details of the soil water simulation are provided in the supplementary materials 3 data and methods 3 1 the study area the study area is the hrb which is the second largest endorheic river basin in china located in the arid region of northwestern china fig 4 the heihe river originates from the qilian mountains in the southern part of the basin and flows northward for more than 900 km to two terminal lakes west and east juyan lakes the main river diverges into the east river and the west river at langxin mountain fig 4a the hrb can be naturally divided into upstream midstream and downstream areas where yingluoxia on the mainstream is the divide between the upstream area and the midstream area and zhengyixia is the divide between the midstream and downstream areas in this study the modeling domain covers the midstream and downstream areas of the hrb and a portion of the badain jaran desert fig 4c which is the same as the domains used in tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 the total modeling area is 90 589 km2 there is a large area of farmland in the midstream area accounting for more than 95 of the farmland in the whole basin agricultural areas are mainly distributed in the oases along rivers the farmland area has increased notably in recent decades the farmland area was 5 526 1 km2 in 2000 accounting for approximately 20 4 of the midstream area by 2011 the farmland area had increased to 6006 7 km2 23 5 with a growth rate of approximately 14 9 fig 4d shows the expansion of farmland from 2000 to 2011 most of which occurred in the marginal areas of existing farmland the rest of the midstream area consists of grassland wetland forest urban and desert zones the area of each land use type and the changes in these areas are summarized in table 1 based on three land use maps for the years 2000 2007 and 2011 liu et al 2002 hu et al 2015 the average annual precipitation in the midstream area is approximately 153 4 mm year due to the dry climate the farmland in this area is intensively irrigated via a complicated irrigation system that includes a main intake structure and different levels of canals reservoirs and wells li et al 2018 the downstream area is dominated by desert greater than 90 and there are some natural and artificial oases along the river fig 4a the climate in the downstream area is extremely dry and the annual precipitation is only 58 2 mm year the limited water resources discharged from the midstream area are critical to sustain the riparian ecosystem 3 2 model setup and data sources the heiflow model of the hrb established in this study is developed on the basis of the gsflow model and the gsflow gehm model previously developed by tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 respectively both the surface and subsurface domains were delineated into 90 589 uniform 1 km 1 km grids horizontally the subsurface domain was further divided into five layers including one shallow unconfined aquifer two confined aquifers and two aquitards the soil zone of each hru was discretized into four layers including a very thin surface layer 25 4 mm i e 1 in and three lower layers of the same thickness the parameters of physical soil properties such as the field capacity saturation moisture level and thickness of the soil zone were determined based on a soil database of china for land surface modeling shangguan et al 2013 the subgrid structure of hrus i e the vegetated part and the bare part was determined based on land use maps to reflect the land use changes the entire simulation period from 2000 to 2015 was divided into three periods corresponding to three land use maps for the years 2000 2007 and 2011 the three periods were 2000 2003 2004 2009 and 2010 2015 there were 24 205 26 163 and 26 227 hrus with vegetated parts for the years 2000 2007 and 2011 respectively the other hrus were completely bare two parameters vcr and vegetation type were determined for each hru it should be noted that heiflow assumes only one vegetation type for each hru if there are multiple vegetation types in an hru the type with the largest area will be selected there are 612 hrus covered by p euphratica forest and these hrus were simulated by the pem the remaining hrus were simulated by the gehm in this study there were 16 vegetation types simulated by gehm including three types of trees three types of shrubs four grass plants two wetland plants and four types of crops most of the vegetation parameters for the gehm and the pem adopted the values in sun et al 2018 and li et al 2017 respectively with respect to agricultural irrigation the total irrigation area of the hrb was divided into 46 irrigation districts fig 4c tian et al 2015b and each irrigation district contained a number of hrus the hrus in the same irrigation district adopted the same water management operations the irrigation activities i e daily stream diversions and groundwater pumping rates for each irrigation district were simulated by the recently developed wra module zheng et al 2020 to address the heterogeneity caused by irrigation the irrigation depth i e hirri in eq 1 was determined by dividing the average annual irrigation amount by the irrigation frequency according to the investigations of local water resource authorities the irrigation frequency was approximately 6 times per year the irrigation depths for different irrigation districts ranged from 50 mm to 100 mm with an average of 67 4 mm the data used to establish the heiflow model in this study are the same as those in tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 table s2 in the supplementary materials table 2 lists the data used to calibrate validate and cross verify the model to calibrate and validate the hydrological part of the model we collected streamflow observations at four gaging stations gao ai zhengyixia shaomaying and langxin mountain in fig 4a and water level observations at 66 monitoring wells fig 4c for the ecological part the simulated lai was calibrated and validated against the remote sensing data product lai yuan to cross verify the model performance the simulated et was compared with etwatch data remote sensing data product and field observations obtained at 10 stations stations 1 10 in figs 4a and 4d and the simulated soil moisture was compared with the remote sensing data product esa cci sm and observations obtained at 2 stations stations a and b in figs 4a and 4d station b for the soil moisture measurements and station 8 for the et observations are in the same location 3 3 numerical experiments the model introduced in the above section is the baseline model hereafter labeled as p2 l4 i1 where p2 represents the subgrid structure of the soil zone i e 2 parts l4 indicates the 4 layer soil zone and i1 indicates that the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation is considered when calibrating p2 l4 i1 the first year i e 2000 is used as the warm up period and 2001 2008 8 years and 2009 2015 7 years are used as the calibration and validation periods respectively most of the model parameters are set to the same values used by tian et al 2015b and sun et al 2018 these parameters include surface runoff parameters streamflow parameters and groundwater parameters only the soil zone parameters e g the interflow parameters and some vegetation parameters are calibrated manually in a trial and error manner the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 are used to evaluate the modeling results in addition to p2 l4 i1 we also established three models in parallel namely p1 l1 i0 p2 l1 i0 and p2 l4 i0 to evaluate the relevance of the model modifications introduced in section 2 of these three models p1 l1 i0 does not apply the subgrid structure indicated by p1 the soil zones in p1 l1 i0 and p2 l1 i0 are not discretized indicated by l1 and none of these models considers the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation indicated by i0 in the setup of p1 l1 i0 hrus with vcr values greater than the predefined thresholds are assumed to be fully covered by vegetation and other hrus are considered entirely bare hrus the thresholds for the midstream area downstream area and badain jaran desert fig 4c are set to 0 4 0 3 and 0 3 respectively the impact of subgrid scale modeling can be evaluated by comparing the simulation results of p1 l1 i0 and p2 l1 i0 similarly the simulation results of p2 l1 i0 and p2 l4 i0 are compared to investigate the performance of the multilayer soil zone structure the simulation results of p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 are compared to evaluate the effect on ecohydrological modeling when considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation as stated above p2 l4 i1 i e the baseline model was calibrated manually in a trial and error manner after calibration the nses at the four gaging stations in both the calibration period and validation period were all above 0 8 in particular for the two stations in the midstream area gao ai and zhengyixia the nses were close to 0 9 table s1 in the supplementary materials the rmses of the four stations were relatively small at approximately 8 0 m3 s table s1 this finding indicates that the calibrated model generally reproduces the streamflow of the heihe river as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials the simulated groundwater levels at 66 monitoring wells were also compared to the corresponding observations during the calibration and validation periods the results showed that the groundwater simulation results agree well with the observations as shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials overall the model performance is slightly better than that of the previous modeling results sun et al 2018 in the calibration period the simulated lai was compared with the remote sensing based lai product lai yuan the calibration results show that the model successfully reproduced the vegetation growth in both midstream and downstream areas where the nses are all approximately 0 90 in both the calibration and validation periods fig s2 in the supplementary materials the spatial distributions of the simulated lai and the remote sensing based data were also compared and the spatial patterns are very similar fig s3 in the supplementary materials et is usually the dominant component of the hydrological cycle in endorheic basins and can also be used as an ecological indicator for vegetation growth to cross verify the model the simulated et is compared with the remote sensing based et product etwatch the results show that the spatial distribution of and temporal variations in the simulated et are basically consistent with the etwatch data figs s4 and s5 in the supplementary materials the consistency is generally the same as but overall slightly better than that achieved by sun et al 2018 overall the ecological modeling part of heiflow was effectively calibrated as well 4 2 relevance of subgrid heterogeneity in land cover subgrid modeling is particularly important for areas with sparse vegetation fig 5 illustrates the spatial distributions of simulated lai and et based on p2 l4 i1 in two sample regions the model renders fine scale i e resolution of the land use map spatial variations in lai and et which enables the model to effectively support management of water resources and ecosystems while basin scale ecohydrological modeling with a grid size of 1 km already represents a high resolution it is still too coarse to guide real world management efforts such as precision irrigation revegetation and restricted grazing it should also be noted that our strategy to handle the subgrid structure does not require a significant increase in computational cost in contrast to reach the spatial resolution in fig 5 by using a finer model grid the computational cost would be prohibitive the main difference between models with and without a subgrid structure the et of p2 l1 i0 minus the et of p1 l1 i0 is further illustrated in fig 6 taking et as an example fig 6a shows the distribution of the differences between the simulated et at the original 1 km 1 km scale and each grid corresponds to one dot in the first column of fig 6d as shown the difference is significant and in some hrus this difference can be as high as 150 the red areas are mainly distributed in the downstream area and the northwestern part of the midstream area because the vegetation in these areas is sparse if the subgrid structure is not applied the vegetation in these areas will be ignored by the model p1 l1 i0 in theory when the simulation results are upscaled i e aggregating data to a coarser resolution the spatial differences will decrease to determine the scale at which the models with and without a subgrid structure behave similarly the simulated et values were aggregated from the 1 km 1 km resolution to the resolution of 50 km 50 km with a resolution increment of 1 km figs 6b and 6c show the distribution of et differences at the 20 km 20 km and 50 km 50 km scales respectively compared with those in the left graph the colors in the right two graphs are lighter indicating that the spatial differences in et are smaller fig 6d shows the percentages of et differences at all 50 scales it is obvious that as the scale increases the differences in et diminish the rate of diminishment is fast before 10 km and becomes gradual thereafter when the grid size increases to 20 km the et differences range from 11 6 to 12 7 and when it increases to 50 km the range is reduced to 7 4 6 9 however the basin wide et obtained with p1 l1 i0 and p2 l1 i0 is 143 02 mm year and 141 99 mm year respectively where the relative change is only 0 7 although the results in fig 6 are case dependent the results indicate that considering the subgrid structure will lead to significant simulation differences in areas with sparse vegetation and such differences can remain significant when the simulation results are scaled up within a certain range of scale this issue is important when coupling ecohydrological models or lsms with climate models regional or global scale ecohydrological models or lsms typically use fine scales e g 1 km 20 km compared with those of climate models e g 10 km 60 km for regional climate models and 100 km 250 km for global climate models and their inputs and outputs need to be scaled up to match those of climate models therefore in areas with sparse vegetation ignoring the subgrid characteristics of land surfaces can lead to significant errors in ecohydrological modeling that may consequently impact large scale climate modeling 4 3 model performance enhanced by soil stratification soil stratification is another major improvement of the new heiflow model to assess the multilayer structure the soil moisture simulated by the single layer model i e p2 l1 i0 and the multilayer model i e p2 l4 i0 was compared with the remote sensing based soil moisture product esa cci sm the esa cci sm product is representative of the first few centimeters of the soil 0 5 cm dorigo et al 2017 therefore the soil moisture in the first layer is used for comparison the first layer in the multilayer models is 25 4 mm i e 1 in and the first layer in the single layer model is the entire soil zone fig 7 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean soil moisture over time obtained from the remote sensing product and heiflow in general the two heiflow models lead to results with a similar spatial pattern as the remote sensing product the high soil moisture values are concentrated in the piedmont areas i e the south and west of the basin and the riparian areas and the soil in the badain jaran desert is relatively dry the soil moisture level simulated by the multilayer model is slightly lower than the remote sensing based value but the difference is not significant as shown in the corresponding scatter plots fig s6 in the supplementary materials the r2 value of the multilayer model for this comparison of the spatial distribution is 0 81 and the r2 value of the single layer model is only 0 70 the relative change in soil moisture is used to reflect the temporal variance the relative change is calculated by subtracting the multiyear mean soil moisture from the original monthly soil moisture as shown in fig 7b the multilayer model produces more similar time series compared with the remote sensing product than the single layer model especially when the soil moisture begins to decrease after a peak value is reached the soil moisture simulated by the multilayer model decreases rapidly and the rate of decline of the single layer model is much slower this effect occurs because water evaporates preferentially from the thin first soil layer the r2 value of the multilayer model is 0 69 and the r2 value of the single layer model is only 0 46 fig s6 in the supplementary materials overall the simulation results of the multilayer model are closer to the remote sensing product which reflects the importance of the multilayer structure especially the separation of a thin first layer fig 8 further examines the impact of the discretization of the soil zone on ecohydrological modeling fig 8a shows the time series of average soil water storage in the soil zone simulated by models p2 l1 i0 i e single layer model and p2 l4 i0 i e multilayer model the results show that the two models predicted notably different soil water storages on some days the difference excluding the effect of different initial values was as high as 10 mm which is equivalent to 9 06 108 m3 of water this difference is due to the different et processes predicted by the two models as shown in fig s7 in the supplementary materials fig 8b compares the basin wide average et simulated by the two models with each point corresponding to one day in the simulation period the scatter plot shows that the daily et predicted by the two models is significantly different the et difference was strongly correlated with precipitation with a correlation coefficient of 0 70 fig 8c shows the dynamics of et and soil moisture simulated by the single layer model and the multilayer model when precipitation occurs although the soil moisture of the entire soil zone simulated by the multilayer model red solid line in the lower graph in fig 8c is lower than that simulated by the single layer model the et red solid line in the upper graph in fig 8c is much higher than that of the single layer model specifically the soil in the hrb is usually dry due to the arid climate conditions therefore in the multilayer model the precipitation is mostly trapped in the upper part of the soil zone which results in a rapid increase in the soil moisture in the upper layers especially in the thin surface layer purple dashed line in the lower graph in fig 8c the high soil moisture level leads to rapid evaporation and transpiration however in the single layer model precipitation is evenly added to the soil zone and soil moisture increases slowly therefore et does not increase significantly this effect has been reported in other studies such as that of xu and xie 2001 it should be noted that in arid regions the effect of a thin surface layer on et is greater than in humid regions therefore it is necessary to apply the multilayer structure to effectively represent the et and soil water processes in these regions fig 8d also compares the average et e and t obtained with the single layer and multilayer models the average et values of the single layer and the multilayer models are very close at 141 99 mm year and 141 07 mm year respectively however the e estimated by the multilayer model is higher 4 75 mm year and the t is lower 5 67 mm year this difference is also reflected in the ecological simulation as shown in fig 8e the annual maximum lai simulated by the single layer model is approximately 11 higher than that obtained by the multilayer model it is worth pointing out that figs 8d and 8e present basin wide results and the differences between the two models are larger in farmland approximately 13 where intensive irrigation signifies the necessity of soil stratification overall figs 7 and 8 indicate that the multilayer structure can better simulate the dynamics of soil water and ecological processes than the single layer model due to the fine scale description of physical processes 4 4 impact of the spatial coverage of irrigation compared to p2 l4 i0 i e irrigation water evenly distributed over the entire vegetated area in a grid cell with irrigation p2 l4 i1 i e irrigation water distributed over the vegetated area that is actually irrigated in a given time step led to 31 46 and 13 changes in the simulated average e t and lai respectively over the entire area with irrigation fig 9 compares the daily irrigation area irrigation depth and soil water storage in the midstream area simulated by heiflow with i e p2 l4 i1 and without i e p2 l4 i0 considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation fig 9a shows the daily irrigation water volume simulated by the wra module zheng et al 2020 for the first four years of the simulation period to provide a clear illustration this volume is approximately 2 27 109 m3 year with a maximum irrigation rate of 2 31 107 m3 day in p2 l4 i0 the irrigation water is evenly distributed to all vegetated areas of the irrigated hrus therefore the corresponding irrigation area red area in fig 9b corresponding to the left axis is very large with a maximum of 5396 km2 this approach results in a very low average irrigation depth blue line in fig 9b corresponding to the right axis with a maximum of 7 mm as a result most of the irrigation water is trapped in the upper soil layers and the lower layers cannot be effectively irrigated fig 9c shows the daily irrigation area red areas and average irrigation depth blue line simulated by p2 l4 i1 which considers the specific spatial coverage of irrigation the daily irrigation area is relatively small and the maximum is less than 315 km2 but the water depth on the irrigated areas is much higher fig 9c represents a more realistic situation in which the time schedule of irrigation varies across farms in reality it is rare that all farmlands over the large basin are irrigated simultaneously on a particular day as a result in p2 l4 i1 the irrigation water is more likely to flow into lower layers in the estimated irrigation areas the soil water storage simulated by the two models figs 9d and 9e confirmed this effect the soil water storage in the lower layers i e layer 3 and layer 4 simulated by p2 l4 i1 is significantly greater than that simulated by p2 l4 i0 the soil moisture simulated by the two models was further compared with the soil moisture measurements at two stations station a and station b in fig 4 because soil moisture is directly influenced by irrigation activities the time series of in situ observations at the field scale can be quite different from the simulated average soil moisture at the subgrid scale fig s8 in the supplementary materials thus the comparison considers time averaged values of soil moisture and focuses on the variation in soil moisture across different soil layers as illustrated in fig 10 station a is located in a farmland hru in the midstream area and station b is located in a forest hru in the downstream area both hrus are irrigated when considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation the baseline model i e p2 l4 i1 produces the same trend as the measurements and the lower the soil layer is the higher the soil moisture level however p2 l4 i0 led to the opposite soil moisture profile because most irrigation water was trapped in the upper soil layers this result indicates that it is important to consider the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation activities to produce reliable simulation results of the soil moisture levels in irrigated lands of arid basins we also compared the et simulated by p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 with the observations at 10 stations fig 4 in this case the time series of simulated and observed et were directly compared fig 11 a shows the nse values for each station based on the two models the first 6 stations are located in vegetated areas and the other 4 stations are located in bare areas with the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation considered the nses of the first 6 stations increased significantly this finding indicates that the et simulations in irrigation areas improved due to the enhanced simulation of soil water the time series of the simulations obtained by p2 l4 i1 and the observed values at all the 10 stations are shown in fig s9 in the supplementary materials as an example figs 11b and 11c show the et and its partitioning at station 8 i e station b for the soil moisture measurements simulated by p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 respectively because the irrigation water is trapped in the upper layers especially the first layer in p2 l4 i0 fig 10b soil evaporation was overestimated and the contribution of t to et was only 23 this influence will inevitably affect the simulation of vegetation growth however in p2 l4 i1 the irrigation water can flow to the lower layers fig 10b the evaporation loss is comparatively small and more irrigation water uptake by plants occurs the t et simulated by p2 l4 i1 is 64 this value agrees well with the results reported by liu et al 2018 where the average t et for a forest ecosystem in the downstream area of the hrb was estimated to be 60 in addition the temporal variation in et simulated by p2 l4 i1 is generally consistent with the observations the lai simulations at this station obtained by p2 l4 i0 and p2 l4 i1 were also compared fig s10 in the supplementary materials the average lai simulated by p2 l4 i1 was 27 higher than that simulated by p2 l4 i0 in conclusion the results indicate that the accurate description of irrigation induced soil water processes is important for the simulation of vegetation processes in arid areas 5 conclusions in this study the previously built ecohydrological model heiflow was improved by introducing the subgrid structure of land cover multilayer soil water simulation and accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid cell heiflow is now able to model ecohydrological processes over a wide spectrum of spatial scales from the field scale e g meters to tens of meters to the large basin scale i e 104 to 105 km2 which is an important advance because few existing models can maintain field scale accuracy when applied in large basins the improved heiflow was then implemented in the hrb the second largest endorheic river basin in china with a grid size of 1 km by 1 km this study represents one of the few attempts to evaluate the impact of field scale heterogeneity on basin scale management of water resources and ecosystems using an integrated modeling approach the major study findings include the following first accounting for subgrid heterogeneities can significantly improve the spatial accuracy of the model simulations in areas with sparse vegetation ignoring the subgrid characteristics of land surfaces will lead to significant errors that may be further propagated when the modeling results are used to support management or scaled up for larger scale climate modeling e g 10 60 km for regional climate models and 100 250 km for global climate models second the multilayer soil structure can improve ecohydrological simulations in terms of temporal variations in arid areas it is necessary to separate a thin surface layer from the soil zone to simulate rapid evaporation after water input events for example in the case study a single layer soil structure would introduce more than 10 error in simulating the annual maximum lai third considering the accurate spatial coverage of irrigation within the grid is critical for successful simulations of soil water et and vegetation growth processes in arid areas in the case study the accurate spatial coverage led to 31 46 and 13 changes in the simulated average e t and lai respectively over the entire area with irrigation overall this study presents a unique perspective on the scale issue in ecohydrological modeling the findings have important implications for developing continental or global models of water and energy cycling from groundwater into the atmosphere keune et al 2016 a major challenge for the hydrological community at present as the study results indicate the appropriate resolutions for discretizing both horizontally and vertically the modeling domain which balances computation burden and simulation error largely depend on local conditions of vegetation soil and human activities thus a spatially varying discretizing scheme may be preferable in future modeling efforts in addition some limitations of heiflow need to be addressed by future studies for example nutrient cycling has not been explicitly accounted for by heiflow and therefore the model simulation under nutrient limited situations may involve additional errors moreover although the simple two part subgrid structure works well for the sparse vegetation landscape in the hrb a more complex landscape may require a more sophisticated subgrid structure credit authorship contribution statement feng han data curation methodology formal analysis funding acquisition writing original draft yi zheng conceptualization

4797,the spatiotemporal dynamic of salinity concentration sc in saline lakes is strongly dependent on the rate of water flow into the lake water circulation wind speed evaporation rate and the phenomenon of salt precipitation and dissolution although in situ observations most reliably quantify water quality metrics the spatiotemporal distribution of such data are typically limited and cannot be readily extrapolated for either long term projections or extensive areas alternatively remotely sensed imagery has facilitated less expensive and a stronger ability to estimate water quality over a wide range of spatiotemporal resolutions this study introduces an adaptive learning model that leverages in situ measurements satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of water surface sc in saline lakes we demonstrate the applicability of the framework by using high resolution sentinel 2 and landsat 8 satellite data in the lake urmia lu where 130 points were sampled in april and july 2019 for the model calibration and validation purposes the results showed that artificial neural network ann yields the most accurate relationship between sc and water surface reflectance r2 0 94 nrmse 6 9 mae 12 3 ppt as compared to adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis and multiple linear regression mlr models a sharp distinction in sc between the lu s northern and southern parts was observed during high flows due to the limitation on north south water mixing imposed by the lake s middle causeway nevertheless the impact of causeway on water circulation at the other seasons is minimum a hysteretic relationship was also found between the lake water volume and the lake averaged sc due to the distinct role of bed salt dissolution and high evaporation rate at different seasons a tight agreement between the sc variations in the southern part and the whole lake proved that the southern part dominantly controls sc dynamics in the whole lake keywords water surface salinity machine learning sentinel 2 landsat 8 lake urmia 1 introduction the spatiotemporal variability of salinity concentration sc in hypersaline water bodies plays a critical role in hydrodynamic modeling and water quality studies several former studies have demonstrated the remarkable impact of sc magnitude and fluctuation on aquatic biodiversity and life williams 2002 bathymetry dynamics karimi et al 2016 and evaporation rate kokya and kokya 2008 aquatic life in saline waters is conditioned on a certain sc threshold so that approaching or exceeding the tolerance can intervene the reproduction or cause the extinction of some biota karbassi et al 2010 khosravi et al 2013 principally aquatic species become much more vulnerable to other pollutants and chemical stresses when they are close to the permissible level of sc for instance in many cases the toxicity of compounds like insecticides increases at high sc williams 2002 sc changes can also promote the presence of exotic species in an aquatic environment influencing the food chain and threatening some aboriginal organisms heugens et al 2001 in addition the bed salt dissolution in hypersaline lakes takes place due to changes in water volume and the intensity of water circulation conversely if the salt concentration becomes saturated some portion of the dissolved salt settles down such processes known as precipitation and dissolution change the lake bed bathymetry continuously which dictate a dynamic relationship between the lake water level volume and surface area karimi et al 2016 sima and tajrishy 2013 furthermore the volume of water loss from a hypersaline lake via evaporation is not only a function of the lake surface area but is also directly influenced by the sc

density of water which subsequently decreases surface water evaporation kokya and kokya 2008 in situ measurements are the most reliable approach to monitor water sc in both time and space this is typically carried out by conductivity temperature depth ctd measurements or employing fiber optic sensors to directly measure the sc e g qian et al 2018 however extensive and frequent data collection and analysis is expensive and limited confining a proper description of the spatiotemporal fluctuations in sc alternatively remote sensing imagery and techniques have been widely used in surface water quality monitoring due to large area coverage repetitive data collection over a variety of resolutions and simultaneous information acquisition from different bands in the electromagnetic spectrum this information help construct the relationships between the reflected radiation and water chemical characteristics e g mishra et al 2017 there are three types of approaches in this direction the first approach is mainly applied in coastal and estuarine environments where organic matters largely influence the optical properties of water bowers and brett 2008 hence measurements of chromophoric or colored dissolved organic matter cdom absorption are correlated with the sc ahn et al 2008 bai et al 2013 binding and bowers 2003 this is accomplished by first calibrating the relationship between cdom and water surface reflectance and then calibrating another relationship between cdom and sc using in situ measurements of both sc and cdom absorption coefficients it is thus clear that estimation of sc from cdom rather than directly from water surface reflectance is a much more complex process that carries a higher degree of uncertainty arising from field data collection and model calibration second the relationship between water surface reflectance and cdom absorption coefficient holds valid when sc ranges between 5 ppt and 35 ppt which is limited to the estuarine and coastal areas see bowers and brett 2008 and keith et al 2016 for further details the second approach focuses on establishing a mathematical relationship between water surface reflectance and sc using various predictive models such as neural networks chen and hu 2017 geiger et al 2013 urquhart et al 2012 regression models ferdous and rahman 2020 han et al 2019 khorram 1982 wang and xu 2008 and box jenkins algorithm marghany and hashim 2011 the third approach is similar to the second one as it leverages the satellite surface reflectance to evaluate sc however this approach seeks to develop a model that takes into account the spatial variation in the spectral properties of water in particular these models tune training parameters for each region of the study area rather than tuning a model for the whole area xie et al 2013 urquhart et al 2013 khadim et al 2017 introduced a spatially weighted optimization model swom to assess the spatiotemporal variations in sc in all approaches water surface reflectance data can be provided by different airborne platforms such as modis bai et al 2013 chen and hu 2017 geiger et al 2013 marghany and hashim 2011 urquhart et al 2012 landsat mss khorram 1982 landsat tm

al 2019 and smap dinnat et al 2019 beside remote sensing based approaches many studies have used disparate water quality measures as proxy to estimate other quality parameters barzegar et al 2016 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 gazzaz et al 2012 khan and chai 2017 kisi et al 2019 ranković et al 2011 sahu et al 2011 zaman zad ghavidel and montaseri 2014 or have predicted quality parameters

a wide spectrum of learning based models several studies have demonstrated artificial neural networks ann and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis to yield the most robust and accurate results for water quality assessment in coastal areas palani et al 2008 zhou et al 2020 rivers barzegar et al 2018 2016 ding et al 2014 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 gazzaz et al 2012 huang and foo 2002

this study we introduce an adaptive learning framework for the prediction of sc which couples a machine learning based model to high resolution satellite imagery to this end we first identify the best input satellite band combinations using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii to ensure an optimum utilization of all necessary bands for sc prediction we then employ the ann and anfis to predict sc since these models belong to completely different realms i e swarm intelligence vs fuzzy logic we intend to explore their distinct capability in deriving the complex relationship between sc and water surface reflectance additionally we evaluate and compare the accuracy of multiple linear regression mlr model as reduced complexity model with much lower computational cost using high resolution sentinel 2 and landsat 8 imagery we demonstrate the applicability of the above framework in the hypersaline lake urmia lu located in northwestern iran in particular we aim to i investigate the spatiotemporal variability of sc in the lu ii explore the impact of the lake s middle causeway on the flow circulation and the mixing pattern of sc between the lake s north and south parts and iii study the sensitivity of the results to the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used in the constructed predictive models the novelty of this study is twofold first since increasing the number of inputs does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the machine learning models and may even lead to overtraining we coupled the predictive model with a meta heuristic stochastic searching algorithm that leverages genetic optimization theory to intelligently search for the optimum inputs i e bands second applying the proposed framework in the lu has revealed some governing physical dynamics in the sc variation such as hysteresis that could not be explored so far the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and gives a brief overview of the lu history by highlighting how anthropogenic activities have reshaped the lu water quantity and quality over the past two decades section 3 presents the modeling framework together with the utilized in situ and remote sensing data for the model calibration and validation purposes section 4 presents the results of the three predictive models and compares them in terms of the satellite data used the spatiotemporal variability of sc in a water year is also explored with emphasis on the mixing pattern dynamics and the emergence of hysteresis implications of the results as well as the applicability of the proposed framework in the lake water budget ecology and hydrodynamic studies are further discussed in this section section 5 further discusses the challenges related to the remote sensing of water quality as well as the advantages of machine learning models in extracting the relationships between water quality measures and surface reflectance data this section also highlights the importance of optimum input band selection to the reliability of learning models finally section 6 summarizes the main findings of this study 2 study area lu located in the northwest of iran 37 46 31 5 n and 45 20 32 4 e is a shallow lake with average depth of about 1 5 m in 2019 known as the second largest hypersaline lake in the world fig 1 a the lake is about 130 km long with the width changing from 12 km in the middle to 40 km towards the northern and southern shores march 2019 lu was registered by the ramsar convention in 1971 as a habitat for birds and rare species like artemia urmiana and was also declared a unesco biosphere reserve in 1976 ramsar sites information service 1971 the lu drainage basin has a semi arid climate with the daily air temperature fluctuating between 6 c and 31 2 c the average precipitation of 350 mm year and the average annual actual evapotranspiration of 421 mm between 2000 and 2016 a considerable portion of the lu water is supplied by river inflow from namely the gadar chay baranduz roze chay nazlu chay zula chay qale chay tasuj sufi chay aji chay shahr chay mahabad simine rud and zarine rud among other rivers fig 1a fig 1b shows the time series of the lu water level and volume between 1965 and 2019 the highest water level was recorded in 1995 at 1277 9 m followed by a declining trend lasting for about two decades in 2015 the lake experienced the lowest historical water volume at 1 25 bcm which was 96 less than that in 1995 causing serious environmental and socioeconomic problems in the lake region see danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 and referenced therein for details on these issues and the causes of lu drying annual changes in sc in lu mainly occurs as a result of water volume changes as a direct result of the water volume reduction the lake sc elevated from 280 g l in 1967 to more than 340 g l in 2008 karbassi et al 2010 such a high salt concentration threatened the population of artemia alarmingly over the past years which consequently reduced the number of migratory birds as well as adversely impacted the economic activities relating to the artemia use for commercial purposes hassanzadeh et al 2012 lu is also intervened by a causeway that is about 15 km long which divides the lake into the northern and southern parts fig 1c as a result water exchange between the separated parts occurs only through a 1 25 km opening which is about 8 of the causeway length a balanced water circulation exists at the opening however the circulation shows a mainly northward flow tendency around the spring due to the increase in the river inputs from the southern part the small opening size also influences the water mixing in the lake which may lead to the density difference of 23 kg m3 between the northern and southern parts in april marjani and jamali 2014 the majority of the lake inflow from the feeding rivers enters the southern part making it less saline as compared to the northern part 3 methods and data 3 1 field measurements multiple measurements of water surface sc were conducted during april 10th 14th 2019 and july 16th 2019 across the lu in both the northern and southern parts the first and second measuring campaigns were carried out by the geological survey and mineral exploration of iran gsi and the remote sensing research center rsrc at the sharif university of technology sut respectively totally 130 points were sampled which covered a wide range of sc from 65 ppt to 320 ppt fig 2 a shows the location of 79 sampling points corresponding to april 10th 14th and fig 2b shows the location of other 51 measurement points on july 16th water samples were collected by 0 3 l bottles from the top 20 cm of the lake water depth a 912 conductometer metrohm portable probe fig 2c was used to measure the electrical conductivity and sc since the probe yields less accuracy for the scs above 100 ppt all the samples were first diluted five times using distilled water and the measured diluted sc data were then multiplied by five these data were used to train and validate the predictive models described in section 3 4 table 1 gives the measured sc of the 130 sampled points fig 2a and b also show the boxplot of the measured sc from the first and second sampling campaigns respectively sc measured in april 10th 14th 2019 varies between 65 ppt and 304 ppt with the average value of 203 ppt and the standard deviation of 80 ppt sc measured in july 16th 2019 gives a tighter range changing from 247 ppt to 320 ppt with the average value of 282 ppt and the standard deviation of 19 ppt the lower sc in april as compared to july is chiefly due to the massive freshwater inflows from the rivers that usually peak at this time of a year the small sc values in april is also partly attributed to the increased inflow rates from the unusual precipitation of 494 mm from october 2018 to september 2019 which was 50 and 45 greater than 11 years and 50 year average precipitation respectively we further note that sc values lower than 92 ppt were measured near the inlets of the gadar chay mahabad simine rud zarine rud and aji chay rivers fig 1a fig 2a which provide more than 70 of freshwater to the lake sharifan et al 2017 3 2 satellite data we used satellite images from sentinel 2 with a 10 m spatial resolution and 5 days temporal resolution and landsat oli with a 30 m spatial resolution and 16 days temporal resolution to extract water surface reflectance data for the lu www earthexplorer usgs gov to generate monthly sc maps atmospherically corrected images were acquired for each month from october 2018 to september 2019 the proximity of two satellite images was the other condition that was met to make the comparison between the model results from the two data sources possible cloud free images across the lu extent were not detected in december 2018 and july 2019 and thus these months were not included in the analysis 3 3 waterbody extraction at each studied date the processing operations on the satellite images should be confined to the lake water boundary we extracted the lake boundary by using the k means unsupervised clustering algorithm likas et al 2003 within the google earth engine gee platform gee is an open source cloud computing environment that holds a collection of satellite and geospatial datasets and offers different built in image processing and geospatial techniques gorelick et al 2017 soil adjusted vegetation index savi and the normalized difference water index ndwi were used as the input layers for clustering to improve the accuracy of distinction between the water body and dry land 3 4 the adaptive learning model development in this study we employed two learning algorithms i e ann and anfis and made them adaptive to recognize the most accurate relationship between the sc measurements and the digital reflectance data provided by satellite imagery each model consists of two main parts 1 a feature selection module to determine the best band combination from the satellite data and 2 a machine learning based model to predict sc we also examined the efficiency of the mlr model to explore the relative accuracy of such a reduced complexity model as compared to the other two ones that are capable of learning and distinguishing complex non linear relationships between the target and the dependent variables among many other machine learning based models the advantage of these two models is largely overcoming the limitations imposed by noisy and incomplete data for the sake of deep understanding of data behavior and its variability in all models 70 of field data were selected randomly for the training purpose and the remaining 30 were used for the model testing we employed a k fold cross validation method with three folds for the model training and testing two folds contain the training data and one fold contains the testing data the procedure of model training and testing was repeated three times where in each iteration a unique combination of training and testing folds was used ultimately the median accuracy of the three trainings and the median accuracy of the three validations were used as measures to select the best model performance 3 4 1 artificial neural networks ann ann is a supervised machine learning algorithm that consists of different layers including the input layer one or more hidden layer s and the output layer fig 3 shows a typical ann structure with one hidden layer and one output layer the number of hidden layers is arbitrary but practically one layer is often used to prevent a complicated network structure han et al 2011 each layer comprises of several units called neurons green circles in fig 3 that are denoted by i 1 i n and j 1 j m in the input and hidden layer respectively n and m are the total number of neurons in the input and hidden layer respectively the number of input layer neurons indicates the total number of input variables see fig 3 the ann input variables i e the water surface reflectance data are weighted in the input layer and are then fed into the neurons of the hidden layer this operation is described by eq 1 as 1 i j i w ij b l x i b j where ij is the input value to the neuron j in the hidden layer wij is the weight corresponding to the link that connects neurons i of the input layer to neuron j of the hidden layer bl x i is the reflectance value of band l at locations x that is imported from neuron i and bj is the constant value corresponding to neuron j each neuron j in the hidden layer ultimately applies a nonlinear activation function to ij yielding the output expressed as 2 o j 1 1 exp i j where oj is the output from neuron j in the hidden layer finally the output layer emits the prediction as 3 s x p j w jk o j ε where s x p is the predicted sc at locations x across a waterbody wjk is the weight corresponding to the links that connect neurons j of the hidden layer to the output layer s neuron k 1 k np where np is the total number of predicted outputs via ann in this study ann only predicts s x p and thus k 1 and ɛ is the constant value of the output layer s neuron in the training process of ann the unknown parameters wij wjk bj and ɛ are calibrated such that the following objective function is minimized 4 minimize g 1 a s x g t s x g p 2 where a is number of field data samples and s x g t represents the measured sc at location x g 1 g a for the training process the backpropagation technique was utilized via mlp iteratively daniel 2013 3 4 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis anfis is a fuzzy logic based machine learning tool that inherently is a takagi sugeno kang tsk fuzzy inference system but is built and trained using the structure of neural networks jang 1993 tsk introduces rule based linear relationships between the input and output variables each contributing to the tsk predicted value determined by the rule based adaptive weights mendel 2017 we can express a tsk system with n number of inputs and r number of rules as 5 rule 1 if b 1 x is a 11 and and if b n x is a n 1 then s 1 x p α 01 l 1 n α l 1 b l x rule r if b 1 x is a 1 r and and if b n x is a nr then s r x p α 0 r l 1 n α lr b l x where a lq 1 l n 1 q r is the fuzzy set indicating a range of b l x s q x p is the predicted sc values from each rule and α l q is a constant value determined by the tsk the final predicted sc by the above tsk system is represented by 6 s x p q 1 r s q x p w q q 1 r w q q 1 r s q x p l 1 n μ a lq b l x q 1 r w q where wq indicates the strength of s q x p and μ a lq b l x 0 μ a lq 1 is the degree of membership to which b l x belongs to the fuzzy set a lq tsk leverages different membership functions among which the gaussian function equation 7 is commonly used because of its smooth representation of the input changes 7 μ a lq b l x exp 0 5 b l x m lq σ lq 2 2 in this expression m lq and σ lq are the parameters of the gaussian function using eq 7 eq 6 is extended as the following 8 s x p q 1 r s q x p exp 0 5 l 1 n b l x m lq σ lq 2 2 q 1 r exp 0 5 l 1 n b l x m lq σ lq 2 2 eq 8 shows that a tsk system establishes a nonlinear relation between the target and dependent variables the process of building and training a tsk system mainly involves calibrating all the unknown parameters in eq 8 i e mlq and σlq so that the objective function in eq 4 is minimized in the anfis structure ann works as an optimization framework by tuning all the tsk parameters hence leveraging a combined advantages of both fuzzy inference system fis and ann jang 1993 3 4 3 multiple linear regression mlr model a mlr model fits a multiple linear relation between the target and dependent variables which can be expressed as 9 s x p β 0 l 1 n β l b l x ε where βl is the relating coefficient of bl x β0 is a constant and ɛ is the model s bias we used the least squared method to estimate β0 and βl s in eq 9 by minimizing the objective function in eq 4 3 4 4 band selection selecting the optimal number of input variables to a machine learning model such as ann and anfis has a significant influence on the accuracy of the results redundant information makes the generated model structure more complex increasing the number of calibration parameters and thereby misleading the training process besides since the model inputs in this study are different bands of satellite images keeping the irrelevant bands increases the computational cost too han et al 2011 to avoid these issues we used the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to determine the best band combination that can appropriately describe the variability in the measured sc data this model is based on a multi objective optimization algorithm that aims to minimize both the number of selected bands and the model bias between the predicted and observed sc as 10 minimize e v v l 0 e v g 1 a s x g t s ann train x g p v 2 a 0 5 g 1 a s x g t s ann test x g p v 2 a 0 5 where v is a binary decision vector determining the selected bands s ann train x g p v and s ann test x g p v are the predicted sc in the training and testing phase of ann respectively which use the selected input bands determined by v v l 0 represents the number of non zero elements i e number of selected bands in v fig 4 a shows the flowchart of the nsga ii process in the first iteration a population p v 1 v 2 v τ t is defined as a set of decision vectors v u s 1 u τ where τ is the size of p i e the number of decision vectors and t is the iteration number the configuration of binary elements in v u s is set randomly at t 1 the ann algorithm is then used τ times to find the best predictive model of s using each v u as input which subsequently yields the associated error e v u given v u s and e v u s the nsga ii algorithm sorts the population using non dominated sorting that is based on the pareto domination optimality in this scheme the relative dominance of v u s over each other is made by the following conditions van veldhuizen and lamont 2000 11 e v u e v u and v u l 0 v u l 0 and e v u e v u or v u l 0 v u l 0 after the non domination check all v u s not dominated by any other decision vectors are ranked first regardless of the ranked first members the process is repeated again and those v u s that are not dominated by any others are ranked second this iteration continues until a rank is assigned to all v u s of the population v u s with the same rank of f are categorized as front f based on the pareto domination optimality v u s that fall in the first front are the best solutions with respect to e vu and vu l 0 fig 4b shows a pareto front that is generated in the non dominated sorting which is the ranked form of v u s in a population in addition to non dominated sorting in the sorting part of nsga ii crowding distance cd is also computed separately for every member of each front as 12 cd v u e v u 1 e v u 1 e v max e v min v u 1 l 0 v u 1 l 0 v l 0 max v l 0 min where u 1 and u 1 denote the decision vectors of the left side and the right side of the decision vector u in a pareto front respectively superscripts max and min denote the maximum and minimum value of the associated errors as well as the maximum and minimum number of selected bands in a pareto front respectively cd measures the density of solutions in the decision space of objective functions in nsga ii solutions with lower rank and higher cd are worthier solutions in the selection part best τ solutions where τ is the size of initial population are first used based on the previous sorting while the rest are neglected i e the first iteration skips the selection part the remaining steps follow the classical genetic algorithm binary tournament selection selects v u s from the population and then offspring c vʹ1 vʹ2 t and mutant m vʹʹ1 vʹʹ2 t are generated via crossover and mutation operators between selected parents respectively murugan et al 2009 mutants offspring and the main population are combined and make a new larger population r v 1 v 2 v d vʹ1 vʹ2 vʹʹ1 vʹʹ2 t similar to the operation performed for initial population evaluation of the new population yields to e v u s and the new population is sorted based on the errors non dominated sorting and cd after the selection part the new population p t 1 is selected among best r t members and the algorithm proceeds until reaching the iteration after which no improvement is found in a new population based on e vu s and vu l 0 s murugan et al 2009 we note that τ should be selected large enough to ensure no critical information is missed for the purpose of training the ann algorithm on the other hand the efficiency of the nsga ii algorithm diminishes as τ increases simply because the iteration process approaches the monte carlo simulation of all possible permutations of the binary elements therefore an appropriate selection of τ is a trade off between the above two criteria which should be examined via a sensitivity analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 best band combination table 2 gives the best band combinations determined by the feature selection module for both the sentilen 2 and landsat 8 satellite data the pareto front obtained by implementing the nsga ii algorithm linked with ann suggests that the optimum number of bands yielding the most accurate prediction of sc are one two and three the results show that the combination of blue green and red bands gives the least error between the predicted and measured sc regardless of the satellite data source used in the case of two bands as input the green red and blue green band combinations are optimum using sentinel 2 and landsat 8 data respectively the green band from sentinel 2 and the blue band from landsat 8 are suggested when the model is fed by only one single band as input we observe that the prediction accuracy improves as the number of input bands increases as a result of using more spectral information however this cannot be considered as a general conclusion for a couple of reasons first the addition of bands does not necessarily provide relevant spectral information on the water quality metric of interest indeed high absorption rate of electromagnetic radiation in water beyond the visible region masks patterns and variations in the spectral signature of water constituents which does not provide interpretable information to improve the prediction accuracy govender et al 2007 he et al 2008 given that the visible range shows strong spectral signature in water the emergence of at least one band from this range in the best band combination is expected in the remote sensing of water applications alparslan et al 2009 matsushita et al 2008 wang and xu 2008 second spectral information from a wide range of bands typically mislead the model training by using redundant less informative data that increase the chance of overtraining the employed framework in this study have resolved these issues by improving the model training via an optimum utilization of spectral information that suffices to reach high prediction accuracy we note that the best band combination depends on a number of factors such as the type of water quality variable the sensor s sensitivity to the reflected radiation at certain bands the timing of imagery and the chemical composition of a given quality variable at different locations needless to mention a best band combination to detecting sc in water may not be the same as that for e g chlorophyll a the timing of imagery should also be noticed for the possible temporary change of watercolor due to the presence of cdom or the occurrence of algal blooms for instance the best band combination for the lu in july may be different from what holds in other usual instances due to the possible appearance of red algal blooms at this time finally the chemical properties of water affect the electromagnetic energy reflection received by a satellite sensor so that changes of solutes and chemicals in water may reduce or increase the reflectance at a particular wavelength also the presence of some compounds in water can affect the optical properties of other water components e g a high amount of suspended sediments masks the spectral characteristics of chlorophyll a he et al 2008 matsushita et al 2008 4 2 model accuracy table 3 shows the accuracy of the three predictive models i e ann anfis and mlr in the training and testing processes using sentinel 2 and landsat 8 data separately fig 5 further shows the goodness of fit plots for the ann fig 5a d anfis fig 5e h and mlr fig 5i l models all correlations were significant with p value 0 01 the ann model fed by sentinel 2data gives a significant relationship between sc and water surface reflectance as evidenced by r2 0 95 nrmse 5 37 and mean absolute error mae 10 34 ppt in the training step and r2 0 92 nrmse 8 29 and mae 12 91 ppt in the testing step similar observation is found for the same model using landsat 8 data on the contrary the mlr model shows the weakest performance regardless of the source of satellite data used see table 3 for the accuracy measures furthermore sentinel 2 data have resulted in smaller nrmse and mae values as compared to those obtained from the landsat 8 data in almost all the explored models the poor ability of the regression model arises from the complex nonlinear relationship between sc and water reflectance at low water depths indeed since sc and water depth impose counteracting influences on the reflectance smaller reflectance values do not necessarily correspond to pixels with high sc hence the mutual variation deviates from a linear relationship accordingly having obtained the highest accuracy given by the ann model this model is used for the rest of the analysis presented in the following sections fig 6 depicts the spatiotemporal error pattern given by the ann anfis and mlr models using the sc measurements in april 2019 and july 2019 separately we compared the spatial pattern of mae with the latest bathymetric maps of the lu rsrc 2020 to explore the possible correlation between the mae and water depth the results show a significant inverse relationship between water depth and mae this relationship denotes that the three models give larger errors in predicting sc values in the lu s boundaries with smaller water depth for water depth smaller than 1 m the median mae for ann anfis and mlr is 19 03 ppt 25 86 ppt and 42 11 ppt respectively the same result for water depth between 1 m and 2 m is 11 57 ppt 17 33 ppt and 31 91 ppt for ann anfis and mlr respectively we observe the smallest mae in depths larger than 2 m which is 5 37 ppt 6 43 ppt and 13 57 ppt for the ann anfis and mlr models respectively the larger error in regions with smaller water depth mainly stems from the influence of the lakebed on the reflect energy from the water surface this issue was also reported for the remote sensing of other water quality measures e g zhao et al 2017 with respect to the temporal pattern we observe that all models show higher maes in april indeed mae for the ann anfis and mlr equals 11 4 ppt 17 52 ppt and 31 82 ppt respectively while it equals 10 85 ppt 16 67 ppt and 30 27 ppt respectively in july this temporal pattern is chiefly due to the higher precipitative water content in the atmosphere in the wet month i e april that contributes to more absorption and diffusion of electromagnetic waves thus increasing the uncertainty of estimation other similar studies have shown the same pattern as well e g khadim et al 2017 additionally lower lake water depth in april 2019 also contributed to larger estimation errors in the sc 4 3 seasonal variation of sc fig 7 depicts the spatial distribution of sc in the lu during 10 months from october 2018 to september 2019 these maps were generated by using the ann trained model using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery maps for december 2018 and june 2019 could not be generated due to the lack of cloud free images at these months table 4 gives the corresponding dates at which satellite data were obtained as well as the average sc over the whole lu surface area i e s x for each date separately the common observation in all months is the smaller sc in the southern part of the lu which is due to the larger contribution of feeding rivers in the south e g simineh and zarrineh rivers the dominance of high sc is also evident in the western side of the north part in almost all months a sharp distinction between the north and south parts is observed in march and april when inflows to the lake are maximum the causeway opening as the only connection between the south and north parts also contributes to a poor mixing as its interference limits the mixing between the two parts over a comparable time scale in late summer i e september a near complete mixing condition is observed across the lake area we note that the sc values across the lake boundaries should be treated with caution due to the error imposed by the very shallow water depth in addition the effect of lake recession during fall and winter is projected into the smaller lake extent at these seasons as compared to spring and summer fig 8 a shows the median sc in the northern part southern part and the whole lake it is interesting to observe a one month lag time between the occurrence of minimum sc in the southern and northern parts in april and may 2019 respectively however changes of sc in the northern and southern parts at other times in a year are synchronous this suggests that the middle causeway s opening imposes the most significant impact on the north south mixing when high flow rates enter the lake giving rise to the observed one month lag time in mixing otherwise the exchange of flow between the two parts as well as the mixing state are not remarkably influenced by the causeway in other seasons fig 8b further shows the coefficient of variation of sc in the north part south part and the whole lake the high agreement between sc variability in the south part and the whole lake indicates the significant role of the southern part in controlling the salinity dynamic over the entire lake at almost all seasons table 4 further indicates that s x in the model fed by the landsat 8 data changes between 208 ppt and 271 ppt with the maximum and minimum values taking place in october 2018 and april 2019 respectively on the other hand the same model results using the sentinel 2 data yields s x ranging from a minimum of 207 ppt in april and may 2019 to the maximum of 281 ppt in october 2018 the average annual relative difference in s x between the results obtained by landsat 8 and sentinel 2 data is 2 5 which is small enough to conclude that the spatial resolution of both data is high enough to accurately capture the spatially averaged concentration of salinity in the lake nevertheless sentinel 2 imagery provides a finer resolved spatial variability of sc see fig 7 which help scrutinize the dynamics of sc variation around the causeway as well as across the regions where the inflows from the feeding rivers join the lake here we note a couple of points first the bias in s x at some months obtained from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 data is partly due to the time difference between the two satellite images that were available for the analysis different reflectance magnitudes due to the sensor s sensitivity further explains the observed bias especially in those months when images from both satellites were available within a 24 hour period second the aforementioned bias grows from 0 7 in april 2019 to 7 3 in march 2019 this is mainly because the lake undergoes different dynamics as time passes from the dates when in situ observations were available as such the uncertainty of predictions by the machine learning models increases simply because they were initially trained by the data representing the lake dynamics at the time of measurement this is clearly apparent in the results of march 2019 when the rivers inflow to the lake are both peaky and flashy because of sentinel 2 higher spatial resolution we use results from this satellite for the rest of the analysis fig 9 shows the seasonal histogram of sc values in the lu in spring when freshwater input to the lake significantly increases the histogram indicates a bimodal distribution where two sharp peaks distinct the northern and southern parts the first peak indicates the high frequency of low scs around 130 ppt in the south part while the second peak is on the contrary indicative of the dominance of higher scs about 220 ppt in summer two sharp peaks relating to the south and north parts are similarly observed however they occur at higher concentrations due to the decrease in the lake freshwater input as well as increase in the lake evaporation rate also the sharpness of the spikes in summer are smoother than that in spring this is because the contrast in the sc between the north and south parts is chiefly evident in july while it dampens in august and september due to the homogenization in sc in the fall and winter sc reaches a single modal distribution which is skewed toward higher scs the inset of fig 9 further shows the histograms of sc in the march july and august february timeframe that are representative of the two main patterns governing the lake sc changes year round 4 4 hysteretic relationship between the lake water volume and sc the volume of water plays an important direct role in controlling the changes of sc and the process of precipitation and dissolution in saline lakes such as the lu fig 10 shows the intra annual variability of s x versus the lake water volume at 10 months from october 2018 to september 2019 we used the previously developed relationship karimi et al 2016 to estimate the lake water volume given the measured lake level at the time of satellite imagery fig 10 reveals a hysteresis between the lake water volume and s x showing a descending limb from october 2018 to may 2019 when the lake water volume is increasing as of may 2019 designated as a turning point the lake shrinks due to the decrease in the inflows and increase in the evaporation rate however this follows a reverse limb that does not coincide with the former one leading to the emergence of a hysteresis cycle indeed contrasting s x is observed at the same lake water volume of 4 7 bcm in april 2019 and september 2019 when s x equals to 206 8 and 240 7 ppt respectively by approaching april freshwater inflow to the lake sharply dilutes the lake s top water layer forming a vertical sc gradient throughout the lake depth from may to september the coupling effects of salt dissolution in former months high evaporation rate and less gradient in the vertical sc profile lead to the sc rise in this period although langbein 1961 also highlighted salt precipitation bed salt dissolution and evaporation as the influencing factors in the formation of such phenomenon the hysteretic relationship between sc and water volume in closed lakes is still poorly understood to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that shows such relationship in the lu and further investigations on the distinct role of the aforementioned processes on the hysteresis are left to future studies we emphasize that the exclusion of october 2019 from the hysteresis analysis does not mask the generality of the above conclusions because the study period can be approximately taken account as a full water year due to only 14 days difference between the beginning and the end of the analyzed images we also note the considerable difference in s x between october 2018 and september 2019 i e 14 reduction in s x at about the same time in two consecutive years this reduction was essentially due to the massive floods occurred in spring 2019 elevating the lake water volume by 2 8 bcm based on data from iran water resources management iwrm company http wrbs wrm ir 494 mm precipitation was reported from october 2018 to september 2019 within the lu basin which was 50 and 45 greater than 11 years i e 330 2 mm and 50 years i e 341 7 mm averages 4 5 implications for the lake water budget ecology and hydrodynamic modeling lu has experienced a sharp decline in water level over the past decades i e 7 5 m drop in 20 years underlining the necessity of a comprehensive understanding of the processes controlling the lake water budget as a closed shallow lake evaporation is the main component of water loss accounting for about 70 of annual water input from direct precipitation as well as surface and groundwater resources siadatmousavi and seyedalipour 2019 several direct and indirect methods e g eddy covariance tower scintillometer empirical equations and energy balance have been developed so far to estimate evaporation from open water surfaces foken et al 2012 mcjannet et al 2011 yao 2009 they prove that in saline lakes water density gradient controlled by sc acts as an important contributor to the evaporation spatial variability over a lake surface area extent therefore extensive knowledge about the spatiotemporal variability of sc help in a less uncertain estimation of the lake total evaporation as compared to the estimations based on using a constant value for water density while computing evaporation asmar and ergenzinger 1999 unfortunately many saline lakes worldwide have encountered drastic shrinking condition over the past decades due to the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities while the latter is witnessed to be a much influential stressor great salt lake aral sea owens lake and walker lake are the globally recognized examples of many other saline lakes that have drawn serious attentions for sustainable restoration planning and monitoring wurtsbaugh et al 2017 the proposed framework in this study is thus one step forward towards an improved estimation of water budget in not only the lu but also several other similar environments of internationally interest fortunately lu water level has been stabilized since 2016 due to the significant efforts in managing water resources in the basin considerable reduction in agricultural water consumption e g improving irrigation efficiency promoting pressurized irrigation systems replacing the traditional crop patterns by those with less water need revisiting the operation of reservoirs on the main rivers feeding the lake expanding urban water treatment facilities to partly provide the lake environmental demand river dredging and controlling the illegal withdrawal from both surface and groundwater resources are among a few constructive actions taken to this end although the lake has further showed signs of restoration recently for the sake of both best management practices and above normal precipitation in 2019 and 2020 it is still far away from the ecologic water level i e 1274 1 m targeted by ulrnc danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 furthermore projections of climate change scenarios reveal that the lu basin will face higher temperature and less precipitation within next decades ahmadebrahimpour et al 2019 terink et al 2013 which will obviously result in higher lake evaporation rate as well as more stress on water resources if the current restoration plans and monitoring are not pursued in at least the next 10 years re initiation of the lake drying will be plausible this may push water managers and policy makers in the region to consider alternative restoration actions such as the lake separation into a few other smaller lakes that have a higher chance of survival this was indeed one of the considering options by ulrp in 2018 while the aral sea experience proved another example of this unfortunate situation micklin 2010 under this condition an accurate estimation of evaporation rate in both space and time plays the most critical role in identifying the location of those spots with the least evaporation rate this further highlights the applicability of the developed tools in this study that can be reliably used to map the sc water density and evaporation rate in a water body of interest at a minimum time labor and computational cost the knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of sc has further implications for the water quality studies conservation laws i e mass conservation momentum conservation and energy conservation form the theoretical foundation of the hydrodynamic processes that control the transport of sediment toxics and nutrients in the environment ji 2017 one significant involving quantity in the related governing equations is the water density which is basically a function of temperature sc and the concentration of total suspended sediment expressed as the equation of state former studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of water density to small changes in the sc motivating the localized development of the equation of state in different environments naftz et al 2011 in particular marjani and jamali 2014 highlighted that ignoring the effect of water density gradient from hydrodynamic models in the lu leads to an inappropriate estimation of water exchange between the north and south parts the developed tools in the present study can tackle these challenges by providing a dynamic distribution of sc in both space and time which help in the advancement of more precise and realistic hydrodynamic models to explore water current mixing pattern and lake groundwater interaction e g sheibani et al 2020 finally the inter and intra annual variability of sc has noteworthy influences on the distribution of biota and other lake ecology descriptors lu is a natural habitat of a rare economically important brine shrimp species known as artemia urmiana which have been traditionally used in fisheries industry for fish and shrimp farming purposes these species have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations of sc for instance abbaspour and nazaridoust 2007 stated that lu s artemia species can tolerate a sc range of 70 to 320 ppt while the sc of 240 ppt is believed to be the maximum suitable level for their reproduction long term monitoring of sc in the lu shows an alarmingly increase in sc by 105 from 166 g l in 1967 to 340 g l in 2008 karbassi et al 2010 which clearly underlines the drastic condition for the survival of artemia during the lake catastrophic drying between 1995 and 2015 our results in table 4 also reveals a continued critical condition for artemia species until the spring of 2019 regarding the threshold of sc determining the artemia survival in the lu the retrieved mechanistic relationship in fig 10 can be used to determine the required minimum volume of environmental water that ensures the lake long term ecological sustainability currently the lu restoration roadmap outlined by ulrnc considers different quantitative and qualitative indices that collectively define the criteria upon which the lake restoration to its stable condition back to 2001 is assessed among these indices the ecological stability criterion is the most crucial one as it asks for the water volume that is also sufficient for the other criteria to be met this criterion determines the minimum lake water volume supporting artemia reproduction and life regarding the lake average sc therefore one can translate the results of fig 10 into a measure that can be effectively used for a dynamic design and monitoring of the lu long term restoration plan in particular results in fig 10 point out that a minimum of 4 4 bcm water volume can be considered as a promising condition to preserve the artemia reproduction and population in the lu 4 6 on the applicability of the proposed framework to predict other water quality measures the developed framework in this study can be conveniently employed to predict other water quality measures of interest conditioned on the availability of sufficient field data however prediction of some water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a do bod cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus with remote sensing data is more challenging as compared to salinity due to their more complex spectral behaviors alparslan et al 2009 additionally remote sensing of water quality in turbid waters i e case ii waters has been less successful as they contain high concentrations of phytoplankton suspended sediments colored dissolved organic matters and constituents from wastewaters resources since many lakes are classified as case ii waters extracting a strong relationship between the concentration of a water quality measure of interest and the reflected electromagnetic radiation may not be possible oyama et al 2007 to tackle this issue some studies have introduced novel approaches to increase the accuracy of water quality assessment in case ii waters for instance spectral decomposition algorithm sda has been proven promising in mapping water quality parameters in turbid waters matsushita et al 2008 oyama et al 2007 we suggest that our proposed framework can be combined with sda to enhance the sda input band selection as well as to determine the decomposition coefficients of sda more accurately future research is needed in this direction to advance the remote sensing of turbid waters 5 final remarks on modeling water quality using machine learning and remote sensing 5 1 intelligent vs reduced complexity models remote sensing of water quality mainly aims to infer the relationships between the reflected electromagnetic waves at different frequencies and water quality measures it is well understood that such relationships are complex due to the convoluted patterns in the electromagnetic properties of water matsushita et al 2008 oyama et al 2007 where the tremendous absorption of energy up to 90 in water even makes the interpretation of reflected information more challenging moreover the spectral pattern of a water quality of interest can be remarkably disturbed by the presence of other dissolved and suspended constituents in water in such instances remote sensing of water quality is limited and may not lead to promising results if appropriate models are not employed to infer the complex predictive relationships as our results demonstrated see section 4 2 the mlr models cannot fully capture such complex relationships due to the model structure that is forced by simple relations between the target and dependent variables on the contrary the intelligent models such as ann and anfis have witnessed great performances in the prediction of water quality measures as they can build different types of predictive relationships that are not confined to any predefined mathematical descriptions here we note that the supremacy of ann over anfis and vice versa in modeling water quality is not obvious as evidenced by many former studies in this and other contexts e g barzegar et al 2016 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 huang and foo 2002 kisi et al 2019 noori et al 2010 talebizadeh and moridnejad 2011 zaman zad ghavidel and montaseri 2014 zhou et al 2020 in general the accuracy of these models is tightly dependent on the variations in the input data nevertheless if both models are well trained they should not yield considerable discrepancies for instance zaman zad ghavidel and montaseri 2014 assessed the performance of three artificial intelligence models i e ann anfis with grid partition anfis gp anfis with subtractive clustering anfis sc to predict tds concentration using hco3 ca na and water discharge as input variables despite the better performance of ann and anfis based models in the training and testing respectively both models showed promising accuracy in predicting tds concentration 5 2 optimum input selection for model training different approaches can be used to determine the optimum input data required for model training these include 1 heuristic methods such as forward selection backward elimination decision tree induction and data reduction like principle component analysis and 2 meta heuristic methods that involve stochastic intelligent searching similar to algorithms like the genetic algorithm or the particle swarm optimization han et al 2011 although heuristic methods are simpler to implement they do not guarantee the best input combination due to their limitations in considering all the possible selections or complex relationships between the studying variables as a case in point principle component transformation could be beneficial in order to select the decisive inputs but because this method considers linear relationships between input variables it cannot work well in cases like water quality that complex non linear relationships hold between variables to avoid the limitation of the heuristic approaches we adopted a meta heuristic optimization algorithm i e nsga ii to intelligently select the best input data combination murugan et al 2009 according to the accuracy results fig 5 this approach demonstrated improvement in the prediction of salinity as compared to the other competing methods that have estimated surface water salinity using satellite remote sensing artlett and pask 2017 guo et al 2017 keith et al 2016 urquhart et al 2013 wang and xu 2008 zhao et al 2017 5 3 validation of machine learning models data science offers different approaches for the validation and comparison of machine learning models holdout validation k fold cross validation leave one out and stratified cross validation are among the most commonly used methods han et al 2011 this study employed k fold cross validation to train and test the ann anfis and mlr models using different possible combinations of in situ data as the training and testing sets that are determined by k this reduces the possibility of misinterpreting the models performance by unreliable very high or low accuracies indeed specific patterns existing in a fraction of data selected randomly for training and testing may complicate or simplify the training process thereby resulting in very contrasting accuracies however a general rule does not exist for specifying the k value on one hand larger k increases the number of model runs to examine all combinations of the k folds thus increasing the computational cost which can be an issue while dealing with big datasets on the other hand larger k typically leads to a better judgment about the model accuracy in this study we used three folds to make a balance between the run time of the adaptive learning process and the minimum number of folds that assures reliable model performance given by the well recognized training and testing datasets 6 conclusions utilizing satellite imagery to map the spatiotemporal variability of sc in water surface has been proven as a promising approach regarding the limited and sparse measurements of this important water quality metric worldwide in this study we developed an adaptive machine learning based model for the prediction of sc using high resolution images of landsat 8 and sentinel 2 we examined the performance of three models i e ann anfis and mlr in the hypersaline lu by calibrating them against the measured sc data collected during two campaigns in april and july 2019 the main findings of this study suggest that 1 the blue green red band combination gave the least error between the predicted and measured sc regardless of the satellite data source used 2 the ann and mlr models captured the most and least accurate relationship between sc and water surface reflectance respectively 3 data from sentinel 2 resulted in smaller nrmse and mae between the estimated and measured sc as compared to those obtained from landsat 8 data in almost all the explored model types 4 the spatial resolution of both data sources was high enough to accurately capture the lake averaged sc nevertheless the finer spatial resolution of sentinel 2 imagery facilitates a scrutinized analysis of the sc variation around the causeway as well as in those regions where salt dissolution is significant 5 the lu s middle causeway imposes the most significant impact on the north south water mixing when high flow rates enter the lake this causes a one month lag time between the occurrence of minimum sc in the southern and northern parts however the exchange of flow between the two parts is not remarkably influenced by the causeway in other seasons 6 on the annual scale two mixing patterns of sc were detected a nearly complete mixing condition governs the whole lake from august to february while a clear distinction between the north and south part is evident from march to july the very high agreement between the year round sc variability in the southern part and the whole lake witnesses the dominant effect of the southern part in controlling the whole lake s sc dynamics 7 a hysteresis was observed between the lake water volume and the lake averaged sc indicating that bed salt dissolution and high surface evaporation rate leads to higher sc at the end of summer as compared to that in spring credit authorship contribution statement majid bayati conceptualization methodology software visualization

4797,the spatiotemporal dynamic of salinity concentration sc in saline lakes is strongly dependent on the rate of water flow into the lake water circulation wind speed evaporation rate and the phenomenon of salt precipitation and dissolution although in situ observations most reliably quantify water quality metrics the spatiotemporal distribution of such data are typically limited and cannot be readily extrapolated for either long term projections or extensive areas alternatively remotely sensed imagery has facilitated less expensive and a stronger ability to estimate water quality over a wide range of spatiotemporal resolutions this study introduces an adaptive learning model that leverages in situ measurements satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of water surface sc in saline lakes we demonstrate the applicability of the framework by using high resolution sentinel 2 and landsat 8 satellite data in the lake urmia lu where 130 points were sampled in april and july 2019 for the model calibration and validation purposes the results showed that artificial neural network ann yields the most accurate relationship between sc and water surface reflectance r2 0 94 nrmse 6 9 mae 12 3 ppt as compared to adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis and multiple linear regression mlr models a sharp distinction in sc between the lu s northern and southern parts was observed during high flows due to the limitation on north south water mixing imposed by the lake s middle causeway nevertheless the impact of causeway on water circulation at the other seasons is minimum a hysteretic relationship was also found between the lake water volume and the lake averaged sc due to the distinct role of bed salt dissolution and high evaporation rate at different seasons a tight agreement between the sc variations in the southern part and the whole lake proved that the southern part dominantly controls sc dynamics in the whole lake keywords water surface salinity machine learning sentinel 2 landsat 8 lake urmia 1 introduction the spatiotemporal variability of salinity concentration sc in hypersaline water bodies plays a critical role in hydrodynamic modeling and water quality studies several former studies have demonstrated the remarkable impact of sc magnitude and fluctuation on aquatic biodiversity and life williams 2002 bathymetry dynamics karimi et al 2016 and evaporation rate kokya and kokya 2008 aquatic life in saline waters is conditioned on a certain sc threshold so that approaching or exceeding the tolerance can intervene the reproduction or cause the extinction of some biota karbassi et al 2010 khosravi et al 2013 principally aquatic species become much more vulnerable to other pollutants and chemical stresses when they are close to the permissible level of sc for instance in many cases the toxicity of compounds like insecticides increases at high sc williams 2002 sc changes can also promote the presence of exotic species in an aquatic environment influencing the food chain and threatening some aboriginal organisms heugens et al 2001 in addition the bed salt dissolution in hypersaline lakes takes place due to changes in water volume and the intensity of water circulation conversely if the salt concentration becomes saturated some portion of the dissolved salt settles down such processes known as precipitation and dissolution change the lake bed bathymetry continuously which dictate a dynamic relationship between the lake water level volume and surface area karimi et al 2016 sima and tajrishy 2013 furthermore the volume of water loss from a hypersaline lake via evaporation is not only a function of the lake surface area but is also directly influenced by the sc level in multiple ways increase in the sc i elevates the solution ion activity which leads to declination in the spontaneous transformation of a liquid phase into a vapor phase and ii increases the density of water which subsequently decreases surface water evaporation kokya and kokya 2008 in situ measurements are the most reliable approach to monitor water sc in both time and space this is typically carried out by conductivity temperature depth ctd measurements or employing fiber optic sensors to directly measure the sc e g qian et al 2018 however extensive and frequent data collection and analysis is expensive and limited confining a proper description of the spatiotemporal fluctuations in sc alternatively remote sensing imagery and techniques have been widely used in surface water quality monitoring due to large area coverage repetitive data collection over a variety of resolutions and simultaneous information acquisition from different bands in the electromagnetic spectrum this information help construct the relationships between the reflected radiation and water chemical characteristics e g mishra et al 2017 there are three types of approaches in this direction the first approach is mainly applied in coastal and estuarine environments where organic matters largely influence the optical properties of water bowers and brett 2008 hence measurements of chromophoric or colored dissolved organic matter cdom absorption are correlated with the sc ahn et al 2008 bai et al 2013 binding and bowers 2003 this is accomplished by first calibrating the relationship between cdom and water surface reflectance and then calibrating another relationship between cdom and sc using in situ measurements of both sc and cdom absorption coefficients it is thus clear that estimation of sc from cdom rather than directly from water surface reflectance is a much more complex process that carries a higher degree of uncertainty arising from field data collection and model calibration second the relationship between water surface reflectance and cdom absorption coefficient holds valid when sc ranges between 5 ppt and 35 ppt which is limited to the estuarine and coastal areas see bowers and brett 2008 and keith et al 2016 for further details the second approach focuses on establishing a mathematical relationship between water surface reflectance and sc using various predictive models such as neural networks chen and hu 2017 geiger et al 2013 urquhart et al 2012 regression models ferdous and rahman 2020 han et al 2019 khorram 1982 wang and xu 2008 and box jenkins algorithm marghany and hashim 2011 the third approach is similar to the second one as it leverages the satellite surface reflectance to evaluate sc however this approach seeks to develop a model that takes into account the spatial variation in the spectral properties of water in particular these models tune training parameters for each region of the study area rather than tuning a model for the whole area xie et al 2013 urquhart et al 2013 khadim et al 2017 introduced a spatially weighted optimization model swom to assess the spatiotemporal variations in sc in all approaches water surface reflectance data can be provided by different airborne platforms such as modis bai et al 2013 chen and hu 2017 geiger et al 2013 marghany and hashim 2011 urquhart et al 2012 landsat mss khorram 1982 landsat tm ferdous and rahman 2020 wang and xu 2008 landsat oli ferdous and rahman 2020 han et al 2019 seawifs ahn et al 2008 binding and bowers 2003 goci sun et al 2019 aquarius dinnat et al 2019 smos dinnat et al 2019 and smap dinnat et al 2019 beside remote sensing based approaches many studies have used disparate water quality measures as proxy to estimate other quality parameters barzegar et al 2016 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 gazzaz et al 2012 khan and chai 2017 kisi et al 2019 ranković et al 2011 sahu et al 2011 zaman zad ghavidel and montaseri 2014 or have predicted quality parameters

a wide spectrum of learning based models several studies have demonstrated artificial neural networks ann and adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis to yield the most robust and accurate results for water quality assessment in coastal areas palani et al 2008 zhou et al 2020 rivers barzegar et al 2018 2016 ding et al 2014 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 gazzaz et al 2012 huang and foo 2002

this study we introduce an adaptive learning framework for the prediction of sc which couples a machine learning based model to high resolution satellite imagery to this end we first identify the best input satellite band combinations using the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii to ensure an optimum utilization of all necessary bands for sc prediction we then employ the ann and anfis to predict sc since these models belong to completely different realms i e swarm intelligence vs fuzzy logic we intend to explore their distinct capability in deriving the complex relationship between sc and water surface reflectance additionally we evaluate and compare the accuracy of multiple linear regression mlr model as reduced complexity model with much lower computational cost using high resolution sentinel 2 and landsat 8 imagery we demonstrate the applicability of the above framework in the hypersaline lake urmia lu located in northwestern iran in particular we aim to i investigate the spatiotemporal variability of sc in the lu ii explore the impact of the lake s middle causeway on the flow circulation and the mixing pattern of sc between the lake s north and south parts and iii study the sensitivity of the results to the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used in the constructed predictive models the novelty of this study is twofold first since increasing the number of inputs does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the machine learning models and may even lead to overtraining we coupled the predictive model with a meta heuristic stochastic searching algorithm that leverages genetic optimization theory to intelligently search for the optimum inputs i e bands second applying the proposed framework in the lu has revealed some governing physical dynamics in the sc variation such as hysteresis that could not be explored so far the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and gives a brief overview of the lu history by highlighting how anthropogenic activities have reshaped the lu water quantity and quality over the past two decades section 3 presents the modeling framework together with the utilized in situ and remote sensing data for the model calibration and validation purposes section 4 presents the results of the three predictive models and compares them in terms of the satellite data used the spatiotemporal variability of sc in a water year is also explored with emphasis on the mixing pattern dynamics and the emergence of hysteresis implications of the results as well as the applicability of the proposed framework in the lake water budget ecology and hydrodynamic studies are further discussed in this section section 5 further discusses the challenges related to the remote sensing of water quality as well as the advantages of machine learning models in extracting the relationships between water quality measures and surface reflectance data this section also highlights the importance of optimum input band selection to the reliability of learning models finally section 6 summarizes the main findings of this study 2 study area lu located in the northwest of iran 37 46 31 5 n and 45 20 32 4 e is a shallow lake with average depth of about 1 5 m in 2019 known as the second largest hypersaline lake in the world fig 1 a the lake is about 130 km long with the width changing from 12 km in the middle to 40 km towards the northern and southern shores march 2019 lu was registered by the ramsar convention in 1971 as a habitat for birds and rare species like artemia urmiana and was also declared a unesco biosphere reserve in 1976 ramsar sites information service 1971 the lu drainage basin has a semi arid climate with the daily air temperature fluctuating between 6 c and 31 2 c the average precipitation of 350 mm year and the average annual actual evapotranspiration of 421 mm between 2000 and 2016 a considerable portion of the lu water is supplied by river inflow from namely the gadar chay baranduz roze chay nazlu chay zula chay qale chay tasuj sufi chay aji chay shahr chay mahabad simine rud and zarine rud among other rivers fig 1a fig 1b shows the time series of the lu water level and volume between 1965 and 2019 the highest water level was recorded in 1995 at 1277 9 m followed by a declining trend lasting for about two decades in 2015 the lake experienced the lowest historical water volume at 1 25 bcm which was 96 less than that in 1995 causing serious environmental and socioeconomic problems in the lake region see danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 and referenced therein for details on these issues and the causes of lu drying annual changes in sc in lu mainly occurs as a result of water volume changes as a direct result of the water volume reduction the lake sc elevated from 280 g l in 1967 to more than 340 g l in 2008 karbassi et al 2010 such a high salt concentration threatened the population of artemia alarmingly over the past years which consequently reduced the number of migratory birds as well as adversely impacted the economic activities relating to the artemia use for commercial purposes hassanzadeh et al 2012 lu is also intervened by a causeway that is about 15 km long which divides the lake into the northern and southern parts fig 1c as a result water exchange between the separated parts occurs only through a 1 25 km opening which is about 8 of the causeway length a balanced water circulation exists at the opening however the circulation shows a mainly northward flow tendency around the spring due to the increase in the river inputs from the southern part the small opening size also influences the water mixing in the lake which may lead to the density difference of 23 kg m3 between the northern and southern parts in april marjani and jamali 2014 the majority of the lake inflow from the feeding rivers enters the southern part making it less saline as compared to the northern part 3 methods and data 3 1 field measurements multiple measurements of water surface sc were conducted during april 10th 14th 2019 and july 16th 2019 across the lu in both the northern and southern parts the first and second measuring campaigns were carried out by the geological survey and mineral exploration of iran gsi and the remote sensing research center rsrc at the sharif university of technology sut respectively totally 130 points were sampled which covered a wide range of sc from 65 ppt to 320 ppt fig 2 a shows the location of 79 sampling points corresponding to april 10th 14th and fig 2b shows the location of other 51 measurement points on july 16th water samples were collected by 0 3 l bottles from the top 20 cm of the lake water depth a 912 conductometer metrohm portable probe fig 2c was used to measure the electrical conductivity and sc since the probe yields less accuracy for the scs above 100 ppt all the samples were first diluted five times using distilled water and the measured diluted sc data were then multiplied by five these data were used to train and validate the predictive models described in section 3 4 table 1 gives the measured sc of the 130 sampled points fig 2a and b also show the boxplot of the measured sc from the first and second sampling campaigns respectively sc measured in april 10th 14th 2019 varies between 65 ppt and 304 ppt with the average value of 203 ppt and the standard deviation of 80 ppt sc measured in july 16th 2019 gives a tighter range changing from 247 ppt to 320 ppt with the average value of 282 ppt and the standard deviation of 19 ppt the lower sc in april as compared to july is chiefly due to the massive freshwater inflows from the rivers that usually peak at this time of a year the small sc values in april is also partly attributed to the increased inflow rates from the unusual precipitation of 494 mm from october 2018 to september 2019 which was 50 and 45 greater than 11 years and 50 year average precipitation respectively we further note that sc values lower than 92 ppt were measured near the inlets of the gadar chay mahabad simine rud zarine rud and aji chay rivers fig 1a fig 2a which provide more than 70 of freshwater to the lake sharifan et al 2017 3 2 satellite data we used satellite images from sentinel 2 with a 10 m spatial resolution and 5 days temporal resolution and landsat oli with a 30 m spatial resolution and 16 days temporal resolution to extract water surface reflectance data for the lu www earthexplorer usgs gov to generate monthly sc maps atmospherically corrected images were acquired for each month from october 2018 to september 2019 the proximity of two satellite images was the other condition that was met to make the comparison between the model results from the two data sources possible cloud free images across the lu extent were not detected in december 2018 and july 2019 and thus these months were not included in the analysis 3 3 waterbody extraction at each studied date the processing operations on the satellite images should be confined to the lake water boundary we extracted the lake boundary by using the k means unsupervised clustering algorithm likas et al 2003 within the google earth engine gee platform gee is an open source cloud computing environment that holds a collection of satellite and geospatial datasets and offers different built in image processing and geospatial techniques gorelick et al 2017 soil adjusted vegetation index savi and the normalized difference water index ndwi were used as the input layers for clustering to improve the accuracy of distinction between the water body and dry land 3 4 the adaptive learning model development in this study we employed two learning algorithms i e ann and anfis and made them adaptive to recognize the most accurate relationship between the sc measurements and the digital reflectance data provided by satellite imagery each model consists of two main parts 1 a feature selection module to determine the best band combination from the satellite data and 2 a machine learning based model to predict sc we also examined the efficiency of the mlr model to explore the relative accuracy of such a reduced complexity model as compared to the other two ones that are capable of learning and distinguishing complex non linear relationships between the target and the dependent variables among many other machine learning based models the advantage of these two models is largely overcoming the limitations imposed by noisy and incomplete data for the sake of deep understanding of data behavior and its variability in all models 70 of field data were selected randomly for the training purpose and the remaining 30 were used for the model testing we employed a k fold cross validation method with three folds for the model training and testing two folds contain the training data and one fold contains the testing data the procedure of model training and testing was repeated three times where in each iteration a unique combination of training and testing folds was used ultimately the median accuracy of the three trainings and the median accuracy of the three validations were used as measures to select the best model performance 3 4 1 artificial neural networks ann ann is a supervised machine learning algorithm that consists of different layers including the input layer one or more hidden layer s and the output layer fig 3 shows a typical ann structure with one hidden layer and one output layer the number of hidden layers is arbitrary but practically one layer is often used to prevent a complicated network structure han et al 2011 each layer comprises of several units called neurons green circles in fig 3 that are denoted by i 1 i n and j 1 j m in the input and hidden layer respectively n and m are the total number of neurons in the input and hidden layer respectively the number of input layer neurons indicates the total number of input variables see fig 3 the ann input variables i e the water surface reflectance data are weighted in the input layer and are then fed into the neurons of the hidden layer this operation is described by eq 1 as 1 i j i w ij b l x i b j where ij is the input value to the neuron j in the hidden layer wij is the weight corresponding to the link that connects neurons i of the input layer to neuron j of the hidden layer bl x i is the reflectance value of band l at locations x that is imported from neuron i and bj is the constant value corresponding to neuron j each neuron j in the hidden layer ultimately applies a nonlinear activation function to ij yielding the output expressed as 2 o j 1 1 exp i j where oj is the output from neuron j in the hidden layer finally the output layer emits the prediction as 3 s x p j w jk o j ε where s x p is the predicted sc at locations x across a waterbody wjk is the weight corresponding to the links that connect neurons j of the hidden layer to the output layer s neuron k 1 k np where np is the total number of predicted outputs via ann in this study ann only predicts s x p and thus k 1 and ɛ is the constant value of the output layer s neuron in the training process of ann the unknown parameters wij wjk bj and ɛ are calibrated such that the following objective function is minimized 4 minimize g 1 a s x g t s x g p 2 where a is number of field data samples and s x g t represents the measured sc at location x g 1 g a for the training process the backpropagation technique was utilized via mlp iteratively daniel 2013 3 4 2 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis anfis is a fuzzy logic based machine learning tool that inherently is a takagi sugeno kang tsk fuzzy inference system but is built and trained using the structure of neural networks jang 1993 tsk introduces rule based linear relationships between the input and output variables each contributing to the tsk predicted value determined by the rule based adaptive weights mendel 2017 we can express a tsk system with n number of inputs and r number of rules as 5 rule 1 if b 1 x is a 11 and and if b n x is a n 1 then s 1 x p α 01 l 1 n α l 1 b l x rule r if b 1 x is a 1 r and and if b n x is a nr then s r x p α 0 r l 1 n α lr b l x where a lq 1 l n 1 q r is the fuzzy set indicating a range of b l x s q x p is the predicted sc values from each rule and α l q is a constant value determined by the tsk the final predicted sc by the above tsk system is represented by 6 s x p q 1 r s q x p w q q 1 r w q q 1 r s q x p l 1 n μ a lq b l x q 1 r w q where wq indicates the strength of s q x p and μ a lq b l x 0 μ a lq 1 is the degree of membership to which b l x belongs to the fuzzy set a lq tsk leverages different membership functions among which the gaussian function equation 7 is commonly used because of its smooth representation of the input changes 7 μ a lq b l x exp 0 5 b l x m lq σ lq 2 2 in this expression m lq and σ lq are the parameters of the gaussian function using eq 7 eq 6 is extended as the following 8 s x p q 1 r s q x p exp 0 5 l 1 n b l x m lq σ lq 2 2 q 1 r exp 0 5 l 1 n b l x m lq σ lq 2 2 eq 8 shows that a tsk system establishes a nonlinear relation between the target and dependent variables the process of building and training a tsk system mainly involves calibrating all the unknown parameters in eq 8 i e mlq and σlq so that the objective function in eq 4 is minimized in the anfis structure ann works as an optimization framework by tuning all the tsk parameters hence leveraging a combined advantages of both fuzzy inference system fis and ann jang 1993 3 4 3 multiple linear regression mlr model a mlr model fits a multiple linear relation between the target and dependent variables which can be expressed as 9 s x p β 0 l 1 n β l b l x ε where βl is the relating coefficient of bl x β0 is a constant and ɛ is the model s bias we used the least squared method to estimate β0 and βl s in eq 9 by minimizing the objective function in eq 4 3 4 4 band selection selecting the optimal number of input variables to a machine learning model such as ann and anfis has a significant influence on the accuracy of the results redundant information makes the generated model structure more complex increasing the number of calibration parameters and thereby misleading the training process besides since the model inputs in this study are different bands of satellite images keeping the irrelevant bands increases the computational cost too han et al 2011 to avoid these issues we used the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii to determine the best band combination that can appropriately describe the variability in the measured sc data this model is based on a multi objective optimization algorithm that aims to minimize both the number of selected bands and the model bias between the predicted and observed sc as 10 minimize e v v l 0 e v g 1 a s x g t s ann train x g p v 2 a 0 5 g 1 a s x g t s ann test x g p v 2 a 0 5 where v is a binary decision vector determining the selected bands s ann train x g p v and s ann test x g p v are the predicted sc in the training and testing phase of ann respectively which use the selected input bands determined by v v l 0 represents the number of non zero elements i e number of selected bands in v fig 4 a shows the flowchart of the nsga ii process in the first iteration a population p v 1 v 2 v τ t is defined as a set of decision vectors v u s 1 u τ where τ is the size of p i e the number of decision vectors and t is the iteration number the configuration of binary elements in v u s is set randomly at t 1 the ann algorithm is then used τ times to find the best predictive model of s using each v u as input which subsequently yields the associated error e v u given v u s and e v u s the nsga ii algorithm sorts the population using non dominated sorting that is based on the pareto domination optimality in this scheme the relative dominance of v u s over each other is made by the following conditions van veldhuizen and lamont 2000 11 e v u e v u and v u l 0 v u l 0 and e v u e v u or v u l 0 v u l 0 after the non domination check all v u s not dominated by any other decision vectors are ranked first regardless of the ranked first members the process is repeated again and those v u s that are not dominated by any others are ranked second this iteration continues until a rank is assigned to all v u s of the population v u s with the same rank of f are categorized as front f based on the pareto domination optimality v u s that fall in the first front are the best solutions with respect to e vu and vu l 0 fig 4b shows a pareto front that is generated in the non dominated sorting which is the ranked form of v u s in a population in addition to non dominated sorting in the sorting part of nsga ii crowding distance cd is also computed separately for every member of each front as 12 cd v u e v u 1 e v u 1 e v max e v min v u 1 l 0 v u 1 l 0 v l 0 max v l 0 min where u 1 and u 1 denote the decision vectors of the left side and the right side of the decision vector u in a pareto front respectively superscripts max and min denote the maximum and minimum value of the associated errors as well as the maximum and minimum number of selected bands in a pareto front respectively cd measures the density of solutions in the decision space of objective functions in nsga ii solutions with lower rank and higher cd are worthier solutions in the selection part best τ solutions where τ is the size of initial population are first used based on the previous sorting while the rest are neglected i e the first iteration skips the selection part the remaining steps follow the classical genetic algorithm binary tournament selection selects v u s from the population and then offspring c vʹ1 vʹ2 t and mutant m vʹʹ1 vʹʹ2 t are generated via crossover and mutation operators between selected parents respectively murugan et al 2009 mutants offspring and the main population are combined and make a new larger population r v 1 v 2 v d vʹ1 vʹ2 vʹʹ1 vʹʹ2 t similar to the operation performed for initial population evaluation of the new population yields to e v u s and the new population is sorted based on the errors non dominated sorting and cd after the selection part the new population p t 1 is selected among best r t members and the algorithm proceeds until reaching the iteration after which no improvement is found in a new population based on e vu s and vu l 0 s murugan et al 2009 we note that τ should be selected large enough to ensure no critical information is missed for the purpose of training the ann algorithm on the other hand the efficiency of the nsga ii algorithm diminishes as τ increases simply because the iteration process approaches the monte carlo simulation of all possible permutations of the binary elements therefore an appropriate selection of τ is a trade off between the above two criteria which should be examined via a sensitivity analysis 4 results and discussion 4 1 best band combination table 2 gives the best band combinations determined by the feature selection module for both the sentilen 2 and landsat 8 satellite data the pareto front obtained by implementing the nsga ii algorithm linked with ann suggests that the optimum number of bands yielding the most accurate prediction of sc are one two and three the results show that the combination of blue green and red bands gives the least error between the predicted and measured sc regardless of the satellite data source used in the case of two bands as input the green red and blue green band combinations are optimum using sentinel 2 and landsat 8 data respectively the green band from sentinel 2 and the blue band from landsat 8 are suggested when the model is fed by only one single band as input we observe that the prediction accuracy improves as the number of input bands increases as a result of using more spectral information however this cannot be considered as a general conclusion for a couple of reasons first the addition of bands does not necessarily provide relevant spectral information on the water quality metric of interest indeed high absorption rate of electromagnetic radiation in water beyond the visible region masks patterns and variations in the spectral signature of water constituents which does not provide interpretable information to improve the prediction accuracy govender et al 2007 he et al 2008 given that the visible range shows strong spectral signature in water the emergence of at least one band from this range in the best band combination is expected in the remote sensing of water applications alparslan et al 2009 matsushita et al 2008 wang and xu 2008 second spectral information from a wide range of bands typically mislead the model training by using redundant less informative data that increase the chance of overtraining the employed framework in this study have resolved these issues by improving the model training via an optimum utilization of spectral information that suffices to reach high prediction accuracy we note that the best band combination depends on a number of factors such as the type of water quality variable the sensor s sensitivity to the reflected radiation at certain bands the timing of imagery and the chemical composition of a given quality variable at different locations needless to mention a best band combination to detecting sc in water may not be the same as that for e g chlorophyll a the timing of imagery should also be noticed for the possible temporary change of watercolor due to the presence of cdom or the occurrence of algal blooms for instance the best band combination for the lu in july may be different from what holds in other usual instances due to the possible appearance of red algal blooms at this time finally the chemical properties of water affect the electromagnetic energy reflection received by a satellite sensor so that changes of solutes and chemicals in water may reduce or increase the reflectance at a particular wavelength also the presence of some compounds in water can affect the optical properties of other water components e g a high amount of suspended sediments masks the spectral characteristics of chlorophyll a he et al 2008 matsushita et al 2008 4 2 model accuracy table 3 shows the accuracy of the three predictive models i e ann anfis and mlr in the training and testing processes using sentinel 2 and landsat 8 data separately fig 5 further shows the goodness of fit plots for the ann fig 5a d anfis fig 5e h and mlr fig 5i l models all correlations were significant with p value 0 01 the ann model fed by sentinel 2data gives a significant relationship between sc and water surface reflectance as evidenced by r2 0 95 nrmse 5 37 and mean absolute error mae 10 34 ppt in the training step and r2 0 92 nrmse 8 29 and mae 12 91 ppt in the testing step similar observation is found for the same model using landsat 8 data on the contrary the mlr model shows the weakest performance regardless of the source of satellite data used see table 3 for the accuracy measures furthermore sentinel 2 data have resulted in smaller nrmse and mae values as compared to those obtained from the landsat 8 data in almost all the explored models the poor ability of the regression model arises from the complex nonlinear relationship between sc and water reflectance at low water depths indeed since sc and water depth impose counteracting influences on the reflectance smaller reflectance values do not necessarily correspond to pixels with high sc hence the mutual variation deviates from a linear relationship accordingly having obtained the highest accuracy given by the ann model this model is used for the rest of the analysis presented in the following sections fig 6 depicts the spatiotemporal error pattern given by the ann anfis and mlr models using the sc measurements in april 2019 and july 2019 separately we compared the spatial pattern of mae with the latest bathymetric maps of the lu rsrc 2020 to explore the possible correlation between the mae and water depth the results show a significant inverse relationship between water depth and mae this relationship denotes that the three models give larger errors in predicting sc values in the lu s boundaries with smaller water depth for water depth smaller than 1 m the median mae for ann anfis and mlr is 19 03 ppt 25 86 ppt and 42 11 ppt respectively the same result for water depth between 1 m and 2 m is 11 57 ppt 17 33 ppt and 31 91 ppt for ann anfis and mlr respectively we observe the smallest mae in depths larger than 2 m which is 5 37 ppt 6 43 ppt and 13 57 ppt for the ann anfis and mlr models respectively the larger error in regions with smaller water depth mainly stems from the influence of the lakebed on the reflect energy from the water surface this issue was also reported for the remote sensing of other water quality measures e g zhao et al 2017 with respect to the temporal pattern we observe that all models show higher maes in april indeed mae for the ann anfis and mlr equals 11 4 ppt 17 52 ppt and 31 82 ppt respectively while it equals 10 85 ppt 16 67 ppt and 30 27 ppt respectively in july this temporal pattern is chiefly due to the higher precipitative water content in the atmosphere in the wet month i e april that contributes to more absorption and diffusion of electromagnetic waves thus increasing the uncertainty of estimation other similar studies have shown the same pattern as well e g khadim et al 2017 additionally lower lake water depth in april 2019 also contributed to larger estimation errors in the sc 4 3 seasonal variation of sc fig 7 depicts the spatial distribution of sc in the lu during 10 months from october 2018 to september 2019 these maps were generated by using the ann trained model using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery maps for december 2018 and june 2019 could not be generated due to the lack of cloud free images at these months table 4 gives the corresponding dates at which satellite data were obtained as well as the average sc over the whole lu surface area i e s x for each date separately the common observation in all months is the smaller sc in the southern part of the lu which is due to the larger contribution of feeding rivers in the south e g simineh and zarrineh rivers the dominance of high sc is also evident in the western side of the north part in almost all months a sharp distinction between the north and south parts is observed in march and april when inflows to the lake are maximum the causeway opening as the only connection between the south and north parts also contributes to a poor mixing as its interference limits the mixing between the two parts over a comparable time scale in late summer i e september a near complete mixing condition is observed across the lake area we note that the sc values across the lake boundaries should be treated with caution due to the error imposed by the very shallow water depth in addition the effect of lake recession during fall and winter is projected into the smaller lake extent at these seasons as compared to spring and summer fig 8 a shows the median sc in the northern part southern part and the whole lake it is interesting to observe a one month lag time between the occurrence of minimum sc in the southern and northern parts in april and may 2019 respectively however changes of sc in the northern and southern parts at other times in a year are synchronous this suggests that the middle causeway s opening imposes the most significant impact on the north south mixing when high flow rates enter the lake giving rise to the observed one month lag time in mixing otherwise the exchange of flow between the two parts as well as the mixing state are not remarkably influenced by the causeway in other seasons fig 8b further shows the coefficient of variation of sc in the north part south part and the whole lake the high agreement between sc variability in the south part and the whole lake indicates the significant role of the southern part in controlling the salinity dynamic over the entire lake at almost all seasons table 4 further indicates that s x in the model fed by the landsat 8 data changes between 208 ppt and 271 ppt with the maximum and minimum values taking place in october 2018 and april 2019 respectively on the other hand the same model results using the sentinel 2 data yields s x ranging from a minimum of 207 ppt in april and may 2019 to the maximum of 281 ppt in october 2018 the average annual relative difference in s x between the results obtained by landsat 8 and sentinel 2 data is 2 5 which is small enough to conclude that the spatial resolution of both data is high enough to accurately capture the spatially averaged concentration of salinity in the lake nevertheless sentinel 2 imagery provides a finer resolved spatial variability of sc see fig 7 which help scrutinize the dynamics of sc variation around the causeway as well as across the regions where the inflows from the feeding rivers join the lake here we note a couple of points first the bias in s x at some months obtained from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 data is partly due to the time difference between the two satellite images that were available for the analysis different reflectance magnitudes due to the sensor s sensitivity further explains the observed bias especially in those months when images from both satellites were available within a 24 hour period second the aforementioned bias grows from 0 7 in april 2019 to 7 3 in march 2019 this is mainly because the lake undergoes different dynamics as time passes from the dates when in situ observations were available as such the uncertainty of predictions by the machine learning models increases simply because they were initially trained by the data representing the lake dynamics at the time of measurement this is clearly apparent in the results of march 2019 when the rivers inflow to the lake are both peaky and flashy because of sentinel 2 higher spatial resolution we use results from this satellite for the rest of the analysis fig 9 shows the seasonal histogram of sc values in the lu in spring when freshwater input to the lake significantly increases the histogram indicates a bimodal distribution where two sharp peaks distinct the northern and southern parts the first peak indicates the high frequency of low scs around 130 ppt in the south part while the second peak is on the contrary indicative of the dominance of higher scs about 220 ppt in summer two sharp peaks relating to the south and north parts are similarly observed however they occur at higher concentrations due to the decrease in the lake freshwater input as well as increase in the lake evaporation rate also the sharpness of the spikes in summer are smoother than that in spring this is because the contrast in the sc between the north and south parts is chiefly evident in july while it dampens in august and september due to the homogenization in sc in the fall and winter sc reaches a single modal distribution which is skewed toward higher scs the inset of fig 9 further shows the histograms of sc in the march july and august february timeframe that are representative of the two main patterns governing the lake sc changes year round 4 4 hysteretic relationship between the lake water volume and sc the volume of water plays an important direct role in controlling the changes of sc and the process of precipitation and dissolution in saline lakes such as the lu fig 10 shows the intra annual variability of s x versus the lake water volume at 10 months from october 2018 to september 2019 we used the previously developed relationship karimi et al 2016 to estimate the lake water volume given the measured lake level at the time of satellite imagery fig 10 reveals a hysteresis between the lake water volume and s x showing a descending limb from october 2018 to may 2019 when the lake water volume is increasing as of may 2019 designated as a turning point the lake shrinks due to the decrease in the inflows and increase in the evaporation rate however this follows a reverse limb that does not coincide with the former one leading to the emergence of a hysteresis cycle indeed contrasting s x is observed at the same lake water volume of 4 7 bcm in april 2019 and september 2019 when s x equals to 206 8 and 240 7 ppt respectively by approaching april freshwater inflow to the lake sharply dilutes the lake s top water layer forming a vertical sc gradient throughout the lake depth from may to september the coupling effects of salt dissolution in former months high evaporation rate and less gradient in the vertical sc profile lead to the sc rise in this period although langbein 1961 also highlighted salt precipitation bed salt dissolution and evaporation as the influencing factors in the formation of such phenomenon the hysteretic relationship between sc and water volume in closed lakes is still poorly understood to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that shows such relationship in the lu and further investigations on the distinct role of the aforementioned processes on the hysteresis are left to future studies we emphasize that the exclusion of october 2019 from the hysteresis analysis does not mask the generality of the above conclusions because the study period can be approximately taken account as a full water year due to only 14 days difference between the beginning and the end of the analyzed images we also note the considerable difference in s x between october 2018 and september 2019 i e 14 reduction in s x at about the same time in two consecutive years this reduction was essentially due to the massive floods occurred in spring 2019 elevating the lake water volume by 2 8 bcm based on data from iran water resources management iwrm company http wrbs wrm ir 494 mm precipitation was reported from october 2018 to september 2019 within the lu basin which was 50 and 45 greater than 11 years i e 330 2 mm and 50 years i e 341 7 mm averages 4 5 implications for the lake water budget ecology and hydrodynamic modeling lu has experienced a sharp decline in water level over the past decades i e 7 5 m drop in 20 years underlining the necessity of a comprehensive understanding of the processes controlling the lake water budget as a closed shallow lake evaporation is the main component of water loss accounting for about 70 of annual water input from direct precipitation as well as surface and groundwater resources siadatmousavi and seyedalipour 2019 several direct and indirect methods e g eddy covariance tower scintillometer empirical equations and energy balance have been developed so far to estimate evaporation from open water surfaces foken et al 2012 mcjannet et al 2011 yao 2009 they prove that in saline lakes water density gradient controlled by sc acts as an important contributor to the evaporation spatial variability over a lake surface area extent therefore extensive knowledge about the spatiotemporal variability of sc help in a less uncertain estimation of the lake total evaporation as compared to the estimations based on using a constant value for water density while computing evaporation asmar and ergenzinger 1999 unfortunately many saline lakes worldwide have encountered drastic shrinking condition over the past decades due to the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities while the latter is witnessed to be a much influential stressor great salt lake aral sea owens lake and walker lake are the globally recognized examples of many other saline lakes that have drawn serious attentions for sustainable restoration planning and monitoring wurtsbaugh et al 2017 the proposed framework in this study is thus one step forward towards an improved estimation of water budget in not only the lu but also several other similar environments of internationally interest fortunately lu water level has been stabilized since 2016 due to the significant efforts in managing water resources in the basin considerable reduction in agricultural water consumption e g improving irrigation efficiency promoting pressurized irrigation systems replacing the traditional crop patterns by those with less water need revisiting the operation of reservoirs on the main rivers feeding the lake expanding urban water treatment facilities to partly provide the lake environmental demand river dredging and controlling the illegal withdrawal from both surface and groundwater resources are among a few constructive actions taken to this end although the lake has further showed signs of restoration recently for the sake of both best management practices and above normal precipitation in 2019 and 2020 it is still far away from the ecologic water level i e 1274 1 m targeted by ulrnc danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 furthermore projections of climate change scenarios reveal that the lu basin will face higher temperature and less precipitation within next decades ahmadebrahimpour et al 2019 terink et al 2013 which will obviously result in higher lake evaporation rate as well as more stress on water resources if the current restoration plans and monitoring are not pursued in at least the next 10 years re initiation of the lake drying will be plausible this may push water managers and policy makers in the region to consider alternative restoration actions such as the lake separation into a few other smaller lakes that have a higher chance of survival this was indeed one of the considering options by ulrp in 2018 while the aral sea experience proved another example of this unfortunate situation micklin 2010 under this condition an accurate estimation of evaporation rate in both space and time plays the most critical role in identifying the location of those spots with the least evaporation rate this further highlights the applicability of the developed tools in this study that can be reliably used to map the sc water density and evaporation rate in a water body of interest at a minimum time labor and computational cost the knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of sc has further implications for the water quality studies conservation laws i e mass conservation momentum conservation and energy conservation form the theoretical foundation of the hydrodynamic processes that control the transport of sediment toxics and nutrients in the environment ji 2017 one significant involving quantity in the related governing equations is the water density which is basically a function of temperature sc and the concentration of total suspended sediment expressed as the equation of state former studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of water density to small changes in the sc motivating the localized development of the equation of state in different environments naftz et al 2011 in particular marjani and jamali 2014 highlighted that ignoring the effect of water density gradient from hydrodynamic models in the lu leads to an inappropriate estimation of water exchange between the north and south parts the developed tools in the present study can tackle these challenges by providing a dynamic distribution of sc in both space and time which help in the advancement of more precise and realistic hydrodynamic models to explore water current mixing pattern and lake groundwater interaction e g sheibani et al 2020 finally the inter and intra annual variability of sc has noteworthy influences on the distribution of biota and other lake ecology descriptors lu is a natural habitat of a rare economically important brine shrimp species known as artemia urmiana which have been traditionally used in fisheries industry for fish and shrimp farming purposes these species have shown to be sensitive to fluctuations of sc for instance abbaspour and nazaridoust 2007 stated that lu s artemia species can tolerate a sc range of 70 to 320 ppt while the sc of 240 ppt is believed to be the maximum suitable level for their reproduction long term monitoring of sc in the lu shows an alarmingly increase in sc by 105 from 166 g l in 1967 to 340 g l in 2008 karbassi et al 2010 which clearly underlines the drastic condition for the survival of artemia during the lake catastrophic drying between 1995 and 2015 our results in table 4 also reveals a continued critical condition for artemia species until the spring of 2019 regarding the threshold of sc determining the artemia survival in the lu the retrieved mechanistic relationship in fig 10 can be used to determine the required minimum volume of environmental water that ensures the lake long term ecological sustainability currently the lu restoration roadmap outlined by ulrnc considers different quantitative and qualitative indices that collectively define the criteria upon which the lake restoration to its stable condition back to 2001 is assessed among these indices the ecological stability criterion is the most crucial one as it asks for the water volume that is also sufficient for the other criteria to be met this criterion determines the minimum lake water volume supporting artemia reproduction and life regarding the lake average sc therefore one can translate the results of fig 10 into a measure that can be effectively used for a dynamic design and monitoring of the lu long term restoration plan in particular results in fig 10 point out that a minimum of 4 4 bcm water volume can be considered as a promising condition to preserve the artemia reproduction and population in the lu 4 6 on the applicability of the proposed framework to predict other water quality measures the developed framework in this study can be conveniently employed to predict other water quality measures of interest conditioned on the availability of sufficient field data however prediction of some water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a do bod cod total nitrogen and total phosphorus with remote sensing data is more challenging as compared to salinity due to their more complex spectral behaviors alparslan et al 2009 additionally remote sensing of water quality in turbid waters i e case ii waters has been less successful as they contain high concentrations of phytoplankton suspended sediments colored dissolved organic matters and constituents from wastewaters resources since many lakes are classified as case ii waters extracting a strong relationship between the concentration of a water quality measure of interest and the reflected electromagnetic radiation may not be possible oyama et al 2007 to tackle this issue some studies have introduced novel approaches to increase the accuracy of water quality assessment in case ii waters for instance spectral decomposition algorithm sda has been proven promising in mapping water quality parameters in turbid waters matsushita et al 2008 oyama et al 2007 we suggest that our proposed framework can be combined with sda to enhance the sda input band selection as well as to determine the decomposition coefficients of sda more accurately future research is needed in this direction to advance the remote sensing of turbid waters 5 final remarks on modeling water quality using machine learning and remote sensing 5 1 intelligent vs reduced complexity models remote sensing of water quality mainly aims to infer the relationships between the reflected electromagnetic waves at different frequencies and water quality measures it is well understood that such relationships are complex due to the convoluted patterns in the electromagnetic properties of water matsushita et al 2008 oyama et al 2007 where the tremendous absorption of energy up to 90 in water even makes the interpretation of reflected information more challenging moreover the spectral pattern of a water quality of interest can be remarkably disturbed by the presence of other dissolved and suspended constituents in water in such instances remote sensing of water quality is limited and may not lead to promising results if appropriate models are not employed to infer the complex predictive relationships as our results demonstrated see section 4 2 the mlr models cannot fully capture such complex relationships due to the model structure that is forced by simple relations between the target and dependent variables on the contrary the intelligent models such as ann and anfis have witnessed great performances in the prediction of water quality measures as they can build different types of predictive relationships that are not confined to any predefined mathematical descriptions here we note that the supremacy of ann over anfis and vice versa in modeling water quality is not obvious as evidenced by many former studies in this and other contexts e g barzegar et al 2016 barzegar and asghari moghaddam 2016 huang and foo 2002 kisi et al 2019 noori et al 2010 talebizadeh and moridnejad 2011 zaman zad ghavidel and montaseri 2014 zhou et al 2020 in general the accuracy of these models is tightly dependent on the variations in the input data nevertheless if both models are well trained they should not yield considerable discrepancies for instance zaman zad ghavidel and montaseri 2014 assessed the performance of three artificial intelligence models i e ann anfis with grid partition anfis gp anfis with subtractive clustering anfis sc to predict tds concentration using hco3 ca na and water discharge as input variables despite the better performance of ann and anfis based models in the training and testing respectively both models showed promising accuracy in predicting tds concentration 5 2 optimum input selection for model training different approaches can be used to determine the optimum input data required for model training these include 1 heuristic methods such as forward selection backward elimination decision tree induction and data reduction like principle component analysis and 2 meta heuristic methods that involve stochastic intelligent searching similar to algorithms like the genetic algorithm or the particle swarm optimization han et al 2011 although heuristic methods are simpler to implement they do not guarantee the best input combination due to their limitations in considering all the possible selections or complex relationships between the studying variables as a case in point principle component transformation could be beneficial in order to select the decisive inputs but because this method considers linear relationships between input variables it cannot work well in cases like water quality that complex non linear relationships hold between variables to avoid the limitation of the heuristic approaches we adopted a meta heuristic optimization algorithm i e nsga ii to intelligently select the best input data combination murugan et al 2009 according to the accuracy results fig 5 this approach demonstrated improvement in the prediction of salinity as compared to the other competing methods that have estimated surface water salinity using satellite remote sensing artlett and pask 2017 guo et al 2017 keith et al 2016 urquhart et al 2013 wang and xu 2008 zhao et al 2017 5 3 validation of machine learning models data science offers different approaches for the validation and comparison of machine learning models holdout validation k fold cross validation leave one out and stratified cross validation are among the most commonly used methods han et al 2011 this study employed k fold cross validation to train and test the ann anfis and mlr models using different possible combinations of in situ data as the training and testing sets that are determined by k this reduces the possibility of misinterpreting the models performance by unreliable very high or low accuracies indeed specific patterns existing in a fraction of data selected randomly for training and testing may complicate or simplify the training process thereby resulting in very contrasting accuracies however a general rule does not exist for specifying the k value on one hand larger k increases the number of model runs to examine all combinations of the k folds thus increasing the computational cost which can be an issue while dealing with big datasets on the other hand larger k typically leads to a better judgment about the model accuracy in this study we used three folds to make a balance between the run time of the adaptive learning process and the minimum number of folds that assures reliable model performance given by the well recognized training and testing datasets 6 conclusions utilizing satellite imagery to map the spatiotemporal variability of sc in water surface has been proven as a promising approach regarding the limited and sparse measurements of this important water quality metric worldwide in this study we developed an adaptive machine learning based model for the prediction of sc using high resolution images of landsat 8 and sentinel 2 we examined the performance of three models i e ann anfis and mlr in the hypersaline lu by calibrating them against the measured sc data collected during two campaigns in april and july 2019 the main findings of this study suggest that 1 the blue green red band combination gave the least error between the predicted and measured sc regardless of the satellite data source used 2 the ann and mlr models captured the most and least accurate relationship between sc and water surface reflectance respectively 3 data from sentinel 2 resulted in smaller nrmse and mae between the estimated and measured sc as compared to those obtained from landsat 8 data in almost all the explored model types 4 the spatial resolution of both data sources was high enough to accurately capture the lake averaged sc nevertheless the finer spatial resolution of sentinel 2 imagery facilitates a scrutinized analysis of the sc variation around the causeway as well as in those regions where salt dissolution is significant 5 the lu s middle causeway imposes the most significant impact on the north south water mixing when high flow rates enter the lake this causes a one month lag time between the occurrence of minimum sc in the southern and northern parts however the exchange of flow between the two parts is not remarkably influenced by the causeway in other seasons 6 on the annual scale two mixing patterns of sc were detected a nearly complete mixing condition governs the whole lake from august to february while a clear distinction between the north and south part is evident from march to july the very high agreement between the year round sc variability in the southern part and the whole lake witnesses the dominant effect of the southern part in controlling the whole lake s sc dynamics 7 a hysteresis was observed between the lake water volume and the lake averaged sc indicating that bed salt dissolution and high surface evaporation rate leads to higher sc at the end of summer as compared to that in spring credit authorship contribution statement majid bayati conceptualization methodology software visualization

4798,soil water repellency defined as the situation in which the affinity of soils to water is reduced has been reported for many natural and agricultural soils worldwide soil water repellency has significant impacts on hydrology and geomorphology it has been widely observed that the contact angle ca of a sessile water drop placed on a single layer surface of water repellent soil particles decreases in an exponential manner with time this time dependent ca has a substantial effect on flow in water repellent soils however mathematical models aimed at modeling water flow in water repellent soils disregard the time dependent ca s effect the current study aims to correct this omission using capillary rise of water with a time dependent ca in a capillary tube a model for water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils ca 90 was developed this model was successfully verified by performing infiltration experiments into packed coated glass beads the ca at the wetting front during infiltration decreased exponentially to equilibrium and the time to equilibrium was similar to that measured for a reference single layer of coated glass beads simulations for subcritical water repellent soils with time dependent ca yielded an infiltration rate that is either increasing with time noted as concave or initially increases and afterward decreases noted as a concave convex pattern keywords subcritical water repellent soil time dependent contact angle modified green ampt model amphiphilic molecule reorientation concave convex infiltration pattern 1 introduction the existence of soil water repellency has become a worldwide issue and has concerned both scientists and land managers for over a century debano 2000 doerr et al 2000 the existence of such soils has been reported from different regions climates soil types and land uses soil water repellency has substantial hydrological and geomorphological repercussions including reduction of soil infiltration capacity krammes and debano 1965 wallis and horne 1992 diminished evaporation kettridge et al 2017 shokri et al 2008 enhanced overland flow and accelerated soil erosion lanini et al 2009 ravi et al 2006 and development of preferential flow paths in the soil profile that accelerate the leaching of agrochemicals potentially increasing groundwater contamination bauters et al 1998 ritsema et al 1996 the ca represents the intensity of soil water repellency ca 90 indicate hydrophobic soil goebel et al 2011 30 ca 90 indicate subcritical water repellency a common feature of many natural and cultivated soils bachmann et al 2007 ganz et al 2013 hallett et al 2001 the soil water ca can be easily determined by the sessile drop method namely placing a small water droplet on a layer of soil grains that are glued to a glass surface bachmann et al 2000 an exponential decrease in ca with time has been found by these measurements bugici and wallach 2016 leelamanie and karube 2009 leuther et al 2018 subedi et al 2012 whelan et al 2015 as an underlying mechanism soil water repellency is generally ascribed to the amphiphilic structure of the organic matter coating the soil particle comprised of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends doerr et al 2000 ma shum and farmer 1985 the temporal decrease in ca has been related to the reorientation of these molecules during contact with water doerr et al 2000 and references therein the substrate type and the nature of the amphiphilic molecules determine the degree of reorientation of the surface monolayer and the soil s wettability pionnering work of yiannos 1962 has experimentally explored the time dependent ca phenomenon for a water droplet and mathematically describe the amphiphilic molecule reorientation process in terms of ca starov 2004 modified yiannos s 1962 model by extending the interaction of the amphiphilic molecules with the wetting fluid beyond the boundary of the spreading droplet based on the time scale separation theory starov 2004 showed that the characteristic time scale associated with molecular reorientation below the major part of the droplet is much shorter than that near the droplet edge beyond its contact line he concluded that the equilibrium concentration of overturned amphiphilic molecules is established rapidly under the main portion of the droplet and retains its value over the course of the entire spreading process whereas the long time changes occur only within the narrow region near the perimeter of the spreading droplet wang and wallach 2020 went a step further to measured the time dependent ca for an oleic acid coated glass plate surface and capillary tube oleic acid is one of the long chained fatty acids which have been identified as the main constituent of the hydrophobic coating on water repellent soils doerr et al 2000 diehl 2013 graber et al 2009 wang and wallach 2020 found that the rate at which the ca decreased was similar for the plate surface and capillary tube in spite of the fact that the contact area between the water and the tube wall continuously increases by the capillary rise this similar rate indicated that the decrease in ca in the capillary tube is driven mainly by reorientation of the amphiphilic molecules in the narrow region near the contact line as suggested by starov s 2004 theory wang and wallach 2020 also demonstrated that the capillary rise of water in an oleic acid coated capillary tube differs substantially from that in a clean tube with constant ca in contrast to the rapid establishment of equilibrium height for capillary rise in a clean capillary tube the capillary rise in the oleic acid coated capillary tube immediately reaches a quasi equilibrium height followed by a gradual height increase due to the gradual decrease in the time dependent ca as soils are widely assumed to be made of a bundle of capillary tubes green and ampt 1911 richards 1931 the observed difference for a single capillary tube calls for the use of time dependent ca rather than constant ca in models simulating flow in subcritical water repellent soils a non zero ca has rarely been incorporated into mathematical models for water flow simulations in bulk repellent soils brindt and wallach 2020 and references therein moreover none of these models have considered the time dependent ca effect since soil wettability characterized by ca must be taken into consideration in any hydrological study letey et al 1962 it would be valuable to know the influence of the time dependent ca on the water s movement in subcritical water repellent soils in the current study we modified the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 to include a time dependent ca for downward water infiltration the green ampt model has been widely combined with hydrological erosion models to simulate water infiltration among others in the wepp laflen et al 1997 tribs ivanov et al 2004 and swat tuppad et al 2011 models the proposed modified green ampt model was verified by comparison with the experimental results of water infiltration through oleic acid coated glass beads packed in a column 2 the mathematical model green and ampt 1911 presented an approach to model downward infiltration based on the fundamental physics of porous media the green ampt model consists of an ordinary differential equation 1 θ s θ i k dl dt l h 0 p c ρ g l where θ s θ i is the mobile water content i e the difference between the saturated water content θ s and the initial water content θ i k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l is the wetting front position h 0 is the ponding depth p c is the capillary pressure at the wetting front ρ is the water density and g is the acceleration of gravity the green ampt model has the characteristics of simplicity and fits well some experimental observations chen and young 2006 childs and bybordi 1969 green and ampt 1911 selker et al 1999 and to a lesser degree other however the traditional green ampt model has an inherent flaw and it predicts an initial infinite wetting front velocity due to the assumption of constant capillary suction at the wetting front to overcome this limitation hsu and hilpert 2011 modified the model to include velocity dependent capillary pressure they proposed that the capillary pressure depends on the wetting front velocity through a velocity dependent ca based on dimensional analysis and physical considerations 2 cos ϑ v cos ϑ eq α η γ dl dt β 3 p c d γ e ε θ i cos ϑ v where ϑ v is the velocity dependent ca ϑ eq is the equilibrium ca η is the dynamic viscosity of water γ is the interfacial tension α and β are model parameters specific to the porous medium that quantify capillary nonequilibrium d is the grain size and e ε θ i is a nondimensional function of porosity ε and θ i the modified green ampt model after introducing eqs 2 and 3 into eq 1 becomes 4 θ s θ i k dl dt l h 0 s 0 γ d ρ g e ε θ i α η γ dl dt β l where 5 s 0 γ d ρ g e ε θ i cos ϑ eq is the equilibrium suction head the modified green ampt model was proven experimentally to be better than the classical green ampt model for downward infiltration into dry or prewetted sands hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 however this modified green ampt model cannot be used for subcritical water repellent soils with intrinsic time varying ca for water infiltrating into subcritical water repellent soils the dynamic capillary pressure is driven by the time dependent ca as a result of the amphiphilic molecules reorientation while in contact with the infiltrating water in addition to the velocity of the wetting front through a velocity dependent ca the relative effect of each process will be studied further on following the dynamic capillary flow with a time dependent ca in capillary tubes wang and wallach 2020 the velocity dependent dynamic ca in equations 2 and 3 is 6 cos ϑ d cos ϑ t α η γ dl dt β 7 p c d γ e ε θ i cos ϑ d where ϑ d is the dynamic ca incorporating the compound effect of time dependent ca and velocity dependent ca the introduction of eqs 6 and 7 into eq 1 yields a modified green ampt model for water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils 8 θ s θ i k dl dt l h 0 s t γ d ρ g e ε θ i α η γ dl dt β l where 9 s t γ d ρ g e ε θ i cos ϑ t is the time dependent suction head when ϑ t reaches equilibrium eq 8 becomes equation 4 the time dependent suction head s t is used as a fitting variable that is based on two assumptions i s t will exponentially increase as it depends on an exponentially decreasing ϑ t ii s t will reach equilibrium at the same rate as that measured for a sessile water drop placed on a single layer surface of oleic acid coated glass beads 3 materials and methods the downward infiltration experiments were carried out in a glass column 63 c m length 0 5 c m inner diameter and 0 196 c m 2 cross sectional area glass beads of diameters between 100 and 200 μ m type s sigmund lindner gmbh were used the glass bead density was 2 5 g cm 3 porosity of the column was determined by particle density and measured bulk density the glass beads were coated with amphiphilic reorienting molecules oleic acid analytical standard sigma aldrich the oleic acid was dissolved in analytical grade ethanol to a concentration of 0 28 g k g prior to coating the glass beads wang and wallach 2020 found that ethanol used as the solvent for oleic acid does not volatilize completely as expected but coats the inner surface of the capillary tube as a result it alters the capillary rise dynamics because the soluble ethanol affects the surface tension and viscosity of the water ethanol mixture ethanol coated glass beads were also used in the infiltration experiment as a reference for the coating processes glass beads were packed in a glass tube of length 20 c m and inner diameter 0 9 c m one end of the glass tube was connected to a 60 m l syringe coating liquid 40 m l of ethanol or oleic acid ethanol solution was injected into the glass tube with a syringe pump at a rate of 40 m l m i n after coating the glass tube was dried by sucking air through its outlet 12 times to remove the excess coating liquid then the coated glass beads were removed from the tube and left for ethanol volatilization overnight before the infiltration experiments the initial ca and its variation with time for drops of deionized water placed on a singer layer of uncoated and coated glass beads were measured using a goniometer easydrop dsa20e krüss gmbh to obtain uniform deposition of the glass beads three glass beads clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated were respectively poured into the column while maintaining a constant 3 cm distance between the supply funnel and the top of the packed glass beads hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 to maintain a constant water head a marriotte bottle was connected to the water inlet port on the glass column through a valve and tubing triplicate infiltration experiments were performed in the 60 c m long glass bead packed column under ponding conditions with a constant water head of 3 cm the changing mass of the water reservoir was recorded every 0 1 s using a precisa xt 220a balance connected to a pc the mass of water infiltrating into the column m was calculated from the change in mass of the water in the marriotte bottle this loss was then converted to cumulative infiltration f as follows 10 f m ρ a where ρ is the density of the fluid in the column and a is the cross sectional area of the column from cumulative infiltration f the darcy velocity q d f d t and the wetting front position can be calculated 11 l f θ s θ i where the mobile water content θ s θ i was determined by the ratio between the total cumulative infiltration and the total volume of the sand column that is θ s θ i f total v total hsu et al 2017 the column leachate was collected to determine density and surface tension of the water ethanol mixture the fluid density was determined as mass divided by volume and the surface tension by using the krüss goniometer the leachate viscosity was determined from the measured density and surface tension based on khattab et al 2012 who measured these variables for aqueous ethanol solutions the a priori unknown parameters and function in eqs 4 and 8 were e ε θ i α β and k besides eq 4 has an unknown parameter s 0 while eq 8 has an unknown variable s t which is governed by multiple parameters the unknown parameters in eqs 4 and 8 were determined from the measured data using the matlab lsqnonlin solver which is used to solve nonlinear least squares nonlinear data fitting problems as in hsu and hilpert s 2011 analysis e ε θ i and α were combined into a lumped parameter α e ε θ i α β was prescribed as 0 3 which has been proven as a universal value for darcy scale sand experiments hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 therefore the final fitting parameters were s 0 α and k for equation 4 and s t α and k for equation 8 among them s t was expressed as a double exponential increase function a e bt c e dt with fitting parameters a b c and d since the matlab lsqnonlin solver requires an initial value of the fitted parameters the initial values for model fitting were determined by the statistical analysis software 1stopt 1 5 pro http www 7d soft com en which can solve curve fitting problems without the introduction of an initial parameter value zhang et al 2013 the numerical derivative dl d t in eqs 4 and 8 was calculated by matlab based on the measured data by setting dl d t as y eqs 4 and 8 were transformed into binary algebraic equations y f t l s 0 α k and y f t l a b c d α k respectively the unknown parameters in these algebraic equations were fitted by 1stopt 1 5 pro and then used as initial values for the matlab lsqnonlin solver the objective function of the matlab lsqnonlin solver accounts for the difference between experimental and computational ql versus l data hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 equations 4 and 8 are implicit differential equations that were solved using the matlab ode15i solver 4 model validation for water infiltration into a column with oleic acid coated glass beads the initial ca and ca decrease with time are depicted in fig 1 a c for the uncoated ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads respectively the respective initial ca for these beads were 27 44 and 55 whereas the ca for the clean and ethanol coated glass beads decreased slightly in a linear fig 1a and exponential fig 1b manner respectively it decreased sharply in an exponential manner for the oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads reaching equilibrium after 6 min fig 1c the wetting front propagation along the 60 c m long column filled with clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads is shown in fig 2 a water head of 3 c m was held constant at the column inlet the experiment outcome revealed that the wetting front propagates faster in the column with clean glass beads which took 780 s to reach the column outlet followed by columns with ethanol coated 910 s and oleic acid ethanol solution coated 990 s glass beads average measurements of triplicate infiltration experiments for clean and ethanol coated glass beads fitted by equation 4 are depicted in fig 3 a d equations 4 and 8 were used to fit the measured results for the oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads fig 4 a and b the known parameters used for eqs 4 and 8 were ponding depth 3 c m grain size 150 μ m acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 mobile water content and physical properties of the infiltrating fluid the measured average mobile water content for the clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads was 0 368 0 379 and 0 369 respectively since the experiments were performed at 20 c density of 0 9987 g c m 3 viscosity of 1 003 m p a s and surface tension of 72 88 m n m these values were used for the clean glass beads simulations as well khattab et al 2012 the measured density and surface tension of the infiltrating fluid for the ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads were 0 9975 g c m 3 and 70 51 m n m respectively the independently measured density and surface tension were consistent with the values in table 1 of khattab et al 2012 therefore based on khattab et al 2012 a viscosity of 1 041 m p a s was used for the infiltrating fluid in columns with ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads equation 4 the modified green ampt model with velocity dependent ca well predicted ql versus l and l versus t data for the clean fig 3a and b and ethanol coated fig 3c and d glass beads however eq 8 the green ampt model modified for both velocity and time dependent ca fit the measured data for oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads better than eq 4 fig 4a and b the inset in fig 4b depicts the fitted time dependent suction head the estimated parameters of equations 4 and 8 are listed in table 1 the fitted k values when equation 4 was used for clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads were similar to that obtained when eq 8 was used to fit the experimental data for the oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads table 1 darcy velocity reached a steady state after some time namely the slope of the ql versus l curves became uniform fig 3a c and 4a the linear slope between 50 and 60 c m in fig 3a c and 4a was used to determine the hydraulic conductivity k pellichero et al 2012 the respective k values were 0 000195 0 000183 and 0 000166 m s the k values obtained by fitting eqs 4 and 8 were consistent with those obtained directly by the experimental output fitted α is a lumped parameter composed of e ε θ i α the former is a nondimensional function of porosity and initial water content whereas α depends on the surface roughness of the glass beads hsu et al 2017 since average measured porosity for three experiments was 0 4 and initial water content and surface roughness could be assumed similar for the three glass bead experiments the fitted α value was very consistent for all three cases table 1 the fitted s 0 γ d ρ g e ε θ i cos ϑ eq for the ethanol coated glass beads was lower than for the clean glass beads table 1 this resulted in a lower γ ρ and larger equilibrium ca for the ethanol coated glass beads fig 1a and b since the decrease in γ ρ was small the decrease in fitted s 0 was mostly induced by the larger equilibrium ca of the ethanol coated glass beads the following relationship can be deduced from eq 5 12 cos ϑ c cos ϑ e s c s e ρ w γ w γ ew ρ ew where subscript c refers to clean glass beads subscript e refers to ethanol coated glass beads subscript w refers to water and subscript ew refers to ethanol water mixture introducing the fitted s c 0 205 m s e 0 165 m and physical properties of the infiltrating fluid into equation 11 yields the value 1 2 for cos ϑ c cos ϑ e the measured initial ca for clean and ethanol coated glass beads were 27 and 44 respectively fig 1a and b the value 1 24 for cos 27 cos 44 was close to the computational value of equation 11 justifying the fitted suction head for clean and ethanol coated glass beads table 1 the fitted value of 0 173 for s 0 by equation 4 equaled an equilibrium ca of 39 according to equation 11 which was inconsistent with the measured ca of 55 depicted in fig 1c therefore the s 0 fitted by equation 4 for oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads seems to be inappropriate despite the fact that equation 4 nicely fitted the measured data fig 4a and b the fitted time dependent suction head was 0 12 m at the beginning of the infiltration and increased exponentially to an equilibrium value of 0 19 m within 6 min fig 4b inset notably this rate of change was similar to that of the ca decrease measured for a sessile water drop placed on a single layer surface of coated glass beads fig 1c following equation 11 a suction head of 0 12 m represents a ca of 57 and 0 19 m represents a ca of 31 the fitted initial and equilibrium ca were also consistent with the measured initial and equilibrium ca 55 and 31 respectively depicted in fig 1c the proposed assumptions are therefore verified s t for the oleic acid coated glass beads will increase exponentially and reach equilibrium in a period similar to that for a reference single layer surface of the same medium the verified assumptions demonstrated that the proposed modified green ampt model with a dynamic ca incorporating the compound effect of a time dependent ca and velocity dependent ca is appropriate to model water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils 5 model simulations the verified modified green ampt model was used to investigate the effect of different time dependent ca on water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils following equation 12 and the fitted suction head listed in table 1 the time dependent ca was represented by the time dependent suction head mobile water content 0 37 saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 000164 m s ponding depth 3 c m grain size 150 μ m and lumped parameter α 87 5 were introduced into equation 8 the influence of equilibrium ca on water infiltration was studied first for three time dependent suction heads the simulations are depicted in fig 5 a the corresponding initial ca was 85 with equilibrium ca of 75 60 and 40 respectively fig 5b and c depict the wetting front position and velocity respectively the changes in wetting front velocity were quantitatively estimated from the changes in depth versus time a concave pattern was obtained for 85 to 75 and 85 to 60 associated with an initially low wetting front velocity that gradually increased as the wetting front propagated until a constant velocity was reached for the 85 to 40 case a convex pattern followed the concave pattern fig 5b correspondingly the wetting front velocity increased initially then gradually decreased to an equilibrium value fig 5c the effect of three rates of time dependent ca decrease on the wetting front position and velocity is depicted in fig 6 a c the initial ca was 85 and the equilibrium ca was 40 a simulation for a constant ca 40 was added as a reference a convex pattern of wetting front position vs time was obtained for the constant ca 40 with a higher rate of ca decrease the concave infiltration pattern turned into a concave convex one fig 6b correspondingly the wetting front velocity was high at an early infiltration time and gradually decreased fig 6c note that in fig 6c a similar equilibrium wetting front velocity was reached in all the cases despite the fact that the processes were quite different 6 summary and conclusions measurement and modeling of infiltration into a subcritical repellent porous medium is an upscaling study following to the innovative study by wang and wallach 2020 on the capillary rise of water in a capillary tube with induced time dependent ca in this study the green ampt model that has been widely used by hydrologists and soil scientists to model infiltration into soils was modified to include a time dependent ca this model represents a step forward from the model developed by hsu and hilpert 2011 and pellichero et al 2012 that includes the velocity dependent ca the current model was successfully verified by comparison to data measured for transient downward water infiltration into a column packed with oleic acid coated glass beads measured and fitted data revealed that the rate of decrease of the ca at the wetting front during downward infiltration is similar to that measured for a sessile water drop placed on a single layer of oleic acid coated glass beads the velocity dependent ca model hsu hilpert 2011 pellichero et al 2012 could fit the measured infiltration with a time dependent ca but a nonphysically based suction head had to be used at the wetting front fig 4 simulations showed a concave infiltration pattern for subcritical water repellent soils as observed for

4798,soil water repellency defined as the situation in which the affinity of soils to water is reduced has been reported for many natural and agricultural soils worldwide soil water repellency has significant impacts on hydrology and geomorphology it has been widely observed that the contact angle ca of a sessile water drop placed on a single layer surface of water repellent soil particles decreases in an exponential manner with time this time dependent ca has a substantial effect on flow in water repellent soils however mathematical models aimed at modeling water flow in water repellent soils disregard the time dependent ca s effect the current study aims to correct this omission using capillary rise of water with a time dependent ca in a capillary tube a model for water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils ca 90 was developed this model was successfully verified by performing infiltration experiments into packed coated glass beads the ca at the wetting front during infiltration decreased exponentially to equilibrium and the time to equilibrium was similar to that measured for a reference single layer of coated glass beads simulations for subcritical water repellent soils with time dependent ca yielded an infiltration rate that is either increasing with time noted as concave or initially increases and afterward decreases noted as a concave convex pattern keywords subcritical water repellent soil time dependent contact angle modified green ampt model amphiphilic molecule reorientation concave convex infiltration pattern 1 introduction the existence of soil water repellency has become a worldwide issue and has concerned both scientists and land managers for over a century debano 2000 doerr et al 2000 the existence of such soils has been reported from different regions climates soil types and land uses soil water repellency has substantial hydrological and geomorphological repercussions including reduction of soil infiltration capacity krammes and debano 1965 wallis and horne 1992 diminished evaporation kettridge et al 2017 shokri et al 2008 enhanced overland flow and accelerated soil erosion lanini et al 2009 ravi et al 2006 and development of preferential flow paths in the soil profile that accelerate the leaching of agrochemicals potentially increasing groundwater contamination bauters et al 1998 ritsema et al 1996 the ca represents the intensity of soil water repellency ca 90 indicate hydrophobic soil goebel et al 2011 30 ca 90 indicate subcritical water repellency a common feature of many natural and cultivated soils bachmann et al 2007 ganz et al 2013 hallett et al 2001 the soil water ca can be easily determined by the sessile drop method namely placing a small water droplet on a layer of soil grains that are glued to a glass surface bachmann et al 2000 an exponential decrease in ca with time has been found by these measurements bugici and wallach 2016 leelamanie and karube 2009 leuther et al 2018 subedi et al 2012 whelan et al 2015 as an underlying mechanism soil water repellency is generally ascribed to the amphiphilic structure of the organic matter coating the soil particle comprised of hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends doerr et al 2000 ma shum and farmer 1985 the temporal decrease in ca has been related to the reorientation of these molecules during contact with water doerr et al 2000 and references therein the substrate type and the nature of the amphiphilic molecules determine the degree of reorientation of the surface monolayer and the soil s wettability pionnering work of yiannos 1962 has experimentally explored the time dependent ca phenomenon for a water droplet and mathematically describe the amphiphilic molecule reorientation process in terms of ca starov 2004 modified yiannos s 1962 model by extending the interaction of the amphiphilic molecules with the wetting fluid beyond the boundary of the spreading droplet based on the time scale separation theory starov 2004 showed that the characteristic time scale associated with molecular reorientation below the major part of the droplet is much shorter than that near the droplet edge beyond its contact line he concluded that the equilibrium concentration of overturned amphiphilic molecules is established rapidly under the main portion of the droplet and retains its value over the course of the entire spreading process whereas the long time changes occur only within the narrow region near the perimeter of the spreading droplet wang and wallach 2020 went a step further to measured the time dependent ca for an oleic acid coated glass plate surface and capillary tube oleic acid is one of the long chained fatty acids which have been identified as the main constituent of the hydrophobic coating on water repellent soils doerr et al 2000 diehl 2013 graber et al 2009 wang and wallach 2020 found that the rate at which the ca decreased was similar for the plate surface and capillary tube in spite of the fact that the contact area between the water and the tube wall continuously increases by the capillary rise this similar rate indicated that the decrease in ca in the capillary tube is driven mainly by reorientation of the amphiphilic molecules in the narrow region near the contact line as suggested by starov s 2004 theory wang and wallach 2020 also demonstrated that the capillary rise of water in an oleic acid coated capillary tube differs substantially from that in a clean tube with constant ca in contrast to the rapid establishment of equilibrium height for capillary rise in a clean capillary tube the capillary rise in the oleic acid coated capillary tube immediately reaches a quasi equilibrium height followed by a gradual height increase due to the gradual decrease in the time dependent ca as soils are widely assumed to be made of a bundle of capillary tubes green and ampt 1911 richards 1931 the observed difference for a single capillary tube calls for the use of time dependent ca rather than constant ca in models simulating flow in subcritical water repellent soils a non zero ca has rarely been incorporated into mathematical models for water flow simulations in bulk repellent soils brindt and wallach 2020 and references therein moreover none of these models have considered the time dependent ca effect since soil wettability characterized by ca must be taken into consideration in any hydrological study letey et al 1962 it would be valuable to know the influence of the time dependent ca on the water s movement in subcritical water repellent soils in the current study we modified the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 to include a time dependent ca for downward water infiltration the green ampt model has been widely combined with hydrological erosion models to simulate water infiltration among others in the wepp laflen et al 1997 tribs ivanov et al 2004 and swat tuppad et al 2011 models the proposed modified green ampt model was verified by comparison with the experimental results of water infiltration through oleic acid coated glass beads packed in a column 2 the mathematical model green and ampt 1911 presented an approach to model downward infiltration based on the fundamental physics of porous media the green ampt model consists of an ordinary differential equation 1 θ s θ i k dl dt l h 0 p c ρ g l where θ s θ i is the mobile water content i e the difference between the saturated water content θ s and the initial water content θ i k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l is the wetting front position h 0 is the ponding depth p c is the capillary pressure at the wetting front ρ is the water density and g is the acceleration of gravity the green ampt model has the characteristics of simplicity and fits well some experimental observations chen and young 2006 childs and bybordi 1969 green and ampt 1911 selker et al 1999 and to a lesser degree other however the traditional green ampt model has an inherent flaw and it predicts an initial infinite wetting front velocity due to the assumption of constant capillary suction at the wetting front to overcome this limitation hsu and hilpert 2011 modified the model to include velocity dependent capillary pressure they proposed that the capillary pressure depends on the wetting front velocity through a velocity dependent ca based on dimensional analysis and physical considerations 2 cos ϑ v cos ϑ eq α η γ dl dt β 3 p c d γ e ε θ i cos ϑ v where ϑ v is the velocity dependent ca ϑ eq is the equilibrium ca η is the dynamic viscosity of water γ is the interfacial tension α and β are model parameters specific to the porous medium that quantify capillary nonequilibrium d is the grain size and e ε θ i is a nondimensional function of porosity ε and θ i the modified green ampt model after introducing eqs 2 and 3 into eq 1 becomes 4 θ s θ i k dl dt l h 0 s 0 γ d ρ g e ε θ i α η γ dl dt β l where 5 s 0 γ d ρ g e ε θ i cos ϑ eq is the equilibrium suction head the modified green ampt model was proven experimentally to be better than the classical green ampt model for downward infiltration into dry or prewetted sands hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 however this modified green ampt model cannot be used for subcritical water repellent soils with intrinsic time varying ca for water infiltrating into subcritical water repellent soils the dynamic capillary pressure is driven by the time dependent ca as a result of the amphiphilic molecules reorientation while in contact with the infiltrating water in addition to the velocity of the wetting front through a velocity dependent ca the relative effect of each process will be studied further on following the dynamic capillary flow with a time dependent ca in capillary tubes wang and wallach 2020 the velocity dependent dynamic ca in equations 2 and 3 is 6 cos ϑ d cos ϑ t α η γ dl dt β 7 p c d γ e ε θ i cos ϑ d where ϑ d is the dynamic ca incorporating the compound effect of time dependent ca and velocity dependent ca the introduction of eqs 6 and 7 into eq 1 yields a modified green ampt model for water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils 8 θ s θ i k dl dt l h 0 s t γ d ρ g e ε θ i α η γ dl dt β l where 9 s t γ d ρ g e ε θ i cos ϑ t is the time dependent suction head when ϑ t reaches equilibrium eq 8 becomes equation 4 the time dependent suction head s t is used as a fitting variable that is based on two assumptions i s t will exponentially increase as it depends on an exponentially decreasing ϑ t ii s t will reach equilibrium at the same rate as that measured for a sessile water drop placed on a single layer surface of oleic acid coated glass beads 3 materials and methods the downward infiltration experiments were carried out in a glass column 63 c m length 0 5 c m inner diameter and 0 196 c m 2 cross sectional area glass beads of diameters between 100 and 200 μ m type s sigmund lindner gmbh were used the glass bead density was 2 5 g cm 3 porosity of the column was determined by particle density and measured bulk density the glass beads were coated with amphiphilic reorienting molecules oleic acid analytical standard sigma aldrich the oleic acid was dissolved in analytical grade ethanol to a concentration of 0 28 g k g prior to coating the glass beads wang and wallach 2020 found that ethanol used as the solvent for oleic acid does not volatilize completely as expected but coats the inner surface of the capillary tube as a result it alters the capillary rise dynamics because the soluble ethanol affects the surface tension and viscosity of the water ethanol mixture ethanol coated glass beads were also used in the infiltration experiment as a reference for the coating processes glass beads were packed in a glass tube of length 20 c m and inner diameter 0 9 c m one end of the glass tube was connected to a 60 m l syringe coating liquid 40 m l of ethanol or oleic acid ethanol solution was injected into the glass tube with a syringe pump at a rate of 40 m l m i n after coating the glass tube was dried by sucking air through its outlet 12 times to remove the excess coating liquid then the coated glass beads were removed from the tube and left for ethanol volatilization overnight before the infiltration experiments the initial ca and its variation with time for drops of deionized water placed on a singer layer of uncoated and coated glass beads were measured using a goniometer easydrop dsa20e krüss gmbh to obtain uniform deposition of the glass beads three glass beads clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated were respectively poured into the column while maintaining a constant 3 cm distance between the supply funnel and the top of the packed glass beads hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 to maintain a constant water head a marriotte bottle was connected to the water inlet port on the glass column through a valve and tubing triplicate infiltration experiments were performed in the 60 c m long glass bead packed column under ponding conditions with a constant water head of 3 cm the changing mass of the water reservoir was recorded every 0 1 s using a precisa xt 220a balance connected to a pc the mass of water infiltrating into the column m was calculated from the change in mass of the water in the marriotte bottle this loss was then converted to cumulative infiltration f as follows 10 f m ρ a where ρ is the density of the fluid in the column and a is the cross sectional area of the column from cumulative infiltration f the darcy velocity q d f d t and the wetting front position can be calculated 11 l f θ s θ i where the mobile water content θ s θ i was determined by the ratio between the total cumulative infiltration and the total volume of the sand column that is θ s θ i f total v total hsu et al 2017 the column leachate was collected to determine density and surface tension of the water ethanol mixture the fluid density was determined as mass divided by volume and the surface tension by using the krüss goniometer the leachate viscosity was determined from the measured density and surface tension based on khattab et al 2012 who measured these variables for aqueous ethanol solutions the a priori unknown parameters and function in eqs 4 and 8 were e ε θ i α β and k besides eq 4 has an unknown parameter s 0 while eq 8 has an unknown variable s t which is governed by multiple parameters the unknown parameters in eqs 4 and 8 were determined from the measured data using the matlab lsqnonlin solver which is used to solve nonlinear least squares nonlinear data fitting problems as in hsu and hilpert s 2011 analysis e ε θ i and α were combined into a lumped parameter α e ε θ i α β was prescribed as 0 3 which has been proven as a universal value for darcy scale sand experiments hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 tsai et al 2018 therefore the final fitting parameters were s 0 α and k for equation 4 and s t α and k for equation 8 among them s t was expressed as a double exponential increase function a e bt c e dt with fitting parameters a b c and d since the matlab lsqnonlin solver requires an initial value of the fitted parameters the initial values for model fitting were determined by the statistical analysis software 1stopt 1 5 pro http www 7d soft com en which can solve curve fitting problems without the introduction of an initial parameter value zhang et al 2013 the numerical derivative dl d t in eqs 4 and 8 was calculated by matlab based on the measured data by setting dl d t as y eqs 4 and 8 were transformed into binary algebraic equations y f t l s 0 α k and y f t l a b c d α k respectively the unknown parameters in these algebraic equations were fitted by 1stopt 1 5 pro and then used as initial values for the matlab lsqnonlin solver the objective function of the matlab lsqnonlin solver accounts for the difference between experimental and computational ql versus l data hsu et al 2017 pellichero et al 2012 equations 4 and 8 are implicit differential equations that were solved using the matlab ode15i solver 4 model validation for water infiltration into a column with oleic acid coated glass beads the initial ca and ca decrease with time are depicted in fig 1 a c for the uncoated ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads respectively the respective initial ca for these beads were 27 44 and 55 whereas the ca for the clean and ethanol coated glass beads decreased slightly in a linear fig 1a and exponential fig 1b manner respectively it decreased sharply in an exponential manner for the oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads reaching equilibrium after 6 min fig 1c the wetting front propagation along the 60 c m long column filled with clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads is shown in fig 2 a water head of 3 c m was held constant at the column inlet the experiment outcome revealed that the wetting front propagates faster in the column with clean glass beads which took 780 s to reach the column outlet followed by columns with ethanol coated 910 s and oleic acid ethanol solution coated 990 s glass beads average measurements of triplicate infiltration experiments for clean and ethanol coated glass beads fitted by equation 4 are depicted in fig 3 a d equations 4 and 8 were used to fit the measured results for the oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads fig 4 a and b the known parameters used for eqs 4 and 8 were ponding depth 3 c m grain size 150 μ m acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 mobile water content and physical properties of the infiltrating fluid the measured average mobile water content for the clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads was 0 368 0 379 and 0 369 respectively since the experiments were performed at 20 c density of 0 9987 g c m 3 viscosity of 1 003 m p a s and surface tension of 72 88 m n m these values were used for the clean glass beads simulations as well khattab et al 2012 the measured density and surface tension of the infiltrating fluid for the ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads were 0 9975 g c m 3 and 70 51 m n m respectively the independently measured density and surface tension were consistent with the values in table 1 of khattab et al 2012 therefore based on khattab et al 2012 a viscosity of 1 041 m p a s was used for the infiltrating fluid in columns with ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads equation 4 the modified green ampt model with velocity dependent ca well predicted ql versus l and l versus t data for the clean fig 3a and b and ethanol coated fig 3c and d glass beads however eq 8 the green ampt model modified for both velocity and time dependent ca fit the measured data for oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads better than eq 4 fig 4a and b the inset in fig 4b depicts the fitted time dependent suction head the estimated parameters of equations 4 and 8 are listed in table 1 the fitted k values when equation 4 was used for clean ethanol coated and oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads were similar to that obtained when eq 8 was used to fit the experimental data for the oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads table 1 darcy velocity reached a steady state after some time namely the slope of the ql versus l curves became uniform fig 3a c and 4a the linear slope between 50 and 60 c m in fig 3a c and 4a was used to determine the hydraulic conductivity k pellichero et al 2012 the respective k values were 0 000195 0 000183 and 0 000166 m s the k values obtained by fitting eqs 4 and 8 were consistent with those obtained directly by the experimental output fitted α is a lumped parameter composed of e ε θ i α the former is a nondimensional function of porosity and initial water content whereas α depends on the surface roughness of the glass beads hsu et al 2017 since average measured porosity for three experiments was 0 4 and initial water content and surface roughness could be assumed similar for the three glass bead experiments the fitted α value was very consistent for all three cases table 1 the fitted s 0 γ d ρ g e ε θ i cos ϑ eq for the ethanol coated glass beads was lower than for the clean glass beads table 1 this resulted in a lower γ ρ and larger equilibrium ca for the ethanol coated glass beads fig 1a and b since the decrease in γ ρ was small the decrease in fitted s 0 was mostly induced by the larger equilibrium ca of the ethanol coated glass beads the following relationship can be deduced from eq 5 12 cos ϑ c cos ϑ e s c s e ρ w γ w γ ew ρ ew where subscript c refers to clean glass beads subscript e refers to ethanol coated glass beads subscript w refers to water and subscript ew refers to ethanol water mixture introducing the fitted s c 0 205 m s e 0 165 m and physical properties of the infiltrating fluid into equation 11 yields the value 1 2 for cos ϑ c cos ϑ e the measured initial ca for clean and ethanol coated glass beads were 27 and 44 respectively fig 1a and b the value 1 24 for cos 27 cos 44 was close to the computational value of equation 11 justifying the fitted suction head for clean and ethanol coated glass beads table 1 the fitted value of 0 173 for s 0 by equation 4 equaled an equilibrium ca of 39 according to equation 11 which was inconsistent with the measured ca of 55 depicted in fig 1c therefore the s 0 fitted by equation 4 for oleic acid ethanol solution coated glass beads seems to be inappropriate despite the fact that equation 4 nicely fitted the measured data fig 4a and b the fitted time dependent suction head was 0 12 m at the beginning of the infiltration and increased exponentially to an equilibrium value of 0 19 m within 6 min fig 4b inset notably this rate of change was similar to that of the ca decrease measured for a sessile water drop placed on a single layer surface of coated glass beads fig 1c following equation 11 a suction head of 0 12 m represents a ca of 57 and 0 19 m represents a ca of 31 the fitted initial and equilibrium ca were also consistent with the measured initial and equilibrium ca 55 and 31 respectively depicted in fig 1c the proposed assumptions are therefore verified s t for the oleic acid coated glass beads will increase exponentially and reach equilibrium in a period similar to that for a reference single layer surface of the same medium the verified assumptions demonstrated that the proposed modified green ampt model with a dynamic ca incorporating the compound effect of a time dependent ca and velocity dependent ca is appropriate to model water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils 5 model simulations the verified modified green ampt model was used to investigate the effect of different time dependent ca on water infiltration into subcritical water repellent soils following equation 12 and the fitted suction head listed in table 1 the time dependent ca was represented by the time dependent suction head mobile water content 0 37 saturated hydraulic conductivity 0 000164 m s ponding depth 3 c m grain size 150 μ m and lumped parameter α 87 5 were introduced into equation 8 the influence of equilibrium ca on water infiltration was studied first for three time dependent suction heads the simulations are depicted in fig 5 a the corresponding initial ca was 85 with equilibrium ca of 75 60 and 40 respectively fig 5b and c depict the wetting front position and velocity respectively the changes in wetting front velocity were quantitatively estimated from the changes in depth versus time a concave pattern was obtained for 85 to 75 and 85 to 60 associated with an initially low wetting front velocity that gradually increased as the wetting front propagated until a constant velocity was reached for the 85 to 40 case a convex pattern followed the concave pattern fig 5b correspondingly the wetting front velocity increased initially then gradually decreased to an equilibrium value fig 5c the effect of three rates of time dependent ca decrease on the wetting front position and velocity is depicted in fig 6 a c the initial ca was 85 and the equilibrium ca was 40 a simulation for a constant ca 40 was added as a reference a convex pattern of wetting front position vs time was obtained for the constant ca 40 with a higher rate of ca decrease the concave infiltration pattern turned into a concave convex one fig 6b correspondingly the wetting front velocity was high at an early infiltration time and gradually decreased fig 6c note that in fig 6c a similar equilibrium wetting front velocity was reached in all the cases despite the fact that the processes were quite different 6 summary and conclusions measurement and modeling of infiltration into a subcritical repellent porous medium is an upscaling study following to the innovative study by wang and wallach 2020 on the capillary rise of water in a capillary tube with induced time dependent ca in this study the green ampt model that has been widely used by hydrologists and soil scientists to model infiltration into soils was modified to include a time dependent ca this model represents a step forward from the model developed by hsu and hilpert 2011 and pellichero et al 2012 that includes the velocity dependent ca the current model was successfully verified by comparison to data measured for transient downward water infiltration into a column packed with oleic acid coated glass beads measured and fitted data revealed that the rate of decrease of the ca at the wetting front during downward infiltration is similar to that measured for a sessile water drop placed on a single layer of oleic acid coated glass beads the velocity dependent ca model hsu hilpert 2011 pellichero et al 2012 could fit the measured infiltration with a time dependent ca but a nonphysically based suction head had to be used at the wetting front fig 4 simulations showed a concave infiltration pattern for subcritical water repellent soils as observed for hydrophobic porous media with ca 90 e g feng et al 2001 hilpert and glantz 2013 moreover hilpert and glantz 2013 noted they were not able to establish a concave pattern for ca 90 using the green ampt model the current study yielded a concave infiltration pattern for ca 90 soils having a time dependent ca moreover simulations using the modified green ampt yielded a convex infiltration pattern following the concave pattern namely a decreasing infiltration rate that follows an increasing infiltration rate to the best of our knowledge such an infiltration pattern has not been previously reported the model developed and verified can be used to simulate infiltration into natural water repellent soils once their relevant intrinsic parameters have been determined credit authorship

4799,the decay constant k in the antecedent precipitation index api formula is generally determined arbitrarily and empirically which causes great confusion in api calculation and comparison of different research results in response to these problems two hypotheses related to api that is k has the properties of optimality and multivaluedness are proposed in this study the daily runoff and daily precipitation of a typical watershed in the yellow river basin from january1956 december 2013 is taken as an objective investigated the results show that the api has a stable antecedent day t 0 when antecedent day t t 0 the api remains stable and when t t 0 there are the optimal value of k kopt and the optimal t topt in the kopt scenario the kopt ranges between 0 906 and 0 957 which is different from the traditional empirical single value suggested between 0 80 and 0 98 the existence of kopt verifies the optimality of k or api hypothesis 1 the kopt varies with t which verifies that the k or api has the property of multivaluedness hypothesis 2 the two hypotheses of api exist objectively and are related to the runoff generation and soil moisture content of the watershed the correlation coefficient and its t statistic sliding average approximate entropy apen and four error indicators are used to determine the optimal pair among four pairs of low flow and api based on the two hypotheses and the optimal pair the daily low flow from january 2011 to december 2013 is simulated the simulation results from the power function are better than those from the logarithmic function and the kopt scenario is better than the other k scenarios the simulation accuracy is high and the results are reliable the contributions of this study lie in i the findings of two properties

low flow simulation approximate entropy yellow river 1 introduction the low flow is an important aspect of hydrological research it belongs to the category of extreme value studies in the field of hydrology as socio economic development continues the issue of water resource scarcity is becoming increasingly prominent the lack of water resources leads to over development of low flow resources which has caused a series of ecological and environmental problems smakhtin 2001 hejazi and moglen 2007 ouyang 2012 leigh 2013 the low flow regime of rivers is related to certain natural factors including groundwater recharge infiltration of soils characteristics of aquifers and evapotranspiration rates dingman and lawlor 1995 schreiber and demuth 1997 laaha and blöschl 2006 smakhtin 2001 presented a comprehensive overview of low flow indices related to a basin and climate characteristics including mean annual precipitation catchment area slope elevation catchment shape perimeter stream frequency density length of the main stream percentage of lakes reservoirs and forested areas and soil and geological indices the hydrological effects of climate change and vegetation types on low flow have also been extensively reported smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2006 komatsu et al 2010 gudmundsson et al 2011 ahn and merwade 2017 local catchment properties appear to play a large role in translating climatic fluctuations into the hydrological response gudmundsson et al 2011 however utilization of data on catchment characteristics is dependent mainly on data availability and quality which means that assessments of the importance of catchment characteristics are only meaningful among studies with similar hydrological conditions and similar study designs laaha and blöschl 2006 laaha and blöschl 2006 compared different seasonality indices for low flow regionalization in austria and found that precipitation had a more positive effect on summer and winter low flows than catchment relief such as altitude and slope catchment geology aquifer conditions land use and stream density hejazi and moglen 2007 further found that the antecedent precipitation ap was the most influential predictor of low flows whereas demirel et al 2013 concluded that the most important low flow indicators in the alpine sub basins were potential evapotranspiration lake water levels and snow storage in contrast they found that precipitation had no significant influence on low flow these contrasting conclusions drawn by laaha and blöschl 2006 and demirel et al 2013 make it necessary to analyze the effects of precipitation or ap on low flow ap refers to the precipitation that occurs prior to a particular time antecedent day ad in a specific area or basin the concept of the ap index api is defined as a weighted summation of daily precipitation amounts xie and yang 2013 which essentially expresses the effects of accumulation ap the decay constant k in api calculation has an important influence on the accurate calculation of api value heggen 2001 the constant k generally has different values in different watersheds fedora and beschta 1989 the value of k is relatively arbitrary and is generally empirically selected as a value between 0 80 and 0 98 kohler and linsley 1951 dingman 2015 such as 0 84 crozier and eyles 1980 ma et al 2014 and 0 90 kohler and linsley 1951 zêzere et al 2005 hasnawir and kubota 2008 ma et al 2014 there are also values outside the 0 80 0 98 interval for k such as 0 66 schoenera and stone 2020 0 75 ma et al 2014 and 0 997 bennett et al 2018 because the api lacks regional meaning heggen 2001 the same amount of precipitation or heavy rainfall has different effects on soil moisture content or flood events in different regions accordingly the normalized antecedent precipitation index napi was proposed for rainfall runoff simulation heggen 2001 ali et al 2010 however the constant of k also exists in napi between 0 80 and 0 98 heggen 2001 and ali et al 2010 also did not propose a solution for k but directly set it as 0 90 at present api is mainly used in the estimation of soil moisture rosenthal et al 1982 zhao et al 2019 schoenera and stone 2020 and runoff yield and simulation heggen 2001 ma et al 2014 bennett et al 2018 however the arbitrary value of k creates much confusion for api calculation soil moisture content evaluation runoff simulation and comparison of different research results there is still no effective method to determine the value of k it is very necessary to propose an effective method or standard to quantify the value of k whether is there a feasible way to determine the value of k to eliminate the confusion of arbitrary selection of k we suppose that the answer is yes therefore we put forward two hypotheses of k or api in this study the first one is that there is an optimal k value denoted as kopt on the other hand the results of rosenthal et al 1982 showed that the k values in july and december in the same study area were not the same being 0 84 and 0 99 respectively inspired by rosenthal et al 1982 we put forward the second hypothesis that the kopt changes with different ads hypothesis 1 is called the optimality of k or api and hypothesis 2 is called the multivaluedness or variability of kopt or api as a unique hydrological time series the sequence of low flow has evident complexity chou 2014 which is closely related to non linear characteristics due to climate change rind 1999 tang et al 2015 basin surface conditions chou 2014 and human activities ahn and merwade 2017 but what are the changing characteristics of low flow and its complexity and are they related to ap is it possible to simulate low flow from the perspective of complexity these are significant scientific issues that deserve to be addressed because the complexity of low flow could help us to identify the main factors influencing low flow and also reveal the characteristics and relationships of these causal factors tang et al 2014 and simulate low flow the larger the complexity value the more irregular the time series and the greater the complexity the reverse is also true i e the less irregular the sequence the lower the complexity therefore complexity analyses of low flow have both scientific relevance and practical value at present low flow studies are predominantly focused on low flow forecast kroll et al 2004 shaw and riha 2012 foulon et al 2018 worland et al 2018 low flow causal factor analyses chang and boyer 1977 modarres 2008 nikic and radonja 2009 folegot et al 2018 low flow characteristics utilization munz et al 2017 tu et al 2017 and low flow fitting frequency functions charron and ouarda 2015 gao et al 2017 there are relatively fewer studies on the complexity of low flow the concept of entropy is derived from thermodynamics and represents the unavailability of a system s thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work li et al 2012 it is often used to express the complexity of a time series and has been widely applied in the fields of geoscience rind 1999 werner 1999 chou 2012 ng 2015 li et al 2017 life science doebeli and ispolatov 2010 fernández and lynch 2011 ouyang et al 2013 chaudhry et al 2018 economic research battiston et al 2016 ecological system walther 2007 goldenberg et al 2018 and mathematics shamilov and ince 2016 approximate entropy apen is a nonlinear parameter identification method that reflects the dynamics and complexity of time series lin and chu 2011 thus it can effectively quantify the irregularity of a sequence complexity kolmogorov 1968 pincus 1991 1995 pincus and huang 1992 he et al 2012 chou 2014 the advantage of apen is that it requires only a small amount of observational data to determine the statistical properties of a nonlinear unsteady state data sequence and noise signals perez canales et al 2011 in recent years apen has accordingly been applied in runoff analyses for example based on apen li and zhang 2008 established multi scale entropy to calculate the complexity of mississippi river surface runoffs chou 2012 studied the complexity of runoffs and precipitation in the wu tu basin in taiwan using modified apen and sample entropy li et al 2017 used apen to analyze the complexity of annual runoff and precipitation they identified significant increasing trends of complexity which were opposite to the changing trends of annual runoff and precipitation in the jinghe river a secondary tributary of the yellow river they also found that the weakened effect of annual watershed precipitation had an important influence on the increase in complexity of the runoff system during the same period these studies confirm the suitability of apen in investigations of the complexity of hydrological sequences from the aspect of apen algorithm improvement and temporal spatial perspectives however the nature of the complexity of low flow and the factors influencing it including whether it can be used to simulate low flow are still rarely reported this area accordingly warrants further investigation this study intends to take the typical area jinghe river basin of the yellow river basin as the study area and attempts to 1 verify the above two hypotheses and propose an optimal standard for solving the selection of k and 2 establish the relationship between low flow and api based on the two hypotheses and apen to simulate low flow the contribution of this study is to reveal the optimality and multivaluedness of api with changes in ads and propose an optimal standard to the selection of k accordingly to effectively simulate low flow in terms of the two hypotheses and complexity apen the findings will deepen our understanding of ap and its impact on low flow and has academic value in the field of low flow simulation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the jinghe river is a secondary tributary of the yellow river and a primary tributary of the weihe river it has a total length of 455 1 km with a basin area of 45 421 km2 the zhangjiashan station is considered as the control station of the water basin fig 1 it controls 43 216 km2 of the basin area which accounts for 95 15 of the total basin area li et al 2011 li and wei 2014 the jinghe river basin is located inland it has a typical temperate continental climate with a precipitation level decreasing from the southeast to the northwest the level of precipitation differs most between the north and the south in the basin the terrain is high toward the northwest and low toward the southeast the north east and west regions of the overall terrain tilt toward the southeast the spatial temporal distribution of water resources in the basin is uneven the precipitation falling from may to september accounts for 71 87 of the annual precipitation the runoff volume accounts for 61 82 of the total annual runoff of which flood runoff accounts for 44 6 li et al 2011 li and wei 2014 due to the severe soil erosion in the basin the sediment content in runoff during the flood season from july to september is very high while the sediment content of the runoff during the non flood seasons is low li et al 2011 li 2017 2 2 data the time series employed in this study for the runoff is the daily naturalized runoff that is the runoff is not affected by human activities and the formation of runoff is a natural process at the zhangjiashan station during 1933 2013 according to the data available in the jinghe watershed the daily watershed precipitation above the zhangjiashan station was derived from the twenty three meteorological stations in and around the watershed fig 1 during 1956 2013 in terms of the thiessen polygon method among them the precipitation and runoff data before 2010 including 2010 are used for analysis and modeling and the data from 2011 to 2013 are only used to simulate and verify the model the optimal function yopt fopt xopt in fig 3 there are no restrictions on the length of the sequence calibration and validation the length of the sequence for data calibration is still inconclusive juston et al 2009 li et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 in general the data length of calibration validation series is randomly selected the reason why we choose the 1956 2010 sequence as the calibration series and the 2011 2013 sequence as the validation series is because the data used in our previous studies e g li 2017 li et al 2011 2017 are all before 2010 after constructing the model based on the 1956 2010 sequence we re collected the 2011 2013 data sequence to test the effect of the model the precipitation data were provided by the shared data platform of the china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn the daily data of naturalized runoff were obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc of the chinese ministry of water resources http www yellowriver gov cn the yrcc is in charge of naturalizing the observed flow data in the yellow river basin in terms of the method of itemized summation widely used by the chinese officials ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 fig 2 illustrates the daily data series in monthly order of naturalized runoff and precipitation 2 3 daily low flow threshold the distribution characteristics of low flow during the year are not synchronized with their annual variation characteristics smakhtin 2001 there is a difference between the two for example years with the same annual runoff volume may belong to the same category on a yearly scale e g a wet year however due to the different distribution of runoffs during the year the daily or monthly flow can be completely different therefore it is important to determine the runoff threshold between the low flow and non low flow in daily or monthly scales for different target years there are many ways to determine the daily low flow threshold smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2006 the common indicators include one or n day discharges that are exceeded 75 90 and 95 of the time e g q75 7 q75 10 q90 1 q95 1 and q95 10 smakhtin 2001 where the number in parentheses refers to the number of consecutive days used to calculate the low flow indicator in the present study pearson type iii distribution was used for frequency analysis the flow threshold value of runoff with a frequency of 75 exceeds that of runoffs with a frequency of 90 and 95 in order to retain more information from low flow this study applies the smaller one of the two indicators from the 75 frequency i e the q75 7 and q75 10 to determine the daily low flow threshold 2 4 antecedent precipitation index the formula used to calculate api value presented by kohler and linsley 1951 is applied to summarize the daily precipitation amounts 1 api t 1 m p t k t where pt is the precipitation in the tth ad m is the statistical number of ads k is the decay constant for the sake of simplicity this study abbreviates the ith antecedent day as i day for example the 29th day as 29 day in eq 1 the value of api is dependent on the decay constant k because the pt is known under a fixed condition of n the larger the value of k the larger the api the value of k is commonly determined based on an empirical value suggested between 0 80 and 0 98 viessman and lewis 1996 gebremichael and hossain 2010 however such a suggested value is too empirical to enable selection of an appropriate k value in a specific basin or area 2 5 approximate entropy apen uses a set of non negative numbers to describe the complexity of time series the higher the entropy the higher the randomness or complexity of the time series the lower the entropy the more orderly the time series with stronger cyclic regularity and lower complexity assuming that the time series is u i i 1 2 n with embedding dimension m and tolerance threshold r apen value is defined as follows pincus 1991 1995 pincus and huang 1992 2 apen m r m 1 r where m r i 1 n m 1 l n c i m r n m 1 c i m r t h e n u m b e r o f d x i x j r n m 1 x i u i u i 1 u i m 1 i j 1 2 n m 1 d x i x j is the distance between x i and x j and d x i x j max k 0 m 1 u i k u j k eq 2 shows that apen is closely related to m and r in general the parameters m and r are set as 2 and 0 1 0 25 times the standard deviation sd of the time series pincus 1991 1995 richman and moorman 2000 chou 2012 2014 li et al 2017 proposed a new method to select the optimal common parameters m and r this new method needs to consider the apen and the sample entropy sampen together it is not applicable to the situation in which apen or sampen is used apart from the other therefore we obtain the values of m 2 and r 0 2 sd in the present study based on the research results of pincus 1991 richman and moorman 2000 and chou 2014 from the definition of apen it can be seen that apen determines the extent of self similarity of the new and old sequence patterns of a time series after an increase in dimension it essentially represents the probability of a time series to produce a new sequence pattern after a change in dimension the greater the probability the lower the self similarity of the time series and the greater the complexity of the sequence and vice versa in the application process apen has good anti noise and anti interference properties it also has good resistance particularly for occasional and transient strong interferences moreover the method requires only a small amount of data e g 100 5000 items chou 2014 to attain a relatively robust value thus the computational volume is relatively small also the apen method can be applied to random and determined sequences and is better than the sampen for describing the general trend of the time series li et al 2017 it accordingly has a wide range of applicability to hydrological system analysis chou 2012 li et al 2017 the role of apen in the present study is to reveal the complexity of api and low flow and to judge whether there is a connection between them from the perspective of complexity we also use apen to transform api or low flow to form their substitute indicators thereby enhancing the correlation between api and low flow see fig 3 another reason why apen is considered in this study is that apen itself is sensitive to sequence changes and can effectively identify the change characteristics of the sequence itself as shown in fig 5 apen can identify changes on the 29th day our previous research li et al 2017 also shows that apen can be applied to reveal the relationship between runoff and precipitation which makes us attempt to use it to uncover the changing law of low flow in the present study 2 6 sliding window and sliding average according to apen s calculation requirement for the amount of data such as 100 chou 2014 li et al 2017 the minimum data amount of apen is set to 100 months in the present study the entire sequence is divided into two parts the initial window part the first 100 months and the sliding window part the rest the sequence from the beginning of the raw sequence to the 100th month is called the initial window the window concept here refers to the data sequence used for calculation and the length of the window is called the window length the sliding concept here refers to the process of gradually increasing data from the sliding window to the initial window define eq 3 to calculate the sliding average of the sliding window 3 v l i 1 l 0 l v i l 0 l l 0 l m l 0 where vl is the lth sliding average of the sliding window vi is the ith value of the entire sequence and i 1 l 0 l l 0 is the length of the initial window ll is the length from the start of the sliding window to the lth point of the sliding window m is the length of the entire sequence therefore according to eq 3 the sliding average of low flow api and their corresponding apen can be calculated the sliding average of api and apen is referred to as sliding api and sliding apen 2 7 t statistic of correlation coefficient and t 0 set different scenarios of decay constant k from 0 800 to 0 980 with a step of 0 001 calculate the api value corresponding to all scenarios of k based on eq 1 and the correlation coefficient cc between sequences of y e g the daily low flow and x e g api obtain the t statistics ts of cc by 4 ts k t cc k t n 2 1 cc k t where tsk t is the ts value of cc for the scenarios of k and t cck t is the cc value for the scenarios of k and t n is the sequence length in eq 1 k is 1 therefore api tends to be stable as t increases the earliest stable point of t is recorded as t 0 which satisfies when t t 0 the api remains stable for each decay constant k the corresponding expected t 0 can be determined when eq 5 is satisfied 5 ts t 0 if t t 0 t s t 0 if t t 0 where t 0 is the critical ts value at a certain confidence level e g 95 or 99 the confidence level of 99 is adopted in this study and t 0 2 577 2 8 dimensionless processing in order to eliminate the influence of different dimensions e g the dimensions of precipitation and low flow are mm and m3 s respectively apen has no dimension on the results when different variables are compared this study first dedimensionalizes each variable before calculation by 6 x i x i m a x x where x is the original sequence x x 1 x 2 xn xi i 1 2 n is the ith value in x n is the sequence length xi is the dimensionless value corresponding to xi 2 9 error metrics to evaluate the performance of simulated models four statistical indicators normalized mean absolute error nmae root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse index of agreement ioa are used they are expressed as 7 nmae 1 n i 1 n y i x i x 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 1 2 9 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 10 ioa 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i x x i x 2 where n is the series length xi is the ith observed value yi is the ith calculated value x is the mean value of the observed series these four metrics compare the observed and calculated series at the individual level and try to express the spread in yi xi janssen and heuberger 1995 the nmae explains the absolute value of deviations yi xi and smaller nmae means that the calculated values are closer to measured values janssen and heuberger 1995 zhai et al 2008 the dimensionless nse ranges between 1 and nash and sutcliffe 1970 krause et al 2005 where a value of one denotes a perfect simulated value and a value of less than zero indicates that simulated values are worse than the observed ones risse et al 1993 krause et al 2005 however it is difficult to perform an objective evaluation of the agreement between calculated values and observed values in terms of rmse when errors are significant groenendijk et al 2014 alternatively the dimensionless ioa proposed by willmott 1982 has limits of 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement to express the agreement between calculated values and observed values more directly groenendijk et al 2014 in this study there are two places where four error metrics need to be used see fig 3 one is to select the optimal pair yopt xopt among the n m pairs between yi i 1 2 n and xj j 1 2 m and the other is to perform low flow simulation based on the optimal pair yopt xopt for the first case by comparing the matching conditions of xj and yi during the sliding window for different dedimensionalized pairs yi xj the pair with the smallest difference between xj and yi is selected as the optimal pair yopt xopt based on the four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa for the second case after determining the optimal pair yopt xopt in the first case the different functional set of the pair yopt xopt is established as yopt fs xopt through statistical analysis and historical data the statistical analysis is used to select the optimal function form namely yopt fopt xopt between yopt and xopt the optimal function relationship is then applied to the low flow simulation by comparing the difference between the value of fopt xopt during 2011 2013 and the measured sliding apen of low flow yopt during the same period using the four error indicators 2 10 hypotheses and framework this study proposes two hypotheses i api has a maximum correlation with the low flow when t t 0 in a bunch of k sets the k value corresponding to the maximum correlation is called the optimal k value denoted as kopt in the kopt scenario the value of t t t 0 corresponding to the maximum correlation is called the optimal t denoted as topt this property is called the optimality of k or api ii the kopt probably not be a fixed value but will change as t changes this property is called the multivaluedness of k or api in order to verify the above two hypotheses and carry out low flow simulation based on the two properties this study starts from both sides of low flow and precipitation or ap it proposes a framework to verify hypotheses 1 and 2 and simulate low flow shown in fig 3 the orange boxes in fig 3 are the low flow side the a color zone the green boxes are the ap side the b color zone the yellow boxes are the process of verifying the two hypotheses the c color zone and the cyan boxes are the process of simulating low flow the d color zone the main steps are as follows i determine the low flow sequence based on the collected daily runoff data and calculate its variables or substitute indicators e g apen sliding apen and sliding average see zone a in fig 3 ii set different scenarios of k and t and calculate the api and its variables or substitute indicators e g apen sliding apen and sliding api see zone b in fig 3 corresponding to the low flow sequence iii calculate the cc between low flow and api and its ts in different scenarios of k and t to verify the two hypotheses and determine the values of kopt t 0 and topt for the api see zone c in fig 3 iv construct different combinations or pairs yi xj of the different variables yi i 1 2 n and xj j 1 2 m in low flow and api sides zones a and b find the optimal pair yopt xopt among the n m pairs based on four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa and cc or ts see zone d in fig 3 and v according to the optimal pair yopt xopt kopt and topt the low flow or its optimal substitute indicator is simulated by the optimal substitute indicator on the api side the application of api to low flow simulation in the present study is based on the optimal functional relationship between yopt and xopt to apply xopt to low flow simulation the idea is to first determine the significant functional relationship between yopt and xopt and then calculate the yopt based on this functional relationship and xopt sequence data 2 11 low flow simulation the use of api to simulate runoff has been reported in related studies e g heggen 2001 bennett et al 2018 for example heggen 2001 found that the napi model was useful in rainfall runoff modeling and had better performance than the curve number based model bennett et al 2018 employed api to replace the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions to investigate the effect of ap on flood volume in 100 australian catchments the previous studies above show that the simulation method of api to runoff or flood is feasible however there are few reports on using api to simulate low flow from the study of bennett et al 2018 we know that api can be used to indicate catchment s antecedent moisture conditions which are related to the basin s base flow the main contributor to low flow therefore from this point of view it is theoretically feasible to simulate low flow based on api when the method and framework proposed in the present study is used to simulate low flow there exists an important premise that is there is a significant correlation and functional relationship between low flow or its substitute indicator y and api or its substitute indicator x y f x in other words api or its substitute indicator x has an important influence on low flow or its substitute indicator y otherwise the method in this study is not applicable in short the premise must be verified before performing low flow simulation the verification of the premise consists of two parts the first part is to determine the optimal pair y opt x opt among the n m pairs between yi i 1 2 n and xj j 1 2 m which is shown in the dotted box d1 in fig 3 the other one is to achieve the optimal functional relationship yopt fopt xopt between the optimal pair of y opt and x opt which is illustrated in the dotted line box d2 in fig 3 after the above two part premise is determined the low flow simulation can be performed based on the optimal functional relationship yopt fopt xopt and xopt data the application of api to simulate low flow in the present study is based on statistical analysis to derive significant relationship between yopt and xopt fig 3 3 results 3 1 construction of daily low flow sequence the q75 7 value is 18 70 m3 average 44 42 m3 s cv 1 85 cs 3 5cv the q75 10 value is 19 02 m3 s average 44 42 m3 s cv 1 75 cs 3 5cv therefore q75 7 is used in the present study as the upper limit threshold i e when the daily runoff is 18 70 m3 s it is considered as low flow the average daily runoff in january february april or december is less than q75 7 notably january has the highest proportion of low flow days reaching 92 18 it is followed by december and february for which the proportions of low flow days are 80 19 and 66 27 respectively fig 4a the proportion of low flow days in april is also high reaching 64 53 for july to september there are also several days where the daily runoff is less than the daily low flow threshold which is considered as low flow days as the period from december to february of the following year is considered as a continuous series the proportion of low flow days in the months of this period is the highest 66 27 thus the sequence for december to february of the following year is regarded as the daily low flow sequence in this study the total sequence length during 1933 2010 1956 2010 and 2011 2013 are 5441 3832 and 245 days respectively the average runoff 1933 2010 of these three months accounts for only 6 02 of the total annual runoff which is less than the monthly runoff for july august september or october fig 4 b d show the change processes and their linear trends of the daily low flow sequence from 1933 to 2010 and 1956 2010 and of daily precipitation during the same period of low flow from 1956 to 2010 the linear trends of daily low flow and daily precipitation are not significant p 0 01 showing a slight decrease fig 4 b or increase fig 4 c and d trend 3 2 api and its apen the low flow sequence from january 1933 to december 1969 is exactly 100 months this study uses the date of december 31 1969 as the demarcation point to divide the low flow and precipitation sequences into the initial window and the sliding window calculate k value from 0 100 to 0 980 in the step of 0 001 according to eq 1 for different k scenarios the api value of each t can be calculated at the same time according to eqs 2 and 3 the sliding apen and sliding averages of api are calculated due to the numerous results fig 5 only lists some of them fig 5 a c show that the api and its two sliding averages vary greatly with the k scenarios the changes in the three variables are similar and relatively regular under the same t the larger the k the larger the api value and its sliding average fig 5 a and b the smaller the sliding apen of api fig 5 c in the four scenarios of k 0 906 0 920 0 940 and 0 957 t 0 increases as k increases fig 5 d the changes of sliding apen of api of different k scenarios generally show a trend from large to small until stable fig 5 c the closer to the current day t 0 the larger the sliding apen value as t increases the sliding apen value becomes smaller until it stabilizes at t t 0 among the four scenarios of k for the same t the sliding apen value of the k 0 906 scenario is the largest followed by that of k 0 920 0 940 and 0 957 respectively 3 3 optimality and multivaluedness of api in order to explore the influence of different k on low flow and test the two hypotheses of api the ts value of the cc between low flow and api can be calculated according to eq 4 part of the result is shown in fig 6 a fig 6 a shows that the ts exhibits regular changes with the difference of k and t when k increases from 0 100 to about 0 900 the stable ts gradually increases and the ts of each k shows a parallel change rule without crossing each other when k 0 284 the stable ts is 2 580 t 0 5 day which is slightly 2 577 of t 0 when k increases from 0 900 to 0 980 the greater the k value the greater the t 0 value of ts before the ts reaches stability it first reaches the peak then decreases and finally stabilizes when k 0 957 the stable ts starts to be less than t 0 it shows that the significant range of k value that meets the stable ts t 0 is 0 284 0 957 p 0 01 it is the feasible maximum range of possible values of k in order to further find the kopt from the interval 0 284 0 957 of k the maximum values of ts in all 674 scenarios of k step size 0 001 at each t are firstly listed in curve a of fig 6 b then the k values corresponding to the maximum values of ts are selected which are the values of kopt see curve b in fig 6 b when t 29 day the maximum ts increases with the increase of t when t 29 day the maximum ts generally shows a decreasing trend as t increases when t 59 day the maximum ts changes little and finally shows a stable value the kopt presents a more complicated change characteristic than the maximum ts when t 14 day two weeks or so in general kopt shows a decreasing trend as t increases when t 14 day 29 day kopt increases as t increases when t 29 day kopt generally shows a decreasing trend as t increases in particular when t 59 day the change of kopt is small when t is between 76 day 98 day kopt is 0 907 and when t 99 day kopt remains unchanged at 0 906 the existence of the kopt indicates the correctness of hypothesis 1 furthermore kopt is not a fixed value but changes with the change of t within the range of t 0 kopt is a combination of a set of k values indicating the correctness of hypothesis 2 the range of kopt is between 0 906 0 957 and t 0 is between 59 day 138 day there exists a significant logarithmic relationship between t 0 y day and kopt x p 0 01 see fig 6 c this significant relationship shows that the difference in kopt does have an important impact on the t 0 the smaller the kopt the smaller the t 0 the larger the kopt the larger the t 0 this relationship conforms to the change law of api in eq 1 the range of k value for the first time is determined as 0 284 0 957 and the final range of kopt is determined as 0 906 0 957 these two ranges are different from the traditionally recommended ranges of 0 80 0 98 viessman and lewis 1996 gebremichael and hossain 2010 it shows that the suggested value of k may be inappropriate when k 0 957 ts is no longer significant p 0 01 when k 0 967 ts starts to be 0 the changes of api sliding api and sliding apen of api for the kopt scenario with t are shown in fig 5 a c in the kopt scenario when t 29 day the sliding apen produces a local peak but the other k scenarios do not show this feature the sliding apen of the kopt scenario can detect the change of the maximum ts at t 29 day in fig 6 a b it also proves the existence of hypothesis 1 3 4 optimal pair between low flow and api the cc and ts between low flow and precipitation on the current day t 0 are only 0 014 and 0 769 respectively the nse between low flow and precipitation at t 0 is negative 1 010 and the ioa is small 0 459 it shows that there is no significant relationship between low flow and precipitation at t 0 p 0 01 however after considering the treatments of sliding apen and sliding average the sliding apen y of low flow and the sliding average x of precipitation at t 0 show a significant logarithmic relationship p 0 01 y 0 4724 ln x 1 7911 r2 0 8960 and nmae 0 1012 rmse 0 0951 nse 0 5509 and ioa 0 9011 it shows that the correlation of variables can be significantly enhanced after a certain treatment e g apen or sliding average inspired by the above idea we consider four different pairs from two treatments apen and sliding average of low flow y and api x in order to determine the optimal pair yopt xopt see the box d1 in fig 3 explore the optimal functional relationship yopt fopt xopt between low flow and precipitation see the box d2 in fig 3 and further simulate low flow the four pairs are listed in table 1 based on the four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa the topt within the range of t t 0 corresponding to the optimal error indicators can be found for different k scenarios see fig 5 d due to the numerous results this section only gives partial results of the five scenarios of k in fig 5 d fig 7 shows the change process of the four pairs during sliding window january 1 1970 december 31 2010 along with the day number from 1 to 2933 fig 8 shows the changes of the four error indicators of the four pairs in fig 7 along with t from 1 day to 180 day fig 7 shows that there are differences in the change process of low flow and api in different pairs and k scenarios the intuitive results in fig 7 show that the kopt scenario in pair 3 fig 7 c is better than other k scenarios the result of k 0 957 in pair 4 is good see fig 7 d and fig 8 d but at t 50 day nse 0 the nse values of the other k scenarios for pairs 2 and 4 see fig 8 b and d are mostly less than zero indicating that these two pairs are not good the nse and ioa of the five k scenarios of pairs 1 and 3 are all greater than zero and close to one especially the values of pair 3 are larger than those of pair 1 the four error indicators of the kopt scenario in pair 3 are better than those of other k scenarios figs 7 c and 8 c pair 3 is the best among the four pairs in other words the sliding apen of low flow i e yopt and sliding api i e xopt are the optimal substitute indicators for low flow and api respectively for the kopt scenario the topt is about one month 31 day 33 day in pair 3 fig 8 c which is close to the topt 29 day and 30 day corresponding to the two curves a and b in fig 6 b and the topt 29 day of the sliding apen of api in fig 5 c it shows that the low flow has the best correlation with the precipitation of approximately one month in the antecedent period t topt and the correlation disappears after t t 0 59 day 3 5 low flow simulation in this section we present an application of the two properties optimality and multivaluedness of api to the field of low flow simulation based on the results in section 3 4 this section uses the optimal xopt i e the sliding api from 2010 to 2013 to simulate the yopt i e the sliding apen of low flow during the same period based on the optimal pair 3 the kopt scenario and topt 32 day there probable exist a set of functional relationship e g linear logarithmic power and exponential between yopt and xopt named yopt fs xopt which is listed in table 2 the specific process of determining the best of these functions is shown in the dotted line box d2 in fig 3 specifically firstly based on the data sequence from 1970 to 2010 the data sequence from 1956 to 1969 is the initial window the functional relationship between yopt and xopt is fitted by statistical methods and the optimal function is determined by the maximum value of the square of the correlation coefficient r2 secondly this optimal function is used to simulate the low flow from 2011 to 2013 and the simulation results are tested based on the four error indicators so as to verify the applicability and feasibility of the new method proposed in the present study the function results in the second and third columns of table 2 are obtained based on yopt and xopt from 1970 to 2010 and do not consider the distribution of xopt values from 2011 to 2013 these results show that there is the most significant logarithmic relationship among the four function forms between yopt and xopt from 1970 to 2010 p 0 01 fig 9 a the r2 value 0 9352 of the logarithmic function is greater than those of the other three functions however some areas the two purple circles in fig 9 a in the scatter points between yopt and xopt do not correspond one to one and the logarithmic relationship cannot be accurately described in order to reduce the occurrence of this non one to one correspondence we consider a treatment method that is consider the distribution of xopt values 0 9584 0 9780 from 2011 to 2013 determine the sequence of pairs yopt xopt over 2011 2013 period within the distribution range 0 6457 1 0000 of xopt values from 1970 to 2010 and perform statistical analysis of the four functions linear logarithmic power and exponential on this sequence the results are shown in the fourth and fifth columns of table 2 the power instead of the logarithmic function of yopt 1 0227 xopt 1 8655 illustrated in the solid red line in fig 9 a has the largest value of r2 0 6034 among the four function forms although the r2 value of this power function is smaller than that of the logarithmic function in the second and third columns of table 2 it reduces the data points of the non one to one correspondence between yopt and xopt therefore we consider the power function yopt 1 0227 xopt 1 8655 as the best so we use it for low flow simulation for comparison we use these two functional formulas of logarithmic and power functions yopt 0 8940 ln xopt 1 0149 r2 0 9352 and yopt 1 0227 xopt 1 8655 r2 0 6034 for the kopt scenario to simulate the sliding apen of low flow yopt from 2011 to 2013 as shown in fig 9 b and table 3 for other k scenarios the logarithmic form is better than other functional forms so the only logarithmic form is used for them the results are shown in fig 9 b and table 3 fig 9 b shows that the result of the power function is better than the result of the logarithmic form for the kopt scenario and the result of the kopt scenario is better than the results of other k scenarios although cc and ts in the power function in the kopt scenario in table 3 are slightly smaller than those in the logarithmic function the four error indicators from the power function are far superior to those from the logarithmic form indicating that the power function is indeed better than the logarithmic function therefore the optimal pair 3 the kopt scenario and the topt of 32 day have high simulation accuracy 4 discussion 4 1 optimality and multivaluedness of api eq 1 indicates the influence of the k on the api figs 5 9 distinctly illustrate such influences thus determining the appropriate value of k is of considerable significance according to eq 1 with the increase of the antecedent day t the api will tend to be stable since 0 k 1 and thus the t 0 value of different k can be determined this study verifies the correctness of the two hypotheses of k by constructing four different pairs considering different scenarios of k using different methods cc and its ts apen and sliding average and combining four error indicators the traditional view regards the k value of the api in river basin as fixed and selects it arbitrarily and empirically dingman 2015 bennett et al 2018 which lacks theoretical basis and standard dingman 2015 the suggested k interval 0 80 0 98 is large if k is selected as 0 80 0 90 or other values the results obtained vary greatly figs 5 and 6 if a suboptimal k e g k 0 920 is used to simulate low flow the results obtained are not optimal e g fig 9 b and table 2 moreover since the k varies with river basins fedora and beschta 1989 heggen 2001 dingman 2015 the arbitrarily selected value of k for watershed a may not be suitable for watershed b in contrast in this study the value of k determined based on the optimal standard is unique at t see curve b in fig 6 b and the verification and simulation results are both optimal figs 8 and 9 furthermore the optimal k kopt in the api is not a fixed value at t t 0 which means that the impact of precipitation in different antecedent days t on low flow is different and there exists a maximum impact corresponding to topt and the farthest impact corresponding to t 0 fig 5 d rosenthal et al 1982 also found that the value of k was different in july and december 0 84 and 0 99 respectively the present study proves that the selection of k has an optimal standard which provides a basis and reference for the optimization and determination of k it solves the empirical dependent problem of the determination of k the finding of the optimal standard for k selection broadens our understanding of ap especially the influence of k on low flow it is a contribution of this study to the effective selection of k in api figs 5 9 show that when t t 0 the api is stable and the impact of ap on low flow no longer changes when t t 0 the k value of api has an important impact on low flow and its apen and the impacts of ap on low flow with t are different it is because the precipitation in the antecedent days falls to the basin surface to form different runoff components dingman 2015 the different runoff components have different contributions to current day low flow leading to the emergence of multivaluedness of k among them the cumulative ap that contributes the most to low flow corresponds to the optimality of k therefore hypothesis 1 and 2 are valid from the perspective of runoff generation and convergence theory dingman 2015 on the other hand the difference in soil moisture content in the antecedent stage will also cause the difference in k schoenera and stone 2020 which leads to different api process in the antecedent days fig 6 b for example when t 25 day the api moves along the trajectory of k 0 948 but when t 20 day the api moves along the k 0 917 fig 6 b it thus leads to the emergence of the multivaluedness of k therefore the optimality and multivaluedness of k is an objective existence the finding of these two properties of k is another contribution of this study the api calculation methods used by crow 2006 and crow and zhan 2007 were both recursive which were first proposed by fedora 1987 for the purpose of predicting storm hydrographs in small forested catchments of the oregon coast range although the recursive form of api can theoretically be applicable to low flow simulation and analysis there are few reports crow and zhan 2007 used the eq 2 in their paper as γi α βcos 2πdi 365 where γ is the api coefficient i is a daily time index d is the day of year to obtain the seasonality of evapotranspiration however when we use the circular statistics proposed by fisher 1993 to calculate the seasonality index is we find that the is value of the above eq 2 in crow and zhan 2007 paper is 0 062 as shown in table a2 in supplementary material which is close to 0 in other words there is no seasonality in the γ value the indicator of γ is unable to explain the seasonality changes in precipitation and runoff in the present study when we use the seasonality index is proposed by fisher 1993 to calculate the daily precipitation and daily runoff from 1956 to 2010 and the daily runoff from 1933 to 2010 in the present study we find that both runoff and precipitation series have no strong seasonality and the seasonality only exists in july see tables a3 a5 in supplementary material the low flow sequence considered in the present study is from december to february of the following year there is no seasonality in runoff and precipitation in these three months the total number of days in the four months from august to november is 123 days although 123 days are within the range of t 0 59 day 138 day it is already very close to the maximum value of t 0 and fig 5 shows that when t 123 day the change of kopt has been relatively stable it shows that the seasonality of precipitation in july has no effect on low flow from december to february of the following year therefore it indicates that the multivaluedness of kopt is not caused by the seasonality of precipitation or runoff 4 2 low flow complexity and low flow simulation based on the collection of data this study only analyzes the impact of ap on low flow which is equivalent to fixing the impact of other factors on low flow the non significant cc between low flow and synchronous precipitation demonstrates that the current day precipitation is not the significant factor influencing low flow which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by demirel et al 2013 however the significant relationship between low flow and api for different k scenarios shown in figs 7 and 8 reveals the prominent influences of the api on low flow p 0 01 which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by hejazi and moglen 2007 in this study the t 0 and topt fig 5 d of the kopt scenario determined by the four error indicators are relatively close to the t 0 and topt determined based on the cc or ts fig 6 b however the results in table 2 and fig 9 indicate that the scenario selected based only on the maximum cc or ts may not be optimal li et al 2017 also reported this phenomenon it is because the cc or ts can describe the similarity of the two data sequences but it cannot describe the closeness of the two sequences therefore in the low flow simulation in order to avoid the influence of the different dimensions of the variables on the results dimensionless processing should be performed before the low flow simulation in addition to considering cc or ts other error indicators e g nmae rmse nse and ioa should also be considered to more effectively judge the effect of low flow simulation in different scenarios the power function based simulation results in table 2 and fig 9 from the optimal pair 3 and scenarios of kopt and topt have higher simulation accuracy they are better than the results of other k scenarios indicating that the novel approach of simulating low flow in the present study is feasible therefore this study provides an effective method for low flow simulation which is the third contribution of this study although the basin s daily precipitation over 1956 2010 only shows a slight increasing trend fig 4 it is enough to make the sliding api of the kopt scenario show a significant increasing trend p 0 01 fig 7 c the low flow in the same period also shows a slight increasing trend fig 4 but it also makes the sliding apen of low flow show a significant increasing trend p 0 01 fig 7 c in accordance with thermodynamics theory shannon and weaver 1948 the input of external energy enables a system to establish an orderly state as the external energy input is weakened dissipation makes the system move toward a chaotic or disorderly state and the complexity i e apen increases from the results of fig 5 a b the api and sliding api of different k scenarios show a significant increasing trend from t 0 until they stabilize according to the thermodynamics theory shannon and weaver 1948 the sliding apen of api will decrease as shown in fig 5 c it is especially worth noting that the kopt scenario can detect the increase of the sliding apen of api near the topt fig 5 c while the other k scenarios cannot it also demonstrates that the kopt scenario is superior to other k scenarios from the perspective of the two substitute indicators x and y see table 1 of pair 3 the calculations of sliding apen of low flow and sliding api both need to use their initial window and sliding window eq 3 after the treatments of sliding average api and apen the insignificant low flow and precipitation have become significant but they do not change their properties these treatments have an excellent performance to express low flow and precipitation themselves thus laying a solid foundation for low flow simulation according to eqs 2 and 3 the sliding value is related to eq 3 and the apen value is related to eq 2 there is a one to one correspondence between the sliding value vl and the apen value vi of low flow in eq 3 therefore in theory as long as the sliding apen value of the low flow is known a trial algorithm can be used to inversely calculate the apen value of low flow in terms of eq 3 from eq 2 we can see that the distance d x i x j between x i and x j is an absolute value there should not be a one to one correspondence between the apen value of low flow and u i of the low flow sequence u 1 u 2 u i it should be a apen value corresponding to several values of u i that is to say when we add an unknown value x that is greater than zero and less than the low flow threshold to the end of the known sequence we get an apen x value when x is inversely calculated from this apen x value we may get multiple x values accordingly combining the m 2 low flow values before and after u i genetic algorithm or it hybrid algorithm li and wei 2008 can be used to determine the best fitting x value namely low flow value it suggests a valuable direction for low flow simulation from another aspect which is an important value and contribution of this study in the field of low flow simulation however how to derive the specific low flow value needs further research in the future 4 3 applicability of the proposed method although the results and conclusions of this study are based on an example in the yellow river basin china the method proposed in this study overcomes the different preferences of different researchers for choosing the value of k which in itself is an improvement and a relatively significant contribution the optimization method proposed in the present study is based on data driven data sequences dependence rather than region driven specific regions independence theoretically the method of the present study can be applied to other regions with similar hydrological conditions and similar study designs as pointed by laaha and blöschl 2006 for those regions with different hydrological conditions and study design the method of this study should be also applicable because it is based on data driven when the method is used in other different watersheds several steps need to be followed firstly determine the optimal k and t values of the api according to the process in fig 3 and the method in section 2 of the present study secondly based on the method in section 2 10 refer to the specific treatment in section 3 4 to find the optimal pair between low flow and api or their substitute indicators so as to realize low flow simulation finally certainly the results or conclusions obtained based on the optimal standard are probably different due to different data in other different watersheds in areas with similar or different conditions due to the different antecedent soil moisture conditions the runoff generation and convergence process of the watershed may be different dingman 2015 and the same precipitation conditions may result in different runoff bennett et al 2018 this probably make the optimal pair not be the sliding apen of low flow yopt and the sliding api xopt and the optimal functions not be the power or logarithmic function between yopt and xopt listed in tables 2 and 3 on the other hand since the apen method in section 2 5 has two parameters m and r that need to be set in the present study we take the traditional approach to determine these two parameters as m 2 and r 0 1 0 25 times the sd of the time series our purpose in doing this is to fix the influence of m and r on the results of present study to make it easier to analyze the influence of the value of k although we have proved that the m and r obtained by the traditional approach may not be optimal li et al 2017 therefore the fixed value of m and r may have certain uncertainty which adds certain difficulties to the low flow simulation based on the new method of present study in future we can introduce the concept of risk and carry out risk based low flow simulations which is worth considering because the apen method has requirements for the amount of data not 100 chou 2014 li et al 2017 if the amount of data in a study area is too small the calculation results may not be accurate therefore before applying the method of this study sufficient data should be collected as much as possible also before adopting which optimal function to use e g the power function in tables 2 and 3 it is necessary to conduct a comparative analysis of various schemes according to specific problems because the characteristic response of a given drainage basin depends strongly on antecedent conditions heggen 2001 dingman 2015 the main factor influencing low flow lf in this study is api in addition to api if there are other factors such as potential evapotranspiration that have an important impact on lf the effects of all factors on lf can be considered together through the principle of water balance suppose the n factors that have important influence on lf are xi i 1 2 n and their effect functions with lf are fi xi respectively then lf f a p i i 1 n f i x i all variables in the formula are the values after dedimensionalization therefore lf i 1 n f i x i f a p i can be obtained after transformation so that the method of this study can be used for analysis 5 conclusions the nature of low flow is complex and its study presents a challenge in the research on hydrological systems the complexity of low flow is a key feature of low flow characteristics which can be applied to the analyses of low flow variations to identify the factors influencing low flow and to simulate low flow itself in this study antecedent precipitation ap is considered as an important factor influencing the low flow and expressed by the ap index api according to the performance of api s decay constant k based on correlation analysis moving average and entropy approximate entropy apen two hypotheses of k are proposed and tested one typical area jinghe river basin of the yellow river basin is used as the study area the naturalized daily runoff at the zhangjiashan station in the jinghe river basin from 1933 to 2013 and the daily precipitation in the basin over 1956 2013 are employed several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the decay constant k in the api has the properties of optimality and multivaluedness hypothesis 1 and 2 the optimal k value kopt is not a fixed value but between 0 906 and 0 957 not 0 80 0 98 as traditionally believed this study puts forward an optimal standard to determine k which solves the shortcomings of the arbitrary and empirical selection of k it is a contribution of this study also api changes have a stable antecedent day t 0 so that when t t 0 the api remains unchanged furthermore the change of api also has the property of optimal t topt when t t 0 so that the kopt scenario is optimal at topt the emergence of optimality and multivaluedness of api is an objective existence which is related to the nature of runoff generation and soil moisture content of watersheds in the antecedent days the findings of two properties of api and the verification of two hypotheses have academic value which is another contribution of this study 2 ap and low flow that are not significant in the current day can become significant after being processed by the sliding average and apen p 0 01 but the properties of ap and low flow are not changed the best of the four pairs of low flow and api is determined by using four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa based on the optimal pair kopt scenario and topt this study uses the sliding api from 2010 to 2013 to simulate the sliding apen of low flow during the same period with high simulation accuracy the idea of the method for low flow simulation is the third contribution of this study however how to derive the low flow value based on the calculation formula of apen remains to be further studied in the future 3 the method proposed in this study can also be applied to areas outside the present study because the method is data sequences dependent but not the specific regions dependent it is necessary to collect data as much as possible before using the method of present study to carry out the studies of low flow and ap because the apen has requirements for the amount of data the optimal function form used in low flow simulation should be determined in advance through comparison credit authorship contribution statement xungui li writing

4799,the decay constant k in the antecedent precipitation index api formula is generally determined arbitrarily and empirically which causes great confusion in api calculation and comparison of different research results in response to these problems two hypotheses related to api that is k has the properties of optimality and multivaluedness are proposed in this study the daily runoff and daily precipitation of a typical watershed in the yellow river basin from january1956 december 2013 is taken as an objective investigated the results show that the api has a stable antecedent day t 0 when antecedent day t t 0 the api remains stable and when t t 0 there are the optimal value of k kopt and the optimal t topt in the kopt scenario the kopt ranges between 0 906 and 0 957 which is different from the traditional empirical single value suggested between 0 80 and 0 98 the existence of kopt verifies the optimality of k or api hypothesis 1 the kopt varies with t which verifies that the k or api has the property of multivaluedness hypothesis 2 the two hypotheses of api exist objectively and are related to the runoff generation and soil moisture content of the watershed the correlation coefficient and its t statistic sliding average approximate entropy apen and four error indicators are used to determine the optimal pair among four pairs of low flow and api based on the two hypotheses and the optimal pair the daily low flow from january 2011 to december 2013 is simulated the simulation results from the power function are better than those from the logarithmic function and the kopt scenario is better than the other k scenarios the simulation accuracy is high and the results are reliable the contributions of this study lie in i the findings of two properties of api i e the optimality and multivaluedness of k ii the proposal of an optimal standard for the selection of k which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional arbitrary selection of k and iii the

low flow simulation approximate entropy yellow river 1 introduction the low flow is an important aspect of hydrological research it belongs to the category of extreme value studies in the field of hydrology as socio economic development continues the issue of water resource scarcity is becoming increasingly prominent the lack of water resources leads to over development of low flow resources which has caused a series of ecological and environmental problems smakhtin 2001 hejazi and moglen 2007 ouyang 2012 leigh 2013 the low flow regime of rivers is related to certain natural factors including groundwater recharge infiltration of soils characteristics of aquifers and evapotranspiration rates dingman and lawlor 1995 schreiber and demuth 1997 laaha and blöschl 2006 smakhtin 2001 presented a comprehensive overview of low flow indices related to a basin and climate characteristics including mean annual precipitation catchment area slope elevation catchment shape perimeter stream frequency density length of the main stream percentage of lakes reservoirs and forested areas and soil and geological indices the hydrological effects of climate change and vegetation types on low flow have also been extensively reported smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2006 komatsu et al 2010 gudmundsson et al 2011 ahn and merwade 2017 local catchment properties appear to play a large role in translating climatic fluctuations into the hydrological response gudmundsson et al 2011 however utilization of data on catchment characteristics is dependent mainly on data availability and quality which means that assessments of the importance of catchment characteristics are only meaningful among studies with similar hydrological conditions and similar study designs laaha and blöschl 2006 laaha and blöschl 2006 compared different seasonality indices for low flow regionalization in austria and found that precipitation had a more positive effect on summer and winter low flows than catchment relief such as altitude and slope catchment geology aquifer conditions land use and stream density hejazi and moglen 2007 further found that the antecedent precipitation ap was the most influential predictor of low flows whereas demirel et al 2013 concluded that the most important low flow indicators in the alpine sub basins were potential evapotranspiration lake water levels and snow storage in contrast they found that precipitation had no significant influence on low flow these contrasting conclusions drawn by laaha and blöschl 2006 and demirel et al 2013 make it necessary to analyze the effects of precipitation or ap on low flow ap refers to the precipitation that occurs prior to a particular time antecedent day ad in a specific area or basin the concept of the ap index api is defined as a weighted summation of daily precipitation amounts xie and yang 2013 which essentially expresses the effects of accumulation ap the decay constant k in api calculation has an important influence on the accurate calculation of api value heggen 2001 the constant k generally has different values in different watersheds fedora and beschta 1989 the value of k is relatively arbitrary and is generally empirically selected as a value between 0 80 and 0 98 kohler and linsley 1951 dingman 2015 such as 0 84 crozier and eyles 1980 ma et al 2014 and 0 90 kohler and linsley 1951 zêzere et al 2005 hasnawir and kubota 2008 ma et al 2014 there are also values outside the 0 80 0 98 interval for k such as 0 66 schoenera and stone 2020 0 75 ma et al 2014 and 0 997 bennett et al 2018 because the api lacks regional meaning heggen 2001 the same amount of precipitation or heavy rainfall has different effects on soil moisture content or flood events in different regions accordingly the normalized antecedent precipitation index napi was proposed for rainfall runoff simulation heggen 2001 ali et al 2010 however the constant of k also exists in napi between 0 80 and 0 98 heggen 2001 and ali et al 2010 also did not propose a solution for k but directly set it as 0 90 at present api is mainly used in the estimation of soil moisture rosenthal et al 1982 zhao et al 2019 schoenera and stone 2020 and runoff yield and simulation heggen 2001 ma et al 2014 bennett et al 2018 however the arbitrary value of k creates much confusion for api calculation soil moisture content evaluation runoff simulation and comparison of different research results there is still no effective method to determine the value of k it is very necessary to propose an effective method or standard to quantify the value of k whether is there a feasible way to determine the value of k to eliminate the confusion of arbitrary selection of k we suppose that the answer is yes therefore we put forward two hypotheses of k or api in this study the first one is that there is an optimal k value denoted as kopt on the other hand the results of rosenthal et al 1982 showed that the k values in july and december in the same study area were not the same being 0 84 and 0 99 respectively inspired by rosenthal et al 1982 we put forward the second hypothesis that the kopt changes with different ads hypothesis 1 is called the optimality of k or api and hypothesis 2 is called the multivaluedness or variability of kopt or api as a unique hydrological time series the sequence of low flow has evident complexity chou 2014 which is closely related to non linear characteristics due to climate change rind 1999 tang et al 2015 basin surface conditions chou 2014 and human activities ahn and merwade 2017 but what are the changing characteristics of low flow and its complexity and are they related to ap is it possible to simulate low flow from the perspective of complexity these are significant scientific issues that deserve to be addressed because the complexity of low flow could help us to identify the main factors influencing low flow and also reveal the characteristics and relationships of these causal factors tang et al 2014 and simulate low flow the larger the complexity value the more irregular the time series and the greater the complexity the reverse is also true i e the less irregular the sequence the lower the complexity therefore complexity analyses of low flow have both scientific relevance and practical value at present low flow studies are predominantly focused on low flow forecast kroll et al 2004 shaw and riha 2012 foulon et al 2018 worland et al 2018 low flow causal factor analyses chang and boyer 1977 modarres 2008 nikic and radonja 2009 folegot et al 2018 low flow characteristics utilization munz et al 2017 tu et al 2017 and low flow fitting frequency functions charron and ouarda 2015 gao et al 2017 there are relatively fewer studies on the complexity of low flow the concept of entropy is derived from thermodynamics and represents the unavailability of a system s thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work li et al 2012 it is often used to express the complexity of a time series and has been widely applied in the fields of geoscience rind 1999 werner 1999 chou 2012 ng 2015 li et al 2017 life science doebeli and ispolatov

approximate entropy apen is a nonlinear parameter identification method that reflects the dynamics and complexity of time series lin and chu 2011 thus it can effectively quantify the irregularity of a sequence complexity kolmogorov 1968 pincus 1991 1995 pincus and huang 1992 he et al 2012 chou 2014 the advantage of apen is that it requires only a small amount of observational data to determine the statistical properties of a nonlinear unsteady state data sequence and noise signals perez canales et al 2011 in recent years apen has accordingly been applied in runoff analyses for example based on apen li and zhang 2008 established multi scale entropy to calculate the complexity of mississippi river surface runoffs chou 2012 studied the complexity of runoffs and precipitation in the wu tu basin in taiwan using modified apen and sample entropy li et al 2017 used apen to analyze the complexity of annual runoff and precipitation they identified significant increasing trends of complexity which were opposite to the changing trends of annual runoff and precipitation in the jinghe river a secondary tributary of the yellow river they also found that the weakened effect of annual watershed precipitation had an important influence on the increase in complexity of the runoff system during the same period these studies confirm the suitability of apen in investigations of the complexity of hydrological sequences from the aspect of apen algorithm improvement and temporal spatial perspectives however the nature of the complexity of low flow and the factors influencing it including whether it can be used to simulate low flow are still rarely reported this area accordingly warrants further investigation this study intends to take the typical area jinghe river basin of the yellow river basin as the study area and attempts to 1 verify the above two hypotheses and propose an optimal standard for solving the selection of k and 2 establish the relationship between low flow and api based on the two hypotheses and apen to simulate low flow the contribution of this study is to reveal the optimality and multivaluedness of api with changes in ads and propose an optimal standard to the selection of k accordingly to effectively simulate low flow in terms of the two hypotheses and complexity apen the findings will deepen our understanding of ap and its impact on low flow and has academic value in the field of low flow simulation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the jinghe river is a secondary tributary of the yellow river and a primary tributary of the weihe river it has a total length of 455 1 km with a basin area of 45 421 km2 the zhangjiashan station is considered as the control station of the water basin fig 1 it controls 43 216 km2 of the basin area which accounts for 95 15 of the total basin area li et al 2011 li and wei 2014 the jinghe river basin is located inland it has a typical temperate continental climate with a precipitation level decreasing from the southeast to the northwest the level of precipitation differs most between the north and the south in the basin the terrain is high toward the northwest and low toward the southeast the north east and west regions of the overall terrain tilt toward the southeast the spatial temporal distribution of water resources in the basin is uneven the precipitation falling from may to september accounts for 71 87 of the annual precipitation the runoff volume accounts for 61 82 of the total annual runoff of which flood runoff accounts for 44 6 li et al 2011 li and wei 2014 due to the severe soil erosion in the basin the sediment content in runoff during the flood season from july to september is very high while the sediment content of the runoff during the non flood seasons is low li et al 2011 li 2017 2 2 data the time series employed in this study for the runoff is the daily naturalized runoff that is the runoff is not affected by human activities and the formation of runoff is a natural process at the zhangjiashan station during 1933 2013 according to the data available in the jinghe watershed the daily watershed precipitation above the zhangjiashan station was derived from the twenty three meteorological stations in and around the watershed fig 1 during 1956 2013 in terms of the thiessen polygon method among them the precipitation and runoff data before 2010 including 2010 are used for analysis and modeling and the data from 2011 to 2013 are only used to simulate and verify the model the optimal function yopt fopt xopt in fig 3 there are no restrictions on the length of the sequence calibration and validation the length of the sequence for data calibration is still inconclusive juston et al 2009 li et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 in general the data length of calibration validation series is randomly selected the reason why we choose the 1956 2010 sequence as the calibration series and the 2011 2013 sequence as the validation series is because the data used in our previous studies e g li 2017 li et al 2011 2017 are all before 2010 after constructing the model based on the 1956 2010 sequence we re collected the 2011 2013 data sequence to test the effect of the model the precipitation data were provided by the shared data platform of the china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn the daily data of naturalized runoff were obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc of the chinese ministry of water resources http www yellowriver gov cn the yrcc is in charge of naturalizing the observed flow data in the yellow river basin in terms of the method of itemized summation widely used by the chinese officials ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2016 fig 2 illustrates the daily data series in monthly order of naturalized runoff and precipitation 2 3 daily low flow threshold the distribution characteristics of low flow during the year are not synchronized with their annual variation characteristics smakhtin 2001 there is a difference between the two for example years with the same annual runoff volume may belong to the same category on a yearly scale e g a wet year however due to the different distribution of runoffs during the year the daily or monthly flow can be completely different therefore it is important to determine the runoff threshold between the low flow and non low flow in daily or monthly scales for different target years there are many ways to determine the daily low flow threshold smakhtin 2001 laaha and blöschl 2006 the common indicators include one or n day discharges that are exceeded 75 90 and 95 of the time e g q75 7 q75 10 q90 1 q95 1 and q95 10 smakhtin 2001 where the number in parentheses refers to the number of consecutive days used to calculate the low flow indicator in the present study pearson type iii distribution was used for frequency analysis the flow threshold value of runoff with a frequency of 75 exceeds that of runoffs with a frequency of 90 and 95 in order to retain more information from low flow this study applies the smaller one of the two indicators from the 75 frequency i e the q75 7 and q75 10 to determine the daily low flow threshold 2 4 antecedent precipitation index the formula used to calculate api value presented by kohler and linsley 1951 is applied to summarize the daily precipitation amounts 1 api t 1 m p t k t where pt is the precipitation in the tth ad m is the statistical number of ads k is the decay constant for the sake of simplicity this study abbreviates the ith antecedent day as i day for example the 29th day as 29 day in eq 1 the value of api is dependent on the decay constant k because the pt is known under a fixed condition of n the larger the value of k the larger the api the value of k is commonly determined based on an empirical value suggested between 0 80 and 0 98 viessman and lewis 1996 gebremichael and hossain 2010 however such a suggested value is too empirical to enable selection of an appropriate k value in a specific basin or area 2 5 approximate entropy apen uses a set of non negative numbers to describe the complexity of time series the higher the entropy the higher the randomness or complexity of the time series the lower the entropy the more orderly the time series with stronger cyclic regularity and lower complexity assuming that the time series is u i i 1 2 n with embedding dimension m and tolerance threshold r apen value is defined as follows pincus 1991 1995 pincus and huang 1992 2 apen m r m 1 r where m r i 1 n m 1 l n c i m r n m 1 c i m r t h e n u m b e r o f d x i x j r n m 1 x i u i u i 1 u i m 1 i j 1 2 n m 1 d x i x j is the distance between x i and x j and d x i x j max k 0 m 1 u i k u j k eq 2 shows that apen is closely related to m and r in general the parameters m and r are set as 2 and 0 1 0 25 times the standard deviation sd of the time series pincus 1991 1995 richman and moorman 2000 chou 2012 2014 li et al 2017 proposed a new method to select the optimal common parameters m and r this new method needs to consider the apen and the sample entropy sampen together it is not applicable to the situation in which apen or sampen is used apart from the other therefore we obtain the values of m 2 and r 0 2 sd in the present study based on the research results of pincus 1991 richman and moorman 2000 and chou 2014 from the definition of apen it can be seen that apen determines the extent of self similarity of the new and old sequence patterns of a time series after an increase in dimension it essentially represents the probability of a time series to produce a new sequence pattern after a change in dimension the greater the probability the lower the self similarity of the time series and the greater the complexity of the sequence and vice versa in the application process apen has good anti noise and anti interference properties it also has good resistance particularly for occasional and transient strong interferences moreover the method requires only a small amount of data e g 100 5000 items chou 2014 to attain a relatively robust value thus the computational volume is relatively small also the apen method can be applied to random and determined sequences and is better than the sampen for describing the general trend of the time series li et al 2017 it accordingly has a wide range of applicability to hydrological system analysis chou 2012 li et al 2017 the role of apen in the present study is to reveal the complexity of api and low flow and to judge whether there is a connection between them from the perspective of complexity we also use apen to transform api or low flow to form their substitute indicators thereby enhancing the correlation between api and low flow see fig 3 another reason why apen is considered in this study is that apen itself is sensitive to sequence changes and can effectively identify the change characteristics of the sequence itself as shown in fig 5 apen can identify changes on the 29th day our previous research li et al 2017 also shows that apen can be applied to reveal the relationship between runoff and precipitation which makes us attempt to use it to uncover the changing law of low flow in the present study 2 6 sliding window and sliding average according to apen s calculation requirement for the amount of data such as 100 chou 2014 li et al 2017 the minimum data amount of apen is set to 100 months in the present study the entire sequence is divided into two parts the initial window part the first 100 months and the sliding window part the rest the sequence from the beginning of the raw sequence to the 100th month is called the initial window the window concept here refers to the data sequence used for calculation and the length of the window is called the window length the sliding concept here refers to the process of gradually increasing data from the sliding window to the initial window define eq 3 to calculate the sliding average of the sliding window 3 v l i 1 l 0 l v i l 0 l l 0 l m l 0 where vl is the lth sliding average of the sliding window vi is the ith value of the entire sequence and i 1 l 0 l l 0 is the length of the initial window ll is the length from the start of the sliding window to the lth point of the sliding window m is the length of the entire sequence therefore according to eq 3 the sliding average of low flow api and their corresponding apen can be calculated the sliding average of api and apen is referred to as sliding api and sliding apen 2 7 t statistic of correlation coefficient and t 0 set different scenarios of decay constant k from 0 800 to 0 980 with a step of 0 001 calculate the api value corresponding to all scenarios of k based on eq 1 and the correlation coefficient cc between sequences of y e g the daily low flow and x e g api obtain the t statistics ts of cc by 4 ts k t cc k t n 2 1 cc k t where tsk t is the ts value of cc for the scenarios of k and t cck t is the cc value for the scenarios of k and t n is the sequence length in eq 1 k is 1 therefore api tends to be stable as t increases the earliest stable point of t is recorded as t 0 which satisfies when t t 0 the api remains stable for each decay constant k the corresponding expected t 0 can be determined when eq 5 is satisfied 5 ts t 0 if t t 0 t s t 0 if t t 0 where t 0 is the critical ts value at a certain confidence level e g 95 or 99 the confidence level of 99 is adopted in this study and t 0 2 577 2 8 dimensionless processing in order to eliminate the influence of different dimensions e g the dimensions of precipitation and low flow are mm and m3 s respectively apen has no dimension on the results when different variables are compared this study first dedimensionalizes each variable before calculation by 6 x i x i m a x x where x is the original sequence x x 1 x 2 xn xi i 1 2 n is the ith value in x n is the sequence length xi is the dimensionless value corresponding to xi 2 9 error metrics to evaluate the performance of simulated models four statistical indicators normalized mean absolute error nmae root mean square error rmse nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse index of agreement ioa are used they are expressed as 7 nmae 1 n i 1 n y i x i x 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 1 2 9 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 10 ioa 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i x x i x 2 where n is the series length xi is the ith observed value yi is the ith calculated value x is the mean value of the observed series these four metrics compare the observed and calculated series at the individual level and try to express the spread in yi xi janssen and heuberger 1995 the nmae explains the absolute value of deviations yi xi and smaller nmae means that the calculated values are closer to measured values janssen and heuberger 1995 zhai et al 2008 the dimensionless nse ranges between 1 and nash and sutcliffe 1970 krause et al 2005 where a value of one denotes a perfect simulated value and a value of less than zero indicates that simulated values are worse than the observed ones risse et al 1993 krause et al 2005 however it is difficult to perform an objective evaluation of the agreement between calculated values and observed values in terms of rmse when errors are significant groenendijk et al 2014 alternatively the dimensionless ioa proposed by willmott 1982 has limits of 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement to express the agreement between calculated values and observed values more directly groenendijk et al 2014 in this study there are two places where four error metrics need to be used see fig 3 one is to select the optimal pair yopt xopt among the n m pairs between yi i 1 2 n and xj j 1 2 m and the other is to perform low flow simulation based on the optimal pair yopt xopt for the first case by comparing the matching conditions of xj and yi during the sliding window for different dedimensionalized pairs yi xj the pair with the smallest difference between xj and yi is selected as the optimal pair yopt xopt based on the four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa for the second case after determining the optimal pair yopt xopt in the first case the different functional set of the pair yopt xopt is established as yopt fs xopt through statistical analysis and historical data the statistical analysis is used to select the optimal function form namely yopt fopt xopt between yopt and xopt the optimal function relationship is then applied to the low flow simulation by comparing the difference between the value of fopt xopt during 2011 2013 and the measured sliding apen of low flow yopt during the same period using the four error indicators 2 10 hypotheses and framework this study proposes two hypotheses i api has a maximum correlation with the low flow when t t 0 in a bunch of k sets the k value corresponding to the maximum correlation is called the optimal k value denoted as kopt in the kopt scenario the value of t t t 0 corresponding to the maximum correlation is called the optimal t denoted as topt this property is called the optimality of k or api ii the kopt probably not be a fixed value but will change as t changes this property is called the multivaluedness of k or api in order to verify the above two hypotheses and carry out low flow simulation based on the two properties this study starts from both sides of low flow and precipitation or ap it proposes a framework to verify hypotheses 1 and 2 and simulate low flow shown in fig 3 the orange boxes in fig 3 are the low flow side the a color zone the green boxes are the ap side the b color zone the yellow boxes are the process of verifying the two hypotheses the c color zone and the cyan boxes are the process of simulating low flow the d color zone the main steps are as follows i determine the low flow sequence based on the collected daily runoff data and calculate its variables or substitute indicators e g apen sliding apen and sliding average see zone a in fig 3 ii set different scenarios of k and t and calculate the api and its variables or substitute indicators e g apen sliding apen and sliding api see zone b in fig 3 corresponding to the low flow sequence iii calculate the cc between low flow and api and its ts in different scenarios of k and t to verify the two hypotheses and determine the values of kopt t 0 and topt for the api see zone c in fig 3 iv construct different combinations or pairs yi xj of the different variables yi i 1 2 n and xj j 1 2 m in low flow and api sides zones a and b find the optimal pair yopt xopt among the n m pairs based on four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa and cc or ts see zone d in fig 3 and v according to the optimal pair yopt xopt kopt and topt the low flow or its optimal substitute indicator is simulated by the optimal substitute indicator on the api side the application of api to low flow simulation in the present study is based on the optimal functional relationship between yopt and xopt to apply xopt to low flow simulation the idea is to first determine the significant functional relationship between yopt and xopt and then calculate the yopt based on this functional relationship and xopt sequence data 2 11 low flow simulation the use of api to simulate runoff has been reported in related studies e g heggen 2001 bennett et al 2018 for example heggen 2001 found that the napi model was useful in rainfall runoff modeling and had better performance than the curve number based model bennett et al 2018 employed api to replace the catchment s antecedent moisture conditions to investigate the effect of ap on flood volume in 100 australian catchments the previous studies above show that the simulation method of api to runoff or flood is feasible however there are few reports on using api to simulate low flow from the study of bennett et al 2018 we know that api can be used to indicate catchment s antecedent moisture conditions which are related to the basin s base flow the main contributor to low flow therefore from this point of view it is theoretically feasible to simulate low flow based on api when the method and framework proposed in the present study is used to simulate low flow there exists an important premise that is there is a significant correlation and functional relationship between low flow or its substitute indicator y and api or its substitute indicator x y f x in other words api or its substitute indicator x has an important influence on low flow or its substitute indicator y otherwise the method in this study is not applicable in short the premise must be verified before performing low flow simulation the verification of the premise consists of two parts the first part is to determine the optimal pair y opt x opt among the n m pairs between yi i 1 2 n and xj j 1 2 m which is shown in the dotted box d1 in fig 3 the other one is to achieve the optimal functional relationship yopt fopt xopt between the optimal pair of y opt and x opt which is illustrated in the dotted line box d2 in fig 3 after the above two part premise is determined the low flow simulation can be performed based on the optimal functional relationship yopt fopt xopt and xopt data the application of api to simulate low flow in the present study is based on statistical analysis to derive significant relationship between yopt and xopt fig 3 3 results 3 1 construction of daily low flow sequence the q75 7 value is 18 70 m3 average 44 42 m3 s cv 1 85 cs 3 5cv the q75 10 value is 19 02 m3 s average 44 42 m3 s cv 1 75 cs 3 5cv therefore q75 7 is used in the present study as the upper limit threshold i e when the daily runoff is 18 70 m3 s it is considered as low flow the average daily runoff in january february april or december is less than q75 7 notably january has the highest proportion of low flow days reaching 92 18 it is followed by december and february for which the proportions of low flow days are 80 19 and 66 27 respectively fig 4a the proportion of low flow days in april is also high reaching 64 53 for july to september there are also several days where the daily runoff is less than the daily low flow threshold which is considered as low flow days as the period from december to february of the following year is considered as a continuous series the proportion of low flow days in the months of this period is the highest 66 27 thus the sequence for december to february of the following year is regarded as the daily low flow sequence in this study the total sequence length during 1933 2010 1956 2010 and 2011 2013 are 5441 3832 and 245 days respectively the average runoff 1933 2010 of these three months accounts for only 6 02 of the total annual runoff which is less than the monthly runoff for july august september or october fig 4 b d show the change processes and their linear trends of the daily low flow sequence from 1933 to 2010 and 1956 2010 and of daily precipitation during the same period of low flow from 1956 to 2010 the linear trends of daily low flow and daily precipitation are not significant p 0 01 showing a slight decrease fig 4 b or increase fig 4 c and d trend 3 2 api and its apen the low flow sequence from january 1933 to december 1969 is exactly 100 months this study uses the date of december 31 1969 as the demarcation point to divide the low flow and precipitation sequences into the initial window and the sliding window calculate k value from 0 100 to 0 980 in the step of 0 001 according to eq 1 for different k scenarios the api value of each t can be calculated at the same time according to eqs 2 and 3 the sliding apen and sliding averages of api are calculated due to the numerous results fig 5 only lists some of them fig 5 a c show that the api and its two sliding averages vary greatly with the k scenarios the changes in the three variables are similar and relatively regular under the same t the larger the k the larger the api value and its sliding average fig 5 a and b the smaller the sliding apen of api fig 5 c in the four scenarios of k 0 906 0 920 0 940 and 0 957 t 0 increases as k increases fig 5 d the changes of sliding apen of api of different k scenarios generally show a trend from large to small until stable fig 5 c the closer to the current day t 0 the larger the sliding apen value as t increases the sliding apen value becomes smaller until it stabilizes at t t 0 among the four scenarios of k for the same t the sliding apen value of the k 0 906 scenario is the largest followed by that of k 0 920 0 940 and 0 957 respectively 3 3 optimality and multivaluedness of api in order to explore the influence of different k on low flow and test the two hypotheses of api the ts value of the cc between low flow and api can be calculated according to eq 4 part of the result is shown in fig 6 a fig 6 a shows that the ts exhibits regular changes with the difference of k and t when k increases from 0 100 to about 0 900 the stable ts gradually increases and the ts of each k shows a parallel change rule without crossing each other when k 0 284 the stable ts is 2 580 t 0 5 day which is slightly 2 577 of t 0 when k increases from 0 900 to 0 980 the greater the k value the greater the t 0 value of ts before the ts reaches stability it first reaches the peak then decreases and finally stabilizes when k 0 957 the stable ts starts to be less than t 0 it shows that the significant range of k value that meets the stable ts t 0 is 0 284 0 957 p 0 01 it is the feasible maximum range of possible values of k in order to further find the kopt from the interval 0 284 0 957 of k the maximum values of ts in all 674 scenarios of k step size 0 001 at each t are firstly listed in curve a of fig 6 b then the k values corresponding to the maximum values of ts are selected which are the values of kopt see curve b in fig 6 b when t 29 day the maximum ts increases with the increase of t when t 29 day the maximum ts generally shows a decreasing trend as t increases when t 59 day the maximum ts changes little and finally shows a stable value the kopt presents a more complicated change characteristic than the maximum ts when t 14 day two weeks or so in general kopt shows a decreasing trend as t increases when t 14 day 29 day kopt increases as t increases when t 29 day kopt generally shows a decreasing trend as t increases in particular when t 59 day the change of kopt is small when t is between 76 day 98 day kopt is 0 907 and when t 99 day kopt remains unchanged at 0 906 the existence of the kopt indicates the correctness of hypothesis 1 furthermore kopt is not a fixed value but changes with the change of t within the range of t 0 kopt is a combination of a set of k values indicating the correctness of hypothesis 2 the range of kopt is between 0 906 0 957 and t 0 is between 59 day 138 day there exists a significant logarithmic relationship between t 0 y day and kopt x p 0 01 see fig 6 c this significant relationship shows that the difference in kopt does have an important impact on the t 0 the smaller the kopt the smaller the t 0 the larger the kopt the larger the t 0 this relationship conforms to the change law of api in eq 1 the range of k value for the first time is determined as 0 284 0 957 and the final range of kopt is determined as 0 906 0 957 these two ranges are different from the traditionally recommended ranges of 0 80 0 98 viessman and lewis 1996 gebremichael and hossain 2010 it shows that the suggested value of k may be inappropriate when k 0 957 ts is no longer significant p 0 01 when k 0 967 ts starts to be 0 the changes of api sliding api and sliding apen of api for the kopt scenario with t are shown in fig 5 a c in the kopt scenario when t 29 day the sliding apen produces a local peak but the other k scenarios do not show this feature the sliding apen of the kopt scenario can detect the change of the maximum ts at t 29 day in fig 6 a b it also proves the existence of hypothesis 1 3 4 optimal pair between low flow and api the cc and ts between low flow and precipitation on the current day t 0 are only 0 014 and 0 769 respectively the nse between low flow and precipitation at t 0 is negative 1 010 and the ioa is small 0 459 it shows that there is no significant relationship between low flow and precipitation at t 0 p 0 01 however after considering the treatments of sliding apen and sliding average the sliding apen y of low flow and the sliding average x of precipitation at t 0 show a significant logarithmic relationship p 0 01 y 0 4724 ln x 1 7911 r2 0 8960 and nmae 0 1012 rmse 0 0951 nse 0 5509 and ioa 0 9011 it shows that the correlation of variables can be significantly enhanced after a certain treatment e g apen or sliding average inspired by the above idea we consider four different pairs from two treatments apen and sliding average of low flow y and api x in order to determine the optimal pair yopt xopt see the box d1 in fig 3 explore the optimal functional relationship yopt fopt xopt between low flow and precipitation see the box d2 in fig 3 and further simulate low flow the four pairs are listed in table 1 based on the four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa the topt within the range of t t 0 corresponding to the optimal error indicators can be found for different k scenarios see fig 5 d due to the numerous results this section only gives partial results of the five scenarios of k in fig 5 d fig 7 shows the change process of the four pairs during sliding window january 1 1970 december 31 2010 along with the day number from 1 to 2933 fig 8 shows the changes of the four error indicators of the four pairs in fig 7 along with t from 1 day to 180 day fig 7 shows that there are differences in the change process of low flow and api in different pairs and k scenarios the intuitive results in fig 7 show that the kopt scenario in pair 3 fig 7 c is better than other k scenarios the result of k 0 957 in pair 4 is good see fig 7 d and fig 8 d but at t 50 day nse 0 the nse values of the other k scenarios for pairs 2 and 4 see fig 8 b and d are mostly less than zero indicating that these two pairs are not good the nse and ioa of the five k scenarios of pairs 1 and 3 are all greater than zero and close to one especially the values of pair 3 are larger than those of pair 1 the four error indicators of the kopt scenario in pair 3 are better than those of other k scenarios figs 7 c and 8 c pair 3 is the best among the four pairs in other words the sliding apen of low flow i e yopt and sliding api i e xopt are the optimal substitute indicators for low flow and api respectively for the kopt scenario the topt is about one month 31 day 33 day in pair 3 fig 8 c which is close to the topt 29 day and 30 day corresponding to the two curves a and b in fig 6 b and the topt 29 day of the sliding apen of api in fig 5 c it shows that the low flow has the best correlation with the precipitation of approximately one month in the antecedent period t topt and the correlation disappears after t t 0 59 day 3 5 low flow simulation in this section we present an application of the two properties optimality and multivaluedness of api to the field of low flow simulation based on the results in section 3 4 this section uses the optimal xopt i e the sliding api from 2010 to 2013 to simulate the yopt i e the sliding apen of low flow during the same period based on the optimal pair 3 the kopt scenario and topt 32 day there probable exist a set of functional relationship e g linear logarithmic power and exponential between yopt and xopt named yopt fs xopt which is listed in table 2 the specific process of determining the best of these functions is shown in the dotted line box d2 in fig 3 specifically firstly based on the data sequence from 1970 to 2010 the data sequence from 1956 to 1969 is the initial window the functional relationship between yopt and xopt is fitted by statistical methods and the optimal function is determined by the maximum value of the square of the correlation coefficient r2 secondly this optimal function is used to simulate the low flow from 2011 to 2013 and the simulation results are tested based on the four error indicators so as to verify the applicability and feasibility of the new method proposed in the present study the function results in the second and third columns of table 2 are obtained based on yopt and xopt from 1970 to 2010 and do not consider the distribution of xopt values from 2011 to 2013 these results show that there is the most significant logarithmic relationship among the four function forms between yopt and xopt from 1970 to 2010 p 0 01 fig 9 a the r2 value 0 9352 of the logarithmic function is greater than those of the other three functions however some areas the two purple circles in fig 9 a in the scatter points between yopt and xopt do not correspond one to one and the logarithmic relationship cannot be accurately described in order to reduce the occurrence of this non one to one correspondence we consider a treatment method that is consider the distribution of xopt values 0 9584 0 9780 from 2011 to 2013 determine the sequence of pairs yopt xopt over 2011 2013 period within the distribution range 0 6457 1 0000 of xopt values from 1970 to 2010 and perform statistical analysis of the four functions linear logarithmic power and exponential on this sequence the results are shown in the fourth and fifth columns of table 2 the power instead of the logarithmic function of yopt 1 0227 xopt 1 8655 illustrated in the solid red line in fig 9 a has the largest value of r2 0 6034 among the four function forms although the r2 value of this power function is smaller than that of the logarithmic function in the second and third columns of table 2 it reduces the data points of the non one to one correspondence between yopt and xopt therefore we consider the power function yopt 1 0227 xopt 1 8655 as the best so we use it for low flow simulation for comparison we use these two functional formulas of logarithmic and power functions yopt 0 8940 ln xopt 1 0149 r2 0 9352 and yopt 1 0227 xopt 1 8655 r2 0 6034 for the kopt scenario to simulate the sliding apen of low flow yopt from 2011 to 2013 as shown in fig 9 b and table 3 for other k scenarios the logarithmic form is better than other functional forms so the only logarithmic form is used for them the results are shown in fig 9 b and table 3 fig 9 b shows that the result of the power function is better than the result of the logarithmic form for the kopt scenario and the result of the kopt scenario is better than the results of other k scenarios although cc and ts in the power function in the kopt scenario in table 3 are slightly smaller than those in the logarithmic function the four error indicators from the power function are far superior to those from the logarithmic form indicating that the power function is indeed better than the logarithmic function therefore the optimal pair 3 the kopt scenario and the topt of 32 day have high simulation accuracy 4 discussion 4 1 optimality and multivaluedness of api eq 1 indicates the influence of the k on the api figs 5 9 distinctly illustrate such influences thus determining the appropriate value of k is of considerable significance according to eq 1 with the increase of the antecedent day t the api will tend to be stable since 0 k 1 and thus the t 0 value of different k can be determined this study verifies the correctness of the two hypotheses of k by constructing four different pairs considering different scenarios of k using different methods cc and its ts apen and sliding average and combining four error indicators the traditional view regards the k value of the api in river basin as fixed and selects it arbitrarily and empirically dingman 2015 bennett et al 2018 which lacks theoretical basis and standard dingman 2015 the suggested k interval 0 80 0 98 is large if k is selected as 0 80 0 90 or other values the results obtained vary greatly figs 5 and 6 if a suboptimal k e g k 0 920 is used to simulate low flow the results obtained are not optimal e g fig 9 b and table 2 moreover since the k varies with river basins fedora and beschta 1989 heggen 2001 dingman 2015 the arbitrarily selected value of k for watershed a may not be suitable for watershed b in contrast in this study the value of k determined based on the optimal standard is unique at t see curve b in fig 6 b and the verification and simulation results are both optimal figs 8 and 9 furthermore the optimal k kopt in the api is not a fixed value at t t 0 which means that the impact of precipitation in different antecedent days t on low flow is different and there exists a maximum impact corresponding to topt and the farthest impact corresponding to t 0 fig 5 d rosenthal et al 1982 also found that the value of k was different in july and december 0 84 and 0 99 respectively the present study proves that the selection of k has an optimal standard which provides a basis and reference for the optimization and determination of k it solves the empirical dependent problem of the determination of k the finding of the optimal standard for k selection broadens our understanding of ap especially the influence of k on low flow it is a contribution of this study to the effective selection of k in api figs 5 9 show that when t t 0 the api is stable and the impact of ap on low flow no longer changes when t t 0 the k value of api has an important impact on low flow and its apen and the impacts of ap on low flow with t are different it is because the precipitation in the antecedent days falls to the basin surface to form different runoff components dingman 2015 the different runoff components have different contributions to current day low flow leading to the emergence of multivaluedness of k among them the cumulative ap that contributes the most to low flow corresponds to the optimality of k therefore hypothesis 1 and 2 are valid from the perspective of runoff generation and convergence theory dingman 2015 on the other hand the difference in soil moisture content in the antecedent stage will also cause the difference in k schoenera and stone 2020 which leads to different api process in the antecedent days fig 6 b for example when t 25 day the api moves along the trajectory of k 0 948 but when t 20 day the api moves along the k 0 917 fig 6 b it thus leads to the emergence of the multivaluedness of k therefore the optimality and multivaluedness of k is an objective existence the finding of these two properties of k is another contribution of this study the api calculation methods used by crow 2006 and crow and zhan 2007 were both recursive which were first proposed by fedora 1987 for the purpose of predicting storm hydrographs in small forested catchments of the oregon coast range although the recursive form of api can theoretically be applicable to low flow simulation and analysis there are few reports crow and zhan 2007 used the eq 2 in their paper as γi α βcos 2πdi 365 where γ is the api coefficient i is a daily time index d is the day of year to obtain the seasonality of evapotranspiration however when we use the circular statistics proposed by fisher 1993 to calculate the seasonality index is we find that the is value of the above eq 2 in crow and zhan 2007 paper is 0 062 as shown in table a2 in supplementary material which is close to 0 in other words there is no seasonality in the γ value the indicator of γ is unable to explain the seasonality changes in precipitation and runoff in the present study when we use the seasonality index is proposed by fisher 1993 to calculate the daily precipitation and daily runoff from 1956 to 2010 and the daily runoff from 1933 to 2010 in the present study we find that both runoff and precipitation series have no strong seasonality and the seasonality only exists in july see tables a3 a5 in supplementary material the low flow sequence considered in the present study is from december to february of the following year there is no seasonality in runoff and precipitation in these three months the total number of days in the four months from august to november is 123 days although 123 days are within the range of t 0 59 day 138 day it is already very close to the maximum value of t 0 and fig 5 shows that when t 123 day the change of kopt has been relatively stable it shows that the seasonality of precipitation in july has no effect on low flow from december to february of the following year therefore it indicates that the multivaluedness of kopt is not caused by the seasonality of precipitation or runoff 4 2 low flow complexity and low flow simulation based on the collection of data this study only analyzes the impact of ap on low flow which is equivalent to fixing the impact of other factors on low flow the non significant cc between low flow and synchronous precipitation demonstrates that the current day precipitation is not the significant factor influencing low flow which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by demirel et al 2013 however the significant relationship between low flow and api for different k scenarios shown in figs 7 and 8 reveals the prominent influences of the api on low flow p 0 01 which is consistent with the conclusions drawn by hejazi and moglen 2007 in this study the t 0 and topt fig 5 d of the kopt scenario determined by the four error indicators are relatively close to the t 0 and topt determined based on the cc or ts fig 6 b however the results in table 2 and fig 9 indicate that the scenario selected based only on the maximum cc or ts may not be optimal li et al 2017 also reported this phenomenon it is because the cc or ts can describe the similarity of the two data sequences but it cannot describe the closeness of the two sequences therefore in the low flow simulation in order to avoid the influence of the different dimensions of the variables on the results dimensionless processing should be performed before the low flow simulation in addition to considering cc or ts other error indicators e g nmae rmse nse and ioa should also be considered to more effectively judge the effect of low flow simulation in different scenarios the power function based simulation results in table 2 and fig 9 from the optimal pair 3 and scenarios of kopt and topt have higher simulation accuracy they are better than the results of other k scenarios indicating that the novel approach of simulating low flow in the present study is feasible therefore this study provides an effective method for low flow simulation which is the third contribution of this study although the basin s daily precipitation over 1956 2010 only shows a slight increasing trend fig 4 it is enough to make the sliding api of the kopt scenario show a significant increasing trend p 0 01 fig 7 c the low flow in the same period also shows a slight increasing trend fig 4 but it also makes the sliding apen of low flow show a significant increasing trend p 0 01 fig 7 c in accordance with thermodynamics theory shannon and weaver 1948 the input of external energy enables a system to establish an orderly state as the external energy input is weakened dissipation makes the system move toward a chaotic or disorderly state and the complexity i e apen increases from the results of fig 5 a b the api and sliding api of different k scenarios show a significant increasing trend from t 0 until they stabilize according to the thermodynamics theory shannon and weaver 1948 the sliding apen of api will decrease as shown in fig 5 c it is especially worth noting that the kopt scenario can detect the increase of the sliding apen of api near the topt fig 5 c while the other k scenarios cannot it also demonstrates that the kopt scenario is superior to other k scenarios from the perspective of the two substitute indicators x and y see table 1 of pair 3 the calculations of sliding apen of low flow and sliding api both need to use their initial window and sliding window eq 3 after the treatments of sliding average api and apen the insignificant low flow and precipitation have become significant but they do not change their properties these treatments have an excellent performance to express low flow and precipitation themselves thus laying a solid foundation for low flow simulation according to eqs 2 and 3 the sliding value is related to eq 3 and the apen value is related to eq 2 there is a one to one correspondence between the sliding value vl and the apen value vi of low flow in eq 3 therefore in theory as long as the sliding apen value of the low flow is known a trial algorithm can be used to inversely calculate the apen value of low flow in terms of eq 3 from eq 2 we can see that the distance d x i x j between x i and x j is an absolute value there should not be a one to one correspondence between the apen value of low flow and u i of the low flow sequence u 1 u 2 u i it should be a apen value corresponding to several values of u i that is to say when we add an unknown value x that is greater than zero and less than the low flow threshold to the end of the known sequence we get an apen x value when x is inversely calculated from this apen x value we may get multiple x values accordingly combining the m 2 low flow values before and after u i genetic algorithm or it hybrid algorithm li and wei 2008 can be used to determine the best fitting x value namely low flow value it suggests a valuable direction for low flow simulation from another aspect which is an important value and contribution of this study in the field of low flow simulation however how to derive the specific low flow value needs further research in the future 4 3 applicability of the proposed method although the results and conclusions of this study are based on an example in the yellow river basin china the method proposed in this study overcomes the different preferences of different researchers for choosing the value of k which in itself is an improvement and a relatively significant contribution the optimization method proposed in the present study is based on data driven data sequences dependence rather than region driven specific regions independence theoretically the method of the present study can be applied to other regions with similar hydrological conditions and similar study designs as pointed by laaha and blöschl 2006 for those regions with different hydrological conditions and study design the method of this study should be also applicable because it is based on data driven when the method is used in other different watersheds several steps need to be followed firstly determine the optimal k and t values of the api according to the process in fig 3 and the method in section 2 of the present study secondly based on the method in section 2 10 refer to the specific treatment in section 3 4 to find the optimal pair between low flow and api or their substitute indicators so as to realize low flow simulation finally certainly the results or conclusions obtained based on the optimal standard are probably different due to different data in other different watersheds in areas with similar or different conditions due to the different antecedent soil moisture conditions the runoff generation and convergence process of the watershed may be different dingman 2015 and the same precipitation conditions may result in different runoff bennett et al 2018 this probably make the optimal pair not be the sliding apen of low flow yopt and the sliding api xopt and the optimal functions not be the power or logarithmic function between yopt and xopt listed in tables 2 and 3 on the other hand since the apen method in section 2 5 has two parameters m and r that need to be set in the present study we take the traditional approach to determine these two parameters as m 2 and r 0 1 0 25 times the sd of the time series our purpose in doing this is to fix the influence of m and r on the results of present study to make it easier to analyze the influence of the value of k although we have proved that the m and r obtained by the traditional approach may not be optimal li et al 2017 therefore the fixed value of m and r may have certain uncertainty which adds certain difficulties to the low flow simulation based on the new method of present study in future we can introduce the concept of risk and carry out risk based low flow simulations which is worth considering because the apen method has requirements for the amount of data not 100 chou 2014 li et al 2017 if the amount of data in a study area is too small the calculation results may not be accurate therefore before applying the method of this study sufficient data should be collected as much as possible also before adopting which optimal function to use e g the power function in tables 2 and 3 it is necessary to conduct a comparative analysis of various schemes according to specific problems because the characteristic response of a given drainage basin depends strongly on antecedent conditions heggen 2001 dingman 2015 the main factor influencing low flow lf in this study is api in addition to api if there are other factors such as potential evapotranspiration that have an important impact on lf the effects of all factors on lf can be considered together through the principle of water balance suppose the n factors that have important influence on lf are xi i 1 2 n and their effect functions with lf are fi xi respectively then lf f a p i i 1 n f i x i all variables in the formula are the values after dedimensionalization therefore lf i 1 n f i x i f a p i can be obtained after transformation so that the method of this study can be used for analysis 5 conclusions the nature of low flow is complex and its study presents a challenge in the research on hydrological systems the complexity of low flow is a key feature of low flow characteristics which can be applied to the analyses of low flow variations to identify the factors influencing low flow and to simulate low flow itself in this study antecedent precipitation ap is considered as an important factor influencing the low flow and expressed by the ap index api according to the performance of api s decay constant k based on correlation analysis moving average and entropy approximate entropy apen two hypotheses of k are proposed and tested one typical area jinghe river basin of the yellow river basin is used as the study area the naturalized daily runoff at the zhangjiashan station in the jinghe river basin from 1933 to 2013 and the daily precipitation in the basin over 1956 2013 are employed several conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the decay constant k in the api has the properties of optimality and multivaluedness hypothesis 1 and 2 the optimal k value kopt is not a fixed value but between 0 906 and 0 957 not 0 80 0 98 as traditionally believed this study puts forward an optimal standard to determine k which solves the shortcomings of the arbitrary and empirical selection of k it is a contribution of this study also api changes have a stable antecedent day t 0 so that when t t 0 the api remains unchanged furthermore the change of api also has the property of optimal t topt when t t 0 so that the kopt scenario is optimal at topt the emergence of optimality and multivaluedness of api is an objective existence which is related to the nature of runoff generation and soil moisture content of watersheds in the antecedent days the findings of two properties of api and the verification of two hypotheses have academic value which is another contribution of this study 2 ap and low flow that are not significant in the current day can become significant after being processed by the sliding average and apen p 0 01 but the properties of ap and low flow are not changed the best of the four pairs of low flow and api is determined by using four error indicators nmae rmse nse and ioa based on the optimal pair kopt scenario and topt this study uses the sliding api from 2010 to 2013 to simulate the sliding apen of low flow during the same period with high simulation accuracy the idea of the method for low flow simulation is the third contribution of this study however how to derive the low flow value based on the calculation formula of apen remains to be further studied in the future 3 the method proposed in this study can also be applied to areas outside the present study because the method is data sequences dependent but not the specific regions dependent it is necessary to collect data as much as possible before using the method of present study to carry out the studies of low flow and ap because the apen has requirements for the amount of data the optimal function form used in low flow simulation should be determined in advance through comparison credit authorship contribution statement xungui li writing
