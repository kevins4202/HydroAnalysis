18750,a simple balancing method using passive samplers over a week s period has been developed and tested successfully to determine elimination rates of 22 common micropollutants of household and industrial sources in 18 full scale wastewater treatment plants of different design and performance independent reactor tests to delineate elimination rates with native sludge of the treatment plants correlated very well with the full scale elimination rate determinations as opposed to common assumptions this large dataset indicated that shorter sludge retention times read higher active biomass showed higher micropollutant elimination rates in many cases multivariate statistical analysis of the elimination rates over the 18 treatment plants was able to group compounds according to common degradation pathways and showed that sensitivity to srt drove the grouping the dataset also allowed to determine population equivalent normalized loads of the investigated micropollutants the application of wwtp balancing with passive sampling makes it relatively easy to gather elimination rates and inlet loads on a much broader basis than before and gives orientation for more in depth analysis of degradation pathways graphical abstract image 1 keywords pocis micropollutants srt hrt respirometry metabolic pathways 1 introduction organic micropollutants mp that are released by wastewater treatment plants wwtp have been in the focus of research for more than a decade now and a consensus seems to have been reached that additional treatment steps are needed to lower emissions to surface waters biological treatment has been deemed insufficient to reach the often high removal efficiencies needed for recalcitrant compounds falas et al 2016 ozonation and adsorption to activated carbon are the currently favored techniques of high yield mp removal and some countries like switzerland have decided to implement these techniques on a national scale eggen et al 2014 the upgrading of wwtps is nevertheless a consistent invest and needs prioritization according to criteria that ideally reflect the local immission situation while the swiss invoke thresholds for upgrading that are based on relative rough wwtp size and receiving water sensitivity criteria more differentiated approaches based on risk assessment with in stream water quality models are available ort et al 2009 kehrein et al 2015 although successful simulations have been documented alder et al 2010 these models need however to be fed with consistent data on mp loads arriving at the wwtp as well as the removal efficiency of treatment plants the quantification of mp loads at wwtp inlets require highly time resolved monitoring schemes to be accurate ort et al 2010 and reliable data is therefore very scarce inlet loads are hence often estimated from consumption data and population density with metabolic excretion factors for human pharmaceuticals singer et al 2016 this data is however stricken with high uncertainty because of variabilities in regional and seasonal use as well as unknown demographic influences stamm et al 2008 removal efficiencies for mp in biological treatment are equally uncertain and not well understood a circumstance that is largely due to biased full scale treatment plant mass balances majewsky et al 2013 published reviews on mp elimination are largely based on direct daily inlet outlet comparisons which are potentially biased and consequently show extremely large variabilities verlicchi et al 2012 although reactor studies with activated sludge explored some of the drivers and pathways of mp removal men et al 2017 and prediction models for mp removal in wwtps are available lautz et al 2017 reliable data to feed these models could only be gathered in laboratory experiments with a very limited array of conditions sludge origin artificial wastewater and are incapable of covering the variety of conditions in real life wwtps decision support by such models gains in uncertainty in ecologically important and sensitive small or headwater catchments where local specificities can produce strong outliers hence there is a need for locally relevant and accurate data we recently introduced and validated a sampling scheme that respects the distribution of residence times in wastewater treatment plants and is hence able to match in and outflowing water volumes accurately for micropollutant balancing majewsky et al 2011b 2013 the approach has since been adopted by other working groups to calibrate wastewater treatment models for micropollutant fate rodayan et al 2014 baalbaki et al 2017a 2017b the technique is nevertheless cumbersome since it requires prior investigation of flow and mixing regime as well as a relative elaborate autosampler campaign it is therefore hardly applicable on a larger number of sites when commissioned to investigate the performance of 18 wwtps in micropollutant elimination and their emission profile by the luxembourgish water administration the team had to resort to a more pragmatic method passive samplers would intuitively fulfil the requirements of representative sampling over extended periods and have already been successfully applied in epidemiological wastewater monitoring of drugs harman et al 2011 baz lomba et al 2017 in a recent study passive samplers also proved to yield accurate time weighted average concentrations under fluctuating concentrations in sewers and surface waters mutzner et al 2019 in order to yield time weighted average concentrations passive samplers need to be calibrated which is especially difficult in the highly variable wwtp inlets ort et al 2010 moreover it is not clear whether the membranes of passive samplers will not be clogged in the organic rich wastewaters after a relative short time to solve this the team elaborated a relative simple hypothesis which relied on the measurement of reference compounds like carbamazepine or lidocaine which are known to be completely recalcitrant in activated sludge treatment majewsky et al 2013 carbamazepine has been proposed as a recalcitrant anthropogenic marker before clara et al 2004 and suits a benchmarking approach to evaluate persistence mclachlan et al 2017 the rationale is if the sampling rate is depending on the hydraulic conditions and the clogging of the membranes in the respective in and outlet measurement points i e a purely physical phenomenon then all compounds should behave proportionally to the recalcitrant reference compounds under conditions of identical flow and clogging the collected mass for the recalcitrant compounds should be identical in the in and outlet the mass ratio of in and outlet would then be 1 deviations of this ratio therefore illustrate different sampling conditions and can be directly used to correct the masses of the biodegradable compounds and lead straight to the elimination value without load calculation based on the knowledge that mp concentration variability in the outlet of treatment plants is very restricted aymerich et al 2017 majewsky et al 2013 the calibration of the outlet sampling rate can be achieved with very few grab samples the outlet mass load of a compound can consequently be used to determine the inlet load by applying the inverse of the elimination determined earlier on incoming mass loads are hence quantifiable without cumbersome calibration of the passive samplers at the inlet the scheme could be potentially biased in cases where flow proportional sampling would significantly deviate from time proportional sampling in treatment plant inlets however according to our experience at inlets of larger treatment plants with extended sewer networks discharge variability is much smaller than concentration variability and is rarely correlated bias is only expected if higher discharge substantially mobilizes or dilutes compounds the present article shows the application of this monitoring principle to 18 treatment plants and uses laboratory reactor experiments with native activated sludge to validate the full scale determined elimination rates prior to the campaign an extensive investigation on the evolution of the sampling rates under inlet and outlet conditions in a wwtp have been conducted over a week the chosen exposure period for a campaign this article is able to present for the first time a large dataset of elimination rates in full scale wwtps that has been established with a common representative sampling scheme and reveals upon further scrutiny with statistical analysis a wealth of phenomenological information to guide further investigations 2 materials and methods 2 1 passive samplers and analytics the passive samplers used were pocis polar organic compound integrative sampler each disk contained 200 mg of oasis hlb adsorbent between two pes membrane sheets three pocis disks where exposed in the small est lab holders after exposure of one week the oasis hlb powder was recovered and filled into 5 ml spe columns and covered with a frit the recovered powder was weighted to compensate for losses on transfer columns were dried under vacuum and subsequently extracted twice with 50 50 solvent solution of dichlormethane and acetonitrile solvent was reduced to dryness after internal standard addition and taken up in 50 50 acetonitrile water for analysis on lc ms ms internal standards were available for Â¾ of the compounds and served to compensate for matrix effects and handling losses quantification was calibrated on internal standards grab samples as well as the time series from the reactor experiments were analyzed directly from the filtered water sample with an online concentration technique the target analytes

compounds allowing only for the calculation of elimination rates but not of incoming loads reactor tests did not feature these compounds either 2 2 preliminary clogging test in the former studies 3 days of inlet mass flow were balanced against 1 day in the outlet to achieve over 80 matching of the sampled volumes due to the mixing regime in the plant majewsky et al 2011b 2013 with the passive samplers the hypothesis was that comparing a period of 1 week at in and outlet would yield a balance of a comparable sampled volume volumes from the inlet outside the window that is recovered in the outlet are expected to be minor over such a large period due to the quality differences in terms of doc and suspended matter in the in and outlet it was expected that sampling rates would differ i e would be inferior at the inlet because of superior clogging the verification if the sampling rate covered the full weekly period and that distortions in the representativeness of the different days would be acceptable was equally important for this purpose a pre test has been run on the petange wwtp 60 000 pe with the exposure of pocis for 1 3 5 and 7 days within a week in the in and outlet in parallel autosamplers took daily composite samples with a 20 min subsampling frequency every day sampling rates with increasing time of exposure could then be calculated by comparing the average concentrations from autosampler samples to pocis masses the inlet was sampled after the primary settler and the outlet after the secondary clarifier both sites had sufficient flow velocity to guarantee decent sampling rates 2 3 large scale sampling campaign 2 3 1 criteria for treatment plant selection luxembourg counts over 80 wwtps featuring activated sludge process the majority has a capacity between 1000 pe and 10 000 pe to produce a certain validity in the dataset is was important to cover a large spectrum of wwtp characteristics the following criteria were applied on the average of monitoring data from 2015 and led to the selection of wwtps in table 1 removal efficiency of the general monitored parameters defining the water quality i e cod bod5 total nitrogen ammonia total phosphorus utilization capacity the actual number of connected pes calculated by the bod5 load assuming that 1 pe 60 gbod5d 1 was compared with the treatment capacity of the plants cod bod 5 ratio the ratio of the influent provides first indices about the biodegradability of the wastewater cod bod5 2 refers to good biodegradability while the ratio in the effluent vaguely points to the biological treatment efficiency in case of relatively high effluent concentrations as well as the fraction of inert dissolved cod cod bod5 2 9 indicates insufficient aeration or small biomass activity cod bod5 10 indicates non settable and or hardly degradable substances luh 2012 specific influent flow was estimated by the dry weather flow assuming that the 25 quantile of the flow data corresponds to dry weather conditions and the normalization with the connected pes assuming that 1 pe 60 gbod5d 1 as indication for infiltration in sewers and therefore dilution of the influent hrt the hydraulic retention time is essential for the elimination of organic matter including micropollutants to a certain extend as well as nitrogen from wastewater it is further affecting the food biomass ratio and therefore the biomass activity srt the retention time of biomass is primarily sensitive to ammonium oxidizers since they grow considerably slower than heterotrophic bacteria this parameter is related to hrt and has an impact on the biomass activity 2 3 2 sampling design and calculation methods the sampling scheme allowed for 6 treatment plants to be sampled twice over a period of 1 week in 14 days the bottleneck was the respirometric and micropollutant degradation tests which could be conducted on 2 activated sludges 2 replicates in one week the campaign consisted of 3 site visits for passive sampler installation and exchange as well as grab sampling in the in and outlet of the plant on each visit grab samples 500 ml were taken which served for calibration effluent or plausibility check influent of the passive sampler signal in addition 8 l of activated sludge from each wwtp were sampled and taken to the laboratory for respirometric and micropollutant degradation experiments depending on the onsite conditions the sampling locations differed from spillways of settling tanks over effluent channels of grit chambers to direct implementation into clarifiers sump and effluent shafts the flow velocity should not exceed a certain range since strong hydraulic forces can damage the membrane of the pocis and cause the loss of sorbent the elimination for each compound was calculated by normalizing flow and clogging influences through the ratio of the recalcitrant reference compound carbamazepine or lidocaine 1 e l i m i n a t i o n 1 c o m p o u n d m a s s o u t l e t

regression of passive sampler masses against the 2 grab samples taken at the beginning and the end of each exposure equation 2 yielding one sampling rate for all sites the assumption is that the low variability at the outlet allows to take two grab samples to be representative of the average concentration over the sampling period 2 g s c o n c a b p s m a s s 3 t w a c o n c p s m a s s r s t 4 r

by the dimension of the biological tank and the weekly average flow rate the srt was determined by the quotient of the mass of mlss mixed liquor suspended solids in the biological tank and the load of total solids in the waste sludge the load of total solids leaving the reactor via the secondary clarifier was estimated being 3 and hence neglected 2 3 3 laboratory reactor experiments laboratory reactor experiments with native activated sludges from the different treatment plants were conducted to determine elimination rates for the mp under controlled conditions in order to validate the elimination rates derived by the passive sampler approach in addition the reactors served to do respirometric tests for biomass characterization four equal reactors each of it 4 l in volume were used for the laboratory tests while always two reactors were operated with the same activated sludge as duplicate the reactors were continuously stirred kept at 22 c and a ph 7 0 25 an in house software labview national instruments usa and hardware application ensured the constant ph by adding base naoh 0 5 n or acid h2so4 0 5 n if necessary into the reactors the main task of the operation module however was to control the do the latter was realized by an on off aeration control with a minimum do concentration of 3 mg l 1 and maximum of 6 mg l 1 the relatively high do concentration was necessary to accurately monitor oxygen uptake rate during the respirometer tests following the spiking of substrate and to prevent oxygen limitation due to the system hysteresis the timing of the bench tests was as follows day 1 sampling of 16 l activated sludge 2 wwtps each of it 8 l and starting of bench scale reactors day 2 respirometer test activity of heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass day 4 xenobiotic spike test 2 3 4 respirometric measurements respirometric measurements were performed to determine the active biomass in the sludge and hence relate operational plant parameters hrt srt to the condition of the sludge the activated sludge was aerated around 20 h until the endogenous respiration was reached the autotrophic maximum respiration was achieved by adding 10 mg l 1 reactor volume ammonium into the reactor the maximum heterotrophic respiration was attained by dosing 100 mg l 1 reactor volume acetate into the reactor the amount of both spikes was designed to cover about 2 h of maximum respiration prior the acetate spike allylthiourea atu was added to inhibit the ammonium and nitrite respiration atu is a selective complexing agent which reacts with copper the co factor of the ammonium oxygenase bacteria maximum respiration activity equations 5 and 6 i e when substrate is not limited was determined by the activated sludge model no 1 henze et al 2000 using the optimizer function in gps x hydromantis ess inc canada while the heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass concentration was determined from the baseline i e the endogenous respiration and the yield

biomass activity the amount was calculated individually based on the our peak of the respirometer test this was done about 1 h before the xenobiotics were spiked with a concentration of 10 Î¼g l 1 reactor volume into the reactors volume of the spike solution 10 ml in certain intervals samples 30 ml each were taken over 7 h at t 3 min 30 min 1 h 1 5 h 2 h 3 h 5 h 7 h subsequently the samples were centrifuged 4200 rpm filtered 0 45 Î¼m and stored at 20 c until the analysis with lc ms ms it was assumed that the degradation mechanism in the reactors is subject to pseudo first order kinetic while the elimination during the first two measurement points 3 min and 30 min is mainly governed by sorption hence the rate constant of the biological degradation kbiol with the criterion p 0 05 was

analysis i e the used wards algorithm based on correlation furthermore data of the compounds elimination rates has been examined by means of artificial neural networks ann using the kohonen learning algorithm kohonen 1982 this treatment allows to fill in an incomplete matrix with the best guess and to apply pca to a complete data matrix the ann initialized in a small set of random numbers is trained in an iterative way each site is assigned to the so called best matching unit bmu the cell whose virtual vector has the minimum euclidean distance with the real vector principal component analysis pca was used on the data matrix of the compounds elimination rates completed with bmus in order to identify relevant elimination rates patterns that account for differences between treatment plants the ann and pca used in this study were programmed with matlab r2017a 3 results 3 1 preliminary clogging test the test was targeted at investigating the decreasing sampling rate over time and its difference in treatment plant in and outlets the results can be inspected in fig 1 which shows how the data has been fitted by an exponential equation to calculate contributions in mass by succeeding days in the following carbamazepine and lidocaine showed a substantial decrease in sampling rates of roughly 80 over a weekly period in the inlet diclofenac started at a lower sampling rate and declined more slowly although sampling rates were high in the first days weekly averages met expected levels known from exposures in rivers with similar setups moschet et al 2015 sampling rates were mostly higher at the outlet than at the inlet and decreased less rapidly the slower decrease is probably due to less clogging of the membrane while the absolute higher level of sampling rates also depends on the flow velocity in the outlet which was relatively high the comparison of the collected mass for each day at the inlet reveals that the early days were overrepresented with contributions of over 20 while towards the end of the exposure period the contribution dropped below 10 note that if sampling rates remained stable over the whole week daily contributions would yield 14 this tendency was less pronounced for the outlet potential concentration outliers at the inlet during one day are most critical towards the end of the exposure where they might because of hydraulic reasons not be fully captured at the outlet and hence distort the elimination rate thanks to the decreasing sampling rate a two fold outlier would only yield a 6 increase in collected mass while a 5 fold outlier would provide a 23 gain the sampling scheme is therefore pretty robust since larger deviations are only occasionally expected for industrial chemicals 3 2 consistence of reference compound recovery the calculation of the elimination of micropollutants is based on circumventing direct load comparison because calibrating sampling rates in the inlet is a desperate endeavor due to the high variability of concentrations the hypothesis is that for recalcitrant compounds with zero elimination like carbamazepine and lidocaine differences in collected mass at the in and outlet are entirely governed by physical factors influencing sampling rates such as flow velocity and clogging of the membrane and independent of the compound hence the ratio of inlet to outlet mass should be identical for both compounds if this scheme is accurate carbamazepine and lidocaine ratios should be close to a 1 1 line when plotted against each other fig 2 shows with the ratios for both compounds from all 36 samplings that this condition is largely met with a few exceptions ratios are expected to be lower than 1 since the influent is expected to have lower sampling rates but opposite cases also exist in fact outlets of treatment plants were often too small or with too low water levels to host the passive sampler cages and these were then installed in the clarifier in quiet flow conditions in these cases the masses collected at the inlet exceeded those of the outlet in the few cases where ratios did not match one can observe that lidocaine yields more stable ratios than carbamazepine upon the weekly repeats in such cases lidocaine has been used as a correction factor for the reactive compounds 3 3 calculated full scale vs reactor experiment elimination rates fig 3 depicts the distributions of daily elimination rates that have been derived directly from passive sampler masses as box plots they are displayed in increasing order of the medians and are classified according to joss et al 2006 one needs to keep in mind that these are removal rates per day and that the actual elimination at the specific plant is dependent on the hrt which ranges from 2 to 50 h for the different plants table 1 it is noticeable that especially in the class with poor elimination the method also yielded negative values despite the correction by the reference compound in practice this would mean that the mass collected at the outlet is higher than at the inlet note that residence time distribution based balancing as exemplified in majewsky et al 2013 also yielded standard errors in elimination that were negative for carbamazepine analytical uncertainty of 10 20 can easily yield negative elimination for compounds that are hardly eliminated another passive sampler specific reason might be related to competitive sorption to the passive sampler oasis hlb is a mixed polymer featuring hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties which entails more specific interaction and hence potential competition for sites knowing that at the inlet competition by macrosubstrates and other micropollutants is much bigger than at the outlet this might produce higher masses in the outlet passive sampler although the concentration in water is essentially the same this would be compound specific and only visible for more recalcitrant compounds no negatives for degradables note that the method yielded several strong outliers that are not shown and probably due to analytical matrix effects they were excluded from the following multivariate statistical analysis the full box plots including outlier statisitcs are shown supplementary material s2 however elimination rates that have been determined with native sludges in the reactor experiments in the laboratory to verify the passive sampler approach showed good agreement with the full scale elimination rates fig 4 this can be considered as a validation as the reactor elimination rates have been determined under defined conditions nine out of twelve compounds investigated in reactor tests could be used for validation and coefficients of determination r2 varied between 0 54 ketoprofen diclofenac and 0 97 atenolol deet due to the relative short duration of the bench experiment 7 h very recalcitrant compounds have a higher uncertainty and less elimination rates could be fitted with confidence see detailed curves in supplementary material s3 s4 bias in passive sampler derived elimination rates due to lack of flow proportional sampling does not seem to be the rule in the treatment plants monitored as expected carbamazepine and lidocaine showed no decrease in concentration beyond analytical uncertainty in the reactor experiments and could not be used for validation as did propranolol but for reasons of analytical precision in the reactor tests supplementary material s3 sorption as shown by elimination kinetics in the reactor as well as calculations from experimental data played a negligible role except for triclosan pfos and pfoa arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 elimination rates are comparable to references in the literature that gained the data in reactor experiments with activated sludges joss et al 2006 or followed the distributed residence time protocol baalbaki et al 2017a 2017b comparison with other data such as the ones compiled by verlicchi et al 2012 are futile since they show extremely large ranges of removal and are potentially biased because they rely mostly on direct subtraction of 24 h composite samples majewsky et al 2011b 2013 however the data gathered here also show that there is substantial genuine variability in elimination performance of micropollutants among biological treatment plants note that for the perfluorated compounds doubt has been raised that sampling for pfos is in the kinetic mode since half time to equilibrium is only 2 4 days kaserzon et al 2012 this could potentially bias the calculated elimination for pfos if concentration variabilities occurred later in the exposure 3 4 treatment plant operational parameters and micropollutant elimination one of the goals of the project was to investigate if the design of the plant and operational parameters are able to influence the micropollutant elimination capacity removal efficiency of classical pollution utilization capacity and bod cod ratios could not explain any variations in micropollutant elimination between treatment plants table 1 has documented the array of hydraulic 2 50 h on average and sludge retention times 3 206 d that have been calculated for the monitored plants one would expect mp concentration to decrease exponentially with hydraulic retention time following a first order decay considering the elimination median for all compounds we found a logarithmic increase to a plateau that was reached beyond a hrt of about 20 h hrt vs elimination plots in the supplementary materials section s5 fast degraders like ibuprofen bisphenol a or estrone reached plateaus of full elimination even earlier while the medium elimination rates of compounds like atenolol deet and terbutryn showed a plateau after 30 40 h residence time it might be tempting to suggest designing treatment plants with higher hrts to allow for a more complete elimination of certain compounds although it also has to be kept in mind that higher hrt at constant bod load will yield lower food biomass ratios and hence low microbial activity classical design of wwtps featuring nitrogen removal necessarily requires hrts between 15 h and 20 h if the treatment plant is designed with aerobic sludge treatment an hrt between 30 h and 40 h results triclosan is a special case which shows full elimination with no relation to hrt its elimination is known to be governed by sorption to sludge particles baalbaki et al 2016 the dominant elimination process for all other compounds showing logarithmic increase in the hrt vs elimination plots is therefore expected to be biological degradation sludge retention time had been proposed as a key design parameter fostering micropollutant elimination with a narrative linking sludge age to microbiological diversity and enhanced biodegradation capacities clara et al 2005 in our investigation we could not find any significant positive correlation between srt and elimination rates table 2 on the contrary for many compounds smaller sludge ages showed higher elimination rates and significant negative regressions between srt and elimination rate fig 5 all plots in supplementary material s6 this is especially true for the fast degraders bisphenol a ibuprofen and estrone but also for compounds like tcpp atenolol and bezafibrate triclosan and the polyfluorinated compounds that are primarily eliminated through sorption on the sludge also showed a significant negative correlation with srt faster renewal of sludge increased the sorption capacity in these plants we can explain our findings with the respirometer data that confirmed the expected negative correlation between heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass activity and the srt i e the higher the srt the lower biomass activity expressed as maximum respiration max our data not shown or biomass growth rate in fig 6 the srt is basically defined by the sludge loading rate slr which indicates the food to biomass ratio f m of the reactor small f m ratios result in long srts and low biomass activity the correlations between microbial activity as sour and elimination rates are shown in fig 19 si 6 and were well aligned for autotrophs and heterotrophs the results confirm the outcomes of majewsky et al 2011a who also found such a trend whereas for different compounds the authors proposed faster degradation for paracetamol caffeine sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac under the presence of high numbers of heterotrophs and a low srt biofilm treatments as compared to conventional activated sludge systems are considered to feature very long srts and yet high performance the biofilm wwtps beggen plant 18 and hesperange plant 12 showed very efficient xenobiotic elimination a srt about 47 d was estimated of the hesperange wwtp while the srt of the beggen wwtp was unknown since no biomass data were available the long biomass retention time of the biofilm processes is assumed to foster slowly growing species protected in the biofilm stratification the latter could lead to a higher diversity of the microbial community kwon et al 2010 cortes lorenzo et al 2014 whose capability in the metabolization of a variety of substrate potentially outperforms the one of activated sludge falas et al 2012 hapeshi et al 2013 casas et al 2015 the narrative proposed by clara et al 2005 heralding higher mp elimination with higher srt has been challenged recently on the assumption that higher microbial diversity is linked to higher sludge age falas et al 2016 johnson et al 2015 the work of clara et al counts several hundred citations but very few attempted to replicate the theory the authors investigated 5 wwtps and 4 activated sludges from lab scale experiments with srts between 0 6 d and 550 d most of the investigated compounds e g ibuprofen bezafibrate estrogens and bisphenol a showed a high increase in elimination between the srt of 2 d and 10 d for srts larger than 10 d though the data from clara et al indicate no significant change in elimination similar results were recently reported by achermann et al 2018 who investigated the influence of sludge ages between 3 and 15 days that were generated in laboratory reactors a large array of compounds that are subject to oxidative transformation showed increased kbiols when srts increased from 3 to 10 days however weak or negative relations to srt were observed for compounds that undergo substitution type transformation reactions srts below 10 d are rather uncommon the german wwtp design guideline dwa a131 2000 proposes 10 d as the minimum srt for digestion plants when designing a plant 100 000 pe featuring nitrogen removal our data suggest that active biomass as inversely related to srt influences elimination rates way beyond 10 d retention time 3 5 multivariate analysis of elimination rates wwtp sampling with passive samplers yielded a substantial data matrix of elimination rates for 22 compounds over 18 plants and two repeats per site which gave the opportunity for further multivariate statistical exploration on one hand the covariation of elimination rates can identify compounds whose degradation depends on the presence of similar microbial consortia or even similar degradation pathways on the other hand the analysis can be applied to identify similarities between sites in terms of degradation and the link to their design and operational parameters in both cases we opted for a hierarchical cluster analysis following wards algorithm the dendrogram for the compound approach can be inspected in fig 7 and the allocation to groups is reported above the box plots of fig 3 the results give interesting insights to potential degradation pathways it classified for instance the fast degraders in group 4 and also managed to group structurally similar compounds like the phenylureas diuron and isoproturon or the fluorosurfactants pfos and pfoa for instance diclofenac as a relatively recalcitrant compound found itself in cluster 1 which was otherwise regrouping compounds with medium elimination rates note also that within the beta blockers propranolol was associated with cluster 3 while the structurally more similar atenolol and metoprolol were regrouped in cluster 1 while this is very interesting the question is if independent research can substantiate this clustering degradation pathway elucidation for micropollutants under environmentally realistic conditions has only recently made progress thanks to the advent of non target high resolution mass spectrometry for polar compounds pico and barcelo 2015 the approach attempts to reconstruct degradation pathways via the structural identification of stable intermediate transformation products however the experimental evidence is yet too eclectic for a systematic evaluation of the results of our cluster analysis prediction tools for biodegradation pathways like the eawag pps are able to generate the most probable transformation reactions based on biotransformation rules and starting from the compound s structural features gao et al 2011 there are limits to this approach since the biotransformation rules are valid for functional groups without consideration of the surrounding structural moieties gulde et al 2016 they also stem from pure culture assays where the compound was the sole substrate which does not reflect the environmental reality where micropollutants may be co metabolically transformed fischer and majewsky 2014 degradation pathways were generated for each of the investigated compounds in the online eawag pps system and the likely and neutral transformation rules were tabulated as well as similar rules supplementary materials s7 compounds belonging to clusters 3 and 4 showed a great variety of probable transformation rules with little in common cluster 1 regrouped compounds featuring primary amine betablockers or amides deet that have dealkylation as common degradation rules bt0063 bt0243 while triazoles diclofenac and ketoprofen shared dioxygenation as major rules bt0005 bt0065 bt0353 a recent study on the transformation of diclofenac in a hybrid biofilm jewell et al 2016 showed that the pathways that could be identified in this extensive work through traceable transformation products diverged largely from the pps prediction dioxygenations were not reported main initial steps were amidation dcf lactam and mono oxygenation our statistical analysis seems to indicate that the hybrid biofilm in that study that is known to have a better performance on diclofenac degradation might not be representative of common activated sludge degradation pathways for diclofenac since deoxygenation is common to the cluster delineated here cluster 2 featuring the phenylureas isoproturon and diuron as well as bezafibrate and lidocaine share pps transformation rules attacking amides amines to form carbamates and carboxylates as products bt0067 bt0068 bt0243 cluster analysis of elimination rates thus seems to be able to produce meaningful hints on common transformation pathways or conditions in treatment plants the clustering of treatment plants over the elimination rates of all the compounds is also a good consistence test as the dendrogram in the supplementary materials s8 shows 7 out of 10 of the weekly repeats on the single treatment plants are closely clustered this confirms that the sampling method and the derived elimination rates are reproducible even though in some cases weather conditions were variable between the repeats differences in discharges in a second step it is interesting to analyze if plant operation has an influence on the clustering of the plants according to similarities in elimination patterns when plotted against sludge retention times the clusters spread over relatively large ranges with overlaps fig 8 cluster 1 spanned the low srts from 5 to 40 days while cluster 4 ranged from 15 to 45 days cluster 3 comprised treatment plants with a narrower array of higher srt 30 50 days while cluster two singled out one plant note that median elimination rate of all the compounds is affected neither by srt nor affiliation to a cluster a principal component analysis had been conducted with the aim to identify the compounds that drive the clustering of the treatment plants by generation of an ordination biplot between plants and compounds fig 9 the majority of the treatment plants were gathered within progressive negative scores of both axis except a few plants on the same diagonal on the positive score side pca analysis showed two main sources of variance horizontal axis that explains about 70 of the variance was mainly driven by elimination rates of the compounds in cluster 4 which featured the highest elimination rates and the widest range as well as negative correlation to srt cluster 1 by contrast was not showing any clear trend and was gathered closer around the central axes the vertical axis explains about 22 of variance where cluster 2 occupied the orthogonal position and would hence show the compounds that were independent of sludge age and operational parameters for a critical compound like diclofenac which is featured on the european priority substances watch list our analysis indicates that it is rather insensitive to operational parameters cluster one and orthogonal position to the classification drivers it is however questionable if simple interpretation schemes such as sludge retention time are suited to fully explain the rather complex degradation patterns and the involved microbial consortia it is equally probable that macro substrate composition or the detoxification of potential stressors influences the elimination capabilities of the microbial consortia fischer and majewsky 2014 note also that clustering of treatment plants performed here is influenced by the array of compounds that are considered for the analysis and might change with the list of analysed compounds 3 6 determination of sampling rates at the outlet and inlet per capita loads finally the variability of the incoming loads per capita were investigated for the campaign note that all investigated compounds can be allocated to consumer or household good emissions although for some like triazoles or biocides not exclusively and therefore a normalization to population equivalents is legitimate the monitored treatment plants are dominated by domestic wastewaters with varying contributions of small and medium enterprises load calculation implied first determining the sampling rates at the outlet although noticeable variability of flow conditions existed in the individual outlets it was decided in a first step to determine an average sampling rate rs over all treatment plants via a regression analyzing the relationship between collected mass and grab sample concentrations the slope of the linear regression would then serve to determine rs equation 4 in a second step the impact of this simplified calculation on load determination would be evaluated by using individually derived rs for each treatment plant for comparison fig 10 shows such a regression for carbamazepine over all outlets 36 passive sampler masses with 2 grab samples each the coefficient of determination lay between adj r2 0 11 terbutryn and adj r2 0 99 carbamazepine compared to the boxplot of the individually calculated sampling rates the regression rs is close to the median while the interquartile of the boxplots spans approximately a factor of two when both types of rs are used to calculate the specific incoming loads on a population equivalent basis the ranges shown in the boxplots of fig 11 are comparable for carbamazepine and diclofenac in this example it can therefore be concluded that for the sake of load estimation and its uncertainty the regression method yields reliable results individual plants might however deviate due to sampling rate or immission profile specificities the resulting distributions of specific in and outlet loads can be inspected in fig 12 pe normalization was calculated by using the phosphorus load assumption 1 pe Ë 1 8 gd 1 total phosphorus other typical wastewater parameters e g cod correlated also well with xenobiotics of domestic origin however phosphorus is the most closely linked to domestic wastewater and for this reason we may have found the best correlation to conduct the pe normalization see the example of diclofenac in the supplementary materials s9 as expected the specific loads of pharmaceuticals are less variable than for instance those of isoproturon or deet which also have non domestic origins the results agree well with a survey published by singer et al 2016 where a smaller array of 6 treatment plants with varying industrial input were investigated medians found in that study were 165 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for atenolol 188 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for carbamazepine 369 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for diclofenac 31 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for ketoprofen 80 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for lidocaine 135 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for metoprolol 25 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for propranolol and 117 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for sulfamethoxazol the distributions of this study can therefore be used to explore the impact of non monitored plants in catchment simulations 4 conclusions this paper introduced an innovative method to balance micropollutant flows in full scale wastewater treatment plants the use of passive samplers and only a few supportive grab samples makes the effort for a full scale balance affordable and applicable to a large number of plants it allows for routine monitoring in wwtp operation as well as benchmarking by regulators because of its simplicity the approach might raise skepticism about its reliability even more so since it has not been validated by independent full scale plant investigations it is therefore necessary to remind the five essential elements that make the gathered data plausible conservative tracers carbamazepine and lidocaine show an identical behavior which is governed by the environmental conditions of sampling flow velocity clogging elimination rates from full scale passive sampler monitoring and lab scale degradation studies with native sludges agree well although this validation is limited to the medium to fast eliminated compounds because of limited reactor time it shows that the principle works the calculated elimination rates are variable but agree with state of the art values from treatment plant and lab experiments the variability of the elimination rates can furthermore be related to operational parameters srt and predicted degradation pathways cluster analysis eawag pps hence the method is precise enough to identify trends that are stronger than the method s uncertainty monitoring with passive samplers yields repeatable and distinct results over the whole range of compounds for each treatment plant wwtp cluster analysis there were a few unexplained outliers for several compounds which showed random behavior and where the best explanation is analytical problems due to matrix effects hence the passive sampler method as presented here might fail for individual compounds in certain cases although on average they show sound results future applications of the monitoring scheme will show its robustness since the application of the scheme demands little effort and investment partial failures pose a small risk reactor experiments are therefore a good complement to fill the gaps despite the need of advanced treatment processes such as ozonation or activated carbon being necessary to meet the environmental quality standards for certain compounds in receiving waters classical biological treatments need to perform in a stable and optimized manner to avoid jeopardizing advanced treatment operation this needs close surveillance at low costs on one hand but also a better understanding of the governing parameters for micropollutant elimination this endeavor is currently undertaken with systematic exploration of an array of sludge retention times and a wide number of compounds with expected transformation pathways in lab reactor studies achermann et al 2018 these allow to identify common degradation behavior under certain operational conditions and allow to target more in depth enzymatic profiling and molecular biological exploration falas et al 2018 however these intensive investigations will necessarily be limited to case studies with a reduced representativeness and the balancing method presented here when applied on large scale will enable to confirm findings from the detail studies to identify

18750,a simple balancing method using passive samplers over a week s period has been developed and tested successfully to determine elimination rates of 22 common micropollutants of household and industrial sources in 18 full scale wastewater treatment plants of different design and performance independent reactor tests to delineate elimination rates with native sludge of the treatment plants correlated very well with the full scale elimination rate determinations as opposed to common assumptions this large dataset indicated that shorter sludge retention times read higher active biomass showed higher micropollutant elimination rates in many cases multivariate statistical analysis of the elimination rates over the 18 treatment plants was able to group compounds according to common degradation pathways and showed that sensitivity to srt drove the grouping the dataset also allowed to determine population equivalent normalized loads of the investigated micropollutants the application of wwtp balancing with passive sampling makes it relatively easy to gather elimination rates and inlet loads on a much broader basis than before and gives orientation for more in depth analysis of degradation pathways graphical abstract image 1 keywords pocis micropollutants srt hrt respirometry metabolic pathways 1 introduction organic micropollutants mp that are released by wastewater treatment plants wwtp have been in the focus of research for more than a decade now and a consensus seems to have been reached that additional treatment steps are needed to lower emissions to surface waters biological treatment has been deemed insufficient to reach the often high removal efficiencies needed for recalcitrant compounds falas et al 2016 ozonation and adsorption to activated carbon are the currently favored techniques of high yield mp removal and some countries like switzerland have decided to implement these techniques on a national scale eggen et al 2014 the upgrading of wwtps is nevertheless a consistent invest and needs prioritization according to criteria that ideally reflect the local immission situation while the swiss invoke thresholds for upgrading that are based on relative rough wwtp size and receiving water sensitivity criteria more differentiated approaches based on risk assessment with in stream water quality models are available ort et al 2009 kehrein et al 2015 although successful simulations have been documented alder et al 2010 these models need however to be fed with consistent data on mp loads arriving at the wwtp as well as the removal efficiency of treatment plants the quantification of mp loads at wwtp inlets require highly time resolved monitoring schemes to be accurate ort et al 2010 and reliable data is therefore very scarce inlet loads are hence often estimated from consumption data and population density with metabolic excretion factors for human pharmaceuticals singer et al 2016 this data is however stricken with high uncertainty because of variabilities in regional and seasonal use as well as unknown demographic influences stamm et al 2008 removal efficiencies for mp in biological treatment are equally uncertain and not well understood a circumstance that is largely due to biased full scale treatment plant mass balances majewsky et al 2013 published reviews on mp elimination are largely based on direct daily inlet outlet comparisons which are potentially biased and consequently show extremely large variabilities verlicchi et al 2012 although reactor studies with activated sludge explored some of the drivers and pathways of mp removal men et al 2017 and prediction models for mp removal in wwtps are available lautz et al 2017 reliable data to feed these models could only be gathered in laboratory experiments with a very limited array of conditions sludge origin artificial wastewater and are incapable of covering the variety of conditions in real life wwtps decision support by such models gains in uncertainty in ecologically important and sensitive small or headwater catchments where local specificities can produce strong outliers hence there is a need for locally relevant and accurate data we recently introduced and validated a sampling scheme that respects the distribution of residence times in wastewater treatment plants and is hence able to match in and outflowing water volumes accurately for micropollutant balancing majewsky et al 2011b 2013 the approach has since been adopted by other working groups to calibrate wastewater treatment models for micropollutant fate rodayan et al 2014 baalbaki et al 2017a 2017b the technique is nevertheless cumbersome since it requires prior investigation of flow and mixing regime as well as a relative elaborate autosampler campaign it is therefore hardly applicable on a larger number of sites when commissioned to investigate the performance of 18 wwtps in micropollutant elimination and their emission profile by the luxembourgish water administration the team had to resort to a more pragmatic method passive samplers would intuitively fulfil the requirements of representative sampling over extended periods and have already been successfully applied in epidemiological wastewater monitoring of drugs harman et al 2011 baz lomba et al 2017 in a recent study passive samplers also proved to yield accurate time weighted average concentrations under fluctuating concentrations in sewers and surface waters mutzner et al 2019 in order to yield time weighted average concentrations passive samplers need to be calibrated which is especially difficult in the highly variable wwtp inlets ort et al 2010 moreover it is not clear whether the membranes of passive samplers will not be clogged in the organic rich wastewaters after a relative short time to solve this the team elaborated a relative simple hypothesis which relied on the measurement of reference compounds like carbamazepine or lidocaine which are known to be completely recalcitrant in activated sludge treatment majewsky et al 2013 carbamazepine has been proposed as a recalcitrant anthropogenic marker before clara et al 2004 and suits a benchmarking approach to evaluate persistence mclachlan et al 2017 the rationale is if the sampling rate is depending on the hydraulic conditions and the clogging of the membranes in the respective in and outlet measurement points i e a purely physical phenomenon then all compounds should behave proportionally to the recalcitrant reference compounds under conditions of identical flow and clogging the collected mass for the recalcitrant compounds should be identical in the in and outlet the mass ratio of in and outlet would then be 1 deviations of this ratio therefore illustrate different sampling conditions and can be directly used to correct the masses of the biodegradable compounds and lead straight to the elimination value without load calculation based on the knowledge that mp concentration variability in the outlet of treatment plants is very restricted aymerich et al 2017 majewsky et al 2013 the calibration of the outlet sampling rate can be achieved with very few grab samples the outlet mass load of a compound can consequently be used to determine the inlet load by applying the inverse of the elimination determined earlier on incoming mass loads are hence quantifiable without cumbersome calibration of the passive samplers at the inlet the scheme could be potentially biased in cases where flow proportional sampling would significantly deviate from time proportional sampling in treatment plant inlets however according to our experience at inlets of larger treatment plants with extended sewer networks discharge variability is much smaller than concentration variability and is rarely correlated bias is only expected if higher discharge substantially mobilizes or dilutes compounds the present article shows the application of this monitoring principle to 18 treatment plants and uses laboratory reactor experiments with native activated sludge to validate the full scale determined elimination rates prior to the campaign an extensive investigation on the evolution of the sampling rates under inlet and outlet conditions in a wwtp have been conducted over a week the chosen exposure period for a campaign this article is able to present for the first time a large dataset of elimination rates in full scale wwtps that has been established with a common representative sampling scheme and reveals upon further scrutiny with statistical analysis a wealth of phenomenological information to guide further investigations 2 materials and methods 2 1 passive samplers and analytics the passive samplers used were pocis polar organic compound integrative sampler each disk contained 200 mg of oasis hlb adsorbent between two pes membrane sheets three pocis disks where exposed in the small est lab holders after exposure of one week the oasis hlb powder was recovered and filled into 5 ml spe columns and covered with a frit the recovered powder was weighted to compensate for losses on transfer columns were dried under vacuum and subsequently extracted twice with 50 50 solvent solution of dichlormethane and acetonitrile solvent was reduced to dryness after internal standard addition and taken up in 50 50 acetonitrile water for analysis on lc ms ms internal standards were available for Â¾ of the compounds and served to compensate for matrix effects and handling losses quantification was calibrated on internal standards grab samples as well as the time series from the reactor experiments were analyzed directly from the filtered water sample with an online concentration technique the target analytes

compounds allowing only for the calculation of elimination rates but not of incoming loads reactor tests did not feature these compounds either 2 2 preliminary clogging test in the former studies 3 days of inlet mass flow were balanced against 1 day in the outlet to achieve over 80 matching of the sampled volumes due to the mixing regime in the plant majewsky et al 2011b 2013 with the passive samplers the hypothesis was that comparing a period of 1 week at in and outlet would yield a balance of a comparable sampled volume volumes from the inlet outside the window that is recovered in the outlet are expected to be minor over such a large period due to the quality differences in terms of doc and suspended matter in the in and outlet it was expected that sampling rates would differ i e would be inferior at the inlet because of superior clogging the verification if the sampling rate covered the full weekly period and that distortions in the representativeness of the different days would be acceptable was equally important for this purpose a pre test has been run on the petange wwtp 60 000 pe with the exposure of pocis for 1 3 5 and 7 days within a week in the in and outlet in parallel autosamplers took daily composite samples with a 20 min subsampling frequency every day sampling rates with increasing time of exposure could then be calculated by comparing the average concentrations from autosampler samples to pocis masses the inlet was sampled after the primary settler and the outlet after the secondary clarifier both sites had sufficient flow velocity to guarantee decent sampling rates 2 3 large scale sampling campaign 2 3 1 criteria for treatment plant selection luxembourg counts over 80 wwtps featuring activated sludge process the majority has a capacity between 1000 pe and 10 000 pe to produce a certain validity in the dataset is was important to cover a large spectrum of wwtp characteristics the following criteria were applied on the average of monitoring data from 2015 and led to the selection of wwtps in table 1 removal efficiency of the general monitored parameters defining the water quality i e cod bod5 total nitrogen ammonia total phosphorus utilization capacity the actual number of connected pes calculated by the bod5 load assuming that 1 pe 60 gbod5d 1 was compared with the treatment capacity of the plants cod bod 5 ratio the ratio of the influent provides first indices about the biodegradability of the wastewater cod bod5 2 refers to good biodegradability while the ratio in the effluent vaguely points to the biological treatment efficiency in case of relatively high effluent concentrations as well as the fraction of inert dissolved cod cod bod5 2 9 indicates insufficient aeration or small biomass activity cod bod5 10 indicates non settable and or hardly degradable substances luh 2012 specific influent flow was estimated by the dry weather flow assuming that the 25 quantile of the flow data corresponds to dry weather conditions and the normalization with the connected pes assuming that 1 pe 60 gbod5d 1 as indication for infiltration in sewers and therefore dilution of the influent hrt the hydraulic retention time is essential for the elimination of organic matter including micropollutants to a certain extend as well as nitrogen from wastewater it is further affecting the food biomass ratio and therefore the biomass activity srt the retention time of biomass is primarily sensitive to ammonium oxidizers since they grow considerably slower than heterotrophic bacteria this parameter is related to hrt and has an impact on the biomass activity 2 3 2 sampling design and calculation methods the sampling scheme allowed for 6 treatment plants to be sampled twice over a period of 1 week in 14 days the bottleneck was the respirometric and micropollutant degradation tests which could be conducted on 2 activated sludges 2 replicates in one week the campaign consisted of 3 site visits for passive sampler installation and exchange as well as grab sampling in the in and outlet of the plant on each visit grab samples 500 ml were taken which served for calibration effluent or plausibility check influent of the passive sampler signal in addition 8 l of activated sludge from each wwtp were sampled and taken to the laboratory for respirometric and micropollutant degradation experiments depending on the onsite conditions the sampling locations differed from spillways of settling tanks over effluent channels of grit chambers to direct implementation into clarifiers sump and effluent shafts the flow velocity should not exceed a certain range since strong hydraulic forces can damage the membrane of the pocis and cause the loss of sorbent the elimination for each compound was calculated by normalizing flow and clogging influences through the ratio of the recalcitrant reference compound carbamazepine or lidocaine 1 e l i m i n a t i o n 1 c o m p o u n d m a s s o u t l e t

regression of passive sampler masses against the 2 grab samples taken at the beginning and the end of each exposure equation 2 yielding one sampling rate for all sites the assumption is that the low

by the dimension of the biological tank and the weekly average flow rate the srt was determined by the quotient of the mass of mlss mixed liquor suspended solids in the biological tank and the load of total solids in the waste sludge the load of total solids leaving the reactor via the secondary clarifier was estimated being 3 and hence neglected 2 3 3 laboratory reactor experiments laboratory reactor experiments with native activated sludges from the different treatment plants were conducted to determine elimination rates for the mp under controlled conditions in order to validate the elimination rates derived by the passive sampler approach in addition the reactors served to do respirometric tests for biomass characterization four equal reactors each of it 4 l in volume were used for the laboratory tests while always two reactors were operated with the same activated sludge as duplicate the reactors were continuously stirred kept at 22 c and a ph 7 0 25 an in house software labview national instruments usa and hardware application ensured the constant ph by adding base naoh 0 5 n or acid h2so4 0 5 n if necessary into the reactors the main task of the operation module however was to control the do the latter was realized by an on off aeration control with a minimum do concentration of 3 mg l 1 and maximum of 6 mg l 1 the relatively high do concentration was necessary to accurately monitor oxygen uptake rate during the respirometer tests following the spiking of substrate and to prevent oxygen limitation due to the system hysteresis the timing of the bench tests was as follows day 1 sampling of 16 l activated sludge 2 wwtps each of it 8 l and starting of bench scale reactors day 2 respirometer test activity of heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass day 4 xenobiotic spike test 2 3 4 respirometric measurements respirometric measurements were performed to determine the active biomass in the sludge and hence relate operational plant parameters hrt srt to the condition of the sludge the activated sludge was aerated around 20 h until the endogenous respiration was reached the autotrophic maximum respiration was achieved by adding 10 mg l 1 reactor volume ammonium into the reactor the maximum heterotrophic respiration was attained by dosing 100 mg l 1 reactor volume acetate into the reactor the amount of both spikes was designed to cover about 2 h of maximum respiration prior the acetate spike allylthiourea atu was added to inhibit the ammonium and nitrite respiration atu is a selective complexing agent which reacts with copper the co factor of the ammonium oxygenase bacteria maximum respiration activity equations 5 and 6 i e when substrate is not limited was determined by the activated sludge model no 1 henze et al 2000 using the

biomass activity the amount was calculated individually based on the our peak of the respirometer test this was done about 1 h before the xenobiotics were spiked with a concentration of 10 Î¼g l 1 reactor volume into the reactors volume of the spike solution 10 ml in certain intervals samples 30 ml each were taken over 7 h at t 3 min 30 min 1 h 1 5 h 2 h 3 h 5 h 7 h subsequently the samples were centrifuged 4200 rpm filtered 0 45 Î¼m and stored at 20 c until the analysis with lc ms ms it was assumed that the degradation mechanism in the reactors is subject to pseudo first order kinetic

analysis i e the used wards algorithm based on correlation furthermore data of the compounds elimination rates has been examined by means of artificial neural networks ann using the kohonen learning algorithm kohonen 1982 this treatment allows to fill in an incomplete matrix with the best guess and to apply pca to a complete data matrix the ann initialized in a small set of random numbers is trained in an iterative way each site is assigned to the so called best matching unit bmu the cell whose virtual vector has the minimum euclidean distance with the real vector principal component analysis pca was used on the data matrix of the compounds elimination rates completed with bmus in order to identify relevant elimination rates patterns that account for differences between treatment plants the ann and pca used in this study were programmed with matlab r2017a 3 results 3 1 preliminary clogging test the test was targeted at investigating the decreasing sampling rate over time and its difference in treatment plant in and outlets the results can be inspected in fig 1 which shows how the data has been fitted by an exponential equation to calculate contributions in mass by succeeding days in the following carbamazepine and lidocaine showed a substantial decrease in sampling rates of roughly 80 over a weekly period in the inlet diclofenac started at a lower sampling rate and declined more slowly although sampling rates were high in the first days weekly averages met expected levels known from exposures in rivers with similar setups moschet et al 2015 sampling rates were mostly higher at the outlet than at the inlet and decreased less rapidly the slower decrease is probably due to less clogging of the membrane while the absolute higher level of sampling rates also depends on the flow velocity in the outlet which was relatively high the comparison of the collected mass for each day at the inlet reveals that the early days were overrepresented with contributions of over 20 while towards the end of the exposure period the contribution dropped below 10 note that if sampling rates remained stable over the whole week daily contributions would yield 14 this tendency was less pronounced for the outlet potential concentration outliers at the inlet during one day are most critical towards the end of the exposure where they might because of hydraulic reasons not be fully captured at the outlet and hence distort the elimination rate thanks to the decreasing sampling rate a two fold outlier would only yield a 6 increase in collected mass while a 5 fold outlier would provide a 23 gain the sampling scheme is therefore pretty robust since larger deviations are only occasionally expected for industrial chemicals 3 2 consistence of reference compound recovery the calculation of the elimination of micropollutants is based on circumventing direct load comparison because calibrating sampling rates in the inlet is a desperate endeavor due to the high variability of concentrations the hypothesis is that for recalcitrant compounds with zero elimination like carbamazepine and lidocaine differences in collected mass at the in and outlet are entirely governed by physical factors influencing sampling rates such as flow velocity and clogging of the membrane and independent of the compound hence the ratio of inlet to outlet mass should be identical for both compounds if this scheme is accurate carbamazepine and lidocaine ratios should be close to a 1 1 line when plotted against each other fig 2 shows with the ratios for both compounds from all 36 samplings that this condition is largely met with a few exceptions ratios are expected to be lower than 1 since the influent is expected to have lower sampling rates but opposite cases also exist in fact outlets of treatment plants were often too small or with too low water levels to host the passive sampler cages and these were then installed in the clarifier in quiet flow conditions in these cases the masses collected at the inlet exceeded those of the outlet in the few cases where ratios did not match one can observe that lidocaine yields more stable ratios than carbamazepine upon the weekly repeats in such cases lidocaine has been used as a correction factor for the reactive compounds 3 3 calculated full scale vs reactor experiment elimination rates fig 3 depicts the distributions of daily elimination rates that have been derived directly from passive sampler masses as box plots they are displayed in increasing order of the medians and are classified according to joss et al 2006 one needs to keep in mind that these are removal rates per day and that the actual elimination at the specific plant is dependent on the hrt which ranges from 2 to 50 h for the different plants table 1 it is noticeable that especially in the class with poor elimination the method also yielded negative values despite the correction by the reference compound in practice this would mean that the mass collected at the outlet is higher than at the inlet note that residence time distribution based balancing as exemplified in majewsky et al 2013 also yielded standard errors in elimination that were negative for carbamazepine analytical uncertainty of 10 20 can easily yield negative elimination for compounds that are hardly eliminated another passive sampler specific reason might be related to competitive sorption to the passive sampler oasis hlb is a mixed polymer featuring hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties which entails more specific interaction and hence potential competition for sites knowing that at the inlet competition by macrosubstrates and other micropollutants is much bigger than at the outlet this might produce higher masses in the outlet passive sampler although the concentration in water is essentially the same this would be compound specific and only visible for more recalcitrant compounds no negatives for degradables note that the method yielded several strong outliers that are not shown and probably due to analytical matrix effects they were excluded from the following multivariate statistical analysis the full box plots including outlier statisitcs are shown supplementary material s2 however elimination rates that have been determined with native sludges in the reactor experiments in the laboratory to verify the passive sampler approach showed good agreement with the full scale elimination rates fig 4 this can be considered as a validation as the reactor elimination rates have been determined under defined conditions nine out of twelve compounds investigated in reactor tests could be used for validation and coefficients of determination r2 varied between 0 54 ketoprofen diclofenac and 0 97 atenolol deet due to the relative short duration of the bench experiment 7 h very recalcitrant compounds have a higher uncertainty and less elimination rates could be fitted with confidence see detailed curves in supplementary material s3 s4 bias in passive sampler derived elimination rates due to lack of flow proportional sampling does not seem to be the rule in the treatment plants monitored as expected carbamazepine and lidocaine showed no decrease in concentration beyond analytical uncertainty in the reactor experiments and could not be used for validation as did propranolol but for reasons of analytical precision in the reactor tests supplementary material s3 sorption as shown by elimination kinetics in the reactor as well as calculations from experimental data played a negligible role except for triclosan pfos and pfoa arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 elimination rates are comparable to references in the literature that gained the data in reactor experiments with activated sludges joss et al 2006 or followed the distributed residence time protocol baalbaki et al 2017a 2017b comparison with other data such as the ones compiled by verlicchi et al 2012 are futile since they show extremely large ranges of removal and are potentially biased because they rely mostly on direct subtraction of 24 h composite samples majewsky et al 2011b 2013 however the data gathered here also show that there is substantial genuine variability in elimination performance of micropollutants among biological treatment plants note that for the perfluorated compounds doubt has been raised that sampling for pfos is in the kinetic mode since half time to equilibrium is only 2 4 days kaserzon et al 2012 this could potentially bias the calculated elimination for pfos if concentration variabilities occurred later in the exposure 3 4 treatment plant operational parameters and micropollutant elimination one of the goals of the project was to investigate if the design of the plant and operational parameters are able to influence the micropollutant elimination capacity removal efficiency of classical pollution utilization capacity and bod cod ratios could not explain any variations in micropollutant elimination between treatment plants table 1 has documented the array of hydraulic 2 50 h on average and sludge retention times 3 206 d that have been calculated for the monitored plants one would expect mp concentration to decrease exponentially with hydraulic retention time following a first order decay considering the elimination median for all compounds we found a logarithmic increase to a plateau that was reached beyond a hrt of about 20 h hrt vs elimination plots in the supplementary materials section s5 fast degraders like ibuprofen bisphenol a or estrone reached plateaus of full elimination even earlier while the medium elimination rates of compounds like atenolol deet and terbutryn showed a plateau after 30 40 h residence time it might be tempting to suggest designing treatment plants with higher hrts to allow for a more complete elimination of certain compounds although it also has to be kept in mind that higher hrt at constant bod load will yield lower food biomass ratios and hence low microbial activity classical design of wwtps featuring nitrogen removal necessarily requires hrts between 15 h and 20 h if the treatment plant is designed with aerobic sludge treatment an hrt between 30 h and 40 h results triclosan is a special case which shows full elimination with no relation to hrt its elimination is known to be governed by sorption to sludge particles baalbaki et al 2016 the dominant elimination process for all other compounds showing logarithmic increase in the hrt vs elimination plots is therefore expected to be biological degradation sludge retention time had been proposed as a key design parameter fostering micropollutant elimination with a narrative linking sludge age to microbiological diversity and enhanced biodegradation capacities clara et al 2005 in our investigation we could not find any significant positive correlation between srt and elimination rates table 2 on the contrary for many compounds smaller sludge ages showed higher elimination rates and significant negative regressions between srt and elimination rate fig 5 all plots in supplementary material s6 this is especially true for the fast degraders bisphenol a ibuprofen and estrone but also for compounds like tcpp atenolol and bezafibrate triclosan and the polyfluorinated compounds that are primarily eliminated through sorption on the sludge also showed a significant negative correlation with srt faster renewal of sludge increased the sorption capacity in these plants we can explain our findings with the respirometer data that confirmed the expected negative correlation between heterotrophic and autotrophic biomass activity and the srt i e the higher the srt the lower biomass activity expressed as maximum respiration max our data not shown or biomass growth rate in fig 6 the srt is basically defined by the sludge loading rate slr which indicates the food to biomass ratio f m of the reactor small f m ratios result in long srts and low biomass activity the correlations between microbial activity as sour and elimination rates are shown in fig 19 si 6 and were well aligned for autotrophs and heterotrophs the results confirm the outcomes of majewsky et al 2011a who also found such a trend whereas for different compounds the authors proposed faster degradation for paracetamol caffeine sulfamethoxazole and diclofenac under the presence of high numbers of heterotrophs and a low srt biofilm treatments as compared to conventional activated sludge systems are considered to feature very long srts and yet high performance the biofilm wwtps beggen plant 18 and hesperange plant 12 showed very efficient xenobiotic elimination a srt about 47 d was estimated of the hesperange wwtp while the srt of the beggen wwtp was unknown since no biomass data were available the long biomass retention time of the biofilm processes is assumed to foster slowly growing species protected in the biofilm stratification the latter could lead to a higher diversity of the microbial community kwon et al 2010 cortes lorenzo et al 2014 whose capability in the metabolization of a variety of substrate potentially outperforms the one of activated sludge falas et al 2012 hapeshi et al 2013 casas et al 2015 the narrative proposed by clara et al 2005 heralding higher mp elimination with higher srt has been challenged recently on the assumption that higher microbial diversity is linked to higher sludge age falas et al 2016 johnson et al 2015 the work of clara et al counts several hundred citations but very few attempted to replicate the theory the authors investigated 5 wwtps and 4 activated sludges from lab scale experiments with srts between 0 6 d and 550 d most of the investigated compounds e g ibuprofen bezafibrate estrogens and bisphenol a showed a high increase in elimination between the srt of 2 d and 10 d for srts larger than 10 d though the data from clara et al indicate no significant change in elimination similar results were recently reported by achermann et al 2018 who investigated the influence of sludge ages between 3 and 15 days that were generated in laboratory reactors a large array of compounds that are subject to oxidative transformation showed increased kbiols when srts increased from 3 to 10 days however weak or negative relations to srt were observed for compounds that undergo substitution type transformation reactions srts below 10 d are rather uncommon the german wwtp design guideline dwa a131 2000 proposes 10 d as the minimum srt for digestion plants when designing a plant 100 000 pe featuring nitrogen removal our data suggest that active biomass as inversely related to srt influences elimination rates way beyond 10 d retention time 3 5 multivariate analysis of elimination rates wwtp sampling with passive samplers yielded a substantial data matrix of elimination rates for 22 compounds over 18 plants and two repeats per site which gave the opportunity for further multivariate statistical exploration on one hand the covariation of elimination rates can identify compounds whose degradation depends on the presence of similar microbial consortia or even similar degradation pathways on the other hand the analysis can be applied to identify similarities between sites in terms of degradation and the link to their design and operational parameters in both cases we opted for a hierarchical cluster analysis following wards algorithm the dendrogram for the compound approach can be inspected in fig 7 and the allocation to groups is reported above the box plots of fig 3 the results give interesting insights to potential degradation pathways it classified for instance the fast degraders in group 4 and also managed to group structurally similar compounds like the phenylureas diuron and isoproturon or the fluorosurfactants pfos and pfoa for instance diclofenac as a relatively recalcitrant compound found itself in cluster 1 which was otherwise regrouping compounds with medium elimination rates note also that within the beta blockers propranolol was associated with cluster 3 while the structurally more similar atenolol and metoprolol were regrouped in cluster 1 while this is very interesting the question is if independent research can substantiate this clustering degradation pathway elucidation for micropollutants under environmentally realistic conditions has only recently made progress thanks to the advent of non target high resolution mass spectrometry for polar compounds pico and barcelo 2015 the approach attempts to reconstruct degradation pathways via the structural identification of stable intermediate transformation products however the experimental evidence is yet too eclectic for a systematic evaluation of the results of our cluster analysis prediction tools for biodegradation pathways like the eawag pps are able to generate the most probable transformation reactions based on biotransformation rules and starting from the compound s structural features gao et al 2011 there are limits to this approach since the biotransformation rules are valid for functional groups without consideration of the surrounding structural moieties gulde et al 2016 they also stem from pure culture assays where the compound was the sole substrate which does not reflect the environmental reality where micropollutants may be co metabolically transformed fischer and majewsky 2014 degradation pathways were generated for each of the investigated compounds in the online eawag pps system and the likely and neutral transformation rules were tabulated as well as similar rules supplementary materials s7 compounds belonging to clusters 3 and 4 showed a great variety of probable transformation rules with little in common cluster 1 regrouped compounds featuring primary amine betablockers or amides deet that have dealkylation as common degradation rules bt0063 bt0243 while triazoles diclofenac and ketoprofen shared dioxygenation as major rules bt0005 bt0065 bt0353 a recent study on the transformation of diclofenac in a hybrid biofilm jewell et al 2016 showed that the pathways that could be identified in this extensive work through traceable transformation products diverged largely from the pps prediction dioxygenations were not reported main initial steps were amidation dcf lactam and mono oxygenation our statistical analysis seems to indicate that the hybrid biofilm in that study that is known to have a better performance on diclofenac degradation might not be representative of common activated sludge degradation pathways for diclofenac since deoxygenation is common to the cluster delineated here cluster 2 featuring the phenylureas isoproturon and diuron as well as bezafibrate and lidocaine share pps transformation rules attacking amides amines to form carbamates and carboxylates as products bt0067 bt0068 bt0243 cluster analysis of elimination rates thus seems to be able to produce meaningful hints on common transformation pathways or conditions in treatment plants the clustering of treatment plants over the elimination rates of all the compounds is also a good consistence test as the dendrogram in the supplementary materials s8 shows 7 out of 10 of the weekly repeats on the single treatment plants are closely clustered this confirms that the sampling method and the derived elimination rates are reproducible even though in some cases weather conditions were variable between the repeats differences in discharges in a second step it is interesting to analyze if plant operation has an influence on the clustering of the plants according to similarities in elimination patterns when plotted against sludge retention times the clusters spread over relatively large ranges with overlaps fig 8 cluster 1 spanned the low srts from 5 to 40 days while cluster 4 ranged from 15 to 45 days cluster 3 comprised treatment plants with a narrower array of higher srt 30 50 days while cluster two singled out one plant note that median elimination rate of all the compounds is affected neither by srt nor affiliation to a cluster a principal component analysis had been conducted with the aim to identify the compounds that drive the clustering of the treatment plants by generation of an ordination biplot between plants and compounds fig 9 the majority of the treatment plants were gathered within progressive negative scores of both axis except a few plants on the same diagonal on the positive score side pca analysis showed two main sources of variance horizontal axis that explains about 70 of the variance was mainly driven by elimination rates of the compounds in cluster 4 which featured the highest elimination rates and the widest range as well as negative correlation to srt cluster 1 by contrast was not showing any clear trend and was gathered closer around the central axes the vertical axis explains about 22 of variance where cluster 2 occupied the orthogonal position and would hence show the compounds that were independent of sludge age and operational parameters for a critical compound like diclofenac which is featured on the european priority substances watch list our analysis indicates that it is rather insensitive to operational parameters cluster one and orthogonal position to the classification drivers it is however questionable if simple interpretation schemes such as sludge retention time are suited to fully explain the rather complex degradation patterns and the involved microbial consortia it is equally probable that macro substrate composition or the detoxification of potential stressors influences the elimination capabilities of the microbial consortia fischer and majewsky 2014 note also that clustering of treatment plants performed here is influenced by the array of compounds that are considered for the analysis and might change with the list of analysed compounds 3 6 determination of sampling rates at the outlet and inlet per capita loads finally the variability of the incoming loads per capita were investigated for the campaign note that all investigated compounds can be allocated to consumer or household good emissions although for some like triazoles or biocides not exclusively and therefore a normalization to population equivalents is legitimate the monitored treatment plants are dominated by domestic wastewaters with varying contributions of small and medium enterprises load calculation implied first determining the sampling rates at the outlet although noticeable variability of flow conditions existed in the individual outlets it was decided in a first step to determine an average sampling rate rs over all treatment plants via a regression analyzing the relationship between collected mass and grab sample concentrations the slope of the linear regression would then serve to determine rs equation 4 in a second step the impact of this simplified calculation on load determination would be evaluated by using individually derived rs for each treatment plant for comparison fig 10 shows such a regression for carbamazepine over all outlets 36 passive sampler masses with 2 grab samples each the coefficient of determination lay between adj r2 0 11 terbutryn and adj r2 0 99 carbamazepine compared to the boxplot of the individually calculated sampling rates the regression rs is close to the median while the interquartile of the boxplots spans approximately a factor of two when both types of rs are used to calculate the specific incoming loads on a population equivalent basis the ranges shown in the boxplots of fig 11 are comparable for carbamazepine and diclofenac in this example it can therefore be concluded that for the sake of load estimation and its uncertainty the regression method yields reliable results individual plants might however deviate due to sampling rate or immission profile specificities the resulting distributions of specific in and outlet loads can be inspected in fig 12 pe normalization was calculated by using the phosphorus load assumption 1 pe Ë 1 8 gd 1 total phosphorus other typical wastewater parameters e g cod correlated also well with xenobiotics of domestic origin however phosphorus is the most closely linked to domestic wastewater and for this reason we may have found the best correlation to conduct the pe normalization see the example of diclofenac in the supplementary materials s9 as expected the specific loads of pharmaceuticals are less variable than for instance those of isoproturon or deet which also have non domestic origins the results agree well with a survey published by singer et al 2016 where a smaller array of 6 treatment plants with varying industrial input were investigated medians found in that study were 165 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for atenolol 188 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for carbamazepine 369 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for diclofenac 31 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for ketoprofen 80 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for lidocaine 135 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for metoprolol 25 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for propranolol and 117 Î¼g pe 1 d 1 for sulfamethoxazol the distributions of this study can therefore be used to explore the impact of non monitored plants in catchment simulations 4 conclusions this paper introduced an innovative method to balance micropollutant flows in full scale wastewater treatment plants the use of passive samplers and only a few supportive grab samples makes the effort for a full scale balance affordable and applicable to a large number of plants it allows for routine monitoring in wwtp operation as well as benchmarking by regulators because of its simplicity the approach might raise skepticism about its reliability even more so since it has not been validated by independent full scale plant investigations it is therefore necessary to remind the five essential elements that make the gathered data plausible conservative tracers carbamazepine and lidocaine show an identical behavior which is governed by the environmental conditions of sampling flow velocity clogging elimination rates from full scale passive sampler monitoring and lab scale degradation studies with native sludges agree well although this validation is limited to the medium to fast eliminated compounds because of limited reactor time it shows that the principle works the calculated elimination rates are variable but agree with state of the art values from treatment plant and lab experiments the variability of the elimination rates can furthermore be related to operational parameters srt and predicted degradation pathways cluster analysis eawag pps hence the method is precise enough to identify trends that are stronger than the method s uncertainty monitoring with passive samplers yields repeatable and distinct results over the whole range of compounds for each treatment plant wwtp cluster analysis there were a few unexplained outliers for several compounds which showed random behavior and where the best explanation is analytical problems due to matrix effects hence the passive sampler method as presented here might fail for individual compounds in certain cases although on average they show sound results future applications of the monitoring scheme will show its robustness since the application of the scheme demands little effort and investment partial failures pose a small risk reactor experiments are therefore a good complement to fill the gaps despite the need of advanced treatment processes such as ozonation or activated carbon being necessary to meet the environmental quality standards for certain compounds in receiving waters classical biological treatments need to perform in a stable and optimized manner to avoid jeopardizing advanced treatment operation this needs close surveillance at low costs on one hand but also a better understanding of the governing parameters for micropollutant elimination this endeavor is currently undertaken with systematic exploration of an array of sludge retention times and a wide number of compounds with expected transformation pathways in lab reactor studies achermann et al 2018 these allow to identify common degradation behavior under certain operational conditions and allow to target more in depth enzymatic profiling and molecular biological exploration falas et al 2018 however these intensive investigations will necessarily be limited to case studies with a reduced representativeness and the balancing method presented here when applied on large scale will enable to confirm findings from the detail studies to identify

18751,biological nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate is ineffective due to the extremely low carbon nitrogen c n ratio moreover a large amount of waste activated sludge was is inevitably generated from wwtps during the municipal sewage treatment process in this study an innovative process was developed to enhance nitrogen removal from low c n 1 1 mature landfill leachate and to reduce the was during a 300 day operation two sequencing batch reactors sbrs were involved in this process firstly the mature landfill leachate was pumped into an aerobic reactor to undergo partial nitrification pn sbr then the pn sbr effluent and was were pumped into an anoxic reactor to undergo integrated fermentation and denitritation ifd sbr the ph profile was treated as a real time parameter to precisely control the duration of the pn and ifd processes partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation pnifd system achieved a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 95 0 and an average nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 63 kg m3 d during the last operational phase due to a variety of refractory contaminants the effluent cod concentration was 1865 9 mg l and a 19 7 cod removal efficiency was obtained under an influent concentration of 2324 5 mg l compared with the traditional nitrogen removal process pnifd not only decreased requirements for oxygen by 25 and the external organic carbon by 100 but also achieved simultaneous reduction of external was more than 53 7 of the external sludge was reduced during the ifd sbr operational cycle with an average external sludge reduction rate srr of 5 09 kg m3 d fermentation denitritation related microorganisms such as anaerolineaceae acidimicrobiaceae and thauera accounted for up to 41 5 of the total abundance in the ifd sbr based on the long and stable operation this study provides a simple and promising approach for synchronous nitrogen removal and was reduction graphical abstract image 1 keywords partial nitrification fermentation denitritation waste activated sludge was free nitrous acid fna 1 introduction landfill leachate contains a large amount of organics inorganics and salts especially in mature landfill leachate that has been buried for more than 5 years mature landfill leachate is generally characterized by a high ammonia content and a low biodegradable organic matter content miao et al 2019b wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 biological nitrogen removal bnr is the most prevalent and efficient way of treating landfill leachate bnr generally involves a two step process consisting of aerobic nitrification conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate and subsequent anoxic denitrification conversion of nitrate and nitrite to molecular nitrogen n2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the bnr process that is applied in mature landfill leachate treatment has two primary drawbacks 1 the organic carbon content in the leachate is generally insufficient to achieve complete denitrification guo et al 2018 and 2 huge quantities of waste activated sludge was is generated as a byproduct of wastewater treatment chen et al 2018 the was treatment process is complicated and the associated cost can be up to 60 of the overall operational cost of wastewater treatment plants wwtps wang et al 2019 as a source of inexpensive organic carbon was could release biodegradable carbon such as proteins polysaccharides or volatile fatty acids vfas through anaerobic fermentation processes namely solubilization hydrolysis and acidification the release of a desirable amount of carbon and its subsequent use during bnr can simultaneously solve the problems of excessive was and limited organic matter free nitrous acid fna as the protonated form of nitrite can be supplied to accelerate was fermentation wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2011 when activated sludge was exposed to 2 02 mg l fna for 48 h the biocidal performance significantly improved with a 20 decrease in the viable cells pijuan et al 2012 wu et al 2014 reported that mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss reduction was 63 4 and that nitrite removal occurred within 7 days when 0 2 g g ss was added to a simultaneous sludge fermentation nitrite removal system wu et al 2014 although many studies have reported accelerated fermentation with fna most of them used fna during a pretreatment stage in which the fna pretreatment units were separated from the fermentation reactor and the bnr system ma et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 however co occurrence of fermentation and nitrite reduction in a single reactor is rarely investigated in this study an innovative partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation pnifd process carried out in sequencing batch reactors sbrs was investigated to achieve nitrogen removal and external was reduction in mature landfill leachate with c n 1 mature landfill leachate was first introduced into a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor pn sbr in which ammonia was oxidized to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the effluent containing a high concentration of nitrite from the pn sbr was then pumped into the integrated fermentation denitritation sequencing batch reactor ifd sbr meanwhile the was was simultaneously added into the ifd sbr the interaction of external sludge fermentation and denitritation requires significant attention when investigating acceptable nitrogen removal and external sludge reduction techniques the denitritation process which was the key functional bioreaction during pnifd required a continuous organic substrate supply additionally the fermentation process was accelerated by the biocidal and metabolic inhibitory effects of fna which affects cell growth hartop et al 2017 respiration miao et al 2019a

setup and operation the schematic and operational strategy of the pnifd are presented in fig 1 the pn sbr working volume 10 0 l height 900 mm diameter 120 mm was fed with mature landfill leachate by a peristaltic pump fig 1a the pn sbr facilitated partial nitrification to produce no 2 n the pn effluent was stored in a middle tank and then the effluent with external was was simultaneously introduced into the ifd sbr the ifd sbr working volume 6 0 l height 600 mm diameter 120 mm was used for the integrated fermentation and dentiritation process temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured throughout the operation fig 1b shows the operational cycles of the reactors the duration of aeration in the pn sbr and anoxic mixing in the ifd sbr were accurately controlled by real time parameters in the pn sbr the partial nitrification decreased the alkalinity in the system and the aeration was stopped once the ph profile emerged ammonia valley zhang et al 2018 in the ifd sbr the alkalinity

the experiment was divided into two phases phase pn was the partial nitrification start up phase day 1 120 only the pn sbr was operated during this phase which comprised of four runs based on the stepwise increase of the volume exchange ratio ver the influent nitrogen loading rate nlr was correspondingly increased from 0 092 to 0 382 kg m3 d while the aeration intensity was maintained between 200 and 400 l h to achieve do levels below 0 5 mg l phase pnifd was the pnifd start up phase the ifd sbr was connected to the pn sbr four runs were performed according to the sludge dosing ratio sdr

nitrification start up phase the temporal evolution of the ammonium transformation performance and nitrite accumulation ratio nar in the pn sbr are presented in fig 2 in the beginning the ver was

effluent varied between 29 2 and 42 8 mg l the nitrate concentration was relatively high and the nar was approximately 79 4 after several operational cycles the biomass gradually adapted to the ammonia rich mature landfill leachate the nar and the ammonia oxidation efficiency increased to 98 3 and 98 49 respectively on day 35 indicating a successful start up of partial nitrification at run

requirement guo et al 2016 during run iii the nlr and ver further increased whereas the nar declined sharply from 98 5 to 87 9 due to a decrease in temperature from 26 to 21 c after being equipped with a heat band the no 3 n concentration in the effluent decreased from 240 to 23 3 mg l and the nar recovered from 87 9 to 98 2 within a week from days 90 120 the pn sbr was operated with a ver of 50 and an nlr of 0 382 kg m3 d a previous study stated that an increasing nlr could result in a decreasing nar which attributed to the inhibition of aob by fa anthonisen et al 1976 it is widely considered that an fa concentration between 10 and 150 mg l could be an inhibitor for aob yang et al 2017 the fa concentration during run iv was around 55 3 mg l however the reactor was not affected by the increased nlr and fa as illustrated in fig 2b in contrast a stable nh 4 n removal performance was simultaneously observed with the significant increase in the nar during run iv of the pn sbr system consequently the average effluent concentration of no 2 n and nar were 1518 6 mg l and 97 5 respectively throughout the experiment almost no nitrate accumulated suggesting a good partial nitrification performance and inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activity a successful partial nitrification startup could be attributed to two primary reasons firstly nob are inhibited when the fa concentration is above 10 mg l or the fna concentration is higher than 0 2 mg l anthonisen et al 1976 at an nlr of 0 092 kg m3 d during run i the fa and fna concentrations were approximately 14 5 mg l and 0 33 mg l respectively the nob were inhibited thereby preventing the conversion of no 2 n to no 3 n secondly the real time monitoring of ph was employed to accurately control the aeration length the appearance of the ammonia valley demonstrated that partial nitrification was accomplished the aeration should be stopped at the breakpoint to prevent the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate detailed description below typical mature landfill leachate c n 1 was used in this study due to a variety of refractory contaminants the effluent cod concentration reached 1645 7 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 24 3 after 120 days of operation fig 2a this result was similar to sun in that only a 14 cod removal rate was obtained using a biological treatment because of the low biodegradability of the organics sun et al 2015 overall the pn sbr achieved stable partial nitrification over 120 days and produced suitable effluent for subsequent use in the ifd sbr 3 2 partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation start up phase during the pnifd start up phase the ifd sbr was connected to the pn sbr the effluent of the pn sbr and external was were simultaneously pulse dosed to the ifd sbr this phase lasted for 180 days from days 120 300 the experimental period had four stages run i to run iv based on the sludge dosing ratio sdr of the ifd sbr in this phase the nar and effluent no 2 n of the pn sbr remained at 97 5 1 6 and 1524 57 mg l respectively fig 3 a 3 2 1 overview of the nitrogen removal performance an overview of the nitrogen removal performance is provided in fig 3 the nitrogen concentration did not decrease significantly in the pn sbr fig 3a and the nitrogen removal primarily relied on the ifd sbr during run i the sdr was 16 7 and nitrogen removal was achieved the effluent nitrite concentration varied between 50 1 and 106 7 mg l while the ammonia concentration progressively increased from 46 08 mg l to 80 13 mg l fig 3b the nitrite and nitrate removal rates were 0 13 kg m3 d and 0 0034 kg m3 d respectively fig 3c at the end of run i the tn concentration in effluent remained around 124 4 mg l and ammonia and nitrite were the two main nitrogen species present in the system the average concentration of no 2 n in the effluent was 53 5 mg l fig 3b indicating that the release of organic compounds from the sludge was deficient for denitritation causing insufficient nitrite removal to enhance the nitrogen removal performance a 25 sdr was used during run ii days 151 180 the no 2 n concentration in effluent showed a significantly decreasing tendency from 53 5 to 4 7 mg l and the hrt was shortened from 100 to 36 h table 1 the increased sludge dosing volume promoted the release of organic matter in the was and consequently improved the denitritation performance no external carbon was introduced with electron donors needed for denitritation only originating from the external sludge thereby saving 100 of the carbon source for nitrogen removal in the ifd sbr during this period biodegradable carbon produced from fermentation was sufficiently utilized in situ by denitrifiers resulting in the effluent cod remaining relatively constant at 1706 6 mg l fig 3b and only a slight cod increase of 9 6 fig 3c at the end of run ii ammonia was the only nitrogenous species present in the effluent with a concentration of approximately 97 2 mg l fig 3b on day 173 the nrr and nlr were 0 36 and 0 38 kg m3 d respectively during run iii the sdr was increased to 33 3 which further improved the nitrogen removal performance the hrt dropped to 23 2 h on day 181 the effluent no 3 n and no 2 n concentrations were both below 1 6 mg l giving rise to an nrr of 0 56 kg m3 d during run iv the sdr was increased to 41 7 compared with run iii the effluent quality in run iv did not significantly change the nrr and the tn removal efficiency were 0 63 kg m3 d and 95 0 respectively these results indicate that organic compounds were no longer the limiting substrate for the denitritation process at an sdr greater than 33 3 and that they were potentially responsible for the slightly increased ammonia concentration at the end of experiment the effluent cod concentration reached 1865 9 mg l while the average cod removal in the ifd sbr and pnifd system were 7 9 and 19 7 respectively fig 3c these values are comparable to previously published effluent cod concentrations of 793 3 2510 6 mg l and removal efficiencies of 14 37 2 using sole biological methods cheibub et al 2014 li et al 2019 miao et al 2016 sun et al 2015 the breakthrough of this study was the integrated fermentation and denitritation processes in a single reactor system compared with previous fna based pretreatment processes ma et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 pnifd does not require an fna pretreatment unit and a fermentation tank thereby decreasing the maintenance and operational costs pnifd a concise and reliable process has high potential towards energy positive and energy recovery operations of wwtps as a by product of fermentation po 4 3 p was discharged into the aqueous phase fig 3 b the average concentration of po 4 3 p ranged between 0 1 and 3 4 mg l during the entire phase these values are less than those reported for the traditional fermentation process ren et al 2009 precipitation was considered the most plausible phosphate removal pathway by the metal ions supplementary from landfill leachate table s1 similar observations have been reported for a simultaneous fermentation denitrification and phosphate removal system zhang et al 2013 besides precipitation struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o generation under alkaline conditions is another potential phosphorus removal mechanism wu et al 2014 in the ifd sbr the ph rose to 8 5 at the end of the operational cycle the average tn removal efficiency was the highest 94 2 after run ii overall the above results suggest that pnifd was successfully established 3 2 2 long term external was reduction capacity the external was reduction performance in pnifd is shown in fig 4 a during different runs the initial mlvss mlvssini concentration in the ifd sbr ranged from 8797 mg l to 16522 mg l the organic matter required for denitritation was completely derived from sludge fermentation throughout the entire operational period 1350 5330 mg l of sludge consumption and 40 6 73 4 sludge reduction efficiency were obtained in every cycle with sdrs of 16 7 and 33 the average srrs were 0 30 2 17 and 3 79 kg m3 d respectively the maximum srr of 5 09 kg m3 d was observed in run iv with a 41 7 sdr fig 4a an enhanced sludge consumption rate improved the nre 95 0 and nrr 0 63 kg m3 d fig 4a the carbon source required for tn removal was stable throughout the whole phase and the most suitable sdr was 41 7 for the pnifd system as summarized in table 2 the srr achieved in pnifd were much higher than previous related processes the higher sludge consumption rate was primarily due to the enhanced microbial activity and lower hrt a large amount of excess was is currently generated in wwtps for example 8 million tons of was is produced in the united states and 11 million tons of dry sludge is produced in china wei et al 2018 only about 30 of excess was can be degraded by traditional anaerobic digestion systems while the residual solids require further treatment dong et al 2016 the maximum sludge reduction capacities of the sludge digestion systems at the ji zhuangzi and gao beidian wwtps in china are 1 7 and 1 1 kg m3 d respectively guo et al 2016 ideally 53 7 of the external sludge can be degraded and directly converted to biodegradable organic matter in the ifd sbr the pnifd sludge treatment capacity was significantly higher than that of conventional sludge digestion systems this was primarily dependent on the biocidal effects and denitritation stimulation of fna the biocidal effects of fna inhibit numerous metabolic bioprocesses including atp generation tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and substrate activated transport across the cell membrane pijuan et al 2010 ye et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 release of carbon sources from external sludge could be immediately captured by denitrifiers to reduce nitrite nitrate thus further stimulating fermentation moreover 100 of the carbon source associated with nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate could be saved when compared to conventional activated sludge processes the correlation between the denitritation efficiency and srr was also investigated in this study fig 4a the average nitrogen removal per unit sludge was 1 73 g n g ss in run i during this run the organic compounds released from the sludge were insufficient for denitritation and an average of 53 5 mg l no 2 n was present in the effluent fig 3b the released endogenous carbon was fully utilized by denitrifiers resulting in relatively high nitrogen removal per unit sludge after the sdr increased from 16 7 to 25 in run ii the organic compounds were not a limiting substrate for denitritation and a lower nitrogen removal per unit of dosing sludge 0 51 g n g ss was observed fig 4a this result is consistent with previous studies for example an up flow anaerobic reactor achieved 0 23 g no 3 n reduction by per sludge consumption when treating the effluent from a municipal wwtp sun et al 2017 another study indicated that 0 13 g of no 2 n could be reduced by 1 g ss in a fermentation tank at an sdr of 33 zhang et al 2013 theoretically ammonia release is an indication of intracellular hydrolysis during the decay process of dying cells ren et al 2009 the nh 4 n production rate progressively increased with an increasing sdr between 16 7 and 33 3 fig 4b during run iii the ammonia production rate reached about 0 033 kg m3 d at an sdr of 33 however a further increase of the sdr only resulted in a slight acceleration of nh 4 n release the overall validity of the decay rate was acknowledged by the change in the mlvss concentration as given in eq 5 the cell decay rate exhibited an increasing tendency as the experiment progressed the average cell decay rate during run iv was 0 237 d fig s2 wang investigated the cell decay rate under anaerobic and aerobic famine conditions and reported an average denitrifying phosphorus accumulation organisms decay rate of 0 008 d after 12 days of starvation wang et al 2015 the specific anammox aerobic decay rate was reported to be 0 028 d though decreases to 0 011 d in anaerobic conditions wang et al 2018 the pnifd cell decay rate was considerably higher than the commonly reported values in the aforementioned literature therefore as no external carbon source was added to the biological nitrogen removal system pnifd not only achieved an enhanced denitritation performance but also exhibited highly efficient external sludge reduction 3 3 real time parameters applied in the pnifd process partial nitrification fermentation and denitritation are dynamic and complex processes related to hydrogen ion consumption production oxygen consumption and carbon source consumption production therefore the process can be accurately evaluated by the ph and do variation the concentration of do remained below 0 18 mg l throughout most of the partial nitrification period fig 5 a due to enhanced microbial activity oxygen was consumed faster than if was supplied to the system the increase of ph during the initial 2 5 h was caused by degradation of organic compounds and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide co2 into the aqueous solution ammonia then decreased from 811 2 to 5 4 mg l with the concomitant hydrogen ion production resulting in a decreased ph the ammonia valley point b indicates successful partial nitrification and that prolonged aeration should be avoided during this period guo et al 2016 this successful partial nitrification process required only 75 of the oxygen supply required for traditional nitrification process in the ifd sbr the vfas increased from 11 9 to 57 3 mg l and the ph correspondingly decreased during the first 3 h of operation fig 5b in this case the vfa production rate was higher than the denitritation consumption rate after the ph decreased to its valley bottom point c the vfas generated by the sludge fermentation process was used in situ by denitrifiers thereby maintaining an almost constant vfa concentration 21 1 26 4 mg l from 3 h to 10 5 h meanwhile the nitrite concentration decreased from 666 2 mg l to 3 8 mg l in 10 5 h with vigorous nitrogen gas spilling fig 5c theoretically under anoxic conditions 2 86 mg cod is consumed to reduce 1 mg no 3 n and 1 71 mg cod is needed to consume 1 mg of no 2 n akizuki et al 2013 therefore at least 1310 8 mg cod was produced in the ifd sbr which was simultaneously utilized by denitrifiers as expected ammonia slightly increased due to the decomposition of organic nitrogen during sludge fermentation the established integrated fermentation denitritation process saved 100 external carbon source and reduced the average mlvss by 53 7 the denitritation process produced alkalinity and caused the ph profile to subsequently increase the nitrite apex point d represents the completion of denitritation qin et al 2017 after the complete depletion of nitrite sludge fermentation proceeded continuously the vfas increased sharply from 21 1 to 871 mg l and the ph significantly decreased in the ifd sbr therefore the nitrite apex in the ph profile denotes the completion of the denitritation process and excessive anoxic mixing should be avoided at this point overall the ph and do profiles were effectively used as a real time control strategy for the pnifd system 3 4 microbial community characterization the live dead staining and functional microbial community in the ifd sbr were estimated by fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing respectively both the live blue and dead red cells are shown on the fish image fig 6 a fish quantification found that 56 of the total bacterial biomass was damaged at the end of the ifd sbr operational cycle suggesting that fna caused evident mortality and irreversible destruction of the microorganisms the dominant microorganisms at the genus level were aliidiomarina anaerolineaceae microthrix acidimicrobiaceae thauera and halomonas fig 6b of these several genera were affiliated with the fermentation process i e aliidiomarina anaerolineaceae and acidimicrobiaceae anaerolineaceae 9 87 belonging to the chloroflexi phylum can accelerate cell lysis and utilize the released organic compounds cao et al 2016 furthermore acidimicrobiaceae 6 4 is a fermentative bacterium that produces acetic acid as a major product lin et al 2017 guggeheimella and propionibacteriaceae which are considered typical vfa producers were also detected in the ifd sbr at the relative abundances of 0 59 and 0 41 respectively wang et al 2013 yuan et al 2016b thauera and dechloromonas can deoxidize nitrate nitrite using organic compounds as electron donors under anoxic condition xie et al 2018 kuenenia 0 1 relative abundance belongs to the planctomycetes phylum and has the ability to carry out the anammox reaction wang and zheng 2017 relatively high abundances of fermentative microorganisms i e anaerolineaceae acidimicrobiaceae and guggeheimella cooperated well with the denitrifiers i e thauera and dechloromonas thereby promoting the complex reaction in the ifd sbr see fig 7 4 conclusions the innovative pnifd system was developed by coupling partial nitrification fermentation and denitritation to treat low c n mature landfill leachate highly efficient nitrogen removal and external sludge reduction performances were achieved using a real time control strategy the subsequent conclusions drawn from this study are as follows compared with the traditional nitrogen removal process pnifd reduces the oxygen supply requirement for partial nitrification by approximately 25 and the external organic carbon requirement for denitritation by 100 the pnifd operated for 300 days achieved a tn removal efficiency of 95 0 a tn removal rate of 0 63 kg m3 d and a cod removal efficiency of 19 7 under influent nh 4 n tn and cod concentrations of 1736 40 mg l 2023 75 mg l and 2109 200 mg l respectively only a 7 9 cod increase was observed in the ifd sbr due to the integrated fermentation denitritation process and the accurate reaction duration as determined by real time parameters the external sludge was reduced by 53 7 and subsequently converted to biodegradable organic matter in the pnifd system resulting in a significant external sludge reduction rate of 5 09 kg m3 d coexistence of fermentative bacteria and denitrifiers was responsible for enhanced tn removal from the mature landfill leachate and external was reduction acknowledgements this work was financially supported by beijing municipal science

18751,biological nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate is ineffective due to the extremely low carbon nitrogen c n ratio moreover a large amount of waste activated sludge was is inevitably generated from wwtps during the municipal sewage treatment process in this study an innovative process was developed to enhance nitrogen removal from low c n 1 1 mature landfill leachate and to reduce the was during a 300 day operation two sequencing batch reactors sbrs were involved in this process firstly the mature landfill leachate was pumped into an aerobic reactor to undergo partial nitrification pn sbr then the pn sbr effluent and was were pumped into an anoxic reactor to undergo integrated fermentation and denitritation ifd sbr the ph profile was treated as a real time parameter to precisely control the duration of the pn and ifd processes partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation pnifd system achieved a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 95 0 and an average nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 63 kg m3 d during the last operational phase due to a variety of refractory contaminants the effluent cod concentration was 1865 9 mg l and a 19 7 cod removal efficiency was obtained under an influent concentration of 2324 5 mg l compared with the traditional nitrogen removal process pnifd not only decreased requirements for oxygen by 25 and the external organic carbon by 100 but also achieved simultaneous reduction of external was more than 53 7 of the external sludge was reduced during the ifd sbr operational cycle with an average external sludge reduction rate srr of 5 09 kg m3 d fermentation denitritation related microorganisms such as anaerolineaceae acidimicrobiaceae and thauera accounted for up to 41 5 of the total abundance in the ifd sbr based on the long and stable operation this study provides a simple and promising approach for synchronous nitrogen removal and was reduction graphical abstract image 1 keywords partial nitrification fermentation denitritation waste activated sludge was free nitrous acid fna 1 introduction landfill leachate contains a large amount of organics inorganics and salts especially in mature landfill leachate that has been buried for more than 5 years mature landfill leachate is generally characterized by a high ammonia content and a low biodegradable organic matter content miao et al 2019b wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 biological nitrogen removal bnr is the most prevalent and efficient way of treating landfill leachate bnr generally involves a two step process consisting of aerobic nitrification conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate and subsequent anoxic denitrification conversion of nitrate and nitrite to molecular nitrogen n2 as shown in eqs 1 and 2 the bnr process that is applied in mature landfill leachate treatment has two primary drawbacks 1 the organic carbon content in the leachate is generally insufficient to achieve complete denitrification guo et al 2018 and 2 huge quantities of waste activated sludge was is generated as a byproduct of wastewater treatment chen et al 2018 the was treatment process is complicated and the associated cost can be up to 60 of the overall operational cost of wastewater treatment plants wwtps wang et al 2019 as a source of inexpensive organic carbon was could release biodegradable carbon such as proteins polysaccharides or volatile fatty acids vfas through anaerobic fermentation processes namely solubilization hydrolysis and acidification the release of a desirable amount of carbon and its subsequent use during bnr can simultaneously solve the problems of excessive was and limited organic matter free nitrous acid fna as the protonated form of nitrite can be supplied to accelerate was fermentation wang et al 2017 zhou et al 2011 when activated sludge was exposed to 2 02 mg l fna for 48 h the biocidal performance significantly improved with a 20 decrease in the viable cells pijuan et al 2012 wu et al 2014 reported that mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss reduction was 63 4 and that nitrite removal occurred within 7 days when 0 2 g g ss was added to a simultaneous sludge fermentation nitrite removal system wu et al 2014 although many studies have reported accelerated fermentation with fna most of them used fna during a pretreatment stage in which the fna pretreatment units were separated from the fermentation reactor and the bnr system ma et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 however co occurrence of fermentation and nitrite reduction in a single reactor is rarely investigated in this study an innovative partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation pnifd process carried out in sequencing batch reactors sbrs was investigated to achieve nitrogen removal and external was reduction in mature landfill leachate with c n 1 mature landfill leachate was first introduced into a partial nitrification sequencing batch reactor pn sbr in which ammonia was oxidized to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob the effluent containing a high concentration of nitrite from the pn sbr was then pumped into the integrated fermentation denitritation sequencing batch reactor ifd sbr meanwhile the was was simultaneously added into the ifd sbr the interaction of external sludge fermentation and denitritation requires significant attention when investigating acceptable nitrogen removal and external sludge reduction techniques the denitritation process which was the key functional bioreaction during pnifd required a continuous organic substrate supply additionally the fermentation process was accelerated by the biocidal and metabolic inhibitory effects of fna which affects cell growth hartop et al 2017 respiration miao et al 2019a zhang et al 2016 glycogen production and protein synthesis ganda et al 2016 direct inhibition of the enzymes boiocchi et al 2017 and through uncoupling effects zhou et al 2011 the formed intracellular

pnifd during the treatment of raw mature landfill leachate 2 investigate the correlation of on line parameters with the nitrogen removal performance in the pn sbr and ifd sbr 3 identify the dominant microorganisms and characterize the species development within the microbial community and 4 provide a feasible solution for on site was utilization and reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operation the schematic and operational strategy of the pnifd are presented in fig 1 the pn sbr working volume 10 0 l height 900 mm diameter 120 mm was fed with mature landfill leachate by a peristaltic pump fig 1a the pn sbr facilitated partial nitrification to produce no 2 n the pn effluent was stored in a middle tank and then the effluent with external was was simultaneously introduced into the ifd sbr the ifd sbr working volume 6 0 l height 600 mm diameter 120 mm was used for the integrated fermentation and dentiritation process temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured throughout the operation fig 1b shows the operational cycles of the reactors the duration of aeration in the pn sbr and anoxic mixing in the ifd sbr were accurately controlled by real time parameters in the pn sbr the partial nitrification decreased the alkalinity in the system and the aeration was stopped once the ph profile emerged ammonia valley zhang et al 2018 in the ifd sbr the alkalinity created by the denitritation process and the breakpoint the nitrite apex appeared on the ph curve indicating completion of denitritation li et al 2014 according to the different operational strategies the experiment was divided into two phases phase pn was the partial nitrification start up phase day 1 120 only the pn sbr was operated during this phase which comprised of four runs based on the stepwise increase of the volume exchange ratio ver the influent nitrogen loading rate nlr was correspondingly increased from 0 092 to 0 382 kg m3 d while the aeration intensity was maintained between 200 and 400 l h to achieve do levels below 0 5 mg l phase pnifd was the pnifd start up phase the ifd sbr was connected to the pn sbr four runs were performed according to the sludge dosing ratio sdr of the ifd sbr variations in nitrogen compounds the nitrite accumulation ratio nar and the nitrogen removal efficiency nre were measured to evaluate the pnifd performance the detailed operational

nitrification start up phase the temporal evolution of the ammonium transformation performance and nitrite accumulation ratio nar in the pn sbr are presented in fig 2 in the beginning the ver was maintained at 10 and the nitrogen loading rate nlr ranged from 0 09 to 0 094 kg m3 d table 1 on day 31 the ver increased from 10 to 15 and the nlr reached 0 164 kg m3 d the ver further increased from

effluent varied between 29 2 and 42 8 mg l the nitrate concentration was relatively high and the nar was approximately 79 4 after several operational cycles the biomass gradually adapted to the ammonia rich mature landfill leachate the nar and the ammonia oxidation efficiency increased to 98 3 and 98 49 respectively on day 35 indicating a successful start up of partial nitrification at run ii during partial nitrification 3 43 mg of oxygen was consumed per 1 mg of oxidized ammonia this is only 75 of the total oxygen used during the traditional nitrification process 4 57 mg oxygen requirement guo et al 2016 during run iii the nlr and ver further increased whereas the nar declined sharply from 98 5 to 87 9 due to a decrease in temperature from 26 to 21 c after being equipped with a heat band the no 3 n concentration in the effluent decreased from 240 to 23 3 mg l and the nar recovered from 87 9 to 98 2 within a week from days 90 120 the pn sbr was operated with a ver of 50 and an nlr of 0 382 kg m3 d a previous study stated that an increasing nlr could result in a decreasing nar which attributed to the inhibition of aob by fa anthonisen et al 1976 it is widely considered that an fa concentration between 10 and 150 mg l could be an inhibitor for aob yang et al 2017 the fa concentration during run iv was around 55 3 mg l however the reactor was not affected by the increased nlr and fa as illustrated in fig 2b in contrast a stable nh 4 n removal performance was simultaneously observed with the significant increase in the nar during run iv of the pn sbr system consequently the average effluent concentration of no 2 n and nar were 1518 6 mg l and 97 5 respectively throughout the experiment almost no nitrate accumulated suggesting a good partial nitrification performance and inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activity a successful partial nitrification startup could be attributed to two primary reasons firstly nob are inhibited when the fa concentration is above 10 mg l or the fna concentration is higher than 0 2 mg l anthonisen et al 1976 at an nlr of 0 092 kg m3 d during run i the fa and fna concentrations were approximately 14 5 mg l and 0 33 mg l respectively the nob were inhibited thereby preventing the conversion of no 2 n to no 3 n secondly the real time monitoring of ph was employed to accurately control the aeration length the appearance of the ammonia valley demonstrated that partial nitrification was accomplished the aeration should be stopped at the breakpoint to prevent the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate detailed description below typical mature landfill leachate c n 1 was used in this study due to a variety of refractory contaminants the effluent cod concentration reached 1645 7 mg l with an average removal efficiency of 24 3 after 120 days of operation fig 2a this result was similar to sun in that only a 14 cod removal rate was obtained using a biological treatment because of the low biodegradability of the organics sun et al 2015 overall the pn sbr achieved stable partial nitrification over 120 days and produced suitable effluent for subsequent use in the ifd sbr 3 2 partial nitrification and integrated fermentation denitritation start up phase during the pnifd start up phase the ifd sbr was connected to the pn sbr the effluent of the pn sbr and external was were simultaneously pulse dosed to the ifd sbr this phase lasted for 180 days from days 120 300 the experimental period had four stages run i to run iv based on the sludge dosing ratio sdr of the ifd sbr in this phase the nar and effluent no 2 n of the pn sbr remained at 97 5 1 6 and 1524 57 mg l respectively fig 3 a 3 2 1 overview of the nitrogen removal performance an overview of the nitrogen removal performance is provided in fig 3 the nitrogen concentration did not decrease significantly in the pn sbr fig 3a and the nitrogen removal primarily relied on the ifd sbr during run i the sdr was 16 7 and nitrogen removal was achieved the effluent nitrite concentration varied between 50 1 and 106 7 mg l while the ammonia concentration progressively increased from 46 08 mg l to 80 13 mg l fig 3b the nitrite and nitrate removal rates were 0 13 kg m3 d and 0 0034 kg m3 d respectively fig 3c at the end of run i the tn concentration in effluent remained around 124 4 mg l and ammonia and nitrite were the two main nitrogen species present in the system the average concentration of no 2 n in the effluent was 53 5 mg l fig 3b indicating that the release of organic compounds from the sludge was deficient for denitritation causing insufficient nitrite removal to enhance the nitrogen removal performance a 25 sdr was used during run ii days 151 180 the no 2 n concentration in effluent showed a significantly decreasing tendency from 53 5 to 4 7 mg l and the hrt was shortened from 100 to 36 h table 1 the increased sludge dosing volume promoted the release of organic matter in the was and consequently improved the denitritation performance no external carbon was introduced with electron donors needed for denitritation only originating from the external sludge thereby saving 100 of the carbon source for nitrogen removal in the ifd sbr during this period biodegradable carbon produced from fermentation was sufficiently utilized in situ by denitrifiers resulting in the effluent cod remaining relatively constant at 1706 6 mg l fig 3b and only a slight cod increase of 9 6 fig 3c at the end of run ii ammonia was the only nitrogenous species present in the effluent with a concentration of approximately 97 2 mg l fig 3b on day 173 the nrr and nlr were 0 36 and 0 38 kg m3 d respectively during run iii the sdr was increased to 33 3 which further improved the nitrogen removal performance the hrt dropped to 23 2 h on day 181 the effluent no 3 n and no 2 n concentrations were both below 1 6 mg l giving rise to an nrr of 0 56 kg m3 d during run iv the sdr was increased to 41 7 compared with run iii the effluent quality in run iv did not significantly change the nrr and the tn removal efficiency were 0 63 kg m3 d and 95 0 respectively these results indicate that organic compounds were no longer the limiting substrate for the denitritation process at an sdr greater than 33 3 and that they were potentially responsible for the slightly increased ammonia concentration at the end of experiment the effluent cod concentration reached 1865 9 mg l while the average cod removal in the ifd sbr and pnifd system were 7 9 and 19 7 respectively fig 3c these values are comparable to previously published effluent cod concentrations of 793 3 2510 6 mg l and removal efficiencies of 14 37 2 using sole biological methods cheibub et al 2014 li et al 2019 miao et al 2016 sun et al 2015 the breakthrough of this study was the integrated fermentation and denitritation processes in a single reactor system compared with previous fna based pretreatment processes ma et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 pnifd does not require an fna pretreatment unit and a fermentation tank thereby decreasing the maintenance and operational costs pnifd a concise and reliable process has high potential towards energy positive and energy recovery operations of wwtps as a by product of fermentation po 4 3 p was discharged into the aqueous phase fig 3 b the average concentration of po 4 3 p ranged between 0 1 and 3 4 mg l during the entire phase these values are less than those reported for the traditional fermentation process ren et al 2009 precipitation was considered the most plausible phosphate removal pathway by the metal ions supplementary from landfill leachate table s1 similar observations have been reported for a simultaneous fermentation denitrification and phosphate removal system zhang et al 2013 besides precipitation struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o generation under alkaline conditions is another potential phosphorus removal mechanism wu et al 2014 in the ifd sbr the ph rose to 8 5 at the end of the operational cycle the average tn removal efficiency was the highest 94 2 after run ii overall the above results suggest that pnifd was successfully established 3 2 2 long term external was reduction capacity the external was reduction performance in pnifd is shown in fig 4 a during different runs the initial mlvss mlvssini concentration in the ifd sbr ranged from 8797 mg l to 16522 mg l the organic matter required for denitritation was completely derived from sludge fermentation throughout the entire operational period 1350 5330 mg l of sludge consumption and 40 6 73 4 sludge reduction efficiency were obtained in every cycle with sdrs of 16 7 and 33 the average srrs were 0 30 2 17 and 3 79 kg m3 d respectively the maximum srr of 5 09 kg m3 d was observed in run iv with a 41 7 sdr fig 4a an enhanced sludge consumption rate improved the nre 95 0 and nrr 0 63 kg m3 d fig 4a the carbon source required for tn removal was stable throughout the whole phase and the most suitable sdr was 41 7 for the pnifd system as summarized in table 2 the srr achieved in pnifd were much higher than previous related processes the higher sludge consumption rate was primarily due to the enhanced microbial activity and lower hrt a large amount of excess was is currently generated in wwtps for example 8 million tons of was is produced in the united states and 11 million tons of dry sludge is produced in china wei et al 2018 only about 30 of excess was can be degraded by traditional anaerobic digestion systems while the residual solids require further treatment dong et al 2016 the maximum sludge reduction capacities of the sludge digestion systems at the ji zhuangzi and gao beidian wwtps in china are 1 7 and 1 1 kg m3 d respectively guo et al 2016 ideally 53 7 of the external sludge can be degraded and directly converted to biodegradable organic matter in the ifd sbr the pnifd sludge treatment capacity was significantly higher than that of conventional sludge digestion systems this was primarily dependent on the biocidal effects and denitritation stimulation of fna the biocidal effects of fna inhibit numerous metabolic bioprocesses including atp generation tricarboxylic acid tca cycle and substrate activated transport across the cell membrane pijuan et al 2010 ye et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 release of carbon sources from external sludge could be immediately captured by denitrifiers to reduce nitrite nitrate thus further stimulating fermentation moreover 100 of the carbon source associated with nitrogen removal from mature landfill leachate could be saved when compared to conventional activated sludge processes the correlation between the denitritation efficiency and srr was also investigated in this study fig 4a the average nitrogen removal per unit sludge was 1 73 g n g ss in run i during this run the organic compounds released from the sludge were insufficient for denitritation and an average of 53 5 mg l no 2 n was present in the effluent fig 3b the released endogenous carbon was fully utilized by denitrifiers resulting in relatively high nitrogen removal per unit sludge after the sdr increased from 16 7 to 25 in run ii the organic compounds were not a limiting substrate for denitritation and a lower nitrogen removal per unit of dosing sludge 0 51 g n g ss was observed fig 4a this result is consistent with previous studies for example an up flow anaerobic reactor achieved 0 23 g no 3 n reduction by per sludge consumption when treating the effluent from a municipal wwtp sun et al 2017 another study indicated that 0 13 g of no 2 n could be reduced by 1 g ss in a fermentation tank at an sdr of 33 zhang et al 2013 theoretically ammonia release is an indication of intracellular hydrolysis during the decay process of dying cells ren et al 2009 the nh 4 n production rate progressively increased with an increasing sdr between 16 7 and 33 3 fig 4b during run iii the ammonia production rate reached about 0 033 kg m3 d at an sdr of 33 however a further increase of the sdr only resulted in a slight acceleration of nh 4 n release the overall validity of the decay rate was acknowledged by the change in the mlvss concentration as given in eq 5 the cell decay rate exhibited an increasing tendency as the experiment progressed the average cell decay rate during run iv was 0 237 d fig s2 wang investigated the cell decay rate under anaerobic and aerobic famine conditions and reported an average denitrifying phosphorus accumulation organisms decay rate of 0 008 d after 12 days of starvation wang et al 2015 the specific anammox aerobic decay rate was reported to be 0 028 d though decreases to 0 011 d in anaerobic conditions wang et al 2018 the pnifd cell decay rate was considerably higher than the commonly reported values in the aforementioned literature therefore as no external carbon source was added to the biological nitrogen removal system pnifd not only achieved an enhanced denitritation performance but also exhibited highly efficient external sludge reduction 3 3 real time parameters applied in the pnifd process partial nitrification fermentation and denitritation are dynamic and complex processes related to hydrogen ion consumption production oxygen consumption and carbon source consumption production therefore the process can be accurately evaluated by the ph and do variation the concentration of do remained below 0 18 mg l throughout most of the partial nitrification period fig 5 a due to enhanced microbial activity oxygen was consumed faster than if was supplied to the system the increase of ph during the initial 2 5 h was caused by degradation of organic compounds and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide co2 into the aqueous solution ammonia then decreased from 811 2 to 5 4 mg l with the concomitant hydrogen ion production resulting in a decreased ph the ammonia valley point b indicates successful partial nitrification and that prolonged aeration should be avoided during this period guo et al 2016 this successful partial nitrification process required only 75 of the oxygen supply required for traditional nitrification process in the ifd sbr the vfas increased from 11 9 to 57 3 mg l and the ph correspondingly decreased during the first 3 h of operation fig 5b in this case the vfa production rate was higher than the denitritation consumption rate after the ph decreased to its valley bottom point c the vfas generated by the sludge fermentation process was used in situ by denitrifiers thereby maintaining an almost constant vfa concentration 21 1 26 4 mg l from 3 h to 10 5 h meanwhile the nitrite concentration decreased from 666 2 mg l to 3 8 mg l in 10 5 h with vigorous nitrogen gas spilling fig 5c theoretically under anoxic conditions 2 86 mg cod is consumed to reduce 1 mg no 3 n and 1 71 mg cod is needed to consume 1 mg of no 2 n akizuki et al 2013 therefore at least 1310 8 mg cod was produced in the ifd sbr which was simultaneously utilized by denitrifiers as expected ammonia slightly increased due to the decomposition of organic nitrogen during sludge fermentation the established integrated fermentation denitritation process saved 100 external carbon source and reduced the average mlvss by 53 7 the denitritation process produced alkalinity and caused the ph profile to subsequently increase the nitrite apex point d represents the completion of denitritation qin et al 2017 after the complete depletion of nitrite sludge fermentation proceeded continuously the vfas increased sharply from 21 1 to 871 mg l and the ph significantly decreased in the ifd sbr therefore the nitrite apex in the ph profile denotes the completion of the denitritation process and excessive anoxic mixing should be avoided at this point overall the ph and do profiles were effectively used as a real time control strategy for the pnifd system 3 4 microbial community characterization the live dead staining and functional microbial community in the ifd sbr were estimated by fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing respectively both the live blue and dead red cells are shown on the fish image fig 6 a fish quantification found that 56 of the total bacterial biomass was damaged at the end of the ifd sbr operational cycle suggesting that fna caused evident mortality and irreversible destruction of the microorganisms the dominant microorganisms at the genus level were aliidiomarina anaerolineaceae microthrix acidimicrobiaceae thauera and halomonas fig 6b of these several genera were affiliated with the fermentation process i e aliidiomarina anaerolineaceae and acidimicrobiaceae anaerolineaceae 9 87 belonging to the chloroflexi phylum can accelerate cell lysis and utilize the released organic compounds cao et al 2016 furthermore acidimicrobiaceae 6 4 is a fermentative bacterium that produces acetic acid as a major product lin et al 2017 guggeheimella and propionibacteriaceae which are considered typical vfa producers were also detected in the ifd sbr at the relative abundances of 0 59 and 0 41 respectively wang et al 2013 yuan et al 2016b thauera and dechloromonas can deoxidize nitrate nitrite using organic compounds as electron donors under anoxic condition xie et al 2018 kuenenia 0 1 relative abundance belongs to the planctomycetes phylum and has the ability to carry out the anammox reaction wang and zheng 2017 relatively high abundances of fermentative microorganisms i e anaerolineaceae acidimicrobiaceae and guggeheimella cooperated well with the denitrifiers i e thauera and dechloromonas thereby promoting the complex reaction in the ifd sbr see fig 7 4 conclusions the innovative pnifd system was developed by coupling partial nitrification fermentation and denitritation to treat low c n mature landfill leachate highly efficient nitrogen removal and external sludge reduction performances were achieved using a real time control strategy the subsequent conclusions drawn from this study are as follows compared with the traditional nitrogen removal process pnifd reduces the oxygen supply requirement for partial nitrification by approximately 25 and the external organic carbon requirement for denitritation by 100 the pnifd operated for 300 days achieved a tn removal efficiency of 95 0 a tn removal rate of 0 63 kg m3 d and a cod removal efficiency of 19 7 under influent nh 4 n tn and cod concentrations of 1736 40 mg l 2023 75 mg l and 2109 200 mg l respectively only a 7 9 cod increase was observed in the ifd sbr due to the integrated fermentation denitritation process and the accurate reaction duration as determined by real time parameters the external sludge was reduced by 53 7 and subsequently converted to biodegradable organic matter in the pnifd system resulting in a significant external sludge reduction rate of 5 09 kg m3 d coexistence of fermentative bacteria and denitrifiers was responsible for enhanced tn removal from the mature landfill leachate and external was reduction acknowledgements this work was financially supported by beijing municipal science

18752,n doped biochars nbcs were prepared by pyrolyzing corncob biomass and urea in different proportion which manifested superior catalytic performance of peroxydisulfate pds activation for sulfadiazine sdz degradation through both dynamic fitting and density functional theory dft calculations the critical role of edge nitrogenation in biochar bc structure was revealed for the first time the incorporation of edge nitrogen configurations pyridinic n and pyrrolic n rather than graphitic n generated reactive sites for the pds activation additionally a thorough investigation was conducted to explicate the pds activation mechanism by nbc through chemical quenching experiments electron spin resonance esr detection oxidant consumption monitoring and electrochemical analysis different from the well reported singlet oxygen 1o2 dominated nonradical mechanism an electron transfer pathway involving surface bound reactive complexes was proved to play a major role in the nbc pds system benefit from the electron transfer mechanism the nbc pds system not only has wide ph adaptation for real application but also shows high resistance to the inorganic anions in aquatic environment we believe this study will deepen the understanding of the carbon driven persulfate activation mechanism and provide strong technical support for the bc mediated persulfate activation in practical applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar peroxydisulfate nitrogen doping electron transfer singlet oxygen sulfadiazine 1 introduction water pollution caused by refractory organics has become a serious problem threatening ecological security and human health in recent decades wu et al 2018 xu et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 advanced oxidation processes aops show significant removal efficiency for these organics in contrast with the inadequate traditional biological treatment methods among the various aops persulfate based advanced oxidation processes have aroused great interest due to their chemical stability and high storability chu et al 2016 in general persulfates such as peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds themselves present low oxidative potential for organic decomposition wacÅawek et al 2017 however the peroxide bonds of persulfates can be readily cleaved by catalysts or externally supplied energy leading to the generation of more reactive radical species such as sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh wang and wang 2018 in order to avoid excessive consumption of energy or chemicals in homogeneous activation systems efficient heterogeneous systems have been extensively studied in which catalysts can be easily separated from the treated water for recycle chen et al 2008 li et al 2018 however heterogeneous systems still suffer from secondary pollution caused by metal leaching therefore it is highly desirable to develop environment friendly metal free catalysts for high efficient removal of organic pollutants recently carbonaceous materials have been proposed as a new class of non metal persulfate activators qin et al 2018 shao et al 2018 however the catalytic properties of the pristine carbons are always unsatisfactory duan et al 2015a in this regard considerable efforts have been devoted to break the inertness and improve the catalytic performance through chemical modification gao et al 2018 guo et al 2016 heteroatom doping especially nitrogen doping was proven to be a simple but effective way to modulate the electronic properties of sp2 hybridized carbon frameworks and create more active sites liu et al 2018 in the nitrogen doping processes three typical n bonding configurations pyridinic n pyrrolic n and graphitic n are usually formed in the carbon networks duan et al 2015b guo et al 2016 some research groups have investigated the possible role of different n bonding configurations on catalytic performance however there is still great controversy about which n type is responsible for the active sites duan et al 2015b found that graphitic n played a key role on n doped carbon nanotubes with pms activation li et al 2018 verified that pyrrolic n acted as the adsorption sites for organic molecules in a fenton like process guo et al 2016 confirmed that carbon atoms with lewis basicity next to pyridinic n were responsible for the oxygen reduction reaction revealing the effective type of incorporated nitrogen is of great significance for the subsequent method design in terms of which a more in depth study is highly in demand moreover as researches progressed nonradical oxidation pathways were discovered in the persulfate activation duan et al 2018 different from the widely recognized radical based pathways how the persulfate activation occurs and contributes to the organic degradation in a nonradical pathway remain mysterious singlet oxygen 1o2 was considered as the dominant reactive oxidative species ros in pds activation with various carbon materials cheng et al 2017 luo et al 2019 yin et al 2019 however the current mechanism that 1o2 was derived from the reaction between ketone groups and pds is unreliable the formation of 1o2 via ketone catalysis is well known in case of pms but not pds montgomery 2002 zhou et al 2015 on the other hand there were also reports that pds or pms could bind onto the surface of catalysts to form reactive complexes which then reacted with the organic contaminant rapidly yun et al 2018 sun et al 2014 reported that carbon nanotubes cnts could active persulfate to generate so4 however lee et al 2015 stated that the formation of so4 were not involved in these processes instead they suggested surface bound reactive complexes were responsible for the contaminant removal more recently guan et al 2017 2018 also explored these cnts persulfate systems in their studies reactive complexes were found to be the main active species in the cnts pds system while both radicals oh and so4 and nonradical species 1o2 and reactive complexes contributed to the contaminant degradation in the cnts pms system hence more studies are required to fully understand the novel oxidation technology based on nonradical activation of persulfate considering the practical application of carbonaceous materials in wastewater treatment it is still a long term goal for the use of well reported nanocarbons due to their current high manufacturing cost zhu et al 2018a biochar bc as a low cost widely available and environment friendly carbonaceous material has drawn significant attention from worldwide researchers recently liu et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 in previous studies bc was simply assessed as carriers for metal stabilization hussain et al 2017 exploration of the ability of bc itself in converting or catalytically degrading organic pollutants especially in persulfate activation processes is just beginning fang et al 2015 demonstrated that persistent free radicals pfrs formed during the pyrolysis of biomass could deliver electrons to pds to evolve so4 zhu et al 2018a reported that n doped graphitic bc exhibited high efficiency for pds activation to the best of our knowledge the critical role of different n bonding configurations in n doped bc nbc is still lack of research and comprehensive understanding of the nbc pds system is also highly in demand in this study we prepared nbcs by pyrolyzing corncob biomass and urea in different proportions the catalytic performance and experimental parameters were evaluated taking sulfadiazine sdz a typical refractory antibiotic as the target contaminant for the first time the critical role of edge nitrogenation of bc structure in pds activation was clarified by both dynamic fitting and density functional theory dft calculations additionally a thorough investigation was conducted to elucidate the pds activation mechanism by nbc through chemical quenching experiments esr detection oxidant consumption monitoring and electrochemical analysis this study is expected to deepen the understanding of the carbon based aops mechanism and provide technical support for the bc mediated persulfate activation in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all reagents were of analytical pure grade see supporting information text s1 and used without further purification deionized water with resistivity of 18 2 mÏ cm 1 was used as required in all experiments 2 2 biochar preparation biochar samples were synthesized according to methods described in the literature sun et al 2013 2014 but with some modification corncob biomass collected from a farmland of harbin heilongjiang china was used as the precursor to produce biochar under oxygen limited conditions in a tubular furnace the corncob was washed with deionized water three times and was dried at 80 c the dried corncob was then grounded into powder and passed through a 100 mesh sieve typically 5 g of corncob powder was added to the urea solution in the weight ratio of 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 the mixture was stirred for 12 h and then dried at 80 c after that the obtained mixture was transferred to the furnace heated at 5 c min 1 to 700 c and maintained under a nitrogen flow for 2 h the obtained biochars were then grounded into fine particles passed through a 100 mesh sieve and designated as bc and nbcx x 1 2 3 4 2 3 chemical analysis characterization methods of the prepared biochar samples were described in text s2 concentration of sdz was analyzed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector see text s3 for detail electron spin resonance esr experiments were performed by a bruker a200 esr spectrometer to detect the reactive oxidative species using dmpo or temp as the spin trapper electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation chi660e with a three electrode cell and details were appended in text s4 the concentration of pds was measured spectrophotometrically based on the method proposed by liang et al 2008 see text s5 for detail measurements of so4 2 were conducted by ion chromatography dionex as3000 equipped with a conductivity detector 2 4 batch experiments the sdz degradation experiments were conducted in conical flasks covered with tinfoil at room temperature 25 2 c 0 1 l sdz solution was vigorously mixed by a magnetic stirring device at constant stirring rate 600 rpm the initial ph of the solution was adjusted by naoh and h2so4 to initiate the experiments a quantity of biochar and pds were simultaneously added to the reactor at the given interval 1 ml aliquots were sampled and immediately quenched with 1 ml sodium thiosulfate 0 2 m then filtered with 0 22 Î¼m filter film and collected into vials rapidly 2 5 computational methods the models of bc and nbc were created using gauss view 5 0 8 the dangling bonds of the edge atoms were terminated with h atoms to obtain a neutral cluster all calculations were performed with the gaussian 09 package revision d 01 geometry optimization and frequency analysis were performed at the b3lyp 6 31g d p level solvation model smd was employed to mimic water solvent effects ribeiro et al 2010 electrostatic potential esp distributions were constructed with gauss view 5 0 on the basis of the optimized models due to the size and edge effects the properties estimated with the finite sized model may vary from those of the real system to some extent however it can be expected that the results obtained with the current models would be qualitatively reliable in predicting the local chemical properties 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of materials sem images and eds elemental mappings of the obtained biochar samples are shown in fig 1 compared to the dense morphology and smooth surface of bc fig 1 a a fluffy and crinkled structure was formed in the presence of urea fig 1 b during the pyrolysis process gas was released due to the decomposition of urea lin et al 2012 this process promoted the exfoliation of the carbon layers leading to the formation of more wrinkles and pores in nbc samples the element distribution within the carbon based matrix was then examined as displayed in fig 1 c and d three main components of c o n were revealed and the nbc sample presented an apparent enhancement in the n content compared with the pristine bc sample xrd patterns of bc and nbc are illustrated in fig 2 a both bc and nbc samples showed broad diffraction peaks at 2Éµ 42 5 corresponding to the 100 plane of crystalline carbon cazetta et al 2018 two pronounced diffraction peaks appeared after the introduction of urea at 2Éµ 14 5 and 25 1 which can be attributed to the 001 and 002 planes of graphitic carbon cazetta et al 2018 these results further indicated that nitrogen atoms were successfully doped into the original biochar and the improved graphitization degree implied better electronic properties zhu et al 2018a raman spectra was collected to further investigate the local structural properties of the biochar samples obtained with or without urea as shown in fig 2 b both bc and nbc samples displayed two prominent peaks at 1320 1580 cm 1 which are attributed to the d and g bands respectively smith et al 2016 the d band originates from the defects and disorder in the carbon layers while the g band is closely associated with the crystalline and graphitic structures smith et al 2016 therefore the integrated intensity ratio of d to g id ig can be used to reflect the defective degree of the biochar samples the id ig values increased from 2 19 for bc to 2 32 for nbc1 indicating that more defective sites were formed by integrating the nitrogen atoms into the sp2 carbon network the high id ig values of these biochar samples can be attributed to the condensation process in which small organic molecules were converted to conjugated aromatic rings and a large number of defective edges were formed along the biochar boundary at the same time keiluweit et al 2010 additionally the increased defective degree of nbc can be due to the carbon layer deformation caused by the nitrogen doping lin et al 2012 xps survey was then conducted to explore the composition and chemical states of the prepared biochar samples as shown in fig 2 c three main peaks were observed at 284 5 395 and 530 ev corresponding to c1s n1s and o1s respectively liang et al 2017 the atomic percentages were listed in table 1 as the doping ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 4 the nitrogen dopants increased from 3 49 at to 11 16 at high resolution xps n 1s spectra were then collected to quantify the types and contents of nitrogen dopants as shown in fig 2 d three peaks with binding energy at 398 3 400 0 and 401 5 ev were fitted which were respectively assigned to pyridinic n pyrrolic n and graphitic n liang et al 2017 considering the detected total nitrogen content the overall content of each nitrogen based moiety is determined and listed in table 1 it can be concluded that the urea derived nitrogen functionalization lead to preferential introduction of pyridinic n and pyrrolic n while no obvious regularity was found in the content of graphitic n 3 2 evaluation of the nbc performance on pds activation sulfadiazine was first used as the target organic contaminant to evaluate the catalytic performance of the prepared biochar materials for the persulfate activation as shown in fig s1 direct oxidation by pds accounted for 6 54 of the sdz removal within 60 min for bc nbc1 and nbc2 the removal of sdz via adsorption was negligible probably due to the lower sbet values listed in table 1 for nbc3 and nbc4 the adsorption removal of sdz increased to 6 42 and 6 89 respectively which is consistent with the fact that a great increase in the sbet was found when the urea doping ratio was increased from 2 to 3 as for the activation performance as shown in fig s2 the apparent reaction rate constants k for biochar samples with different nitrogen doping amounts were fitted and listed in table 1 remarkably the removal performance of sdz by bc pds was enhanced after nitrogen modification we also examined the catalytic activity of biochar samples derived from other precursors and proved the universality of performance improvement by nitrogen doping fig s3 furthermore the reusability of the prepared nbc sample was tested fig s4 the sdz removal efficiency was found to decrease from 96 5 to 83 0 after three cycles which was mainly due to the changes in the nbc surface chemistry the sample catalysis was then successfully recovered by a heat treatment method proposed by kang et al 2018 back to the present study as shown in fig 3 a the reaction rate increased as the doping amounts increased a sharp rise was observed when the doping ratio was increased from 2 to 3 which may be resulted from the stronger adsorption capacity the successful performance of nbc in the catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants can in part be attributed to a large specific surface area ssa which provides more reactive sites peng et al 2013 in the present study a close correlation was found between the k and sbet with a correlation coefficient of 0 981 fig s5 3 3 identification of the reactive sites in nbc for pds activation doping nitrogen atoms is considered to be an effective means to improve the catalytic performance of inert carbonaceous materials by adjusting the spin density and charge distribution liu et al 2018 however whether the reactive sites are produced by pyridinic n pyrrolic n or graphitic n is still under debate guo et al 2016 xu et al 2016 yin et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to understand the types and contents of nitrogen dopants in the biochar induced persulfate activation process to investigate the possible role that nitrogen dopants play in the catalytic oxidation process the effect of sbet was excluded and the normalized reaction rate constants k sbet were listed in table 1 as shown in fig 3 b the value of k sbet was closely correlated with the content of the incorporated pyridinic n and pyrrolic n the correlation coefficients were calculated to be 0 907 and 0 913 respectively however the graphitic n showed a poor correlation with the coefficient of 0 201 fig s6 these results suggested that the reactive sites of biochar in the persulfate activation are mainly the pyridinic n and pyrrolic n which is similar to the conclusion of oxygen reduction reaction guo et al 2016 esp distributions on the van der waals surface have long been used to predict the reaction sites politzer et al 1985 sjoberg and politzer 1990 negative and positive areas are expected to be promising reactive sites for reduction and oxidation reaction respectively therefore we investigated the distributions of esp on bc and nbc to provide a more intuitive analysis as displayed in fig 3 c the esp distribution of bc carbon network is very uniform for the identical elements however when the three chemical states of n were introduced into the network the esp distribution becomes uneven fig 3 d two extremum values were found around the pyridinic n atom and the h atom adjacent to the pyrrolic n atom suggesting that electron rich regions were formed around the pyridinic n atom and the pyrrolic n atom results of esp distributions are consistent with those of rate fitting further indicating that the edge nitrogenation was responsible for the pds activation from above the biochar was successfully used in persulfate activation nitrogen doping using urea as the precursor significantly improved the sdz removal performance larger ssa and nitrogen atom incorporation were the main reasons for the enhancement edge nitrogen types pyridinic n and pyrrolic n rather than the internal type graphitic n played the critical role in the activation process there was a steep rise in the removal rate when the doping ratio was increased from 2 to 3 thus nbc3 was selected for further experiments and experimental parameters that may influence the removal kinetics were examined next 3 4 effect of key experimental parameters on sdz removal as shown in fig 4 a the nbc dosage showed a positive effect on sdz degradation 85 6 of sdz was removed with 0 5 g l 1 over 60 min after increasing the catalyst dosage to 1 0 g l 1 the sdz removal efficiency increased to 96 2 similar sdz removal efficiency was obtained within only 10 min when further increasing the catalyst dosage to 3 0 g l 1 thus the sdz degradation rate dramatically increased as the nbc dosage increased from 0 5 g l 1 to 3 0 g l 1 which could be attributed to the more active sites provided by larger nbc amounts it was reported that the pds concentration would affect the degradation of organic pollutants wang et al 2019 excessive pds concentration will always result in a decrease in performance by consuming reactive oxidation species however in our study there was no significant correlation between sdz removal rate and pds concentration fig 4 b 95 4 of sdz removal was obtained with 0 25 mm pds a slight increase in sdz removal to 97 1 was observed when the pds concentration was increased to 0 5 mm we did not find any inhibition of sdz removal performance even though we further increased the pds concentration to 3 0 mm these results indicate that the nbc pds system may not be a radical based oxidation system which was investigated in detail in section 3 5 fig 4 c shows the effect of initial sdz concentration on sdz removal kinetics as the concentration increased from 1 Î¼m to 20 Î¼m sdz could be almost completely removed when the concentration was increased to 50 Î¼m the removal efficiency was lowered to 76 4 thus a negative correlation between the removal rate and sdz concentration was found suggesting that more reaction time is required as the sdz concentration in the system increases the effects of different initial ph values on sdz degradation in the nbc pds system were also investigated as shown in fig 4 d sdz was removed over time without any significant difference at ph 5 9 a slight decrease in sdz removal was found at ph 3 and a large inhibition was observed when the ph was adjusted to 11 this phenomenon can be explained by the ph dependent nbc surface charge and sdz chemical speciation zeta potential values of nbc at different ph values were then measured and shown in fig s7 the nbc surface was positive below ph 4 which could be attributed to the protonation of unsaturated c atoms and heterocyclic n atoms radovic et al 2000 in addition sdz in water exists dominantly as the cation uncharged or anion molecules as ph rises due to proton exchange at the aromatic amine and sulfonamide groups pka1 2 0 pka2 6 4 boreen et al 2005 the interaction between the nbc surface and sdz molecules was impeded due to the Ï Ï electron donor acceptor interactions at relatively acidic region and charge repulsion at relatively alkaline region marc et al 2011 therefore nbc is effective for pds activation over a wide ph range of 5 9 which is sufficient for wastewater treatment 3 5 nonradical pathway dominated by electron transfer 3 5 1 quenching experiments it is well known that pds activation by metal based catalysts undergoes a free radical based oxidation mechanism as for pds activation by metal free catalysts although various studies have been conducted there is still a bitter controversy about the activation mechanism therefore it is necessary to reveal the oxidative species in the nbc pds system radical quenching experiments were conducted first using various scavengers as shown in fig 5 the effect on the sdz removal rate was negligible when methanol meth 1 m was added to the nbc pds system indicating a rather limited contribution of oh and so4 previous studies have pointed out that alcohols such as ethanol can react with oh or so4 to form alcohol radicals ars which may also contribute to the contaminant degradation zhu et al 2018b however in the present study the contribution of ars to the sdz degradation was ruled out hardly any sdz removal was observed when 1 m meth was added to the fe2 pds system indicating that ars could not react with sdz fig s8 the addition of another common free radical scavenger tert butanol tba resulted in a reduction in the removal rate of 44 5 compared with the control group our previous study explained the odd results of tba in some quenching experiments that is tba is not suitable for free radical identification in carbon involved systems because it prevents the electron transfer on the carbon surface wang et al 2019 these results suggested a nonradical pathway in the nbc pds system furfuryl alcohol ffa was considered as a unique quencher for 1o2 and was used in this study to confirm the presence of 1o2 xu et al 2011 removal of sdz was significantly inhibited in the presence of ffa 20 mm consistent with previously reported results that 1o2 dominated the pds activation process cheng et al 2017 however further experiments were carried out to examine the removal of ffa in our nbc pds system and a negative performance was obtained fig s9 suggesting that 1o2 may not be the primary active species responsible for the sdz oxidation these results were consistent with the research of guan et al 2017 that high concentrations of ffa would affect surface properties of cnts and ultimately lead to the inhibition of contaminant removal potassium iodide ki was then employed as a quencher for the surface bound reactive species and it was found the reaction was almost completely terminated huang et al 2014 therefore it is assumed here that the nbc pds system experiences a nonradical pathway in which surface bound nbc pds complexes rather than 1o2 play a major role 3 5 2 esr detection to further demonstrate the nonradical mechanism in the nbc pds system esr experiments were conducted using dmpo as active species trapping agents as shown in fig 6 a no obvious signals were observed when only pds was present unlike the signals of dmpo oh or dmpo so4 adducts a clear characteristic signal of dmpox adducts 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl was detected after adding nbc fontmorin et al 2016 the absence of traditional free radical adducts further confirmed that oh and so4 were not involved in the degradative mechanism previous studies confirmed that both carbon surface bound oxidative complexes and 1o2 can react with dmpo to form the oxidized derivative dmpox jiang et al 2018 li et al 2018 thus the trapping experiments with dmpo cannot distinguish between these two nonradical pathways esr experiments using temp as a spin trap for capturing 1o2 was then performed to provide more evidences interestingly a noticeable three line pattern corresponding to tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl was observed which was always attribute to the formation of temp 1o2 adducts fig 6 b luo et al 2019 yin et al 2019 it is plausible so far that the singlet oxygenation does occur during the pds activation however as displayed in fig 5 c solvent exchange h2o to d2o did not increase the esr intensity of tempo which was inconsistent with the usual 1o2 behavior in d2o as the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 20 32 Î¼s is more than 10 fold longer than in h2o 2 Î¼s gorman and rodgers 1981 these results implied that the tempo signal observed in the bc pds system in presence of temp as a spin trap may not indicate the formation of 1o2 nardi et al 2014 denoted that the tempo esr method could lead to significant overestimation of 1o2 yield by ignoring the critical role of electron transfer a single electron transfer reaction can occur between temp and excited sensitizers resulting in the generation of temp radical cations followed by deprotonation and reaction with dissolved oxygen to form tempo thus tempo signals considered as evidence for singlet oxygenation in pds activation here could instead correspond to an electron transfer mechanism where nbc mediated the electron transfer from temp to pds resulting in temp production so far the possibility of 1o2 dominating in the nbc pds system was ruled out and surface bound complexes were believed to play a critical role in the nonradical pathway this surface bonding interaction was also confirmed by the ftir spectroscopy fig s10 where increases in absorption at 1074 and 702 cm 1 respectively assigned to the symmetric vibration of sos and bending vibration of s o were observed when nbc was combined with pds almeida jÃºnior et al 2013 3 5 3 decomposition of pds and formation of so4 2 in the nbc pds system the conversion of pds in the nbc pds system was then monitored to go deep into this nonradical mechanism as shown in fig 7 pds was decomposed by nbc in the absence of sdz and so4 2 formation was detected at the same time indicating that electron transfer occurred within the complexes from nbc to pds when sdz was introduced into the nbc pds system significant increasements were found in the pds decomposition rate and so4 2 generation rate these results further excluded the possible contribution of 1o2 on the one hand and confirmed the electron transfer process between the nbc pds complexes and sdz from sdz to pds where nbc acted as an electron mediator moreover the difference in the stoichiometric amounts between pds decomposition and so4 2 generation further indicated the formation of nbc pds complexes 3 5 4 electrochemical analysis the foregoing electron transfer nonradical pathway was further demonstrated by electrochemical measurements electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of bc and nbc were measured first to understand the effect of heteroatoms on the conductivity of the catalysts fig 8 a showed the obtained nyquist plots corresponding fitted curves as well as the equivalent circuit model a smaller semicircle diameter was observed in nbc and the charge transfer resistance values of bc and nbc were estimated to be 3 007 Ï cm 2 and 2 418 Ï cm 2 respectively indicating that the heteroatom incorporation led to a higher conductivity and thus promised faster electronics chronoamperometry test was then conducted to investigate the electron transfer among catalysts pds molecules and sdz molecules as displayed in fig 8 b the injection of 1 mm pds and 10 Î¼m sdz had significant impact on the current output this is a direct evidence proving that the electron transfer among pds catalyst surface and sdz does occur in the case of nbc with the injection of pds the current density immediately increased from about 2 43 to 27 41 Î¼a cm 2 which was higher than that of 0 26 to 13 22 Î¼a cm 2 for bc similar phenomenon occurred with the addition of sdz these results demonstrated that the electron transfer occurred in the nbc pds sdz system the interaction among pds nbc surface and sdz was facilitated due to the edge nitrogenation which accounted for the enhancement of sdz removal rate furthermore as can be seen from linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves fig 8 c the current density increased with the addition of pds suggesting that metastable reactive complexes formed due to the interaction between pds and nbc as well lee et al 2016 another obvious increase of current density was detected with the addition of sdz indicating that electrons transferred from sdz to the surface confined nonradical species 3 5 5 electron transfer mechanism in the nbc pds system based on the above analysis an electron transfer dominated mechanism in the nbc pds system for sdz removal are illustrated as follows 1 n b c p d s n b c p d s 2 n b c p e d s n b c o x 2 s o 4 2 3 s d z n e b c p e d s s d z o x n b c 2 s o 4 2 where nbc pds represented nbc pds complexes nbcox represented the oxidation state of nbc and sdzox was the corresponding oxidation products edge nitrogenation pyridinic n and pyrrolic n greatly changed the charge distribution of original bc thereby forming regions of low and high electron density more reactive sites were generated accordingly which facilitated the interaction between nbc and pds to form surface bonding complexes reaction 1 inner electron transfer within the complexes reaction 2 together with the nbc mediated electron transfer process from sdz to pds reaction 3 was enhanced due to the modulated electron structure reduction of pds occurred over the electron rich n dopants while oxidation of sdz took place around the adjacent electron deficient c atoms this nbc pds system underwent a nonradical pathway dominated by electron transfer different from the generally accepted mechanism in which oh so4 or 1o2 played a major role 3 6 effect of water matrices on sdz degradation by the nbc pds system the inorganic anions in an aquatic environment can act as radical scavengers to inhibit degradation performance in a radical based oxidation process lutze et al 2015 wang et al 2016 nonradical aops were considered to be an effective strategy to overcome this limitation luo et al 2019 reported that bisphenol a was efficiently removed in a 1o2 dominated nonradical system even under high salinity condition we confirmed that the nbc pds system followed a nonradical pathway dominated by electron transfer and hardly any radicals were produced during the catalytic process therefore the effects of various anions on sdz degradation by nbc pds were investigated for its practical application encouragingly as shown in fig 9 a negligible effect was observed in presence of chloride ions cl nitrate ions no3 phosphate ions po4 3 or bicarbonate ions hco3 side reactions between radicals and anions were successfully avoided which ensured the high removal rate of sdz in the nbc pds system natural organic matter nom which is ubiquitous in natural water can scavenge radicals and other oxidizing species thereby lowering the oxidizing capacity of oxidation processes wang et al 2016 in this work humic acid ha was selected as a typical nom to evaluate the effect of nom on sdz degradation unfortunately as shown in fig 9 b the addition of ha still adversely affected the degradation of sdz in the electron transfer process the removal efficiency of sdz decreased from 96 to 65 when the ha concentration was increased from 0 to 20 mg l 1 this suppression effect of ha could be attributed to the competitive reactions between ha and sdz on the nbc surface wang et al 2016 4 conclusions in summary nbcs were synthesized by pyrolyzing corncob biomass and urea in different proportion at 700 c the obtained nbcs exhibited superior catalytic performance for pds activation in sdz removal the mixing ratio of corncob and urea was optimized to be 1 3 at which a sharp rise in the sdz removal rate was obtained larger ssa and nitrogen atom incorporation were the reasons for the improved performance edge nitrogenation in the bc structure was revealed to be responsible for the pds activation the incorporation of edge nitrogen configurations pyridinic n and pyrrolic n rather than graphitic n successfully broke the inert original bc electronic properties extreme points of electrostatic potential at the carbon layer boundaries were thus created resulting in the formation of low and high electron density regions reduction of pds took place over the electron rich n dopants and oxidation of sdz occurred around the adjacent electron deficient c atoms briefly a nonradical mechanism dominated by electron transfer instead of 1o2 was confirmed in the nbc pds system where nbc served as an electron mediator and promised the electron transfer from sdz to pds benefit from the electron transfer mechanism the nbc pds system showed high resistance to inorganic anions but was still negatively affected by nom in an aquatic environment we believe this work will deepen the understanding of the carbon driven persulfate activation mechanism and provide strong technical support for the bc mediated persulfate activation in practical application declaration of interests the

18752,n doped biochars nbcs were prepared by pyrolyzing corncob biomass and urea in different proportion which manifested superior catalytic performance of peroxydisulfate pds activation for sulfadiazine sdz degradation through both dynamic fitting and density functional theory dft calculations the critical role of edge nitrogenation in biochar bc structure was revealed for the first time the incorporation of edge nitrogen configurations pyridinic n and pyrrolic n rather than graphitic n generated reactive sites for the pds activation additionally a thorough investigation was conducted to explicate the pds activation mechanism by nbc through chemical quenching experiments electron spin resonance esr detection oxidant consumption monitoring and electrochemical analysis different from the well reported singlet oxygen 1o2 dominated nonradical mechanism an electron transfer pathway involving surface bound reactive complexes was proved to play a major role in the nbc pds system benefit from the electron transfer mechanism the nbc pds system not only has wide ph adaptation for real application but also shows high resistance to the inorganic anions in aquatic environment we believe this study will deepen the understanding of the carbon driven persulfate activation mechanism and provide strong technical support for the bc mediated persulfate activation in practical applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar peroxydisulfate nitrogen doping electron transfer singlet oxygen sulfadiazine 1 introduction water pollution caused by refractory organics has become a serious problem threatening ecological security and human health in recent decades wu et al 2018 xu et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 advanced oxidation processes aops show significant removal efficiency for these organics in contrast with the inadequate traditional biological treatment methods among the various aops persulfate based advanced oxidation processes have aroused great interest due to their chemical stability and high storability chu et al 2016 in general persulfates such as peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds themselves present low oxidative potential for organic decomposition wacÅawek et al 2017 however the peroxide bonds of persulfates can be readily cleaved by catalysts or externally supplied energy leading to the generation of more reactive radical species such as sulfate radicals so4 and hydroxyl radicals oh wang and wang 2018 in order to avoid excessive consumption of energy or chemicals in homogeneous activation systems efficient heterogeneous systems have been extensively studied in which catalysts can be easily separated from the treated water for recycle chen et al 2008 li et al 2018 however heterogeneous systems still suffer from secondary pollution caused by metal leaching therefore it is highly desirable to develop environment friendly metal free catalysts for high efficient removal of organic pollutants recently carbonaceous materials have been proposed as a new class of non metal persulfate activators qin et al 2018 shao et al 2018 however the catalytic properties of the pristine carbons are always unsatisfactory duan et al 2015a in this regard considerable efforts have been devoted to break the inertness and improve the catalytic performance through chemical modification gao et al 2018 guo et al 2016 heteroatom doping especially nitrogen doping was proven to be a simple but effective way to modulate the electronic properties of sp2 hybridized carbon frameworks and create more active sites liu et al 2018 in the nitrogen doping processes three typical n bonding configurations pyridinic n pyrrolic n and graphitic n are usually formed in the carbon networks duan et al 2015b guo et al 2016 some research groups have investigated the possible role of different n bonding configurations on catalytic performance however there is still great controversy about which n type is responsible for the active sites duan et al 2015b found that graphitic n played a key role on n doped carbon nanotubes with pms activation li et al 2018 verified that pyrrolic n acted as the adsorption sites for organic molecules in a fenton like process guo et al 2016 confirmed that carbon atoms with lewis basicity next to pyridinic n were responsible for the oxygen reduction reaction revealing the effective type of incorporated nitrogen is of great significance for the subsequent method design in terms of which a more in depth study is highly in demand moreover as researches progressed nonradical oxidation pathways were discovered in the persulfate activation duan et al 2018 different from the widely recognized radical based pathways how the persulfate activation occurs and contributes to the organic degradation in a nonradical pathway remain mysterious singlet oxygen 1o2 was considered as the dominant reactive oxidative species ros in pds activation with various carbon materials cheng et al 2017 luo et al 2019 yin et al 2019 however the current mechanism that 1o2 was derived from the reaction between ketone groups and pds is unreliable the formation of 1o2 via ketone catalysis is well known in case of pms but not pds montgomery 2002 zhou et al 2015 on the other hand there were also reports that pds or pms could bind onto the surface of catalysts to form reactive complexes which then reacted with the organic contaminant rapidly yun et al 2018 sun et al 2014 reported that carbon nanotubes cnts could active persulfate to generate so4 however lee et al 2015 stated that the formation of so4 were not involved in these processes instead they suggested surface bound reactive complexes were responsible for the contaminant removal more recently guan et al 2017 2018 also explored these cnts persulfate systems in their studies reactive complexes were found to be the main active species in the cnts pds system while both radicals oh and so4 and nonradical species 1o2 and reactive complexes contributed to the contaminant degradation in the cnts pms system hence more studies are required to fully understand the novel oxidation technology based on nonradical activation of persulfate considering the practical application of carbonaceous materials in wastewater treatment it is still a long term goal for the use of well reported nanocarbons due to their current high manufacturing cost zhu et al 2018a biochar bc as a low cost widely available and environment friendly carbonaceous material has drawn significant attention from worldwide researchers recently liu et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 in previous studies bc was simply assessed as carriers for metal stabilization hussain et al 2017 exploration of the ability of bc itself in converting or catalytically degrading organic pollutants especially in persulfate activation processes is just beginning fang et al 2015 demonstrated that persistent free radicals pfrs formed during the pyrolysis of biomass could deliver electrons to pds to evolve so4 zhu et al 2018a reported that n doped graphitic bc exhibited high efficiency for pds activation to the best of our knowledge the critical role of different n bonding configurations in n doped bc nbc is still lack of research and comprehensive understanding of the nbc pds system is also highly in demand in this study we prepared nbcs by pyrolyzing corncob biomass and urea in different proportions the catalytic performance and experimental parameters were evaluated taking sulfadiazine sdz a typical refractory antibiotic as the target contaminant for the first time the critical role of edge nitrogenation of bc structure in pds activation was clarified by both dynamic fitting and density functional theory dft calculations additionally a thorough investigation was conducted to elucidate the pds activation mechanism by nbc through chemical quenching experiments esr detection oxidant consumption monitoring and electrochemical analysis this study is expected to deepen the understanding of the carbon based aops mechanism and provide technical support for the bc mediated persulfate activation in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all reagents were of analytical pure grade see supporting information text s1 and used without further purification deionized water with resistivity of 18 2 mÏ cm 1 was used as required in all experiments 2 2 biochar preparation biochar samples were synthesized according to methods described in the literature sun et al 2013 2014 but with some modification corncob biomass collected from a farmland of harbin heilongjiang china was used as the precursor to produce biochar under oxygen limited conditions in a tubular furnace the corncob was washed with deionized water three times and was dried at 80 c the dried corncob was then grounded into powder and passed through a 100 mesh sieve typically 5 g of corncob powder was added to the urea solution in the weight ratio of 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 the mixture was stirred for 12 h and then dried at 80 c after that the obtained mixture was transferred to the furnace heated at 5 c min 1 to 700 c and maintained under a nitrogen flow for 2 h the obtained biochars were then grounded into fine particles passed through a 100 mesh sieve and designated as bc and nbcx x 1 2 3 4 2 3 chemical analysis characterization methods of the prepared biochar samples were described in text s2 concentration of sdz was analyzed by an ultra performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector see text s3 for detail electron spin resonance esr experiments were performed by a bruker a200 esr spectrometer to detect the reactive oxidative species using dmpo or temp as the spin trapper electrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation chi660e with a three electrode cell and details were appended in text s4 the concentration of pds was measured spectrophotometrically based on the method proposed by liang et al 2008 see text s5 for detail measurements of so4 2 were conducted by ion chromatography dionex as3000 equipped with a conductivity detector 2 4 batch experiments the sdz degradation experiments were conducted in conical flasks covered with tinfoil at room temperature 25 2 c 0 1 l sdz solution was vigorously mixed by a magnetic stirring device at constant stirring rate 600 rpm the initial ph of the solution was adjusted by naoh and h2so4 to initiate the experiments a quantity of biochar and pds were simultaneously added to the reactor at the given interval 1 ml aliquots were sampled and immediately quenched with 1 ml sodium thiosulfate 0 2 m then filtered with 0 22 Î¼m filter film and collected into vials rapidly 2 5 computational methods the models of bc and nbc were created using gauss view 5 0 8 the dangling bonds of the edge atoms were terminated with h atoms to obtain a neutral cluster all calculations were performed with the gaussian 09 package revision d 01 geometry optimization and frequency analysis were performed at the b3lyp 6 31g d p level solvation model smd was employed to mimic water solvent effects ribeiro et al 2010 electrostatic potential esp distributions were constructed with gauss view 5 0 on the basis of the optimized models due to the size and edge effects the properties estimated with the finite sized model may vary from those of the real system to some extent however it can be expected that the results obtained with the current models would be qualitatively reliable in predicting the local chemical properties 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of materials sem images and eds elemental mappings of the obtained biochar samples are shown in fig 1 compared to the dense morphology and smooth surface of bc fig 1 a a fluffy and crinkled structure was formed in the presence of urea fig 1 b during the pyrolysis process gas was released due to the decomposition of urea lin et al 2012 this process promoted the exfoliation of the carbon layers leading to the formation of more wrinkles and pores in nbc samples the element distribution within the carbon based matrix was then examined as displayed in fig 1 c and d three main components of c o n were revealed and the nbc sample presented an apparent enhancement in the n content compared with the pristine bc sample xrd patterns of bc and nbc are illustrated in fig 2 a both bc and nbc samples showed broad diffraction peaks at 2Éµ 42 5 corresponding to the 100 plane of crystalline carbon cazetta et al 2018 two pronounced diffraction peaks appeared after the introduction of urea at 2Éµ 14 5 and 25 1 which can be attributed to the 001 and 002 planes of graphitic carbon cazetta et al 2018 these results further indicated that nitrogen atoms were successfully doped into the original biochar and the improved graphitization degree implied better electronic properties zhu et al 2018a raman spectra was collected to further investigate the local structural properties of the biochar samples obtained with or without urea as shown in fig 2 b both bc and nbc samples displayed two prominent peaks at 1320 1580 cm 1 which are attributed to the d and g bands respectively smith et al 2016 the d band originates from the defects and disorder in the carbon layers while the g band is closely associated with the crystalline and graphitic structures smith et al 2016 therefore the integrated intensity ratio of d to g id ig can be used to reflect the defective degree of the biochar samples the id ig values increased from 2 19 for bc to 2 32 for nbc1 indicating that more defective sites were formed by integrating the nitrogen atoms into the sp2 carbon network the high id ig values of these biochar samples can be attributed to the condensation process in which small organic molecules were converted to conjugated aromatic rings and a large number of defective edges were formed along the biochar boundary at the same time keiluweit et al 2010 additionally the increased defective degree of nbc can be due to the carbon layer deformation caused by the nitrogen doping lin et al 2012 xps survey was then conducted to explore the composition and chemical states of the prepared biochar samples as shown in fig 2 c three main peaks were observed at 284 5 395 and 530 ev corresponding to c1s n1s and o1s respectively liang et al 2017 the atomic percentages were listed in table 1 as the doping ratio increased from 1 0 to 1 4 the nitrogen dopants increased from 3 49 at to 11 16 at high resolution xps n 1s spectra were then collected to quantify the types and contents of nitrogen dopants as shown in fig 2 d three peaks with binding energy at 398 3 400 0 and 401 5 ev were fitted which were respectively assigned to pyridinic n pyrrolic n and graphitic n liang et al 2017 considering the detected total nitrogen content the overall content of each nitrogen based moiety is determined and listed in table 1 it can be concluded that the urea derived nitrogen functionalization lead to preferential introduction of pyridinic n and pyrrolic n while no obvious regularity was found in the content of graphitic n 3 2 evaluation of the nbc performance on pds activation sulfadiazine was first used as the target organic contaminant to evaluate the catalytic performance of the prepared biochar materials for the persulfate activation as shown in fig s1 direct oxidation by pds accounted for 6 54 of the sdz removal within 60 min for bc nbc1 and nbc2 the removal of sdz via adsorption was negligible probably due to the lower sbet values listed in table 1 for nbc3 and nbc4 the adsorption removal of sdz increased to 6 42 and 6 89 respectively which is consistent with the fact that a great increase in the sbet was found when the urea doping ratio was increased from 2 to 3 as for the activation performance as shown in fig s2 the apparent reaction rate constants k for biochar samples with different nitrogen doping amounts were fitted and listed in table 1 remarkably the removal performance of sdz by bc pds was enhanced after nitrogen modification we also examined the catalytic activity of biochar samples derived from other precursors and proved the universality of performance improvement by nitrogen doping fig s3 furthermore the reusability of the prepared nbc sample was tested fig s4 the sdz removal efficiency was found to decrease from 96 5 to 83 0 after three cycles which was mainly due to the changes in the nbc surface chemistry the sample catalysis was then successfully recovered by a heat treatment method proposed by kang et al 2018 back to the present study as shown in fig 3 a the reaction rate increased as the doping amounts increased a sharp rise was observed when the doping ratio was increased from 2 to 3 which may be resulted from the stronger adsorption capacity the successful performance of nbc in the catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants can in part be attributed to a large specific surface area ssa which provides more reactive sites peng et al 2013 in the present study a close correlation was found between the k and sbet with a correlation coefficient of 0 981 fig s5 3 3 identification of the reactive sites in nbc for pds activation doping nitrogen atoms is considered to be an effective means to improve the catalytic performance of inert carbonaceous materials by adjusting the spin density and charge distribution liu et al 2018 however whether the reactive sites are produced by pyridinic n pyrrolic n or graphitic n is still under debate guo et al 2016 xu et al 2016 yin et al 2019 therefore it is imperative to understand the types and contents of nitrogen dopants in the biochar induced persulfate activation process to investigate the possible role that nitrogen dopants play in the catalytic oxidation process the effect of sbet was excluded and the normalized reaction rate constants k sbet were listed in table 1 as shown in fig 3 b the value of k sbet was closely correlated with the content of the incorporated pyridinic n and pyrrolic n the correlation coefficients were calculated to be 0 907 and 0 913 respectively however the graphitic n showed a poor correlation with the coefficient of 0 201 fig s6 these results suggested that the reactive sites of biochar in the persulfate activation are mainly the pyridinic n and pyrrolic n which is similar to the conclusion of oxygen reduction reaction guo et al 2016 esp distributions on the van der waals surface have long been used to predict the reaction sites politzer et al 1985 sjoberg and politzer 1990 negative and positive areas are expected to be promising reactive sites for reduction and oxidation reaction respectively therefore we investigated the distributions of esp on bc and nbc to provide a more intuitive analysis as displayed in fig 3 c the esp distribution of bc carbon network is very uniform for the identical elements however when the three chemical states of n were introduced into the network the esp distribution becomes uneven fig 3 d two extremum values were found around the pyridinic n atom and the h atom adjacent to the pyrrolic n atom suggesting that electron rich regions were formed around the pyridinic n atom and the pyrrolic n atom results of esp distributions are consistent with those of rate fitting further indicating that the edge nitrogenation was responsible for the pds activation from above the biochar was successfully used in persulfate activation nitrogen doping using urea as the precursor significantly improved the sdz removal performance larger ssa and nitrogen atom incorporation were the main reasons for the enhancement edge nitrogen types pyridinic n and pyrrolic n rather than the internal type graphitic n played the critical role in the activation process there was a steep rise in the removal rate when the doping ratio was increased from 2 to 3 thus nbc3 was selected for further experiments and experimental parameters that may influence the removal kinetics were examined next 3 4 effect of key experimental parameters on sdz removal as shown in fig 4 a the nbc dosage showed a positive effect on sdz degradation 85 6 of sdz was removed with 0 5 g l 1 over 60 min after increasing the catalyst dosage to 1 0 g l 1 the sdz removal efficiency increased to 96 2 similar sdz removal efficiency was obtained within only 10 min when further increasing the catalyst dosage to 3 0 g l 1 thus the sdz degradation rate dramatically increased as the nbc dosage increased from 0 5 g l 1 to 3 0 g l 1 which could be attributed to the more active sites provided by larger nbc amounts it was reported that the pds concentration would affect the degradation of organic pollutants wang et al 2019 excessive pds concentration will always result in a decrease in performance by consuming reactive oxidation species however in our study there was no significant correlation between sdz removal rate and pds concentration fig 4 b 95 4 of sdz removal was obtained with 0 25 mm pds a slight increase in sdz removal to 97 1 was observed when the pds concentration was increased to 0 5 mm we did not find any inhibition of sdz removal performance even though we further increased the pds concentration to 3 0 mm these results indicate that the nbc pds system may not be a radical based oxidation system which was investigated in detail in section 3 5 fig 4 c shows the effect of initial sdz concentration on sdz removal kinetics as the concentration increased from 1 Î¼m to 20 Î¼m sdz could be almost completely removed when the concentration was increased to 50 Î¼m the removal efficiency was lowered to 76 4 thus a negative correlation between the removal rate and sdz concentration was found suggesting that more reaction time is required as the sdz concentration in the system increases the effects of different initial ph values on sdz degradation in the nbc pds system were also investigated as shown in fig 4 d sdz was removed over time without any significant difference at ph 5 9 a slight decrease in sdz removal was found at ph 3 and a large inhibition was observed when the ph was adjusted to 11 this phenomenon can be explained by the ph dependent nbc surface charge and sdz chemical speciation zeta potential values of nbc at different ph values were then measured and shown in fig s7 the nbc surface was positive below ph 4 which could be attributed to the protonation of unsaturated c atoms and heterocyclic n atoms radovic et al 2000 in addition sdz in water exists dominantly as the cation uncharged or anion molecules as ph rises due to proton exchange at the aromatic amine and sulfonamide groups pka1 2 0 pka2 6 4 boreen et al 2005 the interaction between the nbc surface and sdz molecules was impeded due to the Ï Ï electron donor acceptor interactions at relatively acidic region and charge repulsion at relatively alkaline region marc et al 2011 therefore nbc is effective for pds activation over a wide ph range of 5 9 which is sufficient for wastewater treatment 3 5 nonradical pathway dominated by electron transfer 3 5 1 quenching experiments it is well known that pds activation by metal based catalysts undergoes a free radical based oxidation mechanism as for pds activation by metal free catalysts although various studies have been conducted there is still a bitter controversy about the activation mechanism therefore it is necessary to reveal the oxidative species in the nbc pds system radical quenching experiments were conducted first using various scavengers as shown in fig 5 the effect on the sdz removal rate was negligible when methanol meth 1 m was added to the nbc pds system indicating a rather limited contribution of oh and so4 previous studies have pointed out that alcohols such as ethanol can react with oh or so4 to form alcohol radicals ars which may also contribute to the contaminant degradation zhu et al 2018b however in the present study the contribution of ars to the sdz degradation was ruled out hardly any sdz removal was observed when 1 m meth was added to the fe2 pds system indicating that ars could not react with sdz fig s8 the addition of another common free radical scavenger tert butanol tba resulted in a reduction in the removal rate of 44 5 compared with the control group our previous study explained the odd results of tba in some quenching experiments that is tba is not suitable for free radical identification in carbon involved systems because it prevents the electron transfer on the carbon surface wang et al 2019 these results suggested a nonradical pathway in the nbc pds system furfuryl alcohol ffa was considered as a unique quencher for 1o2 and was used in this study to confirm the presence of 1o2 xu et al 2011 removal of sdz was significantly inhibited in the presence of ffa 20 mm consistent with previously reported results that 1o2 dominated the pds activation process cheng et al 2017 however further experiments were carried out to examine the removal of ffa in our nbc pds system and a negative performance was obtained fig s9 suggesting that 1o2 may not be the primary active species responsible for the sdz oxidation these results were consistent with the research of guan et al 2017 that high concentrations of ffa would affect surface properties of cnts and ultimately lead to the inhibition of contaminant removal potassium iodide ki was then employed as a quencher for the surface bound reactive species and it was found the reaction was almost completely terminated huang et al 2014 therefore it is assumed here that the nbc pds system experiences a nonradical pathway in which surface bound nbc pds complexes rather than 1o2 play a major role 3 5 2 esr detection to further demonstrate the nonradical mechanism in the nbc pds system esr experiments were conducted using dmpo as active species trapping agents as shown in fig 6 a no obvious signals were observed when only pds was present unlike the signals of dmpo oh or dmpo so4 adducts a clear characteristic signal of dmpox adducts 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl was detected after adding nbc fontmorin et al 2016 the absence of traditional free radical adducts further confirmed that oh and so4 were not involved in the degradative mechanism previous studies confirmed that both carbon surface bound oxidative complexes and 1o2 can react with dmpo to form the oxidized derivative dmpox jiang et al 2018 li et al 2018 thus the trapping experiments with dmpo cannot distinguish between these two nonradical pathways esr experiments using temp as a spin trap for capturing 1o2 was then performed to provide more evidences interestingly a noticeable three line pattern corresponding to tempo 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine n oxyl was observed which was always attribute to the formation of temp 1o2 adducts fig 6 b luo et al 2019 yin et al 2019 it is plausible so far that the singlet oxygenation does occur during the pds activation however as displayed in fig 5 c solvent exchange h2o to d2o did not increase the esr intensity of tempo which was inconsistent with the usual 1o2 behavior in d2o as the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o 20 32 Î¼s is more than 10 fold longer than in h2o 2 Î¼s gorman and rodgers 1981 these results implied that the tempo signal observed in the bc pds system in presence of temp as a spin trap may not indicate the formation of 1o2 nardi et al 2014 denoted that the tempo esr method could lead to significant overestimation of 1o2 yield by ignoring the critical role of electron transfer a single electron transfer reaction can occur between temp and excited sensitizers resulting in the generation of temp radical cations followed by deprotonation and reaction with dissolved oxygen to form tempo thus tempo signals considered as evidence for singlet oxygenation in pds activation here could instead correspond to an electron transfer mechanism where nbc mediated the electron transfer from temp to pds resulting in temp production so far the possibility of 1o2 dominating in the nbc pds system was ruled out and surface bound complexes were believed to play a critical role in the nonradical pathway this surface bonding interaction was also confirmed by the ftir spectroscopy fig s10 where increases in absorption at 1074 and 702 cm 1 respectively assigned to the symmetric vibration of sos and bending vibration of s o were observed when nbc was combined with pds almeida jÃºnior et al 2013 3 5 3 decomposition of pds and formation of so4 2 in the nbc pds system the conversion of pds in the nbc pds system was then monitored to go deep into this nonradical mechanism as shown in fig 7 pds was decomposed by nbc in the absence of sdz and so4 2 formation was detected at the same time indicating that electron transfer occurred within the complexes from nbc to pds when sdz was introduced into the nbc pds system significant increasements were found in the pds decomposition rate and so4 2 generation rate these results further excluded the possible contribution of 1o2 on the one hand and confirmed the electron transfer process between the nbc pds complexes and sdz from sdz to pds where nbc acted as an electron mediator moreover the difference in the stoichiometric amounts between pds decomposition and so4 2 generation further indicated the formation of nbc pds complexes 3 5 4 electrochemical analysis the foregoing electron transfer nonradical pathway was further demonstrated by electrochemical measurements electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis of bc and nbc were measured first to understand the effect of heteroatoms on the conductivity of the catalysts fig 8 a showed the obtained nyquist plots corresponding fitted curves as well as the equivalent circuit model a smaller semicircle diameter was observed in nbc and the charge transfer resistance values of bc and nbc were estimated to be 3 007 Ï cm 2 and 2 418 Ï cm 2 respectively indicating that the heteroatom incorporation led to a higher conductivity and thus promised faster electronics chronoamperometry test was then conducted to investigate the electron transfer among catalysts pds molecules and sdz molecules as displayed in fig 8 b the injection of 1 mm pds and 10 Î¼m sdz had significant impact on the current output this is a direct evidence proving that the electron transfer among pds catalyst surface and sdz does occur in the case of nbc with the injection of pds the current density immediately increased from about 2 43 to 27 41 Î¼a cm 2 which was higher than that of 0 26 to 13 22 Î¼a cm 2 for bc similar phenomenon occurred with the addition of sdz these results demonstrated that the electron transfer occurred in the nbc pds sdz system the interaction among pds nbc surface and sdz was facilitated due to the edge nitrogenation which accounted for the enhancement of sdz removal rate furthermore as can be seen from linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves fig 8 c the current density increased with the addition of pds suggesting that metastable reactive complexes formed due to the interaction between pds and nbc as well lee et al 2016 another obvious increase of current density was detected with the addition of sdz indicating that electrons transferred from sdz to the surface confined nonradical species 3 5 5 electron transfer mechanism in the nbc pds system based on the above analysis an electron transfer dominated mechanism in the nbc pds system for sdz removal are illustrated as follows 1 n b c p d s n b c p d s 2 n b c p e d s n b c o x 2 s o 4 2 3 s d z n e b c p e d s s d z o x n b c 2 s o 4 2 where nbc pds represented nbc pds complexes nbcox represented the oxidation state of nbc and sdzox was the corresponding oxidation products edge nitrogenation pyridinic n and pyrrolic n greatly changed the charge distribution of original bc thereby forming regions of low and high electron density more reactive sites were generated accordingly which facilitated the interaction between nbc and pds to form surface bonding complexes reaction 1 inner electron transfer within the complexes reaction 2 together with the nbc mediated electron transfer process from sdz to pds reaction 3 was enhanced due to the modulated electron structure reduction of pds occurred over the electron rich n dopants while oxidation of sdz took place around the adjacent electron deficient c atoms this nbc pds system underwent a nonradical pathway dominated by electron transfer different from the generally accepted mechanism in which oh so4 or 1o2 played a major role 3 6 effect of water matrices on sdz degradation by the nbc pds system the inorganic anions in an aquatic environment can act as radical scavengers to inhibit degradation performance in a radical based oxidation process lutze et al 2015 wang et al 2016 nonradical aops were considered to be an effective strategy to overcome this limitation luo et al 2019 reported that bisphenol a was efficiently removed in a 1o2 dominated nonradical system even under high salinity condition we confirmed that the nbc pds system followed a nonradical pathway dominated by electron transfer and hardly any radicals were produced during the catalytic process therefore the effects of various anions on sdz degradation by nbc pds were investigated for its practical application encouragingly as shown in fig 9 a negligible effect was observed in presence of chloride ions cl nitrate ions no3 phosphate ions po4 3 or bicarbonate ions hco3 side reactions between radicals and anions were successfully avoided which ensured the high removal rate of sdz in the nbc pds system natural organic matter nom which is ubiquitous in natural water can scavenge radicals and other oxidizing species thereby lowering the oxidizing capacity of oxidation processes wang et al 2016 in this work humic acid ha was selected as a typical nom to evaluate the effect of nom on sdz degradation unfortunately as shown in fig 9 b the addition of ha still adversely affected the degradation of sdz in the electron transfer process the removal efficiency of sdz decreased from 96 to 65 when the ha concentration was increased from 0 to 20 mg l 1 this suppression effect of ha could be attributed to the competitive reactions between ha and sdz on the nbc surface wang et al 2016 4 conclusions in summary nbcs were synthesized by pyrolyzing corncob biomass and urea in different proportion at 700 c the obtained nbcs exhibited superior catalytic performance for pds activation in sdz removal the mixing ratio of corncob and urea was optimized to be 1 3 at which a sharp rise in the sdz removal rate was obtained larger ssa and nitrogen atom incorporation were the reasons for the improved performance edge nitrogenation in the bc structure was revealed to be responsible for the pds activation the incorporation of edge nitrogen configurations pyridinic n and pyrrolic n rather than graphitic n successfully broke the inert original bc electronic properties extreme points of electrostatic potential at the carbon layer boundaries were thus created resulting in the formation of low and high electron density regions reduction of pds took place over the electron rich n dopants and oxidation of sdz occurred around the adjacent electron deficient c atoms briefly a nonradical mechanism dominated by electron transfer instead of 1o2 was confirmed in the nbc pds system where nbc served as an electron mediator and promised the electron transfer from sdz to pds benefit from the electron transfer mechanism the nbc pds system showed high resistance to inorganic anions but was still negatively affected by nom in an aquatic environment we believe this work will deepen the understanding of the carbon driven persulfate activation mechanism and provide strong technical support for the bc mediated persulfate activation in practical application declaration of interests the

18753,bioassays with sea urchin embryos are widely used to define the environmental quality of marine waters anomalies during embryogenesis are generally considered as end points whereas a toxigenomic approach despite it is wide use in other species is yet in its infancy in the present study we evaluated toxigenic effects induced by copper on the sea urchin paracentrotus lividus embryo combining morphological observations with gene expression analysis many anthropogenic activities release copper in the marine environment with harmful effects on aquatic organisms in the present study p lidivus

differentiation detoxification was investigated at early blastula late gastrula and pluteus stage at blastula stage no morphological anomalies were found with early down regulation of genes involved in development differentiation and a moderate up regulation of some detoxification genes at gastrula stage a slight increase in developmental anomalies up to 19 of malformed embryos was followed by an increased number of targeted genes belonging to the same two classes relative to the blastula stage at pluteus stage morphological anomalies increased in a dose dependent manner all the analyzed genes were strongly up regulated stress and skeletogenic genes showing a late response and almost all genes were targeted by copper at all the concentrations tested the present study represents the first

is an essential element playing an important role as co factor for enzymes involved in many cellular processes however copper can be extremely toxic at concentrations recorded in polluted marine areas buffet et al 2011 manzo et al 2010 in the last decades as a result of anthropogenic activities such as mining and smelting municipal wastes agricultural and industrial emissions the concentration of copper in the environment has grown considerably moreover copper pollution is a serious concern in aquaculture environments because cuso4 is commonly used as algaecide fungicide and bactericide to prevent fish disease cerqueira and fernandes 2002 kolok et al 2002 oliveira et al 2004 straus 2008 straus et al 2015 toxic effects of copper on sea urchin are well known inducing embryo malformations

to binding to histidine cysteine and methionine causing protein inactivation camakaris et al 1999 in strongylocentrotus purpuratus copper competes with calcium cations in intracellular ionoregulatory

pagano 1994 inducing skeletal malformations as in s purpuratus morroni et al 2018a warnau et al 1996 found a positive correlation between cu binding sulfhydryl groups and its toxicity in p lividus suggesting an impairment of protein function manzo et al 2008 which affects larval development however despite these evidences of cu interaction with cellular targets the effects at molecular level remains poorly understood in p lividus mainly due to the lack of an annotated genome there is a lot of molecular evidences showing that a rapid cellular adaptation may be activated after a stress in other marine organisms as well as variation in gene expression through rapid and specific activation and or repression of specific genes nadal et al 2011 more recently ruocco et al 2017b showed that in p lividus embryos changes in gene expression levels may be used as early indicator of stress conditions and these authors identified key genes responsible of molecular pathways involved in protection against natural toxins the aim of this study was to analyze toxigenic effects of copper during p lividus early development identifying the induction of specific genes belonging to different

cu exposed embryos showed a development delay with a significant increase of malformed blastulas at increasing copper concentrations p 0 004 fig 2a the percentage of malformed gastrulas was not statistically different from the control p 0 65 and the increase of iti at different concentrations was mainly due to the malformed blastula fig 2a at pluteus stage the percentage of malformed plutei was negligible at 24 and 36 Î¼g l with respect to the control however the percentage of organisms with a developmental delay increased in a dose dependent manner 15 36 and 92 at 24 36 and 48 Î¼g l copper respectively p 0 001 fig 2b in particular at 24 Î¼g l cu 14 was delayed at early pluteus stage and 8 of the incubated embryos was malformed at 36 Î¼g l copper 33 of the embryos were delayed mostly at early pluteus and prism stages with 26 of malformations at the highest copper concentration 48 Î¼g l cu delayed and malformed embryos were almost 89 with 10 early plutei 27 gastrula and 52 prism stages fig 2b normal developed plutei accounted to only 8 in general this dose dependent effect was revealed by an increase of iti at increasing copper concentrations 1 37 2 37 6 34 at 24 36 38 Î¼g l cu respectively 3 4 effect of cu on gene expression we studied the possible dose dependent effects in fifty genes belonging to four different classes fourteen canonical stress genes eight skeletogenic genes twenty genes involved in developmental and differentiation processes and eight genes involved in detoxification processes fig 1si these genes were chosen since previous investigations have found that they display functional interconnections varrella et al 2016a ruocco et al 2017b our results showed a copper dose and stage dependent effect at the gene level for most of the analyzed genes of all four functional classes the exact fold changes are shown in table 2si all stress genes were targeted at the different copper concentrations and also at the different developmental stages with the only exception of p38mapk more in detail at the blastula stage only hsp70 gs and hif1a were up regulated wheras caspase 8 and p53 were down regulated fig 3 down regulation mainly at the higher copper concentration was also detected at gastrula stage for six stress genes only two were up regulated in this functional category there was more up regulation than down regulation at the pluteus stage only few genes responded in a dose dependent manner such as hsp70 and p53 with high levels of gene expression variation relative to the control in the skeletogenic category copper targeted all the eight genes analyzed mainly increasing their expression levels at the pluteus stage a response in a dose dependent manner was detected only for sm30 among the twenty genes involved in developmental and differentiation processes all were affected by copper with the only exception of wnt8 down regulation predominated in the early stage whereas up regulation predominated at a later developmental stage in this functional category several genes responded in a dose dependent manner such as Î´ 2 catenin tcf7 foxa gfi1 tak1 foxo and onecut in the detoxification category copper mainly up regulated the genes higher levels of gene expression variations were detected for these genes compared to the other categories only few genes responded in a dose dependent manner mt4 and mt6 more in general the blastula stage was less responsive than the pluteus stage and genes showed a late response to copper moreover a heat map of differentially expressed genes versus developmental stages is shown in fig 3 in order to summarize all these molecular results we observed a high level of gene expression variability among the three different developmental stages considered increasing from the blastula stage to pluteus stage in particular i at the blastula stage a weak molecular response is observed with those few activated genes were mainly down regulated ii at the gastrula stage the gene response increased with about the same number of genes up and down regulated iv at the pluteus stage almost all the genes analyzed were activated and targeted by copper with a very strong molecular response detected at the three different concentrations all the targeted genes showed an increase of their expression level after treatment highlighted in the heat map by green colour fig 3 4 discussion the results of this study provide evidence that copper provokes clear toxigenic effects on sea urchin embryo development inducing morphological anomalies and modifying gene expression here we analyzed for the first time copper effects by following the expression of fifty genes previously investigated in response to some diatom derived natural toxins romano et al 2011 marrone et al 2012 varrella et al 2014 varrella et al 2016a b ruocco et al 2016a b ruocco et al 2017b and to lithium ruocco et al 2016b almost all analyzed genes were targeted by copper and some of them were regulated in a dose dependent manner at three different concentrations tested with the only exception of wnt8 and p38mapk fig 4 in particular with permanova analysis five genes showed significant interaction between copper and development asterisks in fig 4 four of these belonging to development differentiation and one to skeletogenesis processes more in detail at blastula stage the absence of evident effects on embryo morphology was associated with the activation of only few genes involved in development differentiation and detoxification processes suggesting that these genes represent an early molecular response to copper in fact at this stage development differentiation genes were all down regulated frequently also in a dose dependent manner as for tcf7 and jnk while detoxification genes were moderately up regulated mt4 mt5 mt6 showing the strong affinity and specificity of action of these genes against metal these results suggest that this metallotionein up regulation might be a defence response against oxidative stress at the gastrula stage a slight increase in developmental anomalies up to 19 of malformed embryos is followed by an increased number of targeted genes always in these two classes development differentiation and detoxification genes belonging to development differentiation started to react to copper increasing especially bp10 Î´2 catenin tcf7 and tak1 or decreasing foxa gfi1 onecut and jnk their expression levels in a dose dependent manner at this stage detoxification genes were still up regulated mt mt4 mt5 andmt6 stress genes and skeletogenic genes at the blastula and gastrula stages had a very weak response to copper however these genes showed a late response at pluteus stage in fact in plutei larvae almost all genes were targeted by copper in a dose dependent manner in particular the level of gene expression increased with an up regulation especially for bp10 Î´2 catenin tcf4 tcf7 foxa foxo onecut genes involved in development and differentiation mt mt4 mt5 mt6 mt7 genes involved in detoxification processes hsp70 hsp60 hsp56 mtase cytb 14 3 3Îµ caspase3 7 p53 stress genes sm30 uni skeletogenic genes see fig 4 and supplementary table 2si the explanation of this massive gene activation confirmed the network analysis reported in our previous works which demonstrated that most of these genes were functionally intercorrelated and identified two gene networks varrella et al 2016a ruocco et al 2017b the first gene network identified four hub nodes genes sharing the largest number of functional connections with other genes nf kb p53 hif1a and Î´2 catenin varrella et al 2016a hub genes were interconnected and modulated each other and in turn were able to modulate the expression levels of twelve p lividus genes six stress genes hsp70 hsp60 hsp56 mtase cytb p38mapk four genes involved in development and differentiation processes sox9 blimp alix wnt6 and two genes belonging to the detoxification category mdr1 and cat the second network identified three hub nodes foxo jun and hif1a ruocco et al 2017b also in this case hub genes were interconnected and modulated each other and in turn modulated the expression levels of ten p lividus genes foxg tcf4 vegf nodal p38mapk gfi1 foxa onecut tcf7 and tak1 according the network analyses we proposed in varrella et al 2016a a working model which can be also applied in the sea urchin response to copper in particular the copper activated hub genes which are interconnected among one another and also affect their intercorrelated genes have a key role in different functional responses such as stress development differentiation and detoxification disturbance of the genic crosstalk may drive sea urchin embryos towards morphological malformations depending on the copper exposure dose furthermore in marrone et al 2012 we suggested that these genes represented the defensome an integrated network of genes that marine organisms deploy to defend themselves from environmental toxicants in order to well define the functional pathways in which these fifty genes were involved we performed panther analysis see supplementary fig 1si demonstrating that i the genes analyzed in this work were involved in antioxidant binding and catalytic activities ii they participated in ten biological processes such as developmental immune system cellular differentiation and metabolic processes iii they were in intracellular and extracellular regions iv they belonged to nine protein class such as hydrolase ligase oxidoreductase transcription factor membrane receptor v finally these genes were involved in twenty five functional pathways mi et al 2013 2017 we propose that these genes could be considered as possible biomarkers to detect exposure to different pollutants including physical and chemical xenobiotics at the highest copper concentration a decrease of the percentage of well developed plutei was observed at the same time of the maximum gene activation the developmental delay also increased at this concentration with more malformed early plutei with respect to the control these data fit with those find by arizzi novelli et al 2003 and morroni et al 2018a who observed an increase of delayed embryos at early pluteus stage in p lividus exposed from 48 to 70 Î¼g l cu interestingly morroni et al 2018a found that the defects were partially reversible after a few hours the observed recoverability could be explained by the results of the present study which showed the induction of a detoxification response at pluteus stage in fact the activation of metallothioneins mts metal binding proteins increase the resistance of cells to high copper levels by forming mt cu complexes with this mechanism copper is safely stored and intracellular excess is sequestered tapia et al 2004 as part of cu homeostasis the mt cu complex participates in the excretion of copper which can explain the capability of exposed embryos to recover a normal pattern analysing the potential environmental impact of copper on sea urchin population in the marine environment the metal concentrations tested in our study can be recorded in many polluted marine areas manfra and accornero 2002 found a copper concentration range of 0 60 6 74 mean 2 58 mg l in coastal mediterranean sea including industrialized urbanized areas in the northern red sea and gulf of aqaba shriadah et al 2004 found a range of 0 07 0 29 mean 0 14 mg l cu dassenakis et al 1996 a 0 03 20 7 mg l in greek contaminated coastal waters in a small tidal bay arizzi novelli et al 2003 found copper concentrations of the same order of magnitude as the p lividus noec value 37 Î¼g l in pore water from the lagoon of venice near the industrial area of porto marghera beiras et al 2003 estimated the toxic effects of copper in elutriate samples from sediment of the galician coast which explain the observed effects of p lividus embryogenesis even if the toxicity of dissolved metals depends on the presence in the water of organic ligands lorenzo et al 2002 the ecological risk for sea urchin population could be real 5 conclusions this study represents the first molecular insights into the negative effects of copper on p lividus embryos and its potential impact on sea urchin populations in polluted areas an important outcome concerns that changes in gene expression are more sensitive than the observation of morphological effects because gene expression constitutes a pre pathological cellular damage aardema and macgregor 2002 in fact conventional toxicological studies based only on morphology frequently lack measurements at molecular resolution capable of predicting toxicological assessment these results open new perspectives on the application of toxicogenomics that aims to combine classical toxicology with omic approaches proteomics metabolomics and genomics bioinformatics aardema and mac gregor 2002 titz et al 2014 along these lines a toxicogenomic approach will be applied in the future to deeply investigate and evaluate the potential impact of pollutants at ecosystem level

18753,bioassays with sea urchin embryos are widely used to define the environmental quality of marine waters anomalies during embryogenesis are generally considered as end points whereas a toxigenomic approach despite it is wide use in other species is yet in its infancy in the present study we evaluated toxigenic effects induced by copper on the sea urchin paracentrotus lividus embryo combining morphological observations with gene expression analysis many anthropogenic activities release copper in the marine environment with harmful effects on aquatic organisms in the present study p lidivus embryos were exposed to different concentrations of copper 24 36 48 Î¼g l and the activation of fifty specific marker genes involved in different biological processes stress skeletogenesis development differentiation detoxification was investigated at early blastula late gastrula and pluteus stage at blastula stage no morphological anomalies were found with early down regulation of genes involved in development differentiation and a moderate up regulation of some detoxification genes at gastrula stage a slight increase in developmental anomalies up to 19 of malformed embryos was followed by an increased number of targeted genes belonging to the same two classes relative to the blastula stage at pluteus stage morphological anomalies increased in a dose dependent manner all the analyzed genes were strongly up regulated stress and skeletogenic genes showing a late response and almost all genes were targeted by copper at all the concentrations tested the present study represents the first

adverse effects of a large number of chemicals on marine biota for a review see pagano et al 2017a in ecotoxicology bioassays with sea urchins are widely used to define the environmental quality of marine sediments and waters through the evaluation of embryonic anomalies up to a block of the embryogenesis rodrÃ­guez romero et al 2016 pagano et al 2017b morroni et al 2016 birch et al 2018 copper is an essential element playing an important role as co factor for enzymes involved in many cellular processes however copper can be extremely toxic at concentrations recorded in polluted marine areas buffet et al 2011 manzo et al 2010 in the last decades as a result of anthropogenic activities such as mining and smelting municipal wastes agricultural and industrial emissions the concentration of copper in the environment has grown considerably moreover copper pollution is a serious concern in aquaculture environments because cuso4 is commonly used as algaecide fungicide and bactericide to prevent fish disease cerqueira and fernandes 2002 kolok et al 2002 oliveira et al 2004 straus 2008 straus et al 2015 toxic effects of copper on sea urchin are well known inducing embryo malformations and developmental delay fernandez and beiras 2001 arizzi novelli et al 2003 manzo et al 2008 2010 gharred et al 2015 morroni et al 2018a more in general in aquatic organisms copper toxicity is related to binding to histidine cysteine and methionine causing protein inactivation camakaris et al 1999 in strongylocentrotus purpuratus copper competes with calcium cations in intracellular ionoregulatory homeostasis inducing skeletal alterations in plutei larvae tellis et al 2014 in paracentrotus lividus a similar mechanism of toxicity was observed with cadmium and lead pagano et al 1982 warnau and pagano 1994 inducing skeletal malformations as in s purpuratus morroni et al 2018a warnau et al 1996 found a positive correlation between cu binding sulfhydryl groups and its toxicity in p lividus suggesting an impairment of protein function manzo et al 2008 which affects larval development however despite these evidences of cu interaction with cellular targets the effects at molecular level remains poorly understood in p lividus mainly due to the lack of an annotated genome there is a lot of molecular evidences showing that a rapid cellular adaptation may be activated after a stress in other marine organisms as well as variation in gene expression through rapid and specific activation and or repression of specific genes nadal et al 2011 more recently ruocco et al 2017b showed that in p lividus embryos changes in gene expression levels may be used as early indicator of stress conditions and these authors identified key genes responsible of molecular pathways involved in protection against natural toxins the aim of this study was to analyze toxigenic effects of copper during p lividus early development identifying the induction of specific genes belonging to different biological functions to achieve this goal p lividus embryos were exposed to three different concentrations of copper 24 36 48 Î¼g l which showed developmental anomalies in a dose dependent manner in agreement with literature data morroni et al 2018a 2018b embryos were observed at blastula gastrula and pluteus stages the expression level of fifty genes involved in stress skeletogenesis developmental differentiation and detoxification processes were investigated at each developmental stage gene expression analysis was integrated with morphological data quantifying and weighting the

ranged from 28 5 to 32 93 Î¼g l cu 3 3 integrative toxicity index in order to summarize the different anomalies induced by copper the integrative toxicity index iti was applied fig 2 at gastrula stage cu exposed embryos showed a development delay with a significant increase of malformed blastulas at increasing copper concentrations p 0 004 fig 2a the percentage of malformed gastrulas was not statistically different from the control p 0 65 and the increase of iti at different concentrations was mainly due to the malformed blastula fig 2a at pluteus stage the percentage of malformed plutei was negligible at 24 and 36 Î¼g l with respect to the control however the percentage of organisms with a developmental delay increased in a dose dependent manner 15 36 and 92 at 24 36 and 48 Î¼g l copper respectively p 0 001 fig 2b in particular at 24 Î¼g l cu 14 was delayed at early pluteus stage and 8 of the incubated embryos was malformed at 36 Î¼g l copper 33 of the embryos were delayed mostly at early pluteus and prism stages with 26 of malformations at the highest copper concentration 48 Î¼g l cu delayed and malformed embryos were almost 89 with 10 early plutei 27 gastrula and 52 prism stages fig 2b normal developed plutei accounted to only 8 in general this dose dependent effect was revealed by an increase of iti at increasing copper concentrations 1 37 2 37 6 34 at 24 36 38 Î¼g l cu respectively 3 4 effect of cu on gene expression we studied the possible dose dependent effects in fifty genes belonging to four different classes fourteen canonical stress genes eight skeletogenic genes twenty genes involved in developmental and differentiation processes and eight genes involved in detoxification processes fig 1si these genes were chosen since previous investigations have found that they display functional interconnections varrella et al 2016a ruocco et al 2017b our results showed a copper dose and stage dependent effect at the gene level for most of the analyzed genes of all four functional classes the exact fold changes are shown in table 2si all stress genes were targeted at the different copper concentrations and also at the different developmental stages with the only exception of p38mapk more in detail at the blastula stage only hsp70 gs and hif1a were up regulated wheras caspase 8 and p53 were down regulated fig 3 down regulation mainly at the higher copper concentration was also detected at gastrula stage for six stress genes only two were up regulated in this functional category there was more up regulation than down regulation at the pluteus stage only few genes responded in a dose dependent manner such as hsp70 and p53 with high levels of gene expression variation relative to the control in the skeletogenic category copper targeted all the eight genes analyzed mainly increasing their expression levels at the pluteus stage a response in a dose dependent manner was detected only for sm30 among the twenty genes involved in developmental and differentiation processes all were affected by copper with the only exception of wnt8 down regulation predominated in the early stage whereas up regulation predominated at a later developmental stage in this functional category several genes responded in a dose dependent manner such as Î´ 2 catenin tcf7 foxa gfi1 tak1 foxo and onecut in the detoxification category copper mainly up regulated the genes higher levels of gene expression variations were detected for these genes compared to the other categories only few genes responded in a dose dependent manner mt4 and mt6 more in general the blastula stage was less responsive than the pluteus stage and genes showed a late response to copper moreover a heat map of differentially expressed genes versus developmental stages is shown in fig 3 in order to summarize all these molecular results we observed a high level of gene expression variability among the three different developmental stages considered increasing from the blastula stage to pluteus stage in particular i at the blastula stage a weak molecular response is observed with those few activated genes were mainly down regulated ii at the gastrula stage the gene response increased with about the same number of genes up and down regulated iv at the pluteus stage almost all the genes analyzed were activated and targeted by copper with a very strong molecular response detected at the three different concentrations all the targeted genes showed an increase of their expression level after treatment highlighted in the heat map by green colour fig 3 4 discussion the results of this study provide evidence that copper provokes clear toxigenic effects on sea urchin embryo development inducing morphological anomalies and modifying gene expression here we analyzed for the first time copper effects by following the expression of fifty genes previously investigated in response to some diatom derived natural toxins romano et al 2011 marrone et al 2012 varrella et al 2014 varrella et al 2016a b ruocco et al 2016a b ruocco et al 2017b and to lithium ruocco et al 2016b almost all analyzed genes were targeted by copper and some of them were regulated in a dose dependent manner at three different concentrations tested with the only exception of wnt8 and p38mapk fig 4 in particular with permanova analysis five genes showed significant interaction between copper and development asterisks in fig 4 four of these belonging to development differentiation and one to skeletogenesis processes more in detail at blastula stage the absence of evident effects on embryo morphology was associated with the activation of only few genes involved in development differentiation and detoxification processes suggesting that these genes represent an early molecular response to copper in fact at this stage development differentiation genes were all down regulated frequently also in a dose dependent manner as for tcf7 and jnk while detoxification genes were moderately up regulated mt4 mt5 mt6 showing the strong affinity and specificity of action of these genes against metal these results suggest that this metallotionein up regulation might be a defence response against oxidative stress at the gastrula stage a slight increase in developmental anomalies up to

genes were still up regulated mt mt4 mt5 andmt6 stress genes and skeletogenic genes at the blastula and gastrula stages had a very weak response to copper however these genes showed a late response at pluteus stage in fact in plutei larvae almost all genes were targeted by copper in a dose dependent manner in particular the level of gene expression increased with an up regulation especially for

caspase3 7 p53 stress genes sm30 uni skeletogenic genes see fig 4 and supplementary table 2si the explanation of this massive gene activation confirmed the network analysis reported in our previous works which demonstrated that most of these genes were functionally intercorrelated and identified two gene networks varrella et al 2016a ruocco et al 2017b the first gene network identified four hub nodes genes sharing the largest number of functional connections with other genes nf kb p53 hif1a and Î´2 catenin varrella et al 2016a hub genes were interconnected and modulated each other and in turn were able to modulate the expression levels of twelve p lividus genes six stress genes hsp70 hsp60 hsp56 mtase cytb p38mapk four genes involved in development and differentiation processes sox9 blimp alix wnt6 and two genes belonging to the detoxification category mdr1 and cat the second network identified three hub nodes foxo jun and hif1a ruocco et al 2017b also in this case hub genes were interconnected and modulated each other and in turn modulated the expression levels of ten p lividus genes foxg tcf4 vegf nodal p38mapk gfi1 foxa onecut tcf7 and tak1 according the network analyses we proposed in varrella et al 2016a a working model which can be also applied in the sea urchin response to copper in particular the copper activated hub genes which are interconnected among one another and also affect their intercorrelated genes have a key role in different functional responses such as stress development differentiation and detoxification disturbance of the genic crosstalk may drive sea urchin embryos towards morphological malformations depending on the copper exposure dose furthermore in marrone et al 2012 we suggested that these genes represented the defensome an integrated network of genes that marine organisms deploy to defend themselves from environmental toxicants in order to well define the functional pathways in which these fifty genes were involved we performed panther analysis see supplementary fig 1si demonstrating that i the genes analyzed in this work were involved in antioxidant binding and catalytic activities ii they participated in ten biological processes such as developmental immune system cellular differentiation and metabolic processes iii they were in intracellular and extracellular regions iv they belonged to nine protein class such as hydrolase ligase oxidoreductase transcription factor membrane receptor v finally these genes were involved in twenty five functional pathways mi et al 2013 2017 we propose that these genes could be considered as possible biomarkers to detect exposure to different pollutants including physical and chemical xenobiotics at the highest copper concentration a decrease of the percentage of well developed plutei was observed at the same time of the maximum gene activation the developmental delay also increased at this concentration with more malformed early plutei with respect to the control these data fit with those find by arizzi novelli et al 2003 and morroni et al 2018a who observed an increase of delayed embryos at early pluteus stage in p lividus exposed from 48 to 70 Î¼g l cu interestingly morroni et al 2018a found that the defects were partially reversible after a few hours the observed recoverability could be explained by the results of the present study which showed the induction of a detoxification response at pluteus stage in fact the activation of metallothioneins mts metal binding proteins increase the resistance of cells to high copper levels by forming mt cu complexes with this mechanism copper is safely stored and intracellular excess is sequestered tapia et al 2004 as part of cu homeostasis the mt cu complex participates in the excretion of copper which can explain the capability of exposed embryos to recover a normal pattern analysing the potential environmental impact of copper on sea urchin population in the marine environment the metal concentrations tested in our study can be recorded in many polluted marine areas manfra and accornero 2002 found a copper concentration range of 0 60 6 74 mean 2 58 mg l in coastal mediterranean sea including industrialized urbanized areas in the northern red sea and gulf of aqaba shriadah et al 2004 found a range of 0 07 0 29 mean 0 14 mg l cu dassenakis et al 1996 a 0 03 20 7 mg l in greek contaminated coastal waters in a small tidal bay arizzi novelli et al 2003 found copper concentrations of the same order of magnitude as the p lividus noec value 37 Î¼g l in pore water from the lagoon of venice near the industrial area of porto marghera beiras et al 2003 estimated the toxic effects of copper in elutriate samples from sediment of the galician coast which explain the observed effects of p lividus embryogenesis even if the toxicity of dissolved metals depends on the presence in the water of organic ligands lorenzo et al 2002 the ecological risk for sea urchin population could be real 5 conclusions this study represents the first molecular insights into the negative effects of copper on p lividus embryos and its potential impact on sea urchin populations in polluted areas an important outcome concerns that changes in gene expression are more sensitive than the observation of morphological effects because gene expression constitutes a pre pathological cellular damage aardema and macgregor 2002 in fact conventional toxicological studies based only on morphology frequently lack measurements at molecular resolution capable of predicting toxicological assessment these results open new perspectives on the application of toxicogenomics that aims to combine classical toxicology with omic approaches proteomics metabolomics and genomics bioinformatics aardema and mac gregor 2002 titz et al 2014 along these lines a toxicogenomic approach will be applied in the future to deeply investigate and evaluate the potential impact of pollutants at ecosystem level

18754,technologies capable of selective removal of target contaminants from water are highly desirable to achieve fit for purpose treatment in this study we developed a simple yet highly effective method to achieve calcium selective removal in an electrosorption process by coating the cathode with a calcium selective nanocomposite csn layer using an aqueous phase process the csn coating consisted of nano sized calcium chelating resins with aminophosphonic groups in a sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel matrix which accomplished a ca2 over na selectivity of 3 5 5 4 at na ca2 equivalent concentration ratio from 10 1 to 1 1 94 184 greater than the uncoated electrode the csn coated electrode exhibited complete reversibility in repeated operation mechanistic studies suggested that the csn coating did not contribute to the adsorption capacity but rather allowed preferential permeation of ca2 and hence increased ca2 adsorption on the carbon cathode the csn coated electrode was very stable showing reproducible performance in 60 repeated cycles graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization calcium selective removal nanocomposite coating desalination electrosorption 1 introduction calcium is the most common divalent cation in surface and groundwater and an important nutrient cashman 2002 greer and krebs 2006 institute of medicine 1997 however calcium can be problematic in households municipal and industrial water systems scaling resulting from precipitation of calcium minerals clogs pipes in municipal water distribution systems reduces efficiency of heat exchangers cooling towers and boilers and causes flux decline and loss of separation performance in water treatment membrane systems gabrielli et al 2006 seo et al 2010 van limpt and van der wal 2014 yoon et al 2016 in addition calcium can induce bio colloid formation by bridging negatively charged functional groups in bacterial extracellular polymeric substances resulting in excessive precipitation or clogging problems sobeck and higgins 2002 conventional methods including thermal evaporation koren and nadav 1994 shaffer et al 2013 ion exchange wiers et al 1982 chemical

deionization cdi is an emerging desalination technology that removes ionic species in water through adsorption of the ions on oppositely charged electrodes porada zhao van der wal presser and biesheuvel 2013 incorporation of ion exchange membranes in cdi i e membrane capacitive deionization mcdi excludes coions from accessing the electrode surface lee et al 2006 this not only enhances charge efficiency and salt adsorption capacity but also allows faster desorption by reverse voltage discharge instead of zero voltage discharge biesheuvel van 2010 biesheuvel zhao porada and van der

biesheuvel and van der wal 2013 however current cdi systems have limited use in desalination applications because of inability to treat feed waters with moderate salinity 10 000 ppm tds low salt rejection and higher energy consumption compared to reverse osmosis qin et al 2019 porada et al 2012 zou et al 2008 the potential of cdi for removing ionic contaminants from water is highly attractive but it may be difficult to realize if the target contaminants are present at concentrations orders of magnitude lower than competing ions such as na and cl in general ions with higher valence and smaller hydrated ion sizes migrate faster in an electric field blanchard et al 1984 liu et al 2013 nightingale 1959 j s park song yeon and moon 2007 seo et al 2010 higher valence ions however often have larger hydrated ion sizes therefore the cdi process has limited intrinsic selectivity several studies have reported preferential removal of divalent cations using modified electrodes using a continuous flow five cell stacked cdi module equipped with activated carbon cloth electrodes seo et al showed a higher percentage removal of hardness ions i e ca2 and mg2 than na from a mixture containing 2 6 mm cacl2 0 9 mm mgso4 and 4 6 mm nahco3 and attributed it to the pore size distribution and structure that favor hardness ions seo et al 2010 because the concentration of na in the feed water was much higher than that of ca2 or mg2 it was unclear how the actual amounts of ions adsorbed compared to each other composite electrodes containing selective ion exchange resins have also been used to impart ion selectivity carbon electrodes coated with a nitrate selective ion exchange resin demonstrated preferential removal of no3 over cl or so4 2 in cdi y j kim and choi 2012 yeo and choi 2013 the resin coating increased no3 adsorption while cl adsorption remained unchanged liu et al fabricated a zeolite decorated carbon nanotube cnt electrode and showed increasing calcium and magnesium adsorption in single salt batch electrosorption experiments with increasing zeolite to cnt ratio liu et al 2013 however the performance of the zeolite cnt electrode deteriorated in a few cycles suggesting that it was either partially degraded or not fully regenerated in another study yoon et al tested a calcium alginate coated carbon electrode in a continuous flow cdi system and achieved calcium removal 2 9 times that of sodium from an equal molar bi solute mixture yoon et al 2016 the greater ca2 removal was attributed to the stronger affinity of divalent ions for the electrode surface termed coulombic interaction the studies discussed above highlighted the promise of composite electrodes containing selective adsorbents for use in electrosorption at the same time they also revealed limitations in the state of art first simply adding a selective adsorbent on the electrode usually has limited effect on the overall ion selectivity as the largest contributor to the overall adsorption capacity is the carbon electrode second adsorbents that bind irreversibly with the target ions will not be regenerable and the selectivity will therefore disappear when the adsorbents are saturated finally no studies have investigated the long term performance of the composite electrodes due to the cyclic nature of the cdi process long term stability of the electrodes is critical in the study reported here we developed a calcium selective nanocomposite csn electrode by coating an activated carbon electrode with a hydrophilic polymer film containing nanosized ion exchange resin the influence of the csn coating on ca2 adsorption was investigated in single and mixed salt solutions and the stability of the csn electrode was evaluated the mechanism of ca2

performance of the electrodes was evaluated in a flow by the mcdi system illustrated in fig 1 a bare carbon electrode was used as the anode in all experiments and the performance of the csn electrode was compared with that of an uncoated carbon electrode the control as the cathode the effective area of both electrodes was 10 cm2 although the csn coating also serves as a cation exchange membrane a cem was still used in all experiments to ensure consistent charge efficiency so that separate the ca2 selective function of the csn coating can be separated from its cation exchange function a polypropylene mesh spacer with a 500 Î¼m mesh opening and 61 porosity was installed between two ion exchange membranes to create a flow channel of 1 mm in depth single solute and binary solutions

apparent velocity of 1 7 mm s an electrochemical workstation ch instruments 660e usa was used to charge discharge the electrodes and measure electric current the applied voltage was 1 2 v for

oes perkinelmer 4300 at least five adsorption and desorption cycles were performed before sampling and data collection began to ensure the system has reached a dynamic steady state 2 4 electrodialysis experiments to investigate the ion transport through nanocomposite coating an electrodialysis setup was used the electrodialysis cell consists of three 5 ml chambers formed by two graphite electrodes an aem and a csn coated microfiltration mf membrane 0 45 Î¼m pore size the mf membrane has no ion separate function and was used only to support the csn coating the csn coating was equilibrated with

a thickness of 300 Î¼m and the activated carbon had a particle size of 5 Î¼m fig 2 a b modification with the csn resulted in a dense continuous coating of 30 Î¼m in thickness fig 2c d with resin nanoparticles well dispersed and distributed uniformly in the polymer matrix fig 2d1 fig 2e compares ftir spectra of the different electrodes as well as the unprocessed resin the uncoated electrode showed only a small peak at 2840 3000 cm 1 that corresponds to c h stretches from pva binders the pva ga ssa coated electrode exhibited peaks for o h 3500 3200 cm 1 c h 2840 3000 cm 1 c o c 1150 1085

resin contained peaks of phosphonic po3 functional groups at 975 and 550 cm 1 mÃ©nard et al 1994 sahni et al 1985 which offers high affinity to ca2 over na the csn electrode clearly exhibited features of both the resin and the pva ga ssa polymer matrix 3 2 performance parameters key performance parameters evaluated include salt adsorption capacity sac meq m2 equation 1 and charge efficiency Î»

adsorption capacity is based on the top surface area of the carbon electrode as the same activated carbon loading was used to fabricate the control and csn coated electrodes the sac based on electrode surface area is linearly proportional to that based on carbon electrode mass in experiments using a binary electrolyte solution a selectivity coefficient s t c defined in accordance to the

containing 10 meq l nacl or cacl2 as shown in fig s2 nacl solution figs 3a and s3 cacl2 solution highly reproducible current and conductivity profiles were observed in all cycles with both electrodes indicating excellent reversibility of these electrodes under rvd there was no ion accumulation the feed solution was not purged by nitrogen thus both influent and effluent ph stayed constant at 5 8 0 2 a close examination of the conductivity profile revealed almost identical adsorption kinetics of the two electrodes for both nacl fig s2b and cacl2 fig 3 b feed solutions suggesting a negligible impact of the csn coating on the ion transport to the carbon electrode surface during the desorption stage using reverse voltage the control electrode exhibited a higher and sharper desorption peak than the csn electrode figs s2c and 3c this suggests that the csn coating slightly hindered ion transport back to the bulk solution presumably due to the additional mass transfer resistance imposed by the csn coating as illustrated in fig 3c these results indicate that internal diffusion in the csn layer is the rate limiting step in the desorption stage while ion release from the carbon surface is relatively fast despite the different valence and size of ca2 and na their adsorption capacity by the uncoated electrode in terms of milliequivalent was similar 68 9 and 71 6 meq m2 for ca2 and na respectively in same initial concentrations 10 meq l as a comparison the sac of the csn electrode was 77 3 and 78 0 meq m2 for na and ca2 respectively 8 and 13 higher than the uncoated carbon electrode the higher sac was attributed to increased charge efficiency which was 78 7 cacl2 and 86 9 nacl for the uncoated electrode and 86 4 cacl2 and 92 9 nacl for the csn electrode fig 3d the ion exchange adsorption capacity of the csn coating itself had a negligible contribution to the sac as the electrode was equilibrated with the feed solution before the electrosorption cycles began 3 4 binary solution experiments binary solutions containing nacl and cacl2 with a total concentration of 10 meq l and different na to ca2 were used as the feed water to investigate ca2 adsorption in the presence of na results are summarized in fig 4 and fig s4 the adsorption and desorption kinetic data fig 4a revealed a substantial difference between the performance of the uncoated and csn electrodes the uncoated electrode exhibited notably faster na adsorption than ca2 adsorption despite the higher electrophoretic mobility of ca2 this behavior is attributed to the smaller radius of hydrated na 3 58 Ã¥ versus 4 12 Ã¥ for ca2 nightingale 1959 and hence faster diffusion into the carbon pores the rate limiting step of the electrosorption process seo et al 2010 yoon et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 analysis of ion concentrations in the effluent found that the uncoated electrode achieved a sac of 70 8 9 9 meq m2 47 7 5 0 mmol m2 for the binary solution with 1 1 na to ca2 equivalent ratio similar to that for the single salt nacl or cacl2 solution about twice as much equivalents of ca2 46 1 5 1 meq m2 were adsorbed as na 24 7 2 5 meq m2 resulting in a st c of 1 9 0 1 unlike in the single salt cacl2 solution the csn coating greatly enhanced ca2 adsorption kinetics in the presence of na fig 4a it also increased the total sac from 70 8 7 6 to 82 4 2 0 meq m2 a 16 4 increase although the sac measured in mmol m2 remained unchanged 47 7 5 0 and 47 7 1 5 mmol m2 for uncoated and csn electrode respectively fig 4b the improved equivalent salt adsorption by the csn coating was attributed to enhanced adsorption of ca2 relative to na as shown in fig 4b ca2 adsorption 69 5 0 9 meq m2 by the csn electrode was 50 7 higher than that of the uncoated electrode 46 1 5 1 meq m2 while na adsorption decreased by 48 from 24 7 2 5 to 12 9 1 1 meq m2 resulting in a greatly improved ca2 selectivity st c of 5 4 furthermore displacement of adsorbed na by ca2 was observed in the later stage of the adsorption process for both the uncoated and the csn electrodes effluent na concentration exceeded its influent concentration while ca2 adsorption continued though the coated electrode showed a much greater displaced amount this is clearly demonstrated in fig 4c where cumulative na ca2 and total cation adsorption by the csn electrode is shown as a function of time cumulative na adsorption reached a maximum at 25 min when the effluent na concentration became the same as the influent concentration fig 4a2 thereafter the amount of na adsorption declined while ca2 adsorption continued to increase compared with the uncoated electrode the csn electrode experienced more na displacement by ca2 similar displacement phenomena were observed in previous studies chen et al 2015 mossad and zou 2012 seo et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 referred to as time dependent ion selectivity zhao et al 2012 in most water and wastewater the concentration of ca2 is usually much lower than that of na therefore experiments were performed using 10 meq l binary solutions with na ca2 equivalent concentration ratio of 1 1 2 1 5 1 and 10 1 as expected the amount of ca2 adsorption decreased while na adsorption increased with increasing influent na to ca2 ratio in the binary influent solution for both the uncoated and csn electrodes fig 4d for the uncoated electrode the amount of ca2 or na adsorption changed proportionally with its respective relative concentration in the influent solution resulting in fairly constant ca2 selectivity st c fig 4e the csn electrode however exhibited a slight drop in st c when the na to ca2 equivalent ratio increased from 1 1 to 10 1 the ca2 selectivity coefficient st c decreased from 5 4 to 3 7 this results is attributed to two reasons incomplete na displacement and increased na flux through the non selective pva matrix it is noted that ca2 adsorption did not reach equilibrium at the end of the adsorption cycle as evident in the notable difference between its effluent and influent concentrations at higher na to ca2 ratio this difference was larger fig s5 and na displacement amount was also decreased fig 4f suggesting insufficient time for ca2 displacement of na to reach completion in the meantime permeation of na through the non selective pva matrix increases with increasing na to ca2 ratio it is anticipated that increasing adsorption cycle time and the ca2 selective resin content can further increase the selectivity of the csn electrode and minimize the impact of na to ca2 concentration ratio 3 5 understanding the selectivity mechanism of the csn electrode as discussed above the csn coating increased ca2 adsorption relative to na on the carbon electrode while having little direct contribution to ca2 adsorption capacity in a previous study we showed that selective so4 2 removal in the presence of cl achieved using a so4 2 selective coating on a carbon electrode was due to preferential transport of so4 2 through the coating zuo et al 2018 it is assumed that the same mechanism is responsible for the selective ca2 removal observed in the current study to test this hypothesis experiments were carried out in an electrodialysis cell to characterize ion transport through the csn coating using a binary solution containing 5 meq l of nacl and 10 meq l cacl2 fig s6 by applying a constant current the concentration of both ca2 and na decreased with operation time in the cation donor chamber while a corresponding increase was observed in the ion acceptor chamber fig 5 detailed mass balance analysis found that the decreased concentration of ions in donor chamber was comparable with that accumulated in accepting chamber fig s6d with negligible ion adsorption on the csn coated mf membrane suggesting electro migration of cations through the csn mf under the electric field further test found that 2 7 times higher ca2 migration flux 155 0 Î¼eq m2 min was achieved through the csn coating than na 57 1 Î¼eq m2 min for 2 1 ca2 na initial concentration ratio despite the fact that ca2 had a larger hydrated ion size 4 12 Ã¥ for ca2 vs 3 58 Ã¥ for na the electro migration flux of ca2 is 2 7 times that of na comparable with the s t c ratio between the csn and uncoated electrodes 5 4 1 9 obtained in the electrosorption experiment at an influent na to ca2 equivalent ratio of 1 1 these results suggest that the higher affinity of the csn for ca2 resulted in the faster electro migration rate of ca2 through the csn coating consistent with the solution diffusion model the higher flux of ca2 relative to na would lead to a higher ca2 to na concentration ratio that the carbon electrode is exposed to and therefore increased ca2 adsorption by the carbon electrode surface 3 6 long term performance of the csn electrode long term stability of the csn electrode was evaluated by operating the experimental system continuously for more than 180 h using a binary influent solution containing 5 meq l nacl and 5 meq l cacl2 total 10 meq l as shown in fig 6 a both the conductivity and current profiles exhibited excellent repeatability for over 60 cycles effluent samples were taken and analyzed in the 5th 30th 45th and 60th cycle results showed that the change in sac was less than 10 the ca2 selectivity st c was consistently 5 in the 60th cycle the amounts of ca2 and na removed during the adsorption stage were 66 9 and 11 8 meq m2 respectively showing that the adsorption by the csn electrode was reversible in long term operation 4 conclusions in this study we developed a nanocomposite electrode that selectively removes ca2 in the presence of competing na ions by applying a ca2 selective nanocomposite csn coating on the activated carbon electrode the high affinity of the nanosized ca2 selective resin particles for ca2 ions results in higher ca2 permselectivity than na and hence an elevated ca2 concentration in the carbon electrode pores which leads to increased ca2 adsorption relative to the competing na at the same time the csn coating had a negligible impact on ion adsorption kinetics and only slightly decreased the desorption kinetics due to the added resistance of the coating the csn electrode exhibited excellent performance over the long term operation with highly stable salt adsorption capacity ca2 selectivity and regenerability these results suggest that a selective barrier on the electrode allows preferential utilization of the adsorption sites on the high capacity carbon electrode for the target ion this renders selectivity on the originally non selective carbon electrode the selectivity for ca2 decreased with increasing na to ca2 ratio in the influent solution but it is anticipated that the impact can be minimized by increasing the adsorption cycle time and or content

18754,technologies capable of selective removal of target contaminants from water are highly desirable to achieve fit for purpose treatment in this study we developed a simple yet highly effective method to achieve calcium selective removal in an electrosorption process by coating the cathode with a calcium selective nanocomposite csn layer using an aqueous phase process the csn coating consisted of nano sized calcium chelating resins with aminophosphonic groups in a sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel matrix which accomplished a ca2 over na selectivity of 3 5 5 4 at na ca2 equivalent concentration ratio from 10 1 to 1 1 94 184 greater than the uncoated electrode the csn coated electrode exhibited complete reversibility in repeated operation mechanistic studies suggested that the csn coating did not contribute to the adsorption capacity but rather allowed preferential permeation of ca2 and hence increased ca2 adsorption on the carbon cathode the csn coated electrode was very stable showing reproducible performance in 60 repeated cycles graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive deionization calcium selective removal nanocomposite coating desalination electrosorption 1 introduction calcium is the most common divalent cation in surface and groundwater and an important nutrient cashman 2002 greer and krebs 2006 institute of medicine 1997 however

and van der wal 2014 yoon et al 2016 in addition calcium can induce bio colloid formation by bridging negatively charged functional groups in bacterial extracellular polymeric substances resulting in excessive precipitation or clogging problems sobeck and higgins 2002 conventional methods including thermal evaporation koren and nadav 1994 shaffer et al 2013 ion exchange wiers et al 1982 chemical

biesheuvel and van der wal 2013 however current cdi systems have limited use in desalination applications because of inability to treat feed waters with moderate salinity 10 000 ppm tds low salt rejection and higher energy consumption compared to reverse osmosis qin et al 2019 porada et al 2012 zou et al 2008 the potential of cdi for removing ionic contaminants from water is highly attractive but it may be difficult to realize if the target contaminants are present at concentrations orders of magnitude lower than competing ions such as na and cl in general ions with higher valence and smaller hydrated ion sizes migrate faster in an electric field blanchard et al 1984 liu et al 2013 nightingale 1959 j s park song yeon and moon 2007 seo et al 2010 higher valence ions however often have larger hydrated ion sizes therefore the cdi process has limited intrinsic selectivity several studies have reported preferential removal of divalent cations using modified electrodes using a continuous flow five cell stacked cdi module equipped with activated carbon cloth electrodes seo et al showed a higher percentage removal of hardness ions i e ca2 and mg2 than na from a mixture containing 2 6 mm cacl2 0 9 mm mgso4 and 4 6 mm nahco3 and attributed it to the pore size distribution and structure that favor hardness ions seo et al 2010 because the concentration of na in the feed water was much higher than that of ca2 or mg2 it was unclear how the actual amounts of ions adsorbed compared to each other composite electrodes containing selective ion exchange resins have also been used to impart ion selectivity carbon electrodes coated with a nitrate selective ion exchange resin demonstrated preferential removal of no3 over cl or so4 2 in cdi y j kim and choi 2012 yeo and choi 2013 the resin coating increased no3 adsorption while cl adsorption remained unchanged liu et al fabricated a zeolite decorated carbon nanotube cnt electrode and showed increasing calcium and magnesium adsorption in single salt batch electrosorption experiments with increasing zeolite to cnt ratio liu et al 2013 however the performance of the zeolite cnt electrode deteriorated in a few cycles suggesting that it was either partially degraded or not fully regenerated in another study yoon et al tested a calcium alginate coated carbon electrode in a continuous flow cdi system and achieved calcium removal 2 9 times that of sodium from an equal molar bi solute mixture yoon et al 2016 the greater ca2 removal was attributed to the stronger affinity of divalent ions for the electrode surface termed coulombic interaction the studies discussed above highlighted the promise of composite electrodes containing selective adsorbents for use in electrosorption at the same time they also revealed limitations in the state of art first simply adding a selective adsorbent on the electrode usually has limited effect on the overall ion selectivity as the largest contributor to the overall adsorption capacity is the carbon electrode second adsorbents that bind irreversibly with the target ions will not be regenerable and the selectivity will therefore disappear when the adsorbents are saturated finally no studies have investigated the long term performance of the composite electrodes due to the cyclic nature of the cdi process long term stability of the electrodes is critical in the study reported here we developed a calcium selective nanocomposite csn electrode by coating an activated carbon electrode with a hydrophilic polymer film containing nanosized ion exchange resin the influence of the csn coating on ca2 adsorption was investigated in single and mixed salt solutions and the stability of the csn electrode was evaluated the mechanism of ca2

oes perkinelmer 4300 at least five adsorption and desorption cycles were performed before sampling and data collection began to ensure the system has reached a dynamic steady state 2 4 electrodialysis

nanoparticles well dispersed and distributed uniformly in the polymer matrix fig 2d1 fig 2e compares ftir spectra of the different electrodes as well as the unprocessed resin the uncoated electrode showed only a small peak at 2840 3000 cm 1 that corresponds to c h stretches from pva binders the pva ga ssa coated electrode exhibited peaks for o h 3500 3200 cm 1 c h 2840 3000 cm 1 c o c 1150 1085

resin contained peaks of phosphonic po3 functional groups at 975 and 550 cm 1 mÃ©nard et al 1994 sahni et al 1985 which offers high affinity to ca2 over na the csn electrode clearly exhibited features of both the resin and the pva ga ssa polymer matrix 3 2 performance parameters key performance parameters evaluated include salt adsorption capacity sac meq m2 equation 1 and charge efficiency Î»

adsorption capacity is based on the top surface area of the carbon electrode as the same activated carbon loading was used to fabricate the control and csn coated electrodes the sac based on electrode surface area is linearly proportional to that based on carbon electrode mass in experiments using a binary electrolyte solution a selectivity coefficient s t c defined in accordance to the

competing ions in the influent solution respectively 3 3 single solute experiments the control and csn electrodes were first evaluated separately in single solute experiments using feed solutions containing 10 meq l nacl or cacl2 as shown in fig s2 nacl solution figs 3a and s3 cacl2 solution highly reproducible current and conductivity profiles were observed in all cycles with both electrodes indicating excellent reversibility of these electrodes under rvd there was no ion accumulation the feed solution was not purged by nitrogen thus both influent and effluent ph stayed constant at 5 8 0 2 a close examination of the conductivity profile revealed almost identical adsorption kinetics of the two electrodes for both nacl fig s2b and cacl2 fig 3 b feed solutions suggesting a negligible impact of the csn coating on the ion transport to the carbon electrode surface during the desorption stage using reverse voltage the control electrode exhibited a higher and sharper desorption peak than the csn electrode figs s2c and 3c this suggests that the csn coating slightly hindered ion transport back to the bulk solution presumably due to the additional mass transfer resistance imposed by the csn coating as illustrated in fig 3c these results indicate that internal diffusion in the csn layer is the rate limiting step in the desorption stage while ion release from the carbon surface is relatively fast despite the different valence and size of ca2 and na their adsorption capacity by the uncoated electrode in terms of milliequivalent was similar 68 9 and 71 6 meq m2 for ca2 and na respectively in same initial concentrations 10 meq l as a comparison the sac of the csn electrode was 77 3 and 78 0 meq m2 for na and ca2 respectively 8 and 13 higher than the uncoated carbon electrode the higher sac was attributed to increased charge efficiency which was 78 7 cacl2 and 86 9 nacl for the uncoated electrode and 86 4 cacl2 and 92 9 nacl for the csn electrode fig 3d the ion exchange adsorption capacity of the csn coating itself had a negligible contribution to the sac as the electrode was equilibrated with the feed solution before the electrosorption cycles began 3 4 binary solution experiments binary solutions containing nacl and cacl2 with a total concentration of 10 meq l and different na to ca2 were used as the feed water to investigate ca2 adsorption in the presence of na results are summarized in fig 4 and fig s4 the adsorption and desorption kinetic data fig 4a revealed a substantial difference between the performance of the uncoated and csn electrodes the uncoated electrode exhibited notably faster na adsorption than ca2 adsorption despite the higher electrophoretic mobility of ca2 this behavior is attributed to the smaller radius of hydrated na 3 58 Ã¥ versus 4 12 Ã¥ for ca2 nightingale 1959 and hence faster diffusion into the carbon pores the rate limiting step of the electrosorption process seo et al 2010 yoon et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 analysis of ion concentrations in the effluent found that the uncoated electrode achieved a sac of 70 8 9 9 meq m2 47 7 5 0 mmol m2 for the binary solution with 1 1 na to ca2 equivalent ratio similar to that for the single salt nacl or cacl2 solution about twice as much equivalents of ca2 46 1 5 1 meq m2 were adsorbed as na 24 7 2 5 meq m2 resulting in a st c of 1 9 0 1 unlike in the single salt cacl2 solution the csn coating greatly enhanced ca2 adsorption kinetics in the presence of na fig 4a it also increased the total sac from 70 8 7 6 to 82 4 2 0 meq m2 a 16 4 increase although the sac measured in mmol m2 remained unchanged 47 7 5 0 and 47 7 1 5 mmol m2 for uncoated and csn electrode respectively fig 4b the improved equivalent salt adsorption by the csn coating was attributed to enhanced adsorption of ca2 relative to na as shown in fig 4b ca2 adsorption 69 5 0 9 meq m2 by the csn electrode was 50 7 higher than that of the uncoated electrode 46 1 5 1 meq m2 while na adsorption decreased by 48 from 24 7 2 5 to 12 9 1 1 meq m2 resulting in a greatly improved ca2 selectivity st c of 5 4 furthermore displacement of adsorbed na by ca2 was observed in the later stage of the adsorption process for both the uncoated and the csn electrodes effluent na concentration exceeded its influent concentration while ca2 adsorption continued though the coated electrode showed a much greater displaced amount this is clearly demonstrated in fig 4c where cumulative na ca2 and total cation adsorption by the csn electrode is shown as a function of time cumulative na adsorption reached a maximum at 25 min when the effluent na concentration became the same as the influent concentration fig 4a2 thereafter the amount of na adsorption declined while ca2 adsorption continued to increase compared with the uncoated electrode the csn electrode experienced more na displacement by ca2 similar displacement phenomena were observed in previous studies chen et al 2015 mossad and zou 2012 seo et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 referred to as time dependent ion selectivity zhao et al 2012 in most water and wastewater the concentration of ca2 is usually much lower than that of na therefore experiments were performed using 10 meq l binary solutions with na ca2 equivalent concentration ratio of 1 1 2 1 5 1 and 10 1 as expected the amount of ca2 adsorption decreased while na adsorption increased with increasing influent na to ca2 ratio in the binary influent solution for both the uncoated and csn electrodes fig 4d for the uncoated electrode the amount of ca2 or na adsorption changed proportionally with its respective relative concentration in the influent solution resulting in fairly constant ca2 selectivity st c fig 4e the csn electrode however exhibited a slight drop in st c when the na to ca2 equivalent ratio increased from 1 1 to 10 1 the ca2 selectivity coefficient st c decreased from 5 4 to 3 7 this results is attributed to two reasons incomplete na displacement and increased na flux through the non selective pva matrix it is noted that ca2 adsorption did not reach equilibrium at the end of the adsorption cycle as evident in the notable difference between its effluent and influent concentrations at higher na to ca2 ratio this difference was larger fig s5 and na displacement amount was also decreased fig 4f suggesting insufficient time for ca2 displacement of na to reach completion in the meantime permeation of na through the non selective pva matrix increases with increasing na to ca2 ratio it is anticipated that increasing adsorption cycle time and the ca2 selective resin content can further increase the selectivity of the csn electrode and minimize the impact of na to ca2 concentration ratio 3 5 understanding the selectivity mechanism of the csn electrode as discussed above the csn coating increased ca2 adsorption relative to na on the carbon electrode while having little direct contribution to ca2 adsorption capacity in a previous study we showed that selective so4 2 removal in the presence of cl achieved using a so4 2 selective coating on a carbon electrode was due to preferential transport of so4 2 through the coating zuo et al 2018 it is assumed that the same mechanism is responsible for the selective ca2 removal observed in the current study to test this hypothesis experiments were carried out in an electrodialysis cell to characterize ion transport through the csn coating using a binary solution containing 5 meq l of nacl and 10 meq l cacl2 fig s6 by applying a constant current the concentration of both ca2 and na decreased with operation time in the cation donor chamber while a corresponding increase was observed in the ion acceptor chamber fig 5 detailed mass balance analysis found that the decreased concentration of ions in donor chamber was comparable with that accumulated in accepting chamber fig s6d with negligible ion adsorption on the csn coated mf membrane suggesting electro migration of cations through the csn mf under the electric field further test found that 2 7 times higher ca2 migration flux 155 0 Î¼eq m2 min was achieved through the csn coating than na 57 1 Î¼eq m2 min for 2 1 ca2 na initial concentration ratio despite the fact that ca2 had a larger hydrated ion size 4 12 Ã¥ for ca2 vs 3 58 Ã¥ for na the electro migration flux of ca2 is 2 7 times that of na comparable with the s t c ratio between the csn and uncoated electrodes 5 4 1 9 obtained in the electrosorption experiment at an influent na to ca2 equivalent ratio of 1 1 these results suggest that the higher affinity of the csn for ca2 resulted in the faster electro migration rate of ca2 through the csn coating consistent with the solution diffusion model the higher flux of ca2 relative to na would lead to a higher ca2 to na concentration ratio that the carbon electrode is exposed to and therefore increased ca2 adsorption by the carbon electrode surface 3 6 long term performance of the csn electrode long term stability of the csn electrode was evaluated by operating the experimental system continuously for more than 180 h using a binary influent solution containing 5 meq l nacl and 5 meq l cacl2 total 10 meq l as shown in fig 6 a both the conductivity and current profiles exhibited excellent repeatability for over 60 cycles effluent samples were taken and analyzed in the 5th 30th 45th and 60th cycle results showed that the change in sac was less than 10 the ca2 selectivity st c was consistently 5 in the 60th cycle the amounts of ca2 and na removed during the adsorption stage were 66 9 and 11 8 meq m2 respectively showing that the adsorption by the csn electrode was reversible in long term operation 4 conclusions in this study we developed a nanocomposite electrode that selectively removes ca2 in the presence of competing na ions by applying a ca2 selective nanocomposite csn coating on the activated carbon electrode the high affinity of the nanosized ca2 selective resin particles for ca2 ions results in higher ca2 permselectivity than na and hence an elevated ca2 concentration in the carbon electrode pores which leads to increased ca2 adsorption relative to the competing na at the same time the csn coating had a negligible impact on ion adsorption kinetics and only slightly decreased the desorption kinetics due to the added resistance of the coating the csn electrode exhibited excellent performance over the long term operation with highly stable salt adsorption capacity ca2 selectivity and regenerability these results suggest that a selective barrier on the electrode allows preferential utilization of the adsorption sites on the high capacity carbon electrode for the target ion this renders selectivity on the originally non selective carbon electrode the selectivity for ca2 decreased with increasing na to ca2 ratio in the influent solution but it is anticipated that the impact can be minimized by increasing the adsorption cycle time and or content of the ca2 resin in the csn coating acknowledgment this work was supported by the national science foundation nanosystems engineering research center for nanotechnology enabled water treatment eec
